lee child gayle lynds linda barnes jenny siler david liss brett battles jon land james phelan watchlist a book in the harold middleton series introduction your mission if you choose to accept it is to come up with an innovative idea to help put a brand new writers organization on the map and then convince top thriller writers to donate their ideas and their time to make it work that was my main job when international thriller writers itw was formed in october and i joined the founding board of directors as a thriller writer myself and owner of a marketing company for authors and publishers the part of itws mission statement that was closest to my heart was to bestow recognition and promote the thriller genre at an innovative and superior level we came up with lists of ideas some fizzled right away others took a while to crash and burn a few had some game and looked like they might actually come to fruition of all possible projects the idea of a serialized novel written by some of the genres best writersto be released first in audiochapter by chapter over weekswas one of the most unusual and the one i was the most involved in coming up with and excited about steve feldberg director of content at audiblecom and i hashed out the idea over the phone first and then over coffee in person a few months later audible gave the idea the green light and the itw board announced it was on board thats when the impossible mission really started how could i convince dozens of writers to donate their ideas and their time to a collaborative project that was different than anything done before take a look at the cover of this book we werent just talking about writers but wonderful writers successful writers writers who are used to actually getting paid a lot of money for their ideas whose books are on national and international bestseller lists writers who are household names who have sold millions of books writers who are all on deadline with their own books and who have commitments to their fans publishers and families how do you get lee child to abandon jack reacher get jeff deaver to write about someone other than lincoln rhyme to get lisa scottoline to leave her beloved philly to get jim fusilli not only to write a chapter but take on the herculean task of herding these big cats and running the show and on and on with everyone one of the eleven other authors turns out you pick up the phone and just ask amazingly every author i asked to be part of this groundbreaking project said yes amazingly eagerly in fact so many said yes i actually lost my own place in the book because i couldnt possibly take a spot that one of these luminaries was willing to fill the chopin manuscriptpart one of the watchlistwas the first ever audio serial thriller it won the audiobook of the year and was an unqualified bestseller it was a unique collaboration among fifteen distinguished international thriller writers who came together with a single goal to help establish itw as a viable valuable important organization for its authors jeffery deaver conceived the characters and the setting and put the plot in motion with the first chapter from there the story was turned over to fourteen authors who each wrote a chapter that propelled the story along along the way the plot took twists and turns as each author lent his or her own imprint on the tale characters were added as the action moved around the worldand the stakes got higher and higher the book wrapped with deaver writing the final two chapters bringing the chopin manuscript to its explosive conclusion and then two years later everyone did it again with a few new authors coming on board and a few who had prior commitments stepping out with the copper bracelet once again deaver started it a host of brilliant writers kept the story spinning and twisting and turning and then deaver finished it what youre holding in your hands is above all proof of how generous and talented the writers are who make up itw all of whom i want to thank for being part of a marvelous project that i hope you dear reader find as entertaining breathtaking thrilling and unputdownable as i do m j rose july part i the chopin manuscript jeffery deaver the piano tuner ran through ascending chords enjoying the resistance of the heavy ivory keys his balding head was bent forward his eyes closed as he listened the notes rose to the darkened ceiling of the recital hall near warsaws old market square then dissipated like smoke satisfied with his work the tuner replaced the temperament strips and his wellworn extensiontuning lever in their velvet case and indulged himself by playing a few minutes of mozart a little night music an ebullient piece that was one of his favorites just as he concluded the crisp sound of clapping palms echoed behind him and he spun around twenty feet away stood a man nodding and smiling stocky with a flop of brown hair broad of face southern slavic the tuner thought hed traveled in yugoslavia many years ago lovely ah my so beautiful do you speak english the man asked with a thick accent i do are you a performer here you must be you are so talented me no i simply tune pianos but a tuner must know his way about the keyboard too can i help you sir the recital hall is closed still such a passion for music i could hear it have you never desired to perform the piano tuner didnt particularly care to talk about himself but he could discuss music all night long he was in addition to being perhaps the best piano tuner in warsaw if not all of central poland an avid collector of recordings and original music manuscripts if hed had the means he would collect instruments too he had once played a chopin polonaise at the very keyboard the composer had used he considered it one of the highpoints of his life i used to but only in my youth he told the man of his sweep through eastern europe with the warsaw youth orchestra with which hed been secondchair cello he stared at the man who in turn was examining the piano as i say the hall is closed but perhaps youre looking for someone i am yes the slav walked closer and looked down ah a bosendorfer one of germanys great contributions to culture oh yes the slight man said caressing the black lacquer and gothic type of the companys name its perfection it truly is would you like to try it do you play not like you i wouldnt presume to even touch a single key after hearing your performance youre too kind you say youre looking for someone you mean anna the french horn student she was here earlier but i believe shes left theres no one else except the cleaning woman but i can get a message to anyone in the orchestra or the administration if you like the visitor stepped closer yet and gently brushed a keytrue ivory the piano having been made before the ban you sir he said are the one i came to see me do i know you i saw you earlier today you did where i dont recall you were having lunch at a café overlooking that huge building the fancy one the biggest one in warsaw what is it the piano tuner gave a laugh the biggest one in the country the palace of culture and science a gift from the soviets which the joke goes they gave us in place of our freedom yes i did have lunch there but do i know you the stranger stopped smiling he looked from the piano into the narrow mans eyes like the assault of the sudden vehement chord in haydns surprise symphony fear struck the piano tuner he picked up his tool kit and rose quickly then stopped oh he gasped behind the stranger he could see two bodies lying on the tile near the front door anna the horn player and beyond her the cleaning woman two shadows on the floor surrounded their limp figures one from the entranceway light one from their blood the slav not much taller than the piano tuner but far stronger took him by the shoulders sit he whispered gently pushing the man down on the bench then turning him to face the piano what do you want a quaking voice tears in his eyes shhh shaking with fear the piano tuner thought madly what a fool i am i should have fled the moment the man commented on the bosendorfers german ancestry anyone with a true understanding of the keyboard knew the instruments are made in austria when he was stopped at krakows john paul ii airport he was certain his offense had to do with what he carried in his briefcase the hour was early and hed wakened much earlier at the pod roza under the rose which was his favorite hotel in poland owing both to its quirky mix of scrolly ancient and starkly modern and to the fact that franz liszt had stayed there still half asleep without his morning coffee or tea he was startled from his stupor by the two uniformed men who appeared over him mr harold middleton he looked up yes thats me and suddenly realized what had happened when airport security had looked through his attaché case theyd seen it and grown concerned but out of prudence the young guards there had chosen not to say anything they let him pass then called for reinforcements these two large unsmiling men of the twenty or so passengers in the lounge awaiting the bus to take them to the lufthansa flight to paris some people looked his waythe younger ones the older tempered by the soviet regime dared not the man closest to middleton two chairs away glanced up involuntarily with a flash of ambiguous concern on his face as if he might be mistaken as his companion then realizing he wasnt going to be questioned he turned back to his newspaper obviously relieved you will please to come with us this way yes please infinitely polite the massive guard nodded back toward the security line look i know what this is about its simply a misunderstanding he larded his voice with patience respect and good nature it was the tone you had to take with local police the tone you used talking your way through border crossings middleton nodded at the briefcase i can show you some documentation that the second silent guard picked up the case the other please you will come polite but inflexible this young squarejawed man who seemed incapable of smiling held his eye firmly and there was no debate the poles middleton knew had been the most willful resisters of the nazis together they walked back through the tiny largely deserted airport the taller guards flanking the shorter nondescript american at harold middleton carried a few more pounds than he had last year which itself had seen a weight gain of few pounds over the prior but curiously his weightconspiring with his thick black hairmade him appear younger than he was only five years ago at his daughters college graduation the girl had introduced him to several of her classmates as her brother everyone in the group had bought the deception father and daughter had laughed about that many times since he thought of her now and hoped fervently he wouldnt miss his flight and the connection to washington dc he was going to have dinner with charlotte and her husband that night at tysons corner it was the first time hed see her since she announced her pregnancy but as he looked past security at the awaiting cluster of menalso unsmilinghe had a despairing feeling that dinner might be postponed he wondered for how long they walked through the exit line and joined the group two more uniformed officers and a middleaged man in a rumpled brown suit under a rumpled brown raincoat mr middleton i am deputy inspector stanieski with the polish national police krakow region no id was forthcoming the guards hemmed him in as if the foot inch american was going to karate kick his way to freedom i will see your passport please he handed over the battered swollen blue booklet stanieski looked it over and glanced at the picture then at the man in front of him twice people often had trouble seeing harold middleton couldnt remember what he looked like a friend of his daughter said he would make a good spy the best ones the young man explained are invisible middleton knew this was true he wondered how charlottes friend did i dont have much time until that flight you will not make the flight mr middleton no we will be returning to warsaw warsaw two hours away thats crazy why no answer he tried once more this is about the manuscript isnt it he nodded to the attaché case i can explain the name chopin is on it yes but im convinced its a forgery its not valuable its not a national treasure ive been asked to take it to the united states to finish my analysis you can call doctor the inspector shook his head manuscript no mr middleton this is not about a manuscript its about a murder murder the man hesitated i use the word to impress on you the gravity of the situation now it is best that i say nothing more and i would strongly suggest you do the same isnt it my luggage your luggage is already in the car now a nod of his head toward the front door we will go please come in mr middleton sit yes there is good i am jozef padlo first deputy inspector with the polish national police this time an id was exhibited but middleton got the impression the gaunt man about his own age and much taller was flashing the card only because middleton expected it and that the formality was alien in polish law enforcement whats this all about inspector your man says murder and tells me nothing more oh he mentioned that padlo grimaced krakow they dont listen to us there slightly better than posnan but not much they were in an offwhite office beside a window that looked out on the gray spring sky there were many books computer printouts a few maps and no decorations other than official citations an incongruous ceramic cactus wearing a cowboy hat and pictures of the mans wife and children and grandchildren many pictures they seemed like a happy family middleton thought again of his daughter am i being charged with anything not at this point his english was excellent and middleton wasnt surprised to notice that there was a certificate on the wall testifying to padlos completion of a course in quantico and one at the law enforcement management institute of texas oh and the cactus then i can leave you know we have antismoking laws here i think thats your doing your countrys you give us burger king and take away our cigarettes the inspector shrugged and lit a sobieski no you cant leave now please you had lunch yesterday with a henryk jedynak a piano tuner yes henry oh no was he the one murdered padlo watched middleton carefully im afraid he was yes last night in the recital hall near old market square no no middleton didnt know the man welltheyd met only on this tripbut theyd hit it off immediately and had enjoyed each others company he was shocked by the news of jedynaks death and two other people were killed as well a musician and a cleaning woman stabbed to death for no reason apparently other than they had the misfortune to be there at the same time as the killer this is terrible but why have you known mr jedynak long no we met in person for the first time yesterday wed emailed several times he was a collector of manuscripts manuscripts books no musical manuscriptsthe handwritten scores and he was involved with the chopin museum at ostrogski castle the inspector said this as if hed heard of the place but never been there yes i had a meeting yesterday afternoon with the director of the czartoryski museum in krakow and i asked henry to brief me about him and their collection it was about a questionable chopin score padlo showed no interest in this tell me please about your meeting in warsaw well i met henry for coffee in the late morning at the museum he showed me the new acquisitions in the collection then we returned downtown and had lunch at a café i cant remember where the frederick restaurant thats how padlo found him he supposedan entry in jedynaks pda or diary yes that was it and then we went our separate ways i took the train to krakow did you see anyone following you or watching you at lunch why would someone follow us padlo inhaled long on his cigarette when he wasnt puffing he lowered his hand below his desk did you see anyone he repeated no he nodded mr middleton i must tell you i regret i have to but it is important your friend was tortured before he died i wont go into the details but the killer used some piano string in very unpleasant ways he was gagged so the screams could not be heard but his right hand was uninjured presumably so that he could write whatever this killer demanded of him he wanted information my god middleton closed his eyes briefly recalling henrys showing pictures of his wife and two sons i wonder what that might be padlo said this piano tuner was well known and well liked he was also a very transparent man musician tradesman husband and father there seemed to be nothing dark about his life a careful examination of middletons face but perhaps the killer thought that was not the case perhaps the killer thought he had a second life involving more than music with a nod he added somewhat like you whatre you getting at tell me about your other career please i dont have another career i teach music and authenticate music manuscripts but you had another career recently yes i did but whats that got to do with anything padlo considered this for a moment and said because certain facts have come into alignment a cold laugh and what exactly does that mean this was the most emotional harold middleton usually got he believed that you gave up your advantage when you lost control thats what he told himself though he doubted that he was even capable of losing control tell me about that career colonel do some people still call you that colonel not anymore but why are you asking me questions you already seem to know the answers to i know a few things im curious to know more for instance i only know that you were connected with the icty and the icct but not many details the unsanctioned international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia investigated and tried individuals for war crimes committed during the complicated and tragic fighting among the serbs bosnians croatians and albanian ethnic groups in the s the icct was the international criminal court established in to try war criminals for crimes in any area of the world both were located in the hague in holland and had been created because nations tended to quickly forget about the atrocities committed within their borders and were reluctant to find and try those whod committed them how did you end up working for them it seems a curious leap from your countrys army to an international tribunal i was planning to retire anyway id been in the service for more than two decades but still please middleton decided that cooperation was the only way that would let him leave anytime soon with the time difference he still had a chance to get into dc in time for a late supper at the ritz carlton with his daughter and soninlaw he explained to the inspector briefly that he had been a military intelligence officer with the us troops sent to kosovo in the summer of as part of the peacekeeping force when the country was engaged in the last of the yugoslavian wars middleton was based at camp broadsteel in the southeast of the country the sector america oversaw the largely rural area dominated by mount duke which rose like fuji over the rugged hills was an ethnically albanian area as was most of kosovo and had been the site of many incursions by serbsboth from other parts of kosovo and from milosevics serbia which kosovo had been part of the fighting was largely overthe tens of thousands of ironically dubbed humanitarian bombing strikes had had their desired effectbut the peacekeepers on the ground were still on high alert to stop clashes between the infamous serb guerillas and the equally ruthless albanian kosovo liberation army forces padlo took this information in nodding as he lit another cigarette not long after i was deployed there the base commander got a call from a general in the british sector near pristina the capital hed found something interesting and had been calling all the international peacekeepers to see if anyone had a background in art collecting and why was that padlo stared at the sobieski hidden below eyelevel the smell was not as terrible as middleton had expected but the office was filling with smoke his eyes stung let me give you some background it goes back to world war two please tell me well many albanians from kosovo fought with an ss unitthe twentyfirst waffen mountain division their main goal was eliminating partisan guerillas but it also gave them the chance to ethnically cleanse the serbs who had been their enemies for years a grimace appeared on the inspectors heavily lined face ah its always the same story wherever you look poles versus the russians arabs versus the jews americans versusa smileeveryone middleton ignored him the twentyfirst supposedly had another job too with the fall of italy and an allied invasion a sure thing himmler and goering and other nazis whod been looting art from eastern europe wanted secure places to hide itso that even if germany fell the allies couldnt find it the twentyfirst reportedly brought truckloads to kosovo made sense a small little populated outofthemainstream country whod think to look there for a missing cezanne or manet what the british general had found was an old eastern orthodox church it was abandoned years ago and being used as a dormitory for displaced serbs by a un relief organization in the basement his soldiers unearthed or boxes of rare books paintings and music folios my that many oh yes a lot was damaged some beyond repair but other items were virtually untouched i didnt know much about the paintings or the books but id studied music history in college and ive collected recordings and manuscripts for years i got the okay to fly up and take a look and what did you find oh it was astonishing original pieces by bach and his sons mozart handel sketches by wagnersome of them had never been seen before i was speechless valuable well you cant really put a dollar value on a find like that its the cultural benefit not the financial but still worth millions i suppose what happened then i reported what id found to the british and to my general and he cleared it with washington for me to stay there for a few days and catalog what i could good press you know true in police work too the cigarette got crushed out forcefully under a yellow thumb as if padlo were quitting forever middleton explained that that night he took all the manuscripts and folios that he could carry back to british quarters in pristina and worked for hours cataloging and examining what hed found the next morning i was very excited wondering what else id find i got up early to return the american stared at a limp yellow file folder on the inspectors desktop the one with three faded checkmarks on it he looked up and heard padlo say the church was st sophia you know about it middleton was surprised the incident had made the news but by thenwith the world focusing on the millennium and the yk crisis the balkans had become simply a footnote to fading history yes i do i didnt realize you were involved middleton remembered walking to the church and thinking i mustve gotten up pretty damn early if none of the refugees were awake yet especially with all the youngsters living there then he paused wondering where the british guards were two had been stationed outside the church the day before just at that moment he saw a window open on the second floor and a teenage girl look out her long hair obscuring half her face she was calling green shirt green shirt please green shirt he hadnt understood but then it came to him she was referring to his fatigues and was calling for his help what was it like padlo asked softly middleton merely shook his head the inspector didnt press him for details he asked and rugova was the man responsible he was even more surprised that the inspector knew about the former kosovo liberation army commander agim rugova that fact was not learned until later long after rugova and his men had fled from pristina and the story of st sophia had grown stone cold your change in career is making sense now mr middleton after the war you became an investigator to track him down thats it in a nutshell he smiled as if that could flick away the cached memories clear as computer jpegs of that morning middleton had returned to camp broadsteel and served out his rotation spending most of his free time running intelligence reports on rugova and the many other war criminals the torn region had spawned back at the pentagon hed done the same but it wasnt the us militarys job to catch them and bring them to trial and he made no headway so when he retired he set up an operation in a small northern virginia office park he called it war criminal watch and spent his days on the phone and computer tracking rugova and others he made contacts at the icty and worked with them regularly but they and the uns tactical operation were busy with bigger fishlike ratko mladic naser oric and others involved in the srebrenica massacre the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii and milosevic himself middleton would come up with a lead and it would founder still he couldnt get st sophia out of his mind green shirt green shirt please he decided that he couldnt be effective working from america nor working alone so after some months of searching he found people whod help two american soldiers whod been in kosovo and helped him in the investigation at st sophia and a woman humanitarian worker from belgrade hed met in pristina the overworked icty was glad to accept them as independent contractors working with the prosecutors office they became known in the icty as the volunteers lespasse and brocco the soldiers younger driven by their passion for the hunt leonora tesla by her passion to rid the world of sorrow a passion that made the otherwisecommon woman beautiful and the elder harold middleton a stranger to passion and driven by well even he couldnt say what the intelligence officer who never seemed to be able to process the humint on himself unarmedat least as far as the icty and local law enforcement knewthey managed to track down several of rugovas henchmen and through them finally the man himself who was living in a shockingly opulent townhouse in nice france under a false identity the arrangement was that for ethical reasons the volunteers job was solely to provide the tribunal with intelligence and contacts the sfor the uns stabilization forcethe military operation in charge of apprehending former yugoslav war criminalsand local police to the extent they were cooperative would be the arresting agents in working on pristine data provided by middleton and his crew un and french troops raided the townhouse and arrested rugova tribunal trials are interminable but three years later he was convicted for crimes that occurred at st sophia he was appealing his conviction while living in what was in middletons opinion a fartoopleasant detention center in the hague middleton could still picture the swarthy man at trial ruggedly handsome confident and indignant swearing that hed never committed genocide or ethnic cleansing he admitted he was a soldier but said that what happened at st sophia was merely an isolated incident in an unfortunate war middleton told this to the inspector isolated incident padlo whispered it makes the horror far worse dont you think phrasing it so antiseptically i do yes another draw on the cigarette middleton wished that he had a candy bar his secret passion padlo then asked im curious about one thingwas rugova acting on anyone elses orders do you think was there someone he reported to middletons attention coalesced instantly at this question why do you ask that he asked sharply was he the american debated and decided to continue to cooperate for the moment when we were hunting for him we heard rumors that he was backed by someone it made sense his kla outfit had the best weapons of any unit in the country even better than some of the regular serbian troops they were the best trained and they could hire pilots for helicopter extractions that was unheard of in kosovo there were rumors of large amounts of cash and he didnt seem to take orders from any of the known kla senior commanders but we had only one clue that there was somebody behind him a message had been left for him about a bank deposit it was hidden in a copy of goethes faust we found in an apartment in eze any leads we thought possibly british or american maybe canadian some of the phrasing in the note suggested it no idea of his name no we gave him a nickname after the bookfaust a deal with the devil are you still searching for this man me no my group disbanded the tribunals still in force and the prosecutors and eufor might be looking for him but i doubt it rugovas in jail some of his associates too there are bigger fish to fry you know that expression no but i understand padlo crushed out another cigarette youre young why did you quit this job the work seems important young middleton smiled then it faded he said only events intervened another dispassionate phrase that one events intervened middleton looked down an unnecessary comment on my part forgive me i owe you answers and youll now understand why i asked what i did he hit a button on his phone and spoke in polish middleton knew enough to understand he was asking for some photographs padlo disconnected and said in investigating the murder of the piano tuner i learned that you were probably the last personwell second lastto see him alive your name and hotel phone number were in his address book for that day i ran your name through interpol and our other databases and found about your involvement with the tribunals there was a brief reference to agim rugova but a crossreference in interpol as well which had been added only late yesterday yesterday yes rugova died yesterday the apparent cause of death was poisoning middleton felt his heart pound why hadnt anyone called then he realized that he was no longer connected with the icty and that it had been years since st sophia was on anyones radar screen an isolated incident this morning i called the prison and learned that rugova had approached a guard several weeks ago about bribing his way out of prison he offered a huge amount of money where would he an impoverished war criminal get such funds the guard asked he said his wife could get the amount he namedone hundred thousand euros the guard reported the matter and there it rested but then four days ago rugova had a visitora man with a fake name and fake id as it turned out after he leaves rugova falls ill and yesterday dies of poison the police go to the wifes house to inform her and find shes been dead for several days she was stabbed dead middleton felt a fierce urge to call leonora and tell her when i learned of your connection with the piano tuner and the death on the same day of the war criminal youd had arrested i had sent to me a prison security camera picture of the probable murderer i showed the picture to a witness we located who saw the likely suspect leaving the old market square recital hall last night its the same man she said with certainty that it was padlo indulged again and lit a sobieski you seem to be the hub of this strange wheel mr middleton a man kills rugova and his wife and then tortures and kills a man youve just met with so now you and i are entwined in this matter it was then that a young uniformed officer arrived carrying an envelope he placed it on the inspectors desk dzenkuje padlo said the aide nodded and after glancing at the american vanished the inspector handed the photos to middleton who looked down at them oh my god he sucked cigarettesmoketainted air deep into his lungs what padlo asked seeing his reaction was he someone you know from your investigation of rugova the american looked up this man he was sitting next to me at krakow airport he was taking my flight to paris the man in the ugly checked jacket no are you certain yes he mustve killed henryk to find out where i was going and in a shocking instant it was clear someonethis man or faust or perhaps he was faustwas after middleton and the other volunteers why for revenge did he fear something was there some other reason and why would he kill rugova the american jabbed his finger at the phone did he get on the flight to paris has it landed find out now padlos tongue touched the corner of his mouth he lifted the receiver and spoke in such rapid polish that middleton couldnt follow the conversation finally the inspector hung up yes its landed and everyone has disembarked other than you everyone with a boarding pass was on the flight but after that they dont know theyll check the flight manifest against passport control at de gaulleif he left the airport and outgoing flight manifests in case he continued in transit middleton shook his head hes changed identity by now he saw me detained and hes using a new passport the inspector said he could be on his way to anywhere in the world but he wasnt middleton knew the only question was this was he en route to africa to find tesla at her relief agency or to the states where lespasse ran a very successful computer company and brocco edited the human rights observer newsletter or was he on a different flight headed to dc where middleton himself lived then his legs went weak as he recalled that showing off proud pictures hed told the piano tuner that his daughter lived in the dc area what a lovely young woman and her husband so handsome they seem so happy middleton leapt to his feet i have to get home and if you try to stop me ill call the embassy he strode toward the door wait padlo said sharply middleton spun around im warning you do not try to stop me if you do no no i only mean here he stepped forward and handed the american his passport then he touched middletons arm please i want this man too he killed three of my citizens i want him badly remember that he believed the inspector said something else but by then middleton was jogging hard down the endless hall as gray as the offices as gray as the sky digging into his pocket for his cell phone david hewson felicia kaminski first noticed the tramp outside the pantheon when she was playing gypsy folk tunes old roman favorites anything that could put a few coins in the battered gray violin case she had inherited from her mother along with the centuryold sweettoned italian instrument that lived inside the man listened for more than minutes watching her all the time then he walked up close so close she could smell the cloud of sweat and humanity that hung around people of the street not that they ever seemed to notice i wanna hear volarè he grumbled in english his voice rough and carrying an accent she couldnt quite place he held a crumpled and dirtstained euro note he was perhaps though it was difficult to be precise he stood at least six feet tall muscular almost athletic though the thought seemed ridiculous volarè is a song sir not a piece of violin music she responded with more teenage ungraciousness than was perhaps wise his face as much as she could see behind the black unkempt beard seemed sharp and observant more so it occurred to her than most street people who were either elderly italians thrown out of their homes by harsh times or foreign clandestini iraqis africans and all manner of nationalities from the balkans each keeping their own counsel each trying to pursue their own particular course through the dark halfsecret hidden economy for those trying to survive without papers there were other more pressing reasons that made hers a bold and unwise response the money her uncle had given her had not been much to begin with though more generous than his meager living as a warsaw piano tuner ought to have allowed two months before on the day she turned he had abruptly announced that his role as her guardian was finished and that it was time to seek a new life in the west she chose italy because she wanted warm weather and beauty and refused to follow the stream of poles migrating to england the grubby slow bus to rome had cost euros and the room in a squalid student house in san giovanni swallowed up a further each week as did the languageschool lessons in italian her adequate english meant she could get some bar work but only in tourist dives at what the owners called the polish ratefour euros an hour less than the legal minimum wage she ate like a sparrow pizza rustica precooked often disgusting but less than two euros a slice she never went out and had yet to make a friend still each week the money from uncle henryk went down a little further she could not in all conscience call and ask for more i know its a song the tramp replied with an unpleasant sneer on his halfhidden face then he crooned a line of it in the voice of a longdead american singer shed heard when her mother and father played music on their cheap hifi to remind themselves of their days in the states before they returned to a new free poland in search of different lives the name of the singer came back to her dean martin and the tune too so she played it pitch perfect from memory improvising a little after the fashion of stéphane grappelli putting a leisurely jazz swing on each inflected run of notes until the original was only just recognizable she was good at the fiddle sometimes if she was bored or there seemed to be someone musical in her audience she would pull out some sheet music stuffed into the case ask a spectator to hold it then play wieniawskis obertass mazurka with its leaping fireworks of double stopping harmonics and lefthand pizzicato both of her parents were musical her mother a violinist her father an accomplished pianist together they had provided her with a musical education from before she could remember in a household where music was as natural and easy as laughter right up until the black day they disappeared and she found herself under the wing of uncle henryk the tramp stared at her as if shed committed a sin you screwed with it he spat bad girl you ought to know your place he stared at his own clothes a grimy overcoat that stank of sweat and urine with a belt made perhaps a little theatrically out of rope one little step up from me nothing more then he threw a single euro in her violin case and stomped off toward largo argentina the open space where she used to catch the bus back home fascinated always by the wrecked collection of ancient temples therea ragged shapeless gathering of columns and stones populated by a yowling community of feral cats a piece of history only she and the passing tourists seemed to notice any more she didnt like cats they were bold aggressive insistent climbing into her fiddle case when it was open to collect money so she kept a small water pistol modeled on something military alongside her music and rosin and used it to shoo them away when the creatures became too persistent the bum caught up with her four times after that twice at the trevi fountain once in the campo dei fiori once outside the new museum for the ara pacis the peace monument erected by augustus that now lived in a modern cubist home by the hectic road running alongside the tiber she was surprised to see him there it didnt seem the usual kind of place for street people and she caught him staring through the windows engrossed in the beautifully carved monument inside she had only glimpsed from the street too since paying the entrance fee was beyond her homeless men rarely looked at imperial roman statuary she thought most of them never looked much at anything at all and now he was back near her againon this hot sunny summer morning in the via delle botteghe oscure at the weekly market her uncle had told her about it took place at the foot of the via dei polacchithe street of polesand made her homesick every time she went this was where the poor migrant polish community gathered in an impromptu bazaar that was part economic necessity part reaffirmation of their distant roots there were cars and vans all rusty all belching diesel as they arrived bearing plates from warsaw and gdansk quickly not wishing to draw the attention of the police they threw open their doors and trunks and began selling all the goods that polish immigrants could not find or more likely afford in their new home spirits and sausage ham and pastries some clearly homemade a few possibly illegal felicia knew none of these people but sometimes the poor were the most generous particularly when they knew she was polish too alone in the city still a little lost the berlin wall had tumbled to the ground when she was months old an infant in some small apartment in a suburb of chicago she knew this because her parents had told her so often of the joy that followed of their own expectant return to the country they had fled in order to throw off the shackles of communism there had always been a shadow in their eyes when they spoke of that decision as she grew older she knew why when they left poland it was a world of black and white and they returned to one that was a shifting shade of gray the bad days before she was born was a time of secret police and cruel arbitrary punishment of dissent but no one had to travel thousands of miles to a distant country to earn a living they said something good had been lost alongside the visible more easily acknowledged bad talking to the old men and women who gathered at the foot of the via dei polacchi she had come to realize there was a gulf between them and her that could never be bridged a strange sense of guilty loss she could never share yet there was a bond too she was polish she was poor when she played the right notesa mazurka a polonaisethere were misty eyes all around and a constant shower of small coins into the fiddle case and on this day there was the tramp too with a hateful look in his eyes one that said she believed shame on you shame on you as she bowed a slow country dance she told herself that if he continued with these attentions she would upbraid him loudly in public with no fear who was a tramp to talk to anyone of shame what gave him the right then feeling a hand on her shoulder she ceased playing and turned to find herself staring into the amiable bright blue eyes of a middleaged man in a gray suit he had a pale fleshy face with stubbly red cheeks receding fair hair and the easy confident demeanor of someone official like a civil servant or a school headmaster you play beautifully felicia he said in polish do i know you he took out an id card from his jacket and flashed it in front of her face too quickly for her to make much sense of the words there no i am a polish police officer on attachment here in rome there is no need for you to know me she must have looked startled he placed a hand on her arm and said in a voice full of reassurance do not be alarmed there is nothing for you to worry about his genial face fell i am simply performing an unhappy task which falls to this profession from time to time come i will buy coffee there is a small place around the corner the man had such a pleasant air of authority that she followed him automatically into the via dei polacchi even though she couldnt remember any cafe in this direction they were halfway along when he stopped her in the shadow of an overhanging building there was such sadness in his eyes a sense of regret too i am sorry he said in his low calm voice there is no easy way to say this your uncle henryk has been killed her stomach clenched her eyes began to sting killed murdered as he worked with two other people too such a world we live in in warsaw he shrugged this would never have happened before not in the old days people then had too much respect too much fear there were so many questions and none of them would form themselves into a sensible sentence in felicias mind i must go home she said finally the man was silent for a moment thinking a different expression in his eyes one she couldnt work out you cant afford to go home he observed frowning whats there for you anyway it was never your country not really the narrow street was empty a cloud had skittered across the bright summer sun casting the entire area into sudden gloom i can afford a bus ride she answered suddenly cross no you cant he replied and took her by both arms he was strong his blue eyes now burned insistent demanding what did your uncle give you to come here she tried to shake herself free it was impossible his grip was too firm some money two thousand euros it was all he had not money the man barked at her his voice rising in volume im not talking money he turned his elbow so that his forearm fell beneath her throat and pinned her against the wall as he snatched her fiddle case with his free hand then he quickly bent down flipped up the single latch with his teeth and scrabbled open the lid this is a paupers instrument he grumbled and flinging the fiddle to the ground crumpled sheets of music followed fluttering to the cobblestones like leaves in autumn what did he give you nothing nothing she stopped he had discarded the bow and her last piece of rosin and now had her one remaining spare string a thomastikinfeld dominant a in his fingers he took away his elbow before she could run off he jerked her back and punched her hard in the stomach the breath disappeared from her lungs tears of pain and rage and fear rose in her eyes as she began to recover she saw he had turned the fiddle string into a noose and felt it slip over her head pushing it down until it rested on her neck he pulled it not so tight only so much that she could feel the familiar wound metal become a cold ligature around her throat poor little lost girl he whispered his breath rank and hot in her ear no home no friends no future one last time what did he give you nothing nothing the thomastikinfeld dominant a started to tighten she was aware of her own breathing the short repetitive muscular motion one always took for granted his face grew huge in her vision he was smiling this was she now realized the result he wished all along then the smile faded a low animal grunt issued from his mouth his body fell forward crushing hers against the wall and a crimson spurt of blood began to gush from between his clenched teeth she turned her head to avoid the red stream now flowing down his chin and clawed at the noose on her throat loosening it forcing the deadly loop over her hair until it was free and she could manage to drag it over her head something thrust the graysuited man aside the tramp was there a long stiletto knife sat in his right fist its entire length red with gore he dropped the weapon and held out his hand come with me now he said there are three of them in a car round the corner they wont wait long who are you she mumbled her head reeling breath still short a car was starting to turn into the narrow street finding it too difficult to make the corner in one go the cloud worked free of the sun bright blinding light filled the area around them enough to make their presence known she heard polish voices and other accents ones she didnt recognize they sounded angry if you stay here you will die the tramp insisted like your uncle like your mother and your father come with me she bent down and picked up her fiddle and bow roughly pushing them into the case along with the scrappy sheets of music and then they ran he had a scooter round the corner a brand new purple vespa with a rental sticker on the rear mudguard she climbed on the back automatically hanging tight the fiddle case still in her grip as he roared through the narrow lanes trying to lose the vehicle behind it wasnt easy she turned her head and saw the car bouncing off the ancient stone walls of the quarter following them down narrow alleys the wrong way she knew this area it was one of her favorites for its unexpected sights and the way the buildings ranged across the centuries sometimes as far back as the age of caesar he was going the wrong way and she knew it but they were there before she could tell him the vespa screamed to a halt in a deadend alley sealed off by freshly painted black iron railings a view point over the tangled ruins around the pescaria the imperial fish market that led to the vast circular stump of the theatre of marcellus like some smaller colosseum cut short by a giants knife there was no road only a narrow pathway down into the mess of columns and shattered walls they ran and stumbled across threadbare grass through the low petrified forest of dusty granite and marble she could hear shouts behind and anguished cries in polish then she heard a shot the tramps strong hand grasped her as she tripped over a fluted portion of shattered column panting for breath she found herself in the angry mass of traffic beneath the looming theatre he dragged her into the mob of vehicles halfway across the road there was a young man on a scooter long black hair falling out from beneath his helmet the tramp kicked him out of the seat then screamed at her to get onto the pillion she didnt need to think any more she didnt want to they wound a sinuous route through the snarledup vehicles found the sidewalk on the river side of the road roared over the cobbles out to the lungotevere the traffic was just as bad there she dared to turn over the road fighting through the cars were three men guns in their hands she swore she prayed and then they were through on the tiber side of the road rattling down the steps that led down to the water and the long broad concrete of the flood defenses two days before shed walked here wondering thinking trying to work out where she belonged not yet born in a country that had forgotten her without parents and now she reflected without her uncle who had come to her rescue when she found herself orphaned she clung on tears in her eyes determined theyd be spent before this man who had both rescued and kidnapped her would look into her face again after half a mile they raced up a long walkway and returned to the road riding steadily through san giovanni past the street where she lived in her head she said goodbye to the few belongings she had there a bible little read some photos a few cheap clothes a music case with some muchloved pieces they found the autovia and she saw the sign to the airport a few miles short of fiumicino he turned the vespa into the drive of a low modern hotel found a hidden space in the car park at the rear stopped and turned off the engine she got off the scooter without being asked you did well the man said simply staring at her did i have a choice if you want to live no you dont have you already forgotten you are in grave danger she glanced at the scooter is that what you are a thief he nodded and she wondered if there was the slightest of smiles behind the matted grubby beard a thief thats correct felicia we must go inside now he waved the key as they rushed past reception and went to the first floor where he opened the door and ushered her into his room it was a suite elegant and expensive the kind she had only seen in movies there were two large suitcases already packed on the floor the pillows of the bed were covered with scattered chocolates he picked up a couple and gave them to her she ate greedily it was good chocolate the best the room she understood had been waiting here empty running up a bill perhaps for weeks do you have a passport with you he asked of course it is the law she showed him i meant the other you have dual nationality this is important no she shook her head forcefully i am polish only that was an accident of birth a lucky accident he grumbled and picked up a briefcase by the side of the bed the manshe could no longer think of him as a tramppulled out a blue document an american passport your name now is joanna phelps your mother was polish which explains your accent you are a student at college in baltimore remember all this she didnt take the passport though she couldnt stop herself staring at the gold eagle on the cover why she asked you know why felicia he replied i dont really his strong hands suddenly held her shoulders shaking her slender frame his eyes were fierce and unavoidable whats your name whats your name my name is felicia kaminski i am nineteen years old a citizen of the polish republic i was born felicia kaminski is dead he cut in be careful you dont join her stepping back he said do not answer the door to anyone eat and drink from the mini bar if you need something i must he stared at the grubby clothes hating themdo something he took new clothes out of one of the cases and disappeared into the bathroom she looked at the second piece of luggage it seemed expensive the label bore the name joanna phelps and an address in baltimore felicia opened it and found that it was full of new jeans skirts shirts and underwear they were all the right size and must have cost more than she earned in an entire month when he came out he was wearing a dark business suit with a white shirt and elegant silk red tie he was no more than handsome italianlooking with a sallow skin clean shaven rough and red in places from the razor he had dark darting eyes and long hair wet from the shower slicked back on his head black mostly with gray flecks his face seemed more lined than she felt it ought to be as if there had been pain somewhere or illness he had a phone in his hand in an hour joanna we will go to fiumicino he said there will be a ticket waiting for you at the first class alitalia counter you show them your passport check in and go straight to the lounge i will meet you there i shall be behind you all the way do not stop after immigration do not look at me do not acknowledge me until we have landed and i approach you where are we going he considered the question wondering whether to answer first to new york then to washington you must know this surely how else would one get back to where you live from italy she said nothing where do you live joanna she tugged at the label of the case he had provided for her i live at south fremont avenue baltimore and you he smiled genuinely in other circumstances she might have thought she liked this man that is none of your business your name is he said nothing but kept on smiling felicia walked quickly to the second case before he could stop her and grasped the label it was blank he laughed at her and she was unsure whether this was a pleasant sound or a cruel one so what do i call you she asked a theatrical gesture he placed a forefinger on his reddened chin stared at the hotel bedroom ceiling and said for now you may call me faust james grady the jetliner glided out of the night to touch down at washingtons dulles airport minutes early and minutes before harold middleton killed a cop as soon as the planes wheels grabbed runway middleton textmessaged his daughter she hadnt answered his calls from europe and state county and city police had been vague about protecting a young couple just because a frantic father called from poland the dc suburban cops seemed skeptical of middletons promises that polish badges and american diplomats would echo his alarm as soon as their chains of command argued out who should contact whom middletons textmessage read green lantern evac scotland green lantern his thenwife sylvia had scoffed at his family code word system to prevent their toddler from being deceived by twolegged predators but little charlotte judged the plan cool especially when daddy let her make their secret code his and thus her favorite comic book hero evac charlotte was nine when the pentagon military intelligence unit where middleton spent most of his career ran an evacuation drill she adopted the word evac as a mantra with significant shifts in irony as she roared through her teenage years scotland when charlotte got married middleton let her use his suburban house for the weddings staging ground while he rented another lonely room in a hotel near the capital hill garden for the marriage ceremony two nights before the wedding father and daughter got drunk in the hotel bar as she introduced him to a hip singlemalt scotch from then on they called that hotel scotland told her what to do thought middleton where to go that its really me if she got the message the seatbelt ding launched middleton into the planes aisle looping the shoulder strap on his soft black briefcase across his sports jacket kept his hands free he didnt know where the rest of his luggage was didnt care his briefcase held his work his laptop ipod and toiletries airport security let him take onto an airplane plus a paperback copy of albert camuss the stranger as middleton was about to reach the planes door a couple from first class barged in front of him the woman who may have looked great years and a million scowls ago clutched a battered jewel case to suspiciously firm breasts as she and her sadeyed husband shuffled up the jet way ahead of middleton middleton heard the wife huff i still cant believe that sister of yours thought she could keep your mothers jewels from me just by going to europe the husbands flat voice knew its own irrelevance we all make mistakes they bumbled ahead to customs where a surgicalgloved guard carefully examined the jewel boxs glittering necklaces bracelets and earrings comparing them to a transit document the wife kept tapping with her crimson fingernails when he was through the first class couple trudged ahead of middleton through the terminal middletons jagged nerves keyed him into a detached hypervigilance hed not felt since returning to the balkans slaughterhouse there all he had to fear were the ghosts of strangers now he felt his own life crawl along the edge of a straight razor he smelled his fellow travelers damp wool scent of livedin clothes deodorants metallic perfumes stale beer from the englishman whod tried to drown his fear of flying middleton heard a child whine and sobs from a spec soldier who was all of years old as he marched toward a flight to germany with connections to iraq an unseen cd blasted drums and crashing guitars middleton recognized springsteen and then remembered that expanding his range of classic rock music was the only debt besides charlotte he owed his ex night filled the terminal windows ads landscaped its walls the musician in middleton found melody in crowd movements synced with his rhythmic march to a bus for the main terminal from there hed find his car in long term parking race to scotland working his cell phone the whole way he saw all that with the absolute clarity of what is and what would be looming beyond the shuffling firstclass couple middleton saw a cop hurrying toward him saw the cops blue uniform saw his shoulderholstered black automatic saw a second pistol on the cops blackleather belt along with handcuffs ammo pouches an empty loop for a radio they were steps apart when middleton matched the cops face to photos hed seen in poland of a murderer the fake cop unsnapped his hip holster middleton shoved the firstclass woman into the pistoldrawing cop the fragile jewel case popped out of her grasp and flew toward the cop who knocked it away the case burst open glittering objects rained on the airport crowd firstclass woman clawed at the cop mine mine her bumped husband fell into an empty chair the fake cop pointed his gun at middletons face as the woman continued to flail at him the gunshot reverberated through the terminal to gate some feet off to middletons left where fbi agent m t connolly was snapping a handcuff onto her own wrist the handcuffs other clamp already circled the wrist of dan kohrman who wore a second set of handcuffs shackling his wrists in front of him connollys closecropped brass hair came up to the shoulder of the husky kohrman whod been apprehended in chicago on a federal flight to avoid prosecution charge and extradited to dc chicago cops passed him off connolly hadnt needed to double cuff kohrman true he was a felony fugitive but hed embezzled funds as a lawyer not the kind of bad boy whod give yearsonthebricks her any trouble no she cuffed her left hand to his right hand because she didnt feel like talking to the scumbag easier to jerk him where she wanted him to go hed protested his innocence as windy city cops led him off the plane toward connolly and a uniformed virginia state trooper who had been assigned to accompany the fbi during custodial transferals through the states jurisdiction to a federal lockup after that well after that the state trooper had the easy smile of a dixie scamp he seemed like a possible diversion from the storm of empty howling in connolly his eyes twinkled while they waited for the chicago plane indicating to her that he harbored similar thoughts he introduced himself as george and she knew he wouldnt be around long enough for her to need to remember his last name look kohrman had said as she clicked her handcuff on his wrist have you asked yourself why i would be so stupid as to steal that money as she tightened the handcuff on her left wrist connolly replied like i care about why then she heard the highcaliber pistol shot crackle behind her crowd reacting trooper george facing the sound source screams and she turned her glock filling her right hand she saw travelers stampeding sensed the taller trooperuniformed george draw his gun glimpsed a thick blackhaired american crashing onto a cop the roar of the gun in middletons face deafened him the muzzle flash novaed his eyes but as the bullet cut wide middleton fell onto his wouldbe killer and the crazed woman from first class and they crashed to the floor the gun flew from the killers hand as hordes of airline travelers panicked in a st century terrorism nightmare middletons vision returned but why cant i hear why is there no noise he scrambled after a mm beretta gliding silently across a jewelstrewn floor the fake cop chopped at the firstclass womans throat jumped to his feet reached for his shoulderholstered second pistol middleton heard only the hammering of his own heart he grabbed the beretta and fired at the man who was drawing a second gun a glowing green neon starbucks sign exploded on a wall beyond as the fake cop to a marksmans stance and acquired his target his black shoes crunched white pearls scattered on the floor the fake cop and middleton fired at the same time his arm unsteady middletons bullet missed the fake cops bullet missed too because he slipped on pearls and tumbled back through the air off to middletons left state trooper george saw a uniformed police officer in trouble saw the cop fall panicked civilians ran between trooper george and the gun battle george glimpsed his targettapped out two snap shots missed middleton saw a nearby black plastic chair shatter instantly knew why whirled his eyes locked on a man wearing a blue uniform like the enemys middleton fired four slugs at that second uniform connolly heard the whine of bullets the roar of a gun as the fugitive kohrman screamed connolly saw trooper george flat on his back a hole at the collar of the blueuniformed shirt over his bulletproof vest a red stream flowed from georges neck his eyes stared at the ceiling connolly lunged toward the fallen trooper but kohrman jerked her handcuffed left arm and she tipped back toward him i wanted to make it big screamed kohrman all right i admit it just dont shoot shut up connolly shouted as she broke his nose with the butt of her pistol kohrman crumpled dead weight she dragged to trooper george bleeding on the floor dropped her gun pressed her free right hand over the gushing hole in the troopers neck youre going to make it she screamed at the fallen officer but she knew that was a lie cant hear middleton saw the second uniformed man whod tried to shoot him crash to the floor middleton whirled his deaf attention to the nearby fake cop who scrambled to his feet on the floors glittering debris and fled through an emergency exit door get him before he gets me or my daughter battling in a world of silence middleton saw men and women dive for cover behind waiting room chairs he saw their muted screaming faces firstclass husband slumped in a black plastic chair his face contorted like a laughing clown staring at the tiled floor where his buxom wife lay gasping for air middletons eyes followed the husbands focus saw flecks of gold paint on the tiles saw broken shards of red and green and white stones saw glittering glass ground to dust saw a fallen cell phone spinning to a stop amid the rainbow rubble middleton scooped up the cell phone as he burst to the emergency exit broke out to the night from a facility designed by homeland security to prevent people from storming into it and its planes not to keep people from running away swallowed by cool air middleton stood at the top of metal stairs leading to the vast fields of runways where jets taxied landed took offall in terrible silence a baggage caravan rolled silently across the dark tarmac no sign of the fake cop middleton suddenly realized he stood spotlighted by the doors white lighta perfect target he ran down the stairs ran toward the glowing swoop of the main terminal a jumbo jet dropped out of the sky skimmed over his head as he staggered across a runway he ran under a second airliner as it climbed into the night the pressure changing wakes of those jet engines popped his gunshotdeafened ears suddenly blessedly he heard jet engines roar get to scotland he thought got to get to scotland the strap of his briefcase boaconstrictored his chest as he gasped for oxygen sweat stuck his shirt to his skin his leg muscles burned and felt as if someone smashed a baseball bat into his right kneecap he knew better than to try for his car theywhoever they weremight be waiting for him in the parking garage pistol shoved in the back waistband of his pants middleton loped to the front of the main terminal no one paid much attentionpeople run through airports all the time a long line of people stood waiting their turn for a taxi to his left he saw a young couple exiting a town car he burst between them leapt into the back seat before the driver could protest go the man behind the wheel stared into the rearview mirror twofifty middleton said digging into his pocket for us currency he sank into the backseat cushion of the taxi as it shot away from the terminal capitol hill the driver let him out in front of the supreme court that glowed like a graystone temple across from congress whitecastle capitol middleton walked through a park and saw no one but the nocturnal outline of a patrolling capitol hill policeman and his leashed german shepherd scotland was a hotel built back when visiting washington wasnt a big business middleton passed through the hotels glass doors walked straight to the registration desk no sir no young woman by that name is registered no mister and missus either no sir no messages yes sir ill call you at the bar if anything changes oh wait what was your name excuse me sir sir in the dark lounge middleton told the bartender glenfiddich rocks after the ice melted in his drink middleton concluded that his daughter wasnt coming wasnt here wasnt where she was supposed to be he laid the cell phone hed snatched off the floor beside his glass on the bar a prepay not his he fished his phone from his briefcase ached to call someone anyone but he couldnt risk a monster hacking and tracking his calls besides who could he talk to who could he trust now maybe killers had infiltrated uncle sams badges too breathe breathe youre a musician be like beethoven hear the full true symphony do what you do best interpret authenticate whatever this was started in europe could still be evolving there with other assassins other terrors started way back with kosovo a war criminal and a phantom mastermind was worth killing for worth dying for from poland the fake cop rode the plane that middleton was supposed to be on he might have spotted an airport cop getting off shift followed him to his parking spot snapped his neck stuffed the dead cop in the trunk of his own car stripped the corpse of clothes weapons and ids as a cop in uniform the killer strolled into the airport to meet every plane from paris but who were his partners focus on what makes sense i know something or someone thats why they wanted to kill me i have something that somebody wants or am something i did something but the truth is im not that important wasnt am now that new truth is calibrated in blood in his mind middleton heard random notes not a symphony he flashed on jazz when asked how a musician could slip into a free form jam that hed neither started nor would finish legendary pianist night train jones said you gotta play with both hands middleton put his cell phone inside his shirt pocket stared at the cell phone hed found spinning on the floor in a combat zone the phone had been turned on when middleton grabbed it if someone could locate a cell phone just because it was turned on they were already rocketing toward him middleton found the recent calls screen on the inside front cover of the paperback camus novel middleton wrote the phone number that this cell phone had connected to for minutes and seconds that same number sent this phone one text message s freemnt a balmore baltimore thought middleton a minute drive from this bar stool a train ride from union station kittycorner to the hotel a few blocks north of the train station was a bus depot from which silver boxes roared up interstate to charm city where middleton spent a lot of time at the peabody conservatory of music middleton wrote the address inside the novels cover he went to the mens room and in the clammy locked stall counted his remaining cash american in euros credit cards but the second he used one to buy a ticket meal or motel he would pop up on the grid he checked the ammo magazine in his scavenged beretta eight bullets can go a long way and nowhere at all on what ive got thought harold middleton back on the bar stool he realized he reeked of frenzy the bar mirror made him flinch he looked terrible burned out and all but buried worse he looked memorable middleton left enough cash on the bar walked toward the night he turned away from welllit streets still not ready to risk a phone call or a train or a bus or shelter for the night walked past empty office buildings out of the darkness loomed a man brandishing a butcher knife middleton froze two paces from a blade that wouldve punctured his throat butcherknife man growled give it up cash wallet hurry so middleton reached under his gray sports jacket and came out with beretta steel go baby yelled the robber to a waiting car he dropped the knife freeze baby middleton shouted or ill blow his head off then kill you too middleton kept the robber in his vision while turned toward the rusted car idling at the curb its front passenger door gaping open like the maw of a shark never heard it roll up behind me never saw it coming wake up the robber said we want a lawyer middleton jerked his head toward the open car doorbut kept his gun locked on the robber get in and you might get out of this alive the handshigh scruffy man eased into the shotgun seat of the idling car middleton slid into the backseat behind him told the boney young woman with blazing eyes behind the steering wheel do what i say or ill blast a bullet in your spine baby yelled her partner you were supposed to beat it outta trouble not anger thought middleton thats not the music more a plea and sorrow fool hed have lit you up word marcus i aint never gonna leave you go knew you werent meant for no thug life notes of pride sorrow where the woman asked the dark silhouette in her rearview mirror were going to baltimore middleton said drive s j rozan swift and silent as a cheetah after an antelope the dust cloud chased the approaching jeep almost you could imagine it putting on a burst of speed catching the jeep and devouring it squinting over the sunbaked soil leonora tesla gave in to an ironic smile as she found herself rooting for the dust since shed come to namibia shed seen this contest often the predator running the prey conscientiously she told herself not to take sidesthey were all gods creatures and they all had to eatbut her heart was always with the prey and her heart was usually broken because the predator usually won now she was on the other side butas usual leonorain a hopeless cause the dust would lose this race settling into defeat as the jeep came to a stop in front of her hut at least this time she wouldnt have to worry about heartbreak this would not be a lifeanddeath struggle only an annoyance in her day hes a funder her program manager had said over the villages single crackling telephone calling from windhoek his voice equal amounts sympathy and command you will have to see him leonora tesla had come to the bush so she wouldnt have to see anyone except the hivpositive women she worked with after the hague after the huntingafter the shock of being called together and told by harold the volunteers must disbandeven the smaller african cities had been too much for her so shed gone to the bush traveling from village to village staying not long in any one place her mandate was to establish craft cooperatives microfinancing womens paths to independence the work suited her her days were filled now with distracting minutiaefinding hinges in one village so anothers kiln door could be repaired lending the equivalent of four american dollars so a group could buy paper on which to keep records of baskets sold and with beauty the colorblock quilts the oombiga pots whose tradition had almost been lost beauty suited tesla too visual beauty the way the women weaved echoed the stark subtlety of the african landscape and musical beauty the only artifact of st century technology shed brought into the bush was an ipod loaded withamong other thingsbach preludes shostakovich symphonies and beethoven sonatas reluctantly she removed it now cutting off chopin as the jeep neared she hoped this wouldnt take long shed ferry him around this funder from shed forgotten to ask shed show him the kiln the looms the workshop shed rattle off her statistics on lifespan extension and selfsufficiency give him her little speech about hope for the next generation the women would present him with a quilt or a pot for which he could have no possible use and hed be patronizingly pleased with them and inordinately proud of himself for making this all possible then maybe hed go away and leave them in peace oh leonora at least try to smile the other volunteers used to say that regularly and precisely because their work gave them little to smile about shed try she did it now a polite smile for the angular blond man who stepped from the jeep he smiled back and slapped his hat against his thigh to shake off the dust he took off his sunglasses well trained in the art of courtesy at least leonora tesla im günter schmidt he spoke in english with a soft accent she couldnt quite place not german but no law said his german name meant he was brought up in that country thats what the permeability of european borders was about it was supposed to be a good thing they shook hands schmidts was soft and fleshy as befit someone who dispensed money from behind a desk youve had a long drive she said sit down ill get you something to drink she indicated a stool on the hard clay under the overhang but he followed her into the house hed learn she thought in africa the indoor though shadowed and appealing was never cooler than outside still smiling schmidt dropped himself onto one of the roughhewn chairs at her plank table she handed him a bottle of bb orange soda in a hut without electricity of course she had no refrigerator but shed learned the african trick of burying bottles in a box in the huts clay floor so the drink was relatively cool well be more comfortable outside she suggested resigned to try to be pleasant to this intruder no he said id rather stay here leonora she bristled at the odd way he said her name but his expression was mild as he looked about her hut so she shrugged wiped her brow with her kerchief and sat beside him youve lived here long schmidt asked taking a pull from his soda bottle no i dont live anywhere long my work takes me many places that would account for the simplicity and yet my possessions few as they are are more numerous than those of the women in our programs when youre rested ill take you to see the kiln well be covering a lot of ground today if you want to see the full scope of our work she stood to reach her own jeep keys on the hook by the door no i think well stay here leonora she turned sharply his smile and the mild expression in his eyes were still in place but his hand held a pistol pointed at her calm leonora stay calm what do you want where is harold middleton teslas heart already pounding gave a lurch but she spoke calmly harold how would i possibly know schmidt didnt answer her the gun moved slightly as though seeking a better angle isnt he in america in washington thats where he lives if he were in washington schmidt asked reasonably would i be here well i havent heard from him in almost a year i dont know whether thats true though eventually im sure ill find out but it doesnt matter whether youve heard from him or not you know where hed go if say he were in trouble in trouble no i dont when you worked together when we did i might have been able to tell you but i dont know anything about his life now he teaches music i dont even know where neither of them had moved since tesla had seen the pistol neither of them moved now in the stretching silence a breeze rustled the leaves in the acacia behind the hut sweat trickled down teslas spine who are you what do you want with harold he laughed i suppose you had to ask that but you know i wont tell you but its about your work leonora the volunteers his smile was bitter your work so you really dont know where middleton is not even if i shoot you a gunshot roar ricocheted off the tin roof and mud walls tesla stumbled grasped the plank table for support as clay shards flew everywhere she found herself staring into schmidts mild eyes wheezing a few breaths quieting her heart by an act of will she answered him even if you shoot me i dont know schmidt nodded all right you dont know where hed go if he were in trouble i suppose then well have to depend on what hed do if you were in trouble he stood come what as you said well be covering a lot of ground she walked ahead of the gun out onto the uneven baked earth the glaring sunlight was unforgiving she did not turn but waited there a stutter in his step a whisper of plastic on fabric behind her schmidt reached into his pocket for his sunglasses she dropped down and rolled into him he stumbled she yanked his ankle forward threw her weight sideways into his other knee dust boiled as he thudded to the ground another shot screamed but out here in the endless bush it didnt thunder and shed been prepared to hear it the gun waved wildly looking for her but by the second shot she was in the hut and by the third shed hurled a clay pot with the force and accuracy of yaa asantewas spear in the whirling dust schmidtand more important the gunwas still forcing her breathing even tesla crouched by the door waiting when all had been motionless for a full minute she crept to the table reached down for one of the soda bottles and flung it at schmidts head on impact it smashed into glittering shards but schmidt didnt move slowly she rose she made her way to where schmidt lay in the settling dust his blood trickled into the dry soil amid the shards of a oncebeautiful pot there you see leonora this time you were on the side of the dust and the predator always wins her first steps back inside took her to the plastic water bucket in her makeshift sink she scooped with her hands splashed water over her face and head as though here at the edge of the namib water was hers to waste then she made her way swiftly about the room collecting the few things she would take when her canvas bag was packed she used a knife to slit the seam shed sewed on the thin mattress as she had on each mattress in each hut shed stayed in she extracted the envelope of american dollars and the small battered portfolio shed had with her since the hague she slipped them both into the side pocket with the ipod zipped and she was done getting schmidt into the jeep was harder she was strong but he was tall and leverage was a problem eventually his head wrapped in a towel to keep bloodstains from the seat shed maneuvered him into the back fished the keys from his pocket and started the engine driving along the dust track the way schmidt had come she saw ahead the spot shed been thinking of where the edge of the road fell off steeply toward the wadi she passed it and turned around so the jeep was headed toward her hut then on the curve she yanked the wheel sharply opened the door and jumped anywhere in the wadi would have worked but her luck was better than shed had the nerve to hope and the jeep smacked headon into an acacia tree when she reached itlimping slightly shed banged her kneecracks spiderwebbed the windshield excellent then came more sweat strain and maneuvering and finally schmidt was halfin halfout of the drivers seat though the crack in his skull was clearly not from this crash he was unlikely to be found for a whileexcept by the hyenas that skulked along this dry streambed once they were through no one would doubt what had killed günter schmidt or whoever he was and wherever hed come from she walked back to the hut hoping she could walk out the ache in her knee once there she stripped and washed in the little water shed left herself she changed clothes took what shed been wearing and the bloody towel in a pillowcase slinging it and her bag into her own jeep tesla paused though shed lived in and left too many places to make a habit of goodbyes she took a moment to stare at the hut and then turned to salute the wide brown land shed thought this might be home but now she doubted shed be back the drive to windhoek airport took a little more than three hours once there she used all four of her credit cards to withdraw as much cash as she could with what shed taken from the mattress shed be all right for a while on one of the cards she bought a ticket on the connecting flight through munich to washington dc then she exited the terminal and boarded the longdistance bus to cape town she didnt know if her credit cards were being monitored but she had to take the possibility into account in cape town shed buy a ticket in cash to new york where you could catch a train to washington harold had told her a dozen times a day hugging her bag to her feeling the portfolios stiffness through the canvas leonora stared out the window at the dry land the lonesome trees a dozen trains a day that ought to be enough erica spindler charlotte middletonperez cracked open her eyes disoriented not home not the dining room at the ritz bright antiseptic white shiny surfaces stiff sheets she hurt ached everywhere especially her lower back the squeak and rattle of a cart broke the silence muffled voices followed she shifted her gaze her husband jack by the bed head in hands the picture of grief with a shattering sense of loss she remembered standing up seeing the blood crying out then gasping as pain knifed through her belly she brought a hand to her abdomen vision blurring with tears shed had a life growing inside her a baby boy she and jack had begun picking out names had past tense now no life inside her no little boy with jacks blue eyes and her dark hair her tears spilled over rolling down her cheeks hot and bitter he lifted his head his eyes were redrimmed from crying charley he said the one word conveyed a world of emotiondespair and regret love and need for comfort to understandhow could this have happened theyd reached the second trimester safe theyd thought out of the woods common wisdom validated their belief her fault working too hard not enough rest as if reading her thoughts perez stretched out a hand she took it and he curled his fingers protectively around hers not your fault charley the doctor said these things happen she shook her head thats not good enough i need to know why he cleared his throat theyre going to run some tests on us on our the miscarriage he suggested an ultrasound of your uterus an xray too she squeezed her eyes shut as he tightened his fingers on hers this is a setback it really hurts but well have no other childre dont please her voice cracked i wanted this baby ii already loved him i understand he said with apparent sympathy and he always seemed to she didnt know what she had done to deserve his love theyd met at tulane university in new orleans she had been stunned when he asked her out when he pursued her she wasnt an extraordinary beauty just pleasant lookingaverage face average figure and jack was off the charts handsome smart educated from an influential louisiana family his falling for her had been as much a mystery as a miracle have you heard from harry she asked shed stopped calling her father dad on her thirteenth birthday she was charley he was harry and her mother was perpetually horrified by the both of them not yet you left a message at the restaurant and just a bit ago on his cell phone it went automatically to voicemail he was delayed still in transit you didnt tell him he squeezed her fingers again just that we were here to call on my cell i left my number she swallowed past the sudden rush of tears mother she managed no answer home or cell ms middleton they turned two men stood in the doorway expressions solemn both men dressed in dark suits were pin neat and pressed despite the hour she wasnt surprised when they introduced themselves as federal officers we need to ask you a few questions now perez asked as he stood here its about your father the taller of the two said producing his department of justice id about harry harold middleton yes whens the last time you spoke with him the hair on the back of her neck prickled before he left for europe a week or so before did he seem himself yes but why did he express any concerns about the trip any anxiety unexpected excitement my father was a seasoned traveler agent smith he offered did you get the sense this trip was different from others hes taken none at all you planned to meet last evening at the ritz dining room yes but how she didnt finish the thought the feds could find out anything harry had taught her that for a late supper i didnt make it her throat closed over the words the agents seemed unmoved by her pain were sorry for your loss ms middleton but mrs perez her husband corrected voice tight as i said this is not a good time either tell us why youre here or leave agent smith looked perez in the eyes perez is a well known name down in louisiana perez frowned meaning what its a name were familiar with thats all jack august perez his family descendants of the original spaniards that settled the new orleans area wielded both political and economic influence in the era of huey p long they had exerted that power with an iron fist nowadays with business savvy and brilliant connections angry color stained perezs cheeks what are you getting at dont let him get to you she thought emotions lead to mistakes ones that could prove deadly another of harrys pearls what the hell was going on she touched her husbands clenched hand its all right sweetheart its just a couple of questions thank you mrs perez has your father contacted you in the past twentyfour hours no i expect his flight was delayed im used to that sort of thing with harry at her response she felt her husbands startled glance she didnt acknowledge it how did you know i was here agent smith he ignored the question im afraid your fathers in some trouble she noticed that while agent smith spoke his partner studied her reactions she also noticed that every so often he rubbed the back of his hand against his leg as if scratching at a bite or wiping at a stain most unfed like feds were trained to be as robotic as possible nervous twitches were not an option trouble i dont understand he was questioned in warsaw concerning three murders in europe harry that incredulous retort came from perez you have the wrong harold middleton the agents gaze flickered to perez then settled on her once more your father was able to catch an air france flight out of paris several hours later he arrived at dullesthen he shot and killed a police officer she who couldnt hold back impossible im sorry thats not my father i understand how you must feel its a shock but we have witnesses my father couldnt have shot anybody first off harold middleton has spent his life fighting for whats right hunting down and bringing to justice the sorts of monsters who terrorize and murder that said where did he get a gun hed just gotten off an international flight who was this cop why would my father want to kill him she held his gaze the tense silence crackled between them after a moment the agent broke the contact inclined his head those are all questions only your father can answer we need to speak with him the last thing she was about to do was help them find harry the feds were like buzzards on road killonce they made up their mind someone was guilty theyd move heaven and earth to prove it what can i do she asked sounding annoyingly earnest to her own ears let us know the minute you hear from him agent smith handed her his card she gazed down at it adorned with the bureaus familiar red white blue and gold seal he handed one to perez thats my cell number call anytime day or night i will she ran her thumb across the business card heart pounding and if you find him youll be the first to know this is all a mistake youre looking for the wrong man for your sake i hope so as the two crossed to the door smith turned meeting her gaze once more something in his expression made her skin crawl thank you for your cooperation the moment the door shut behind them she swung her legs over the side of the bed were getting out of here now charley what this whole thing stinks and im going to find out wh she stood and a wave of dizziness swept over her perez grabbed her arm steadying her harrys in some trouble no doubt but theres nothing you can do about it right nowand certainly not in your condition ill get the nurse to call doctor levine and find out when youre being released and well plan from there she shook off his hand you dont get it im not going to lie around here and do nothing when i know harrys in danger for gods sake charley youre in more danger than he is you just had a miscarriage doctor levine said to expect discomfort and bleeding that youd be weak he advised taking it easy for a couple days im not letting you walk out of here without his okay try to stop me she took a deep breath and looked her husband squarely in the eyes those guys werent fbi without waiting for a response she crossed to the rooms version of a closet a press board armoire her panties and trousers were bloodstained the panties were ruined she decided so she would have to make do with the pads the hospital had provided if she tied her jacket around her waist her darkcolored trousers would do until she could replace them she glanced at her husband as he watched her those cards agent smith handed us were bogus she said take a good look cheap stock laser jet printing run your finger over it the bureaus cards are engraved this one couldve been printed from any home computer she stepped into the stained trousers a lump in her throat she swallowed past it there would be a lifetime to mourn their loss right now harry needed her the only number on smiths card she continued is a cell number perez frowned struggling to come to grips with what she was proposing so wheres the bureaus number exactly he rubbed the bridge of his nose charley have you considered that you might be a little emotionally unstable right now youve suffered a loss its been a shock i think taking a step back and a deep breath might be a good idea ill check you out well go home see if harrys there or left us a message you need a change of clothes something to eat well sort everything out do you trust me of course then help me please in the end she wore him down worried that one of the bogus agents was watching the front of the hospital she refused to allow him to officially check her out the hospital would insist on a wheelchairstandard policyand a frontdoor exit instead they took the stairs and slipped out the delivery entrance she waited while he brought the car around once they were both buckled in he looked at her whats the plan we find harry he smiled at her good plan how do y the faint sound of a digitized version of the song browneyed girl interrupted him her cell phones ring tone its in your purse he said i locked it in the trunk he shifted into park threw open his car door and climbed out a moment later he returned with her purse cell clipped to it message light blinking frantically a number she didnt recognizeperhaps her father had bought a prepaid for security she quickly scrolled through a halfdozen missed calls and one text message waiting all from harry she returned the last call first and it was answered on the first ring dad its me thank god i was so worried charlotte where are you jack and i she bit the words back realization crashing in on her not her father her father hadnt called her charlotte since the second grade charlotte sweetheart are you with a sound of distress she hung up drive jack now he did as she instructed what happened someone pretended to be harry they wanted to know where i was check your messages she did at the sound of her fathers voice relief flooded her charley ive been delayed i hope to still make a late dinner love you she frowned at the second message charley theres a situation here ill explain everything when i get there look be careful stay with jack dont trust anyone you dont know my flights due into dulles at pm by the third and last message there was no denying the panic in his voice where are you im boarding the paris flight when you get this dial back so ill know youre okay she checked the text message next green lantern evac scotland she stared at those four little words feeling as if all the air had suddenly been sucked out of the cars interior whats wrong change in plans were going to capitol hill the scotlandthe st regis while he drove she explained about the code when she finished he glanced at her this is a gag hardly harry would never have sent that text message unless it was for real maybe he didnt send it the thought chilled her but only for a moment no no one else would know our code even mother only knew part of it harry sent it this makes no sense its like some cloakanddagger parlor game only youre telling me its real perez pulled up in front of the hotel what is your dad some kind of a spy she flung open the car door wait here ill be right back moments later she greeted the guest services agent she dug a photo of harry out of her wallet the guy at the desk squinted at it then nodded he was here looking for some woman you i suppose went to the bar to wait she thanked him and hurried to the lounge she saw right away that he wasnt there she crossed to the bar the bartender was busy with another patron a stunning redhead while she waited for him to finish her attention was drawn to the television behind the bar the news story being broadcast a shooting at dulles a police officer down the grainy image of the suspect harry it couldnt be true what can i get you she looked at the bartender she had the photo of her father out ready to ask if the man had seen him if he knew where hed gone instead she shook her head and slipped the photo back into her pocket she couldnt chance him recognizing harry and sounding the alarm nothing i just remembered sorry she turned and quickly left aware of the bartenders gaze on her as she strode past the desk again she glanced the attendants way he was on the phone when he saw her looking his way he quickly averted his eyes if those goons had what they wanted they wouldnt have paid her the little visit in the hospital that was the good news the bad news harry was wanted in connection with the murder of a cop that part of the agents story had been legitimate by now the police knew who he was where he worked and lived where she lived they were amassing the names of friends and coworkers he wouldnt be able to use his credit cards or cell phone his car would be offlimits as would his home he had two groups after himthe fake police and the real ones her husband was waiting for her at the hotel entrance expression tight any luck he was here hes not now look i was listening to the news and i know she said cutting him off i saw it on the tv in the bar they hurried up the block to their bmw and slid inside maybe those guys were real agents no way she replied mother lives close by maybe shes heard from him sylvia and your father hate each other hate was a strong word but she certainly wouldnt call them friends a more mismatched union she couldnt imagine plus her mother had never forgiven harry for charlotte liking him more than her and for turning her only child into what she called a dogooder spyintraining the marriages final straw had been the brief affair hed had with one of his fellow volunteersleonora tesla lets try there anyway at the very least i can borrow a change of clothes her mother would ask about the baby theyd have to explain she brought a hand to her empty belly she didnt want to talk about it she couldnt falling apart was a luxury she couldnt afford right now they made her mothers upscale georgetown neighborhood in less than minutes easing to a stop in front of the twostory colonial they climbed out of the car and hurried up the walk her mothers mercedes sedan was parked in the drive the porch was dark though light glowed in several of the windows charley rang the bell from inside came the frenzied yapping of bella her mothers pomeranian mother she called ringing again its me maybe shed gone out with a friend who had picked her up or she was on a date no this wasnt right she felt it in her gut beside her perez dialed his motherinlaws number it rang twice four times six times heart thundering she dug in her purse for her key ring she kept one of her mothers spares in case of emergency she found it fitted the key in the lock and eased the door open mom she called bella came running from the kitchen across her mothers bright white carpeting leaving a trail of perfect little paw prints red prints a cry slipped past her lips with an order for her to stay put perez started for the kitchen she followed they stopped at the kitchen entry her mother lay on the tile floor face up eyes open vacant seeping blood had formed wing shapes on either side of her torso bella had run around and around her mistress through the blood creating a bizarre almost floral pattern on the white tile her mother had been dressed for bed she wore a tealcolored silk robe the robes flap had fallen open exposing her legs and an edge of lacy lingerie one hand rested on her chest as if she had grabbed at her heart the other at her side oh mother whimpering she took a step forward then stopped lightheaded and grasped the counter for support her husband inched toward his motherinlaws body careful to avoid the blood he squatted and checked her pulse struggling to come to grips with what had happened she shifted her gaze it landed on an item peeking out from under the cabinet she blinked focusing a candybar wrapper with the toe of her shoe she nudged it out milka a european brand one difficult to acquire in the states she tilted her head this one was from poland she stared at it blood thundering in her head her fathers favorite chocolate his secret passion one that they shared shes dead charley weve got to get out of here now she snatched up the candy wrapper and stuffed it into her pocket what are you doing charley that could be evidence weve got to call the police theyre going to try to pin this on harry have you thought that maybe he did never not dad he sent me that text message because im in danger too mother was as well i dont know why this is happening but i trust him with your life with mine as well yes she pressed her lips together as the full meaning of what was happening set in weve got to find him how perez dragged a shaking hand through his hair were not wanted by the police but im sure theyre looking for us she looked back at her mother fighting back despairand the urge to crawl into her husbands arms and sob she was harold middletons daughter she would hunt down whoever had done this and make himor herpay in the distance came the sound of sirens the lake house she said starting for her mothers bedroom and a change of clothes eventually harry will look for us there john ramsey miller in the dulles parking lot fbi agent in charge m t connolly watched homicide detectives process a policemans corpse a deep ligature mark around the murdered cops neck and blossoms of red in the white of his eyes made cause of death obvious the same way the security videos made just as obvious the identity of the man who killed him stole his uniform and stuffed him into the back of a jeep where he now lay the detectives had arrived in response to the shooting of a state trooper in the concourse despite early reports to the contrary trooper george was still alive but in grave condition three bullets had deformed against his bulletproof vest and one had gone high and deflected against the collar and severed an artery he wasnt expected to live if he did he could have serious brain damage from blood loss accompanied by homicide detectives connolly had gone from the parking deck to the security offices to view the video surveillance she got a good look at the fake cop whod fired at the passenger identified by customs as harold middleton middleton had taken away the assailants gun and subsequently fired in selfdefense trooper george assumed the cop was in the right and his target a felonan understandable mistake initially she had jumped to the same conclusion in the melee but she had been shackled to her idiot prisoner and couldnt give pursuit until it was too late shed assumed that the fake cop had chased middleton to capture him but it was now clear hed run away from her and other security officers whod come rushing at the sound of gunfire on the concourse it was also apparent that the fake cop had drawn his gun on middleton right after middleton seemed to recognize him after middleton captured the beretta and used it to defend himself from the troopers gunfire hed fled through an emergency door the fake cop wearing the purloined and somewhat illfitting uniform had vanished as had middleton her next reaction had been to use bureau resources to find out all she could about middleton and the cop killer she and the detectives had agreed that middleton would be identified only as a material witness who had to be picked up immediately for his own protection unless the uniformed copkiller got to him first his description was circulated immediately to area law enforcementpicture to follow as soon as it could be printed from the surveillance videoand he was identified as a wanted copkiller which meant hed only live through his apprehension if they found him naked and lying face down on the pavement in front of live tv film crews the airport terminal and parking deck teemed with angry cops crimescene evidence staff and passenger witnesses state troopers with dogs were beginning a search of the airport hoping to find the killer and middleton but connolly doubted they were still in the area while the cops were reacting like disturbed fire ants connolly was working the steps calmlysomething that came naturally to her she had found a business card lying on the concourse floor which the detectives had taken as evidence they didnt know where the card had come from or if it had meaning to the case until in watching the video of the struggle between middleton and the fake cop in slow motion the card was seen falling to the floor after middletons shirt pocket ripped it read jozef padlo deputy inspector of the polish national police it caught her like a hammer blow and if she hadnt believed in coincidences before she was a devotee now mere minutes later certainly hours before the detectives would get around to it connolly called the phone number and since it was six hours later in poland left the inspector a message on his office voice mail to call her asap next she tried a number that wasnt on the card but was in her cell phone but again padlo didnt answer when the inspectors voice mail kicked in she left the same message this time she gave harold middletons name figuring that if hearing her voice wasnt enough to get him to respond immediately middletons name would when padlo returned the call minutes later connolly had already learned about retired colonel harold middleton from the fbis intel group and decided she was going to work the case come flood or tall cotton middleton had located the butcher klas colonel agim rugova and brought him to trial at the hague rugova had been murdered so the possibility that the two events were connected thrilled her aside from terrorism there was nothing sexier or better for a career than an international case and she knew padlo would cooperate fully with her connolly met padlo at quantico three years earlier when he was a guest at the bureaus lawenforcement classes offered to leading european investigators as fortune would have it connolly had been one of the instructors and she and padlo had become closevery close an image of a naked padlo sitting crosslegged on her beda glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the otheras he told her in depth about a cold case he couldnt solve brought a warm smile to her lips jozef padlo wasnt especially handsome but there was something about the lanky pole that strengthened his appearance and negated his wellworn clothes connolly knew she wasnt a beauty either but padlo saw her as one he was quickwitted honest intelligent dedicated to his work spoke fluent english had big sad eyes delicate hands and was an attentive lover for the first time in her life she hadnt minded the clouds of cigarette smoke in the intervening years they spent a few days vacationing together and spoke by telephone two or three times a week since both were dedicated to their careers being together full time was impossible connolly knew she was going to run the casea capfeather generator probably an international oneand if the detectives got in her way shed sweep them aside after all shed witnessed the shootout connected middleton to the iccy and kept the cops from misinterpreting middletons actions and possibly killing him and she had a working relationship with the foreign authorities plus it didnt hurt that she was the southern belle apple of the her bosss eyethey were both from mississippi and more important she had a highprofile case closure rate second to none it also helped that she never failed to give her superiors as much of the credit as possible connolly looked across the security room at her annoying prisoner whose wrist was now cuffed to a pipe ems had bandaged his nose and cleaned the blood from his face to turn him over for processing shed been calling the us marshals service every minutes for an hour finally she thought as her phone rang a callback this is connolly she said where the hell are my marshals when and where did you last see them the polish inspector asked well hello inspector padlo she answered softening her voice as she stepped outside hello fbi special agent buttercup padlo said have you found middleton heres the deal she saidand told him everything she knew padlo listened without interrupting when she was finished he said harold middleton was the last person to meet with henryk jedynak a collector of old music manuscripts who along with two witnesses was murdered here i had colonel middleton picked up and i questioned him from your description of his assailant he could be dragan stefanovic i made the rugova connection to middleton and showed him an array of photographs of men known to have associated with rugova in the old days displaced mercenaries who are now thugs for hire stefanovics picture was among them as was a man we know only as the slav middleton said he saw the slav at the airportapparently waiting for the same flight to paris that he was taking the slav made it out of paris before we could get french authorities there as you know the french authorities generate more red tape than red wine you dont think middleton may have been somehow involved with jedynaks death do you no harold middleton is one of the good guys a devoted family man with firm moral fiber and a man who has made sacrifices so he could right terrible wrongs now we have the death of jedynak the attempt on middleton in public and the disappearance of jedynaks niece his niece is it related to his murder she is a talented violinist so i suspect all of this might be connected to something all three have in commonmusic for middleton and jedynak the link runs through rare music manuscripts which may connect them to rugova as well rare music manuscripts as you know rugova spent part of the war in bosnia securing looted treasures from world war ii at st sophia he stole fortysomething crates the nazis had hidden in a sealed chamber paintings drawings golden figures a few small but valuable bronzes jewelryand musical scores the deaths of almost two hundred civilians got the attention at the time rightfully so but rugova moved those crates in time he was eager to trade information on who received the looted artin exchange for leniency middleton knew this connolly said middleton had a chopin manuscript he said might be a fraud but maybe it is part of this missing collection and he doesnt know it or maybe he does i believed him when i interviewed him and i can tell you that he was suddenly very afraid for his familys welfare this i believe is a valid fear connolly said i hope the copkiller hasnt found him you can be sure that if its stefanovic he isnt working alone padlo said i can send you photos of the men who served with rugova if one of them has killed middleton it is to keep the location of the hidden treasure a secret were talking millions maybe even billions of euros here send the pictures to my email address at the bureau and ill send the copkillers to you of course buttercup she smiled you know jozef maybe i can get clearances and have a ticket for you at the airport i mean you know these people better than we do and your assistance could be invaluable amazingly ive already told my commissioner that by helping you we can quite possibly help solve jedynaks murder and bring the killer back here to justice maybe you can arrange to have someone meet me at dulles i think i can arrange that inspector padlo the slavs name was vukasin which meant wolf and he was not pleased with how badly things were going waiting in a car outside the st regis for two of his men he stiffened at the sight of the elegant woman who had climbed from a cab across the street she approached his vehicle opened the door and slid inside eleana he said in their native tongue your timing is perfect how could i pass up an opportunity to work with dear old friends and its jessica please jessica very american good the woman seated beside vukasin was a serbian national named eleana soberski who was now thanks to forged documents a us citizen soberski had been a child psychologist before serving as an intel gatherer assigned to rugovas forces the real jessica harris had been a volunteer nurse at the central hospital in belgrade a woman without close family in the states she had become eel food in the danube compliments of the woman aspiring to steal her identity soberskis primary duty with the kla during the cleansing action had been interrogating captured enemy soldiers and civilians collected by rugovas unit vukasin one of rugovas lieutenants had seen her work and admired her interrogation methods and enthusiasm a beauty without a sympathy gene she rejected the soldiers overtures and vukasin came to believe she derived sexual pleasure only when she had utterly terrified people lashed to a table a chair or hanging from the rafters in excruciating pain your target is here at this hotel she asked vukasin took a picture of two men at a table in a restaurant out of his pocket and handed it to her the target is this oneharold middleton who led the volunteers that tracked agim and found him her expression hardened this is harold middleton i thought he would be more impressive where is he were not yet sure and you believe he will come here to a bar in public vukasin nodded his exwife had been persuaded by his men to list places were middleton might flee the st regis was one do you have men inside there harris asked theyre on the way vukasin smiled theyre disguised as fbi agents it will be effective middleton is wanted for shooting a policeman at the airport a policeman vukasin explained a fiasco harris said where is dragan now deceased what choice did i have he put everything at risk and why do we care about middleton vukasin took the picture from her this other man is henryk jedynak a collector and expert in rare music documents jedynak is no longer with us either you can ask middleton why i will gladly do so harris replied but surely there is more to this than the death of music collector vukasin was tired but it was the true she needed to know what the mission was now was a good time to tell her middleton was at st sophia with the peace keepers and he was among those given the task of cataloguing the musical manuscriptsthe ones that remained at the church before we could remove them three years ago jedynak was asked to authenticate a few of the manuscripts middleton left behind when they were to be sold to a private collector it was discovered that jedynak replaced the manuscripts with fakes the seller was rugova vukasin added and he expected a price sufficient to cover his costs of buying his freedom harris said when i interrogated jedynak he admitted to his crime but i could not persuade him to tell me where the original manuscripts were harris smiled wryly vukasin knew only violence and not the more subtle and sophisticated methods that were needed when interrogating true believers he did tell me that middleton was in possession of something he doesnt know he has but would discover it soon enough you squandered a valuable resource i hardly need you to tell me what i have or havent done but it was so jedynak had taken knowledge to the grave and now his niece was gone toostolen from under the noses of his men in rome what she knows remained a mystery vukasin said i believe the key is somehow in a chopin manuscript jedynak gave to middleton real or fake harris asked vukasin looked at her and raised an eyebrow there was no reason to believe jedynak couldve known the real manuscript needed to be moved now vukasin had waited three years to seek its return harris saw vukasin bristle it was you who got to rugova and his wife wasnt it she asked her voice rich with flattery vukasin nodded he was glad to tell her about how hed accomplished the seemingly impossible colonel rugova was desperate he said guards were bribed ahead of my visit and i went in disguised as a lawyer from the tribunal needing rugovas signature on some documents my fountain pen leaked and the poisoned ink on the colonels fingers did its job in seven or eight hours vukasin smiled you know the colonel was glad to see me he was amused by my disguise and very pleased when i told him we had a plan to get him to safety he was unaware of course his wife had surrendered his journalswe had everything he was going to use for leverage he even named the men who paid him for the treasureshis benefactors in the end the great colonel rugova was a simple coward without loyalty or honor i wish i could have been there vukasin lit a small cigar and watched as a car pulled up his two men exited and entered the hotel side by side now well see if middleton is inside he said and if hes not his daughter he replied charlotte pregnant by the way once i have charlotte in the same room with him she smiled at the thought and rubbed her long delicate hands together vigorously does he love anybody else a woman he worked with named tesla leonora tesla if we had the tesla woman that might almost be as effectiveif he still cares about her but a pregnant daughter is preferable david corbett the

to amend curses in reply testaments fired back and forth in a fierce vulgar slang that middleton could barely decipher meanwhile the car bumped and rattled north toward baltimore a lone headlight pointing the way along is rainwet asphalt a brief summer storm had come and gone turning the night air cottony thick and hot against which the dying airconditioner merely chattered middletons sport jacket clung to his shoulders and arms like a second skin and he wiped his face with his free hand the other damply gripping the beretta finally if only to ward off his nausea he broke into the frontseat argument with turn on the radio nudging marcuss shoulder with the pistol the youth turned just slightly his cheek was mottled with small white sores hey me and traci got things to discuss here middleton lodged the tip of the pistols barrel into marcuss neck i said turn on the radio i cant think dont jump the rail there mr gray this was traci at the wheel eyeing him over her shoulder you kidnap us threaten us we doin all you ask be cool now dont play not with that gun theyd been calling him that since hed climbed in the car mr gray at first hed thought it referred to his rumpled appearance which was only worsening with the strain the need for sleep but hed caught an edge of racial mockery in it too wasnt it cab calloway in his hepcats dictionary whod referred to white people as grays but that was so very long ago before these two were born christ before even middleton himself was born im not playing he said all i mean turn on the damn radio marcuss hand shot toward the dash and punched the on button middleton recoiled at the instant blast of menace a lilting growl of bragging bullshit warring with a jackhammer bass track and droning synthesized mush all inflicted at earsplitting volume change the station whoa mack you got a serious pushy streak change the station now marcus huffed but obliged fiddling through crackling sheets of white noise punctuated by sudden twangy cries garbled bibledrunk voices traci said you need to put a chill on mr gray break it back let the little shit slide suddenly the reedy cry of woodwinds broke through a soprano lilting through a familiar bar of haunting sprechstimme middleton shot forward there stop marcus looked like hed been told to swallow a toad this tune it in get rid of the static no no taking us prisoner thats wack enough you cant torture us too tune it in the piece was pierrot lunaire by schoenberg songs scored for five musicians on eight instruments plus voice with the lyrics halfsung halfspoken the first twelvetone masterpiece of the th century incomprehensible noise to most people but not to middleton not to anyone who understood who could hear in it the last throes of romanticism with echoes of not just mahler and strauss but bach maybe youre the one who should chill middleton said easing back in his seat a little you think your generation invented rap or hiphop spoken word with musical background goes back over four hundred years its called recitatif here though schoenbergs notes are scored but in speech we never stay on a single pitch our voices glide on and off a tone thats what the sopranos doing its left entirely up to her how she does it meanwhile the instruments are conjuring up the landscape theres moonlight insanity blood traci was leaning ever so slightly toward the speaker intrigued now eyeing the beretta with a newfound skepticism marcus said you a professor sshhh it was traci the gaunt young coffeeskinned woman with glowing eyes and mussed afro was rapt act like you got some sense sulking marcus flopped back against the door moodily scratching his scabbed arm finally they were quiet middleton had his chance to think but the eerie music with its tale of the moonobsessed clown and his freudian nightmares only enhanced his dread where was charley was she safe who tried to kill him at dulles what was the man after and what was waiting for him at fremont avenue in the city of baltimore the possible danger to charley only amplified the need to decipher the threat his mind spun around and around like that addled by the fatigue his fear thoughts careening against each other senselessly meanwhile with a white speck of the bright moon on the shoulder of his black frock coat pierrot saunters off this languid evening to seek his fortune and look for adventure nodding toward the radio marcus said sounds like the same old screechy shit over and over not if you understand german middleton rubbed his burning eyes and youre not listening to the accompaniment its edgy traci offered striving for a compliment though shed clearly lost interest already marcus sniffed sounds like some kind of secret code you ask me funny you should say that middleton stared out the grimy window at the blurring trees there were rumors during world war ii that the nazis were using twelvetone music to send messages to sympathizers in the american cultural elite theres no standard melody people cant pick out a wrong note sounds like nothing but wrong notes exactly all the easier to hide a message in it whos going to know when the music is off he flashed on the chopin manuscript in his briefcase the one hed thought the polish authorities had wanted when theyd stopped him at the krakow airport his conviction it wasnt genuine lay exactly in several passages of oddly discordant cadences unlike the meticulously melodic chopin what if its a code he wondered what if its not the manuscript or the other music theyre after but something far more valuable something only to be found by decrypting the counterfeit folios inspired suddenly he reached down for his briefcase to check the manuscriptonly to realize the briefcase wasnt there no please he thought dear god he mentally backtracked to the st regis remembered placing his cell phone in his pocket at the restroom sink then shambling out to the bar checking his ravaged hopelessly memorable reflection in the mirror before dropping the cell phone into his briefcase snapping it shut had he then just wandered off without it how dementedly absentminded it was one more sign of how addled scatteredmoonstruck like mad pierrothed become turn the car around traci glowered over her shoulder come again turn the car around were going back to the hotel the two hapless thieves glanced back and forth marcus said check out your eyes mack traci chimed in you beginning to scare me mr gray middleton lifted the beretta placed the tip of the barrel against the back passengerside window and pulled the trigger the thundering report in the small car topped by the piercing hiss of shattered glass deafened him again traci opened her mouth in a silent scream hunching forward in terror as she fumbled to maintain hold of the steering wheel marcus clutched his head staring at the gun with wideeyed dread the burnt sulfur smell of cordite fanned by the sudden gust of black wet summer heat finally masked the stench of the cars moldering interior middleton reached forward clutched marcuss collar with his free hand while jabbing the pistol forward as before at the airport every sound came swathed in invisible muck and yet from somewhere deep within his thrumming skull he heard the underwater roar of his own words shouted at traci i said turn the car around or i swear to god ill kill himill kill him understand right here ill kill you too struggling weakly in middletons grip marcus started to tremble uncontrollably reaching across the car traci tried to soothe him the lilt of her gentling words finally beginning to register as with a hateful glance over her shoulder she merged right to make the coming exit gradually even the crackling radio the abstract insistence of pierrot lunaire returned middleton wondered who have i become conrad the bartender held the manuscript paging through it gingerly it seemed very oldthe paper faded and brittle the notations handwritten not printed like the ones hed bought jennifer before shed love this he thought feeling a surge of inner heat chopin shell throw her arms around his neck press her cheek to his he lived to dote on his niece buy her thingstoys when she was younger bits of modest clothing sheet music now that shed started piano lessons a gifted girl his sisters oldest just turned nine growing a little awkward now that she was shooting up in height leaving the baby fat behind but still with that shimmering black hair halfway down her back the vaguely lost blue eyes the porcelain skin black irish like her wretch of a father wherever he might be prison the grave back in carrickfergus someone had to look after the girl she needed a man in her life and her uncle loved her he loved her very much her musical turn the past two years had proved a welcome change he didnt have to just sit on the sofa and watch her gambol about on the floor in her school jumper and socks he could sit there beside her now turning the pages as she played the schumann hed bought her scenes from a childhood album for the young with the vanilla scent of her shampoo thick between them her hands faltering in painful discords across the keys hed gently nudge closer until their thighs touched the rustle of her sleeve against his that was enough hed remind himself no more not yet content yourself with this but someday perhaps if she wants to such thoughts such images so terrible so welcome like the devil whispering in his ear its what youve always wanted he lived for that too he let the warmth subside from his face as he rolled up the manuscript and put it in the pocket of his sport jacket draped on its peg on the storeroom wall as he returned to the bar two men entered from the hotel lobby dressed in blue sport coats and gray slacks one of them tall with an edgy fluid rhythm in his gait the other was broad and muscular with a bulllike neck small dead eyes the tall one offered an empty smile and slid a business card across the bar it bore the seal of the fbi behind him the hefty one remained expressionless there was no one else in the bar it had been deathly slow all night the tall one leaning forward to read the bartenders nametag said good evening conrad a middleaged man came in earlier probably a little uneasy rattled he shot a peace officer out at the dulles airport then fled the scene we have some indication the shooting may be terroristrelated his cell phone placed him here just a short while back its very important we track his whereabouts you recall him yes conrad knew exactly the man they were talking about but he couldnt convince himself just yet that admitting as much was wise the description you just gave he said that could fit just about every guy whos been in here the past few hours i mean id like to help but the tall one wasnt listening hed spotted the briefcase behind the bar it belonged to the stranger from earlier the one who looked like hed wandered in from a car wreck a copkiller they said apparently a musical one conrad had found his briefcase while straightening the barstools and hed glanced inside hoping to find some identification only to discover the chopin instead the tall one refreshed his vacant smile would you mind handing that to me he nodded toward the briefcase and held out his hand id like to take a glance inside conrad hesitated yielding to an inchoate fear of being found out just to be clear conrad national securitys involved we have broad powers so he wiggled his fingers if you would please conrad collected the briefcase and handed it across the bar figuring he had little choice the tall one took it greedily and immediately opened it up searching the contents brusquely his partner just stood there a little ways behind his huge arms folded across his massive chest its not here the tall one said finally he looked over his shoulder at his partner then back toward conrad the empty smile was now pitiless somethings missing but you know that alreadydont you conrad conrad felt the floor sway beneath him his viscera coiled an inner voice said theyre going to find out your dirty little secret before he could think through the consequences he heard himself say i dont know what you mean his voice faltering he pictured jennifer sitting sadeyed and prim on her shiny black piano bench waiting for her only uncle smelling of breath mints and aftershave to settle in beside her the sheet music conrad its supposed to be inside its not fetch it for us now before i lose my temper it was only then that conrad realized what it was that bothered him about the mans voice the accent canadian he thought can canadians join the fbi look im not trying to be difficult but i honestly dont know what youre talking about the tall one glanced past the bartender to the storeroom door theyd seen him closing it behind him as theyd entered from the lobby the agent nodded for his muscular partner to have a look you cant go back there conrad felt a trickle of sweat feathering down his back and why is that its hotel property the tall man grinned and the hefty one was behind the bar now he gave conrad a snide pat on the cheek then opened the storeroom door his partner said its in your best interests to offer full cooperation im a little disappointed i have to explain that you get out first middleton waved marcus onto the sidewalk with the beretta opening his own door he sent one last shower of broken glass tumbling the spiny fragments toppling down his sleeve closing the door behind him he told traci through the jagged maw where the window had been wait here theres something i left behind well only be a minute the young woman said nothing just sat there gripping the wheel seething middleton plunged the pistol into his sportcoat pocket taking marcuss elbow and gripping it tight come on well make this quick they were halfway between the street and the hotels revolving door when the car peeled out behind them both of them turned watching traci flee middleton feeling his jaw drop the car reached the corner in one long burst of speed then a squeal of brakes a swerving turn gone before middleton could gather his wits the youth shook off his grip and swept a cracking left across middletons jaw then darted off running as fast as his stickthin legs could carry him reeling back on his heels middleton gathered his balance but then just stared rubbing his stubbled chin as the scrawny boy vanished down the wet street an hours gone by middleton thought since i last stood here this very spot nothings changed except perhaps everything he entered the lobby wiping his face with his handkerchief hoping he didnt look as raw and untethered as he felt the desk clerk recognizing him from earlier smiled blankly a welldressed woman with a slim valise possibly a call girl waited at the elevator finding his way to the small dark bar middleton crossed the threshold then stopped the bartender was wrestling with a man much bigger than he was while another taller man looked on the two strangers were dressed almost identically blue blazers and gray slacks oxford buttondowns and forgettable ties none of which matched their demeanor the tall one looked on with a cold curiosity sadism curdled his smile he held middletons briefcase in his hand while examining a cell phone that middleton quickly recognized as his meanwhile the other one who looked much stronger had the bartender in a headlock punching him brutally with his free hand the bartenders arm was outstretched the chopin folio clutched tight in his fist as middleton registered all this the one with the briefcase turned toward him you have no time middleton realized as a scowl of recognition crossed the other mans face tugging the beretta from his pocket middleton charged forward as the man dropped the cell phone and plunged his hand inside his sport coat middleton aimed and placed two quick shots into the fleshy center of the tall mans face trusting the bullets would pierce the cartilage around the nose and lodge deep inside the brain the man tottered his head jerking but his ugly expression strangely unchanged then he buckled and dropped stunned by the gunshots the thick man shoved the bartender aside and crouched reaching for his own weapon middleton swung around took a quick step forward aimed and fired two more shots close range the soft center of the face again the man wavered visage threaded with blood before dropping to one knee grabbing at the edge of the bar then sliding down in fitful spasms the bartender recoiled horrified middleton heard steps coming from the lobby the gasps of unseen onlookers as he reached out his hand give that to me he gestured for the manuscript when the bartender merely stared middleton turned the gun toward him i dont have time the bartender hesitated then dropped the mangled folio onto the bar his face half terror half desolation middleton snatched his briefcase from the floor stuffed his cell phone then the manuscript inside then headed toward the scattering crowd in the lobby the beretta still in his hand the welldressed woman whod been near the elevators earlier slipped up behind tucked her hand inside his arm and clutched his damp sleeve she guided him across the lobby dont stop harry she whispered not if you want to see charlotte john gilstrap felicia kaminski had always loved the idea of airports as a child in a family that never went anywhere she used to envy the friends who would take their holidays in places that were far enough away to be flown to trains were a thrill in their own right but only at airports did you find people who are going far enough away to actually change their lives having dreamed of the moment for so long she was finally about to climb on her very first airplaneto fly to the united states in first class no less fiumicino international airport teemed with travelers mingling in their common mission to check in and navigate their way to their departure gates felicia kaminskino joanna phelps she might have to remember thatfound herself distracted by one family in particular as a mother and father did their best to herd six children toward the security lines it looked a lot like pushing water up hill she found herself smiling then she forced herself to concentrate after this mornings events she needed to be vigilant clearly she was a target and if another attacker wanted to hurt her she would most certainly be hurt it helped that every th person in the airport was a carabinieri with a machine gun slung over his shoulder it seemed to her like a very bad place to attempt murder the afternoons events were unfolding exactly as faust had predicted freshly cleaned and redressed hed led her downstairs through the lobby of the hotel where two mercedes sedans stood waiting with their engines running he ushered her to the first vehicle while he climbed into the back seat of the other theyd pulled away from the curb together but then split into different directions her car going right while his went left and she hadnt seen any sign of him since i understand that you havent traveled much her driver said in passable polish she couldnt quite place the accent do you know how the checkin process works kaminski hated the patronizing tone but had to confess her ignorance the driverpeter if hed told her the truthtook her through the process step by step from checkin at the ticket counter to the passage through security and on to the boarding process itself the only real surprise came from the requirement to take her shoes off to go through the metal detectors she was well aware of the detectors themselves of course but it just hadnt occurred to her that she would have to strip off articles of clothing are you going to walk through the process with me shed asked when peter had finished no miss phelps im afraid that will not be possible security at the airport is very tight these days i must stay with the car and drive away as soon as i drop you off you will be on your own where is faust peters eyes found hers in the rearview mirror for a long moment he said nothing he will be where he needs to be at the correct time what is most important is that you remember to show no sign of recognition if you see him again let him make that move i remember she said im in no hurry to know him anyway having arrived at the airport with nearly three hours to spare felicia moved quickly to get through the checkin process at the ticket counter but then took her time heading for security befitting her firstclass status faust had given her us dollars to fill her wallet and she decided to put some of the windfall to good use at an airport coffee shop she found a table at the edge of the concourse one that offered a broad view of the security lines it was a sea of people shoulder to shoulder in a human corral on the far side of the crowd she could see the firstclass security area where the crowds were much thinner and better organized and that was where she concentrated her attention it was there that she predicted that things were about to get exciting it took long enough that she had to order a second espressosurrendering herself to the inevitability of being wideeyed all nightbut after minutes she saw what shed been waiting for faust finally entered the line in his business attire he looked completely at home among the other wealthy travelers from meters away she watched as the man whod saved her life shrugged out of his suit jacket and stepped out of his shoes he placed his briefcase on the belt for the xray machine then stepped through the narrow archway of the metal detector kaminskis heart hammered against her ribs as she began to wonder if something had gone wrong there should be a reaction by now there should suddenly an alarm erupted and a red light strobed urgently over the security checkpoint it was the kind of noise and light that guaranteed attention and made people instinctively want to run away all except for the carabinieri that is who swarmed from all over the concourse to respond to the threat biting the inside of her cheek to stifle any sign of the satisfied smile that might draw attention to her kaminski pushed away from the table and started walking toward the taxi stands at the front of the airport before that she needed to find a cambio where she could convert her windfall of us dollars into more readily spent euros she knew she had timefaust would be busy with the carabinieri for at least a couple of hours she imaginedand she hoped that even a short delay would provide enough time for her to do what she needed to do and then disappear meanwhile the officials at the airport would be turning fausts luggage inside out as they looked for the pistol that showed up so clearly in the xray ultimately probably in fairly short order theyd find the source of their alarm she wondered if any of them would even smile when they realized that theyd mobilized dozens of policia because a businessman had covered a water pistol with a foil wrapper and stuffed it in one of the file pockets of his brief case felicia kaminski left the airport with none of her new clothesnone but what she wore that is her fancy new suitcase was somewhere in the bowels of the airport already checked and on its way to the aircraft that would deadhead it to new york she kept the money too but beyond that she carried only those items that were rightfully hersher backpack and her violin she had the taxi drop her at the foot of via dei polacchi and she added a generous tip to the fare what was the point of a windfall if it couldnt be shared with others the driver thanked her effusively and offered three times to wait for her while she ran whatever errand she was on but after shed steadfastly refused he finally understood that her insistent no meant just that and he drove on she waited until the taxi was out of sight around the corner before she started walking up the hill shed never actually visited the shop she was looking forla musicabut shed sipped coffee with abe nowakowski the proprietor several times since shed arrived in rome signor abe and her uncle had shared a childhood it turned out living only a few houses away from each other in the old country uncle henryk had asked his friend to look in on her from time to time during their last meeting at a cafe near the pantheon only a few dozen meters from the spot where she had first encountered the man who called himself faust abes demeanor had been different than it had been before his easy humor seemed clouded by something dark during one of her visits she asked are you feeling all right hed smiled but it wasnt convincing i am just getting old that is all he said he paused a moment before adding i am concerned for you felicia so that was it i enjoy my life signor abe i understand that you worry about me but as ive told you before he cut her off with a dismissive flick of his hand i know what you have to say so lets pretend that you have already said it and move on i want you to promise me something she cocked her head waiting when dealing with her uncles generation it never paid to make a promise before all terms had been revealed if anything happens to you if ever you are in any trouble i want you to come to me looking back on the conversation now she wondered if signor abe hadnt known something even at the time shed felt her pulse quicken with his sense of urgent mystery hed read her expression exactly and hurried to soothe her i dont mean to frighten you hed said as i get older i sometimes worry about things that perhaps i shouldnt but if there ever comes a time when you feel as if you are in dangeror even if there comes a time when you merely feel lonely or hungry for some of my fettuccinii want you to promise that you will come by the shop i worry that i am not showing you the hospitality that i should i dont want to disappoint my dear friend henryk that conversation had taken place only two weeks ago now as she walked purposefully up the hill she forced her mind to think of music if she could bridge the synapses of her brain with triplettes and chromatic scales maybe there would be no room left for her fear no room left for the looming grief that awaited her when she finally confronted the fact of her uncles death she walked faster the increased tempo brought to her imagination the sound of american bluegrass musicfiddle music instead of the violina music form that shed never taken seriously until shed listened to a cd that featured yo yo ma bringing sounds out of his cello that she had never heard before she heard alternating strains of joy and melancholy shed tried to recreate the sounds in her own violin but could never quite discover them it was as if those particular strands of musical dna could not be found in an instrument played by a polish girl whose childhood was steeped in classical training kaminski saw the sign for la musica from a block away and instantly wished that the walk could have been longer with a few more steps perhaps she could have found the emotional strength she craved the strength she needed before breaking terrible news to such a nice man but it was not to be she had arrived and she could think of no reason not to enter the shop passing across the threshold was like stepping backward a hundred years narrow dark and deep the shop reminded her of a cave where there would be bats dozens of violins and violas and cellos hung instead from the ceiling each of them glimmering as if theyd been freshly dusted double basses lined the lefthand wall and along the right countless pages of sheet music peeked out from above their wooden racks at the very back of the store actually she couldnt see the back of the store through the shadows that cloaked it felicia the voice came from behind herfrom the cash register she had not seen hidden away as it was around the corner at the very front of the store she instantly recognized the heavily accented voice as that of signor abe but she jumped anyway as she whirled to look at him felicia whats wrong even as he spoke he was on his way around to the front of the tiny counter moving as quickly as his arthritic hips would allow him what has happened the flood of emotion hit out of nowhere all at once uncle henryk is dead she managed to say but her next words were lost in her sobs abe nowakowski locked the door to his shop at midday something hed never done before and helped his beautiful young friend up the back steps to his flat on the second floor there he fixed her some tea and listened to her story kaminski hated herself for losing control of her emotions this way but there were times in the next hour when she feared that her tears would never stop they did of course eventually but she sensed that signor abe would have sat with her for as long as he needed to these things take time he said he was a little man a round man with leathery skin and thick white hair that could never be tamed by a comb when he spoke softly like this his normally strong voice grew raspy i lost my maria six years ago now and while sometimes it feels as though the hole in my heart has healed there are days when the pain is as raw as the day she died ive come to think of the pain as proof that i loved her as much as i told her i did the tea was awful overly strong and overly sweet did you know this might happen to my uncle signor abe she asked the question seemed to startle the old man the other day when we met for coffee you asked me to make a promise i made it and here i am but i was wondering she let her voice trail as signor abe let his gaze fall to his lap the body language answered her question now she hoped that he wouldnt dishonor her uncles memory with a transparent lie to protect her feelings i had an inkling yes he said your uncle called me shortly before you and i met he seemed agitated he spoke hurriedly as if he were trying to get his message out before he could be interrupted or perhaps before he could change his mind nowakowski took a deep breath and let it go slowly when he resumed speaking his rasp had deepened he told me that he would be sending me a package for safe keeping he said that it would be too dangerous for him to have the package with him and that by sending it to me it would truly be safe did the package come he ignored the interruption i of course agreed but then he called the very next day this time he was clearly frightened he said that he hadnt thought things through very clearly before he mailed it and he was terrified that people might think that he had sent it to you instead its what people would naturally think of anything he sent to rome he asked me to check in with you more frequently and to try and find out if you had been in any danger he wanted me to do this without alarming you of course what kind of danger the old man rose from the table to return to the stove before today i wouldnt have been able to tell you i think now we know more tea felicia she recoiled from the thought and tried to cover the reaction with ive been drinking coffee all day i dont need my hands to shake more than they already do nowakowski gave a knowing smile and limped back to the table yes ive been told that i make it a bit too strong one of the hazards of not having very many guests i suppose about the package she pressed did you ever receive it i did he spoke the words as if his explanation was complete what was it signor abes gaze dropped again kaminski realized that this was his habit when he was embarrassed dear henryk asked me specifically not to open the package when it arrived he told me that it would arrive doublewrapped and that if anything ever happened to him i was to open only the outer wrapping and then contact the name i found on the card taped to the inner wrapping but you opened it anyway she said connecting the dots loneliness breeds weakness and curiosity he replied sadly and im afraid that i have been particularly lonely so what was in it she found the old mans embarrassment charming but shed have ripped it open in a second if shed have been in his place no reason for shame there he thought for a moment and then rose again from his chair he disappeared into what must have been the bedroom and then returned less than a minute later with a thick mangled envelope i tried to rewrap it he confessed but im afraid i made something of a mess the envelope was a large one more suitable to construction blueprints than a letter he handled the package gently with reverence almost as he placed it onto the table between them when felicia reached toward it he shooed her hands away please he said curtly allow me to do this she folded her hands on her lap the old man wiped his hands aggressively with a napkin and then carefully slid the contents into the daylight kaminski leaned closer she saw a stack of papers her first impression was that it was very oldyellow with the kinds of marks that could only be made with an old style ink pen as more of the contents were revealed she squinted and leaned even closer its a musical score she said recognizing the rows of staves nowakowski allowed himself a conspiratorial smile much more than that he said he gently placed it on top of the envelope and turned it so that she could better read his treasure my god could it be what she thought there was no mistaking the long runs of sixteenth notes and the other musical notations but as exotic as they looked written by hand her eyes were drawn to the written signature at the top in her circles there was no more famous a signature mozart she gasped an original he beamed or at least i think it is she didnt know what to say it must be worth a fortune three fortunes he corrected priceless i would think its clearly a piano concerto but ive searched the koechel catalogue and this isnt there i think this is an undiscovered work she recognized the koechel catalogue as the internationally recognized indexer of mozarts myriad compositions if signor abe was right then there truly was no way to estimate the value of the manuscript this is fabulous she said but i dont understand why it frightened uncle henryk this could have answered all of his wildest dreams honestly this is the kind of discovery that he would have given anything to make why would he keep it a secret why would he send it away all very good questions nowakowski agreed but i have an even bigger one she waited for it while the old man slid the inner envelope out from under the manuscript she saw a name but there was no address he said who is this harold middleton and how are we supposed to find him joseph finder the moment her nextel phone chirped special agent m t connolly had a bad feeling shed just gotten into the elevator at the brandnew building that housed the fbis northern virginia resident agency on her way back to her office it was a cubicle actually not an office but she could always dream glancing at the caller id she immediately recognized the area code and exchange prefix the call came from the hoover buildingfbi headquarters in dc not good only bad news came from the hoover building shed learned she stepped out of the elevator and back onto the gleaming terrazzo floor of the lobby connolly she said a mans voice reedy and overly precise this is emmett kalmbach he didnt actually have to identify himself shed have recognized the prissy enunciation anywhere kalmbach was the fbis assistant director who oversaw the hundreds of agents in dc and virginia who worked out of the washington field office as well as her satellite office in manassas virginia shed met kalmbach a few times enough to recognize his type the worst kind of kissup kickdown bureaucratic infighter a paperpushing rattlesnake kalmbach had no reason to call her directly at least no good reason and why was he calling from the fbis national headquarters instead of from his office on fourth street yes sir she said she sounded blasé but she felt her stomach clench she watched the brushedsteel elevator doors glide shut in front of her the two halves of a giant fingerprint etched on the elevator doors came together the fingerprint had been some government committees idea of art which was precisely what it looked like art by government committee agent connolly who is jozef padlo ah ha hes an inspector with the polish national police and hes working a triple homicide in warsaw that agentmarion if i may m t sir but he went on smoothly ignoring her our legat in warsaw just emailed me a letter rogatory from the polish ministry of justice requesting that we grant immediate entry into the us to this jozef padlo he says you personally guaranteed him clearance our legat is understandably ticked off so this was what he was calling about she hadnt gone through channels so some junior fbi paperpusher whod picked the short straw and had ended up assigned to the american embassy bureau in warsaw had gotten bent out of shape obviously there was some translation problem she said i didnt guarantee anything to inspector padlo hes provided invaluable assistance to us in a case at dulles involving the murder of one possibly two cops since it seems to be connected to his triple homicide he it seems to be connected kalmbach interrupted whats that supposed to mean trying to conceal her annoyance she explained as crisply as she could padlo was able to id the shooter at dulles as a serb national and a war criminal who excuse me agent connolly he idd the shooter based on what surveillance video taken at dulles ah so inspector padlo viewed the video then she faltered no i did but padlo made a positive id based on my verbal description to him your verbal description kalmbach echoed softly condescension dripped from every word in fact she began but kalmbach cut her off do you understand how complex and involved the process is by which a foreign law enforcement official is granted entry into the united states it involves weeks of legal findings and sworn affidavits by the dojs criminal division the office of international affairs its a cumbersome and extremely sensitive legal affair and not one to be taken lightly for one thing there must be absolutely incontrovertible evidence of dual criminality oh for gods sake she thought the guy lived and breathed paperwork it was a wonder he hadnt already died of white lung sir if padlos right then those three homicides in warsaw are tied to these police shootings at dulles airport and weve got a clearcut case of dual criminality a case built on a verbal description over the telephone agent connolly i hardly think that constitutes a finding of dual criminality this is an awfully slender reed im afraid were not going to be able to grant a visa to inspector padlo yeah she thought if jozef wanted to get into the country quick and easy no questions asked he should just join al qaeda and enroll in flight school wed let him in without a second look but she said so youre saying that if we had a clearcut id of the shooterconnecting the warsaw homicides to the dulles onesyoud have no problem letting padlo in we dont have that do we kalmbach said acidly no sir she said not yet thank you agent marion m t she said but hed hung up shed been m t since the age of thirteen shed always hated her given name marion her father had also been marion but then as he was always proud to point out that was john waynes real name in gulfport mississippi where dad had been a parttime deputy in the harrison county sheriff s department the duke was up there with jesus christ bigger to some folks but to her marion was either a librarian or a housewife in a tv sitcom and neither fit her selfimage she was a tomboy and proud of it as tough as any boy she had even beat up the seventhgrade class bully for daring to call her adored younger brother wayne a sissy so she insisted on being called by her initials which to her ears sounded tough and nononsense and the exact opposite of girlygirl maybe even a little enigmatic over the years shed learned about makeup and shed developed a pretty damned nice figure and she worked out every morning at five for at least an hour when she wanted to look hot she could and she knew that when she put on that slinky red jersey halter dress from banana republic she always drew appreciative glances from men at work though she downplayed her femininity as much as possible the fbi was still a boys club and she was convinced that the guys took you a lot more seriously if you didnt arouse their libidos like the guy who sat across from her right now his name was bruce ardsley and he was a forensic video analyst with the bureaus forensic audio video and image analysis unit the main fbi lab was in dc in the hoover building but theyd recently installed an outpost here because of all the demand on the bureau since ardsley wore thick aviatorframe glasses and had greasy hair and long bushy sideburns that might have been modish in the swinging s and he was notorious for trying to hit on all the female agents and administrative assistants but hed given up on her long ago now they got along fine his office in the basement of the new resident agency building was no bigger than a closet jammed with steel shelves heaped with video monitors and digital editing decks and cpus taped to one wall was a mangled poster of a man running up stadium steps above his blurred figure was the word persistence at his feet it said there is no giant step that does it its a lot of little steps she handed ardsley two disks the one marked dulles is from dulles airport connolly said clever she smiled the other has the photos from warsaw as he promised padlo had emailed her photos of agim rugovas henchmen one of them was dragan stefanovic the man padlo thought might be the dulles shooter whod tried to kill harold middleton stefanovic had served under agim rugova which made him a war criminal at the very least after the war padlo said hed become a mercenary and had gone into hiding highdef i hope i doubt it she replied well all i can do is my best ardsley said at least one thing in our favor is the new networked digitalvideo surveillance system at dulles the airports authority dumped a boatload of money on this a couple years ago bought a bunch of highpriced nextiva se widedynamic range ip cameras with onboard analytical softwarebased solutions translation please said connolly meaning the facialrecognition software is still crap and the images are still fuzzy but now we can all feel good about how much money were throwing at the terrorists and thats in our favor how exactly she asked he pointed to the steel shelves lined with video monitors once the bureau realized how crappy the facialrecognition system is they were forced to sink more money into toys for boys like me to play with remember the super bowl she groaned the fbi had put in an extensive surveillance system at the super bowl in tampa in in order to scan the faces of everyone passing through the turnstiles and match them against the images of known terrorists the aclu pitched a fitthis was before when people listened to the aclubut the whole scheme was a resounding flop anyway the bureau had rounded up a couple of scalpers and that was it youre telling me the technologys no better now oh its better ardsley said well a little better her phone chirped and she excused herself and stepped out into the hallway connolly hey m t its tanya jackson in technical services that was fast she said you got something shed called the fbis technical services unit and asked them to run a locater on middletons cell phone to find out where he was at that very instant most cell phones these days she knew contained gps chips that enabled you to pinpoint its location to within a hundred meters as long as it was turned on and transmitting a signal well not exactly jackson said theres sort of a procedural problem procedural look m t jackson said apologetically you know were no longer allowed to track cell phone users without a court order oh is that right connolly said innocently of course she knew all about the recent rulings now you had to get a court order to compel a wireless carrier to reveal the location of one of their cell phones and to get a court order you had to demonstrate that a crime was in progress or had occurred but jackson had done her favors before shed located cell phones for connolly without the necessary paperwork why did she all of a sudden care about the legal niceties tanya she said whats going on there was silence on the other end of the line youre getting heat on this arent you connolly said another beat of silence and then jackson said five minutes after you called me i heard from someone pretty high up in the bureau he reminded me that it was a felony for me to locate a cell phone without a court order i could go to jail im sorry i put you in that position connolly said i just wanted you to understand tanya connolly said was it emmett kalmbach by any chance ii cant answer that jackson said but she didnt have to youre in luck bruce ardsley said he was beaming dragan stefanovic is the shooter he nodded how certain can you be ninetyseven percent probability of true verification bruce thats fantastic take that kalmbach she thought the probability on the other ones lower though the other one maybe seventyeight percent probability which other one are you talking about ardsley swiveled around in his chair tapped at a keyboard and a large photographic image came up on the flatscreen monitor mounted on the wall in front of her it was a closeup of a darkhaired man in his s wearing a dark expensivelooking business suit he had flat slavic facial features where was this taken a surveillance camera outside a mens room in concourse d at dulles who is it she said nigel sedgwick who ardsley struck another key and a second photo popped onto the screen next to the first a british businessman from bromsgrove in worcestershire thats england or so his passport said here in dc on a buying trip for his hottub business looks like it was taken at passport control she said ardsley turned around shrugged modestly smiled right howd you get it i hacked into homeland security well not hacked really just used a backdoor into customs and border protections database so who is this guy really a third image appeared on the screen next to the other two she immediately recognized the photo as one of the mug shots of agim rugovas men that padlo had emailed her vukasin she said he entered the country last night on a british airways flight from paris using a british passport connolly nodded i guess homeland security doesnt have facialrecognition software huh or theyd have stopped him oh they have the software believe me he said plus this guy vukasin is on one of their watch lists maybe their software isnt as good as ours or maybe someone knew who he was and let him in anyway that doesnt make any sense she said a lot of what homeland security does makes no sense ardsley said what are you sayingyou think he was flagged as a bad guy but let through anyway yes ardsley said thats what i think but im only a video tech so what do i know jesus she breathed so let me ask you something he said she turned away from the flatscreen go ahead you ever free for a drink you dont give up do you connolly said he pointed at the ripped motivational poster on the wall persistence he said with a sheepish smile as connolly approached her cubicle she saw from a distance that a man was sitting in her chair another man was standing next to him the man in the chair was emmett kalmbach the man standing beside him was tall and wiry with hornrimmed glasses and a receding hairline she had no idea who he was then the standing man noticed her muttered something and kalmbach turned slowly around agent connolly kalmbach said getting to his feet allow me to introduce richard chambers from dhs she shook hands with the man in the hornrimmed glasses his handshake was cold and limp dick chambers the man said he didnt smile m t connolly dick is a regional director of homeland security kalmbach said a pleasure to meet you connolly kept her tone and face neutral as if shed never heard of him but in fact she had his background was almost clichéd diplomatic track yale ocs and then state department hed been posted to some of the worst hotspots in the world after september hed gone to homeland security resolved that no terrorist would ever show his face in the midatlantic region of the country chambers wasnt popular among the fedsan abrasive façade over an ego that wouldnt quitbut he was a man who took on fires that nobody else wanted to go near and without any hesitation to risk his own hide he got them extinguished that he was involved made her uneasy real uneasy now will someone explain to me whats going on she asked we can talk in the conference room kalmbach said agent connolly the man from homeland security said we seem to have a communications problem that i hope we can all work out in person hed taken a seat at the head of the mahogany conference table wordlessly indicating his place in the hierarchy what sort of communication problem she asked agent connolly kalmbach said what happened at dulles airport falls cleanly within the jurisdiction of the virginia police i thought i made it clear that the situation there is of no concern to the bureau that wasnt what hed said of course he seemed to be performing for the man from dhs but she knew better than to argue with emmett kalmbach over what he had or had not told her actually connolly said holding up the cd that bruce ardsley had made for her i think its very much of concern to the bureau our own facialrecognition software has identified two serbian war criminals whove entered the country illegally one of them using a false british passport under the name why are you trying to locate harold middleton chambers interrupted taking the disk from her hand because hes a material witness connolly said in an international case that involves a triple homicide in warsaw and another one or possibly by now two was i not absolutely clear kalmbach said his face flushing but the dhs man put a hand on kalmbachs sleeve apparently to silence him agent connolly chambers said softly harold middletons file is bluestriped she looked at him then nodded a blue stripe indicated that a file was sealed for nationalsecurity reasons part of middletons military record had been designated as codewordclassified that meant a level above even top secret why she asked finally kalmbach scowled and said nothing the man from homeland replied how do i put this in a language youll understand this is above your pay grade agent connolly meaning im off the case she blurted out no agent connolly chambers said meaning that there is no case jim fusilli leonora tesla stepped out of the yellow taxi on the busy northwest corner of sixth avenue and th street and hustled into macys she emerged with her hair trimmed short and punked wearing a black buttondown blouse with the collar curled high black slacks and black flatsin many ways the opposite of what she wore hours earlier when she killed günter schmidt a new blackleather shoulder bag tucked tight under her arm held a change of underwear and what remained from the moment she steered schmidts body toward the ravaging hyenas down in the wadi her sunglasses cash credit cards and passport her portfolio and her most valued possession her fully loaded ipod a gift from harold middleton she called the human rights observer from a payphone in herald square an intern answered and told her val brocco hadnt come in a flu she reported his message said he intended to spend a second day in bed tesla decided against giving her name and demanding his latest cell number consoling herself with the thought that broccos borderingonobsessive sense of precaution might serve him well itd better to find middleton theyd tried to kill her sending an agent to namibia for the task no doubt they already had at least one agent in metro dc where middleton and brocco were based next from the lobby of madison square garden she tried jeanmarc lespasse in parkwood north carolina mr lespasse she was told was no longer with tddtechnologie de demain the company he founded and no the receptionist added tersely theres no forwarding information sure enough the last cell number tesla had for lespasse was no longer active downstairs into penn station tesla paid cash for a oneway ticket on the acela express to washingtons union station though she planned to get off in delaware checking the overhead departure board she saw she had enough time to run to the newsstand for a prepaid cell phone and an array of domestic and international newspapers for the twohour train ride to wilmington as she gathered her change she looked up there on a tv above a rack of batteries and disposable cameras was a grainy video of a gun battle at dulles airport two cops killed the zipper reported harold she said the word escaping before she realized it had she stared at the soundless newscast the zipper under the video now told her the gunman hadnt yet been found for some reason she took it as verification that he was still alive she wondered if the same could be said of lespasse and maybe brocco twelve hours earlier harold middleton left the st regis hotel with the sadist eleana soberski on his arm and a zastava p in his ribs as he and soberski walked west along k street they seemed like the kind of couple not unknown in the neighborhood a disheveled middleaged man in a business suit briefcase swinging at the end of his fist and an upscale hooker exuding cold impenetrability except they were moving away from a fourstar hotel rather than toward one for a an hour date middleton listened for police cruisers sirensno doubt the cowering bartender had called the dc police who in turn would notify the fbi lurching along he wondered if hed be saved by the people hed been trying to avoid he said where the gun nozzle raked his ribs farragut square soberski replied the statue charlotte is there middleton stumbled but soberski kept him upright the briefcase he said yes the briefcase soberski replied of course the briefcase but the briefcase is not enough middleton glanced around k street was empty the sidewalks rolled up now that the dinner hour was through in new york chicago san francisco krakow warsaw thered be dozens of people enjoying the night air on their way to a new hot spot their chatter and laughter a giddy prelude to whats next in washington you could hear the joyless scrape of the guards shoes outside lafayette park and the white house two blocks away what do you mean not enough middleton asked as they turned north on th street to me a piece of paper my daughter of course you would trade your chopin for your daughter but what else they stood at the corner of connecticut avenue pausing as a few taxis headed east as middleton caught his breath he finally heard the wail of sirens further off than hed hoped but drawing nearer theres nothing else he said fatigue clouded his thoughts the men hed shot in the bar were after the chopin manuscript werent they colonel middleton she replied with a wry laugh lets not be silly but i dont know what you want she jabbed the gun deeper into his ribcage then we will leave it that i know what you wantcharlotte and your grandchild up ahead the traffic light changed and soberski led middleton off the curb and into the street anything he said as they reached the yellow line where is faust a mercedes sedan eased to the end of the short queue of waiting cars blocking their path faust we are aware of your relationship with faust soberski said we whos before soberski could react the driver of the mercedes jutted his left arm out the open window and squeezed off a shot the lone round entered her face at an upward angle penetrating a nasal bone and exploding the top of her head red mist filled the air above middleton as soberski collapsed in a heap the zastava tumbling from her hand leave it harry as sirens blared middleton saw his soninlaw staring up at him from behind the wheel of his exwifes sedan leave it and get in now harry seconds later jack perez twisted the wheel and skirted the queue bursting across the intersection he raced through a yellow light at george washington university hospital intent on reaching route before the cops responded to another shooting this one on connecticut avenue charley middleton asked the briefcase sat flat on his lap safe perez said tires squealing as he turned left sylvia no harry they got sylvia where is the lake house harry charleys at the lake house middleton wiped the side of his face then stared as his bloody palm before we get there harry youd better tell me whats going on theyre trying to kill me middleton managed trying but youre not dead perez said sylvia two guys in the bar two cops at dulles three people in warsaw middleton heard himself say and now the hooker she wasnt thats nine and none of them is you the ramp up ahead and what little traffic there was flowed free jack listen perez lifted his right hand from the wheel and silently told his fatherinlaw to keep still i just undid a lifetimes worth of work reversing my familys reputation for you harry middleton stayed quiet he knew the perez family had been connected in the s to the genovese crime family through carlo marcello but army intel said young jack had tested clean he never mentioned the offthebooks background check to charley in return perez continued you tell me what youre into theres a chopin manuscript in here middleton said tapping the briefcases lid its believed to be part of a stash the nazis squirreled away in a church in kosovo believed its a forgery its not in chopins hand its been folded mistreated and yet somebody thinks its worth nine lives middleton remembered the bodies strewn inside st sophia and the dying teenage girls desperate cry green shirt green shirt please a lot more than nine jack they were on the highway now and perez slid the mercedes into the fast lane pushing it up to the sedan riding on a cloud so im telling you jack that you and charley ought to go on thinking i was in krakow to authenticate a manuscript that some other expert will know is phony too suddenly you whos catalogued scores by bach handel wagner mozart middleton added are fooled by an obvious forgery jack what im trying to say and with charley ready to pop you go to poland thats not you harry middleton watched the maple and poplars trees rush by at the roadside are you going to toss that python perez had been driving with the pressed against the steering wheel hell no at least not until youre straight with me middleton sighed better you dont know jack why perez said peering into the rearview you think its about to get worse though toughened by a native cynicism and the hardscrabble life of a street musician yearold felicia kaminski was too young to understand that a sense of justice and a blush of optimism raised by an unexpected success were illusions no more reliable than a promise or a kiss still energized by caffeine and the vision of faust as he was hauled off by airport security shed headed from signor abes la musica shop to an internet café near the colosseumanother sign of her cleverness she fled via delle botteghe oscure and hadnt gone to the pantheon or north to the trevi fountain areas faust had scouted nor did she return to her home in san giovanni shed begun to feel she was living a clandestine life a purposeful life in memory of her uncle henryk within the first minute at the computer shed learned harold middleton taught masterpieces of music at the american university in washington dc which was miles miles to be precisefrom the address in baltimore faust said was to be her new home there was a flight from fiumicino through frankfurt that would arrive in washington at she could exchange her firstclass ticket for a coach seat and still have enough eurosno dollarsto take a taxi to the college even if professor middleton was off campus she could arrange to bring him backthe words i am henryk jedynaks niece would be enough to earn his attention she spent the night in a cheap flop on the lido resolute but feeling naked without her violin remembering to use the joanna phelps passport faust had given her she swapped the ticket at the alitalia courtesy desk in terminal b sharing a conspiratorial smile with the young woman behind the counter when she explained that she didnt want to fly with the vecchio sporcaccionedirty old manwhod bought it in her name incredibly the woman directed her to retrieve her luggage that had been pulled from yesterdays flight her excuse played with security in baggage claim too and she returned upstairs to a lufthansa desk to turn over nearly euros for a new ticket she converted the remaining euros to dollars paying an exchange rate worthy of a loan shark three hours later the ample jet was soaring above the dolomiti on its way to its stopover in germany and miracle of miracles as it departed frankfurt the two seats next to her in row remained empty she slipped off her shoes grabbed a blanket from an overhead bin and stretched out her last thoughts a prayer that middleton would explain everything and a sense that she was about to discover that her uncle had died in defense of art and culture in the form of an unknown composition by mozart she was in a deep sleep dreaming of music of a violin with quicksilver strings of returning to the statesa glimpse of her father who hadnt appeared to her in years and the broadshouldered buildings of chicagos state streetwhen she felt a tug on her toe she awoke slowly her mind unable to recall where she was opening her eyes she scrambled to uncoil her body looking for this faust held up the oversized envelope that she had seen in signor abes shop no doubt it contained the mozart manuscript she rose up on her elbows and to her surprise spoke in italian che cosa avete fatto con lanziano he nudged into the seat on the aisle and placed a forefinger on his chin old man nowakowski is fine he replied in english he may continue to be fine she stared at him in a bluestriped business suit white shirt and a blue tie that matched the sky over the atlantic he was utterly composed as he stroked back his long black hair you are very lucky you were not killed last night he told her it wasnt luck her senses had begun to return well you were hiding from me i suppose which is as good as hiding from them tell me whats going on faust looked around the rear of the jet stewardesses were in the back cabin preparing the beverage service think joanna he said your signor abe is alive and so are you i have the mozart your uncle wanted to protect knowing that tell me how you can believe i am the enemy you say nothing she said as she sat up crossing her legs under her niente nic nothing with the mozart in my hand i will go with you to meet harold middleton he replied the last man to see your uncle aliveexcept for the killer that is you know who killed my uncle faust stood and held out his hand beckoning her to leave the narrow row of course he said speaking in polish the traitor vukasin the lowest of the lows its a shame your uncle had to die in his presence where is he vukasin no doubt he is within a kilometer or so of colonel middleton faust turned at the sound of the beverage cart rattling into the aisle come joanna he said reaching for her they serve champagne in first class and bavarian bleu cheese with a pumpkinseed breadbefore lunch im sure the effects of the panzanella and cantucci you had last night have long passed kaminskino phelpsstood and wriggled her feet back into her worn shoes the arterial spray from broccos severed throat had already dried on his heartbreakingly meager kitchen table and rigor had begun to subside curiously only his left hand was tied behind his back his right hung limply fingertips just above the blood and urinestained floor tesla saw the outline of a standardsized reporters notebook on the table which meant the killer coerced brocco to write something before he died and getting brocco to write something meant he was tortured before he was killed the killer also recorded broccos voicehow else could a dead man call in sick after he died clever a way to buy some time but what had he wanted brocco to write tesla had been asked one pertinent question by schmidt where is harold middleton there are four immediate answers brocco could have given middletons true location a false one a concession that he didnt know where he wasas tesla hador a refusal to say anything all but the first would lead to escalating pain and if brocco hadnt known where his old boss was he could have been compelled into speculation tesla looked at her former colleague and though his head was lolled back and his eyes opened wide and empty she remembered tenderly his earnestness his awkwardness around women his passion for th century classical music his unassailable belief in the power of a free press she peered into his mouth and saw that his tongue had been cut out which explained the dried blood on his lips and chin and also whatever he wrote on the notebooks page tesla went to the sink to retrieve a ratty dishtowel and brought it to the old newsprintsmudged yellow wall phone she dialed gave them broccos address and then let the handset fall the towel unraveling and landing on the worn linoleum as she turned to leave she saw brocco had five deadbolt locks on the door his tattered khaki saddlebag which hung from the knob was empty the ultracautious brocco had let the killer in the killer stole broccos laptop brocco knew the killer and the email addresses stored in the laptop werent enough tesla hustled down three flights of stairs and stepped into the lateafternoon sun shaken her thoughts occupied by broccos brutal murder as well as by speculation on where harold might be she momentarily abandoned the vigilance she applied when she stepped off the acela in wilmington only to taxi to bwi scurry through the airport as if she were late for a flight and then pop back on amtrak to union station buying a ticket using a credit card issued to a woman who worked as an extra at il teatro constanzi in rome now as she hurried to catch the georgia avenue bus as it wheezed from its stop she suddenly remembered with a startling vividness an unexpectedly satisfying afternoon shed spent with harold at a house on lake anna were she the type to blush she wouldve lake anna she told herself unaware that shed failed to see a man in an old sunbaked citröen sitting directly across from broccos shabby building he wore a black stocking cap atop his shaved head the cap covered a blackandgreen tattoo of the jack of spades when tesla leaped onto the bus the man turned the ignition key folded the switchblade hed been using to clean his fingernails and eased the car out of the spot he was waiting when minutes later the woman in black pulled out of the budget lot at union station in a dark blue rental sunglasses on her nose there was nothing else they could do they had no choice the mercedes had kicked up pebbles as perez parked it at the side of the house as middleton hoisted his weary body from the car perez said harry no lights shes sleeping harry no of course not charley sent her husband to scotland to rescue her father if she wasnt pregnant shed have been there herself perez pulled the python groping through darkness theyd stepped inside the house and as perez climbed the stairs to the bedrooms middleton put down his briefcase and headed through the kitchen to the living room through the picture window he saw his daughters silhouette on the porch she was slumped in a wicker chair charley hed whispered then he said her name again louder this time when she didnt respond middleton called to his soninlaw and raced outside charley had his browning abolt across her lap beneath the wicker chair was a tiny puddle of blood that had been dripping from between her legs middleton recoiled oh jesus perez said as he skidded to a halt charley charley wake up at that moment middleton understood that his daughter had lost her baby he felt a muted sense of relief for a moment seeing the blood he thought they had gotten to her as they had henryk jedynak sylvia and othersand had tried to kill him at dulles kneeling perez said she needs yeah she does and now charlotte perez was recovering at martha jefferson hospital a private room iv drip in place and her husband at her side barely awake in a lounge chair with a magnum in his jacket side pocket honey sunlight streamed through the windows treetops swayed in the gentle breeze felt like hiding in plain sight to harold middleton to jack perez too peter spiegelman felicia kaminski collapsed on the vast sofa that sat before the window that filled the wall of a suite atop the harbor court hotel the fat silkcovered cushions nearly swallowed her whole far below the lights of baltimores inner harbor blinked yellow and white at her and big boats bobbed like eggs on the black water was there something in the blinking lightssome pattern a signal a message meant for her if there was she was too tired to decipher it beyond tired really she was spentexhausted by fear and flight and addled by too many time zones and champagne that flowed freely in the firstclass cabin faust had all but forced it on her and hed kept up with her glass for glass all the while smiling like the cheshire cat one bottle had led to anotherso many bubblesbut the smiling mr faust seemed entirely immune kaminski closed her eyes but she could still see his white teeth and those dark stony eyes could still hear that deep melodious voice speaking in italian then in french in polish in german and now in english as he addressed the hotel man there was a rueful smile in his words without looking she knew that the hotel mannot a bellman but the immaculate bluesuited fellow from behind the deskwas smiling back and nodding it was all smiles and nods and discreet bows for mr faust all along the way on the airplane in the executive lounge in frankfurt as they waited to fly to the states and from the man at dulles who met them retrieved their luggage and drove them in a shiny black bmw all the way to baltimore it was as if they all knew him their oldest friend dear mr faustwho smiled and drank champagne and spoke in many tongues but answered questions in none of them kaminski sighed and sank deeper into the cushions her head swam and the harbor lights blinked at her even through her closed lids she had smoked opium once an oily black bead with that tunisian boywhat was his namewho played guitar near the castel santangelo and it had set her drifting like this floating her worries no more than distant lights there was a sharp knock and she came to with a bump she rubbed her eyes and sat up to see faust opening the suite door a man came in squat and muscular wearing jeans and a blackleather jacket his hair was gray and cut short and he greeted faust in italian then glanced at his guest and switched to something else whatever it was sounded fast and harsh to kaminskis earsslavic she thought but otherwise no clue faust listened and nodded and checked his watch he said something to the manan order a dismissaland the man nodded and left faust looked at her another trip he said felicia could barely find her voice what now at this hour again the smile no rest for the wicked felicia but we wont be gone long if you wish to wash up first i will wait she rubbed her hands over her face rubbing life back into it no she said im tired of being dragged around and now im done with it sono rifinito non sto andando even to herself she sounded like a child but she was beyond caring she looked at faust leaning so casually against the doorframe his suit somehow without a wrinkle and every hair in place as if he had stepped from a page in a fashion magazine he shook his head you are not staying here alone felicia anger welled in her no and why not it is not safe i take care of myself yes i saw how well back in rome she said screw you i dont need a goddamn babysitter you are the tough little urchin now eh tough enough kaminski said grinding her teeth i didnt grow up in places like this being waited on hand and foot fausts smile widened you think that i did lets say you dont look out of place he chuckled you havent known the real romance of street life until youve experienced it in buenos aires caught between the montoneros and the battalion boys now those were charming fellows and much more dedicated than your average roman teppista kaminski massaged her temples trying to get her brain to function buenos aires montoneros what the fuck shed read something once about the dirty war but she couldnt remember what so you had it rough and now youre up from the guttera real success story something like that good for you youve earned all this and never mind that youre a thief or a spy or some kind of terroristsomeone who bullies old men and kidnaps girls from the streets of rome ive told you felicia your friend abe is fine and i am no spy i have no taste for politics at all if i had to describe my profession id say i was a broker i match buyers with sellers and take a fee a modest fee all things considered buyers and sellers of what faust shrugged this and that odds and ends like stolen music manuscripts the manuscript is in the closet felicia behind lock and key my own musical inclinations run more to sinatra than mozart not music then whatdrugs guns whatever it is im sure it makes your family very proud kaminski felt the air change going silent and thick around her the smiling mr faust was no longer smiling and those dark eyes seemed to look right through her defiance and anger drained from her replaced by choking fear this time the knock on the door was a relief it was the squat man again and he looked nervously at faust faust said something to the manshe didnt know whatand walked out the door the squat man turned to her come he said in gravelly english she was not inclined to argue faust hadnt lied about the trip it was a short one in the back of the big bmw through sodiumlit nighttime streets kaminski looked for signs and landmarks light street east lombard a big stadium off to the left bathed in light and carpeted in impossible green then a tangle of narrower streets and old brick buildings in minutes they pulled up in front of one of them four stories and broad the building looked to her like a warehouse or an old factory and so it had been once upon a time as she read on the shiny brass plaque near the modern glass entry the sail cloth factory just above that plaque another with the address south fremont avenue home she thought her anger returning as she followed faust inside exposed brick and ornamental wrought iron whispered of the buildings industrial past otherwise the rest of the lobbygleaming brass etched glass and marbleproclaimed its current incarnation as a luxury apartment building faust crossed to the elevator and felicia followed him in and then on the fourth floor out again around a corner down a pale gray corridor and to a black door at its end faust knocked twice then he took a key from his jacket pocket worked the lock and stepped inside and stopped short kaminski didnt see the wiry bearded man pointing a glock at fausts chest until she bumped into fausts back then she gasped and gripped fausts bicep jesus she whispered the bearded man smiled at faust who smiled back qué tal nacho faust said nada jefe the man said and slipped the glock into a holster behind his back all quiet on the western front have a look for yourself faust gently removed kaminskis hand from his bicep and followed nacho to a window she let out a long breath and looked around the large loft apartmentbrick walls high ceilings exposed beams and ductwork shiny plank floors and little in the way of furniture a card table some folding chairs a dim floor lamp and heavy white drapes across the windows there was plenty of technical equipment three laptops several cameras wearing long lenses and two massive tripodmounted binoculars they were pointed at a narrow gap in the drapes and now nacho fiddled with one of them got the image intensifier on this one jefe he said as faust bent to the eyepieces when was the last delivery faust asked as he looked this afternoon maybe five oclock you know what it was nacho looked at kaminski and switched to spanish she tried to follow it but it came too fast and the accents were strange and anyway it sounded scientific to her chemical terms maybe she walked slowly to the binoculars while faust and nacho spoke the men saw her but seemed not to care she peered into the eyepiece outside the world was tinted green as was a brick building low and long that seemed very close it had a lot of windows all shuttered and she thought it looked abandoned there was a loading dock in the center of the image and the only thing that moved was a plastic bag blowing in the warm night breeze nacho pulled the drapes and the outside images went black he looked at kaminski and nodded his head at a chair in the corner she sat still straining to catch the conversation it was less technical now faust asking something about someonedoes he know does he know what horario was that like orario meaning schedule timetable and who was this he it seemed as if nacho was uncertain too he shrugged at faust and moved to a large closets double doors he put his hands on the knobs maybe you have better luck than me jefe he said in english and swung the doors wide kaminski screamed the man on the closet floor stared at her though he was bound with wire and gagged with duct tape and bleeding from a gash on his shaved head which she noticed was tattooed with the likeness of the jack of spades nacho pressed a forefinger to his lips and made a shushing noise at her she had no idea how long it was before her head cleared but when it did she saw faust kneeling by the tattooed man his hand rested gently on the mans shoulder and he spoke softly in his ear the duct tape was off the tattooed mans mouth and kaminski could see that the mans lips were split and that he was crying and speaking too in urgent terrified english no nonot weeks its days a matter of days maybe less faust spread the duct tape over the mans mouth again and patted him almost affectionately on the back then he stepped away and shut the closet door nacho looked at faust and smiled still got the touch jefe he said faust smiled minutely you call if theres any more activity he said to kaminski he added we return to the hotel she stood and followed numbly as they were about to step into the corridor she touched fausts arm and spoke in a whisper what will happen to himthe man in the closet nacho will see to him faust said now come we have dinner plans to make it was nearly black in the hospital room when jack perez came awake the in his hand the only light came from the orange glow of the call buttons on the wall the green digits on the blood pressure monitor and the pinkish scatter of streetlight through the shaded window it was nearly silent tooonly the sounds of his wifes steady breathing the quiet whir of air in the vents and the electric ping of some sort of warning bell reached his ears about right for two am but something had woken perez from his brittle sleep his fatherinlaw going out someone in the corridor perez wiped a hand across his eyes rose from the lounge chair and crossed the room without a sound he leaned against the doorframe with one hand on the knob and the down along his leg he took a deep breath and opened the door a crack middleton was down the hall his back to perez and he was talking quietly to a man and a woman the man was lanky and pale and his jaw was darkened by a threeday beard his eyes were shadowed and darting the woman was tall tanned and broadshouldered and her dark hair was cut short perez hadnt made a sound but somehow middleton knew he was there come meet some old friends jack he said without turning around perez pocketed the python and closed the door to his wifes room behind him this is jeanmarc lespasse and leonora tesla former colleagues of mine nora jm this is my soninlaw jack perez lespasse nodded at perez and tesla put out a warm hand harry has told us all thats happened mr perez im so sorry for what you and your wife have been through will she be all right shes lost a lot of blood but the docs say shell recover all right is another story i dont know that either one of us will be all right again after this as tesla nodded sympathetically middleton said nora and jm have been through the wringer themselves the past couple of days a man nearly killed nora in namibia and jm narrowly avoided abduction in chapel hill jesus harry is all this about we think so middleton said the man who attacked nora was looking for me i didnt hang around to find out what those clowns in the parking lot were after lespasse added in a raspy whisper but i heard them speaking serbian and they were carrying those cheap shit zastavas and this is all about what that fucking manuscript perez asked tesla and lespasse shifted nervously middleton said nothing for christs sakes harry perez said shaking his head he looked at tesla how did you two manage to find us we both saw the news reports of harrys difficulty at dulles and knew that he was in flight we both guessed that he might turn up at the lake house i ran into nora there lespasse said and nearly blew my head off we saw the blood and thought the worst lespasse added we started checking hospitals closest ones first and there you were perez turned back to his fatherinlaw not too difficult and the guys who are after you whoever they are seem fuckin relentless how much longer before they turn up here too any answer middleton might have given was interrupted by the night duty nurse you and your fatherinlaw will have to quiet down mr perez and your friends will have to come back during regular visiting hours middleton seized the opportunity yes maam and were very sorry ill just see these folks out so jack can sit with charley he took teslas arm and led her and jeanmarc toward the elevator leaving jack perez grinding his teeth in the darkened hallway outside the air was warm and close the hospital parking lot was nearly empty jeanmarc lespasse lit a cigarette inhaled deeply and blew a column of smoke into the night sky harry middleton recalled the last time hed seen lespasse and val brocco a blisteringly hot day at chaotic kenyatta airport he remembered too his farewell to nora tesla it had been somewhat after his final meeting with the two men and the location was much niceran algerianinfluenced inn on the cote dazurebut the moment was no less difficult events intervened she glanced at him once and then her eyes fled words seemed easier your family has no idea leonora tesla asked middleton no i never told themnever thought id have to i thought i could protect them from all this she clutched his hand an instinctive gesture and released it fast this isnt your fault harry but your soninlaw is right it wasnt difficult for us to find you and it wont be difficult for anyone else whos looking its not safe its safe enough for a little whilelong enough for me to think things through the soberski woman asked about faust she thought i was into something with him so you said harry and i told you eleana soberski was a sociopath and a congenital liar tesla said you have to assume that anything she said was meant to mislead and to manipulate faust was our boogeymanour white whaleand she knew that what better way to get your attention than dangle his name she didnt have to dangle anything nora she had a gun in my ribs blowing out more smoke lespasse said she thought she was going to be interrogating you harry she was laying groundwork putting you off balance she before lespasse could finish middletons cell phone burred he found it in a pocket flipped it open and heard only static and then a faraway voice old and struggling in english colonel middleton my name is abraham nowakowski im calling from rome and i have a message from felicia kaminskihenryk jedynaks niece an urgent message harold middleton listened intently for several minutes then he said ciao signor abe mille grazie closing his phone he let out a massive breath tesla and lespasse looked at him expectantly speak of the devil and the devil appears middleton said faust hes in the country and closeup in baltimore hes got something henryk jedynak was holding for me and hes got jedynaks niece too baltimore what the hell is he doing in baltimore lespasse asked i dont know jedynaks niece managed to get a call out to a family friend in romethats who was on the line from what he said it sounds like faust has some sort of operation going on there but the girl was cut off after a minute did she say where in baltimore faust is tesla asked no but she did tell her friend where she and faust would be tomorrowcheck thattonight a place called kalis court on thames street apparently the two of them are going there for dinner just the two of them im thinking that maybe we should join them tesla and lespasse looked at middleton tesla shook her head join them you cant be serious harrywith only three of us we need backup for something like that colonel lespasse said unless what you want is in and out bang bang bang middleton shook his head thats appealing but not smart no we need to talk to this guy and at length so backup it is harry opened his phone again and clicked through his list of contacts he stopped on an entry marked ek and hit dial the phone rang once the voice in middletons ear said its about time you called harry but then i guess youve had your hands full lately i need a team emmett middleton said in baltimore sure you do harry and what about what i need we can talk about that too after we settle baltimore we can fuckin talk about it now its been real bad luck for people to run into you lately harry weve got bodies at dulles downtown on sixteenth street and two assholes with fake bureau ids in a bar nearby okay sure selfdefense but you still have to answer questions and we cant stop the local boys from bringing you in if they find out jesus you shouldve told us from the beginning what was going on guess what emmett somebody forgot to send me an agenda i didnt know what was going on and i still dont be that as it may we need to talk no time emmett my batterys running low not to worry harry we can talk about it over coffee say in five minutes in the hospital cafeteria middleton looked left right overhead on the phone kalmbach laughed nastily on your left he said across the street middleton peered into the darkness and a pair of headlights of a bureauissued car winked once twice at him emmett kalmbach was still laughing cream and two sugars for me harry in his suite at the harbor court hotel the man known as faust answered the muted beep of a cell phone the voice on the other end was faraway and old faust listened intently and a small satisfied smile played on his lips well done signor abe he said faust put his phone down and looked across the sitting room into the smaller of the suites two bedrooms a splash of light fell across the kingsized bed and in it he could see kaminskis pale face on the pillow and a spray of blond hair charming he said again to no one in particular ralph pezzullo there was something about fells point that put harold middleton in a foul mood maybe it had to do with the fight at the horse you came in saloon that got him booted out of west point maybe it related to the scar on his left temple left by a bar stoolthe one that still throbbed whenever the thermometer dipped below this dank place changed my life he thought entering the fog that clung like bad luck to baltimores thames street charleys miscarriage his exwife sylvias violent death the mayhem and destruction that trailed him since the meeting in krakow now he was determined to right all that coming on like st george to slay the dragon as in the richly colored depiction by raphael sanzio he admired even if faust had chosen kalis court in some sort of a sick cosmic joke he smiled to himself wasnt kali the hindu goddess of annihilation as he peered through the fog middleton reminded himself to focus the forces aligned against him were vile and dark the equation he followed was simple he had come to slay evil which had manifested in numbing complexity nora teslas voice squawked in his earpiece targets in alone thats strange he thought marching over the same cobblestones hed been tossed to like trash so many years ago kaminski isnt with him i said alone so you did middleton pushed his shoulders back fixed the collar of his coat and entered the restaurant a hostess with a frosted smile stopped him with hard blue eyes you have a reservation im meeting someone a man midthirties long dark hair slicked back tall just arrived i know him yes suddenly flummoxed she managed to smile and frown at the same time he said he was dining alone not tonight my dear middletons dover saddlery riding boots reverberated confidently across the walnut floor past tesla and lespasse in a nearby booth along with an fbi agent and another man ambiguously titled but one whose job became clearer if you knew his phone number was an exchange near crystal city virginia the home of the pentagon outside in a control van were some other distinguished visitors emmett kalmbach and homeland securitys richard chambers such seniority at a surveillance operation was unusual but faust was such a wild card and the recent shootings so troubling that both the major agencies responsible for tracking foreign threats within the us wanted direct involvement middleton knew kalmbach the man could be spineless but middleton didnt care all the easier to get what he wanted from the feebies on ninth street as for dick chambers the regional director wouldnt have much personal interest in faust the politics of the balkans hadnt intrigued him hed made one trip to the region during the conflicts apparently deemed it solvable by underlings and headed off for the middle eastwhere he saw more of a threat to the us about which he was right of course but chamberss presence here could be explained by a simpler reason the dhs the organization that brought us the colorcoded threat levels and was charged with protecting our borders had screwed up big time and focused on people whos last names began with al had missed vukasin a known war criminal and an unknown number of his goons sneaking into the country on phony papers which wasnt necessarily bad news for middleton it meant that chambers needed to protect his image and could bring resources to bear in a big way middleton was confident that all the pieces were in place for checkmate spotting thick black eyebrows protruding over the top of the racing form middleton stopped and lowered his chin good evening faust he said deeply placing the edge of his briefcase on the table his heart was beating fast palms moist the man hed been tracking for years was now in front of him he seemed diminished much smaller than middleton expected though he knew the physical details of the war criminal better than he knew his own i rather liked pattys special in the eighth running ten to one came the reply faust set down the paper and smoothed it carefully colonel harold middleton the swarthyskinned man with the lopsided grin looked up briefly then snapped his fingers at the nervous waiter with the puff of blond hair bring a glass for my friend then to middleton he said i hope you dont mind beaujolais the american beamed at his quarrys attempt at gamesmanship i have you faust he said as he pulled out a chair and sat we can do this anyway you want faust folded the paper and fixed him with intense black eyes unhappy master who unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs the burden bore till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore of nevermore of nevermore i deplore people who play with other peoples lives so do i its over lets hope not colonel the man took a bite of food which he seemed to relish he then said one thing ive never thanked you for my name your name that was your creation i believe you found some documents in a volume of goethes masterpiece and dubbed me after the hero you think faust was a hero protagonist then he raised his glass so heres to selling our souls to the devil middleton let his wine glass sit untouched they confronted each others stare middleton wanted nothing more than to reach over and wring the younger mans neck faust said the great edgar allen poe died at church hospital very close to here few grieved the poor mad genius was placed in an unmarked grave his last words lord help my soul it seems you identify with him faust shook his head i was thinking he was more like you condemned to walk the earth as a marked man walking down the avenue of life stalked by demons using his will to bend his torment into art middleton drank down his wine then slammed his fist onto the table youre a criminal a fiend i still dream about the slaughtered children of kosovo and racak faust laughed into his fist adding fire to middletons anger then he held up his hand easy my friend why it is that you americans always assume that everything is black and white in this case it is so if it has a pink ribbon tied around it its a birthday present maybe you didnt pull the trigger yourself but you backed the man who did rugova was a pig may he rest in i hope hes rotting in hell he was useful middleton stabbed a finger toward his rivals chin you stink of guilt i like you colonel i need you thats why i must stop you from continuing to demean your own intelligence before middleton could reply faust snapped his fingers at the waiter who skittered across the dining room my guest here will have the lacquered octopus to start for me the pear and caramelized walnut salad wed both like the whole bronzini no salt faust lifted his glass heres to the beginning of our partnership success what the hell are you talking about tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of people are counting on us but dont know it music lovers he asked darkly i know a great deal about you colonel ive studied you carefully youre a man who is relentless in pursuit of what you consider a worthy goal i hope youll excuse me if i say that your goals so far have been wrongheaded the salad and octopus arrived and were soon treated to showers of fresh black pepper i bet you the price of this meal that well be working together by the evenings end faust offered middleton nodded his acceptance in a small bookkeepers office in a corner of the lemonandbrinescented kitchen of kalis court m t connolly sat listening with desperate attention to the two men at the table not yards from her their voices traveling through an earbud kalmbach at his disposal were hundreds of bureau agents and yet in a display of typically unnecessary bravado he drove to martha jefferson hospital by himself unaware connolly was behind him now hours later kalmbach with dick chambers in tow had led her to middleton and faust who was beginning the next phase of his dissertation with an anecdote about his father connolly listened hard the bug was under fausts bread plate invitations to dance made with simple nods faust said the intense courtship she jumped as her cell phone rang she stretched her leg and snapped it quickly from her belt this is connolly hello buttercup she walked toward a corner away from the kitchen staff s prying eyes padlo she said her voice barely above a whisper where are you sono a roma he replied his italian accented with as much american english as his native polish someone wants to say hello josef wait oh and by the way his english is actually its nonexistent connolly sighed as faust and middleton continued in her other ear buona sera signora connolly an old man said nervously il mio nome è abe nowakowski posso aiutarlo con il vostro commercio im sorrycommercio i dont business padlo said taking the heavy black handset in the old mans shop which is still finding middleton i presume ive got middleton padlo heard her say and faust when padlo repeated the names the old man recoiled they are together padlo asked together and negotiating nowakowski who had lived in terror since the moment he first saw the mozart score said dove è il felicia padlo saw that the old man trembled a young girl the deputy said to connolly felicia kaminski jedynaks niece recalling her photo he began to describe her shes not here connolly said harbor court the old man told padlo padlo repeated the hotels name not now connolly thought as she shut her cell phone out in the dining room faust had made his play faust said my father was a relatively old man when he married my mother they met at a type of tango bar we call milangas in buenos aires a scratchy carlos gardel record seductive glances filled with subverted desire invitations to dance made with simple nods the intense courtship begins with toetangling turns and kicks under crystal chandeliers before they speak it seems to my father that theyre making love whats your father got to do with this as a young man my father was a chemist in poland he said my mother reminded him of his first wife a gypsy zumella she died in europe during the war along with million and millions of others if we didnt stop that madman wed all be speaking german he called my mother jolantaviolet blossom he was a sentimental man he met his first wife selling violet blossoms in castle square in warsaw i fail to see what this colonel middleton in all your travels or investigations for the government have you ever heard the name projekt i dont believe i have are you familiar with the work of gerhard schrader middleton shook his head a german chemist who experimented with chemical agents he invented tabun which was originally used to kill insects then adapted as a lethal weapon against mankind the nazis produced twelvethousand tons of the stuff at a secret plant in poland code named hockwerk faust dipped into a briefcase at his feet and removed a photocopy of a document from the nuremberg tribunal my father worked at hockwerk his name is fourth on this list kazimierz rymut youll note the asterisk which refers to the footnote at the bottom it might be hard to read so ill quote it for you this individual has been exculpated due to cooperation he provided regarding experiments conducted on human subjects im not sure i know what that means it means that my father heard that some of the chemical agents he was working onagents that he assumed would be used to kill rats and other rodentswere being used on human beings on october doctor josef mengele removed approximately five thousands gypsies from sachsenhausen concentration camp outside oranienberg and had them trucked into a wooded area near rudna poland there they were sprayed with sarin gas within hours every single man woman and child died isnt that the same material that was used in the subway attack in tokyo by the aum shinrikyo cult yes fausts hand drifted toward his briefcase i have in my possession the official report but will spare you the details suffice it to say the results were ghastly when rumors of this event reached my father im sure he refused to believe them at first he was a man like many who tried to insulate himself from the ugliness of the world around him he listened to vivaldi tinkered with coocoo clocks baked pastries wept at the faces of young children he was not like us colonel and yet when confronted with the horror of what was going on around him he acted middleton said sounds like your father was a hero he became a hero and a great example to me i wont go into all the details of what he did except to say that he found a way to pass details of the chemical weapon program at hockwerk known as projekt to the allies which helped them target the plant before it could cause any more damage thank god the waiter arrived with the bronzini which gave off a faint scent of orange blossom under a delicate brown crust yes thank god faust said as he sampled the fish deeming it delightful the maniacs were stopped but evil men have a way of rediscovering the most horrifying things middleton nodded i do believe that evil is an active force in the world faust leaned closer and almost whispered and you and i are going to stop it how middleton was confused a part of him wanted to believe faust another part was hugely skeptical i still dont understand how this relates to us here tonight because colonel some of the manuscripts that you found hidden in st sophia in the czartoryski collection were not about music this is what your friend henryk jedynak was on the verge of telling you thats why he was killed why because encrypted in the musical notes are formulas for a number of vagentshighly stable nerve agents that were developed at hockwerk many times more lethal that sarin or tabun the most potent of these is known as vx scientists call it the most toxic synthesized compound known to man if this is true its undoubtedly true ill provide the supporting documents faust said i assume youll thoroughly check out the story yourself of course the clock is ticking colonel we dont have much time why i dont think i need to tell you which formula is encrypted into the chopin manuscript vx correct middletons mind worked feverishly tracking back over all that had happened since he first saw the manuscripts in pristina faust tore into a piece of bread vukasin must be stopped the wolf is behind all this he thought of sylvia his ex and charley who was still at risk absolutely his plan is horrifying unimaginably cruel but rugova where did he fit in sometimes one doesnt have the luxury to choose the most favorable allies when i learned about the existence of the manuscripts i hired rugova to help me he wasnt particularly reliable or sympathetic i was i regret to say desperate im even more desperate now vukasin knew he was alone nowalone amid perhaps five police cruisers nine uniformed cops and maybe twice as many in plainclothes who had come to the martha jefferson hospital someone had been smart they had told local law enforcement that middleton the man they believed had killed two policemen at dulles had been spotted at the hospital and would soon return so right now charlotte middletonperez was as protected as anyone inside the beltway she could not be vukasins next victim too bad he thought he would have to draw out middleton in some other way and he would have to do it andrzej his last reliable agent in the states had failed to contact him after trailing the volunteer tesla from the house at lake anna to who knows where vukasin imagined the killer and his shaved head with its ridiculous jack of spades tattoo had been served to pigs in the countryside soberski had failed toogetting her head blown off in the middle of the street a short walk from the white house briefly he wondered what the sadists last utterance had been well vukasin thought as he retreated in the forest behind the hospital with all the work comes all the honor tens of thousands of dead americans and the credit will belong only to me but one last chore the harbor court hotel near the next ground zero was only or so miles north driving with caution hed be there in four hours he smiled at the thought of what would occur after he arrived lisa scottoline charley middletonperez floated in that netherworld between wakefulness and sleep anxiety tugging at the edge of her consciousness like a toddler at the hem of his mothers skirt she knew at some vague level that she was in a hospital room that her husband jack was asleep in the chair beside her and that the doctors had given her meds to help her rest from outside in the hall came the faint rattle of a cart gliding over a polished floor and people talking in low voices she didnt care enough to eavesdrop she remained in the drug cocoon pharmaceutically insulated from her fears unfortunately it was wearing off and no drug could quell these fears not forever so much had happened almost all at once in her minds eye she saw the scenes flicker backward in time a gruesome rewind someone had tried to kill her theyd murdered her mother and she had seen her dead on the floor her lovely features contorted and a blackening pool of blood beneath her head seeping into the grains of the oak floor filling its lines like a grisly etching troubled shifting in the bed she flashed on her father running for his life and her husband jack had risked everything to save them both but there was one life he couldnt save she heard a slight moan and realized that it came from her she was waking up though she wasnt sure she wanted to closer to wakefulness than sleep she felt an emptiness that she realized was literally true she was empty now the baby was gone the baby she had carried for the past five months within her very body she had loved being pregnant every minute of it they had tried for the baby for so long and she couldnt believe when theyd finally gotten pregnant shed memorized baby books and from day one of her pregnancy was mindful that every spoonful she put into her mouth and every sip of every drink she was taking for them both she ate plain yogurt gave up her beloved chocolate fled from secondhand smoke and refused antinausea meds when her morning sickness was its worst her every thought had been to nurture the baby one theyd both wanted so much jack jr she had decided to name him jack jr and jack would have loved the idea now she would never tell him her plan he hadnt wanted to know whether the baby was a boy or a girl so shed kept it from him too though she was bursting with the news surprise me he had said the night she had found out a smile playing around his lips and she had felt so full of love at his uncharacteristic spontaneity that she had thrown her arms around him and given him a really terrific hug at least by pregnancy standards which was from three feet away she shifted on the bed and her eyelids fluttered open she caught a glimpse of light from the windows behind institutionalbeige curtains the brightness told her it was morning though of which day she didnt know before her eyes closed again she spotted jack a sleeping silhouette slumped in a chair his broad shoulders slanted down his head with his sandy hair rumpled had fallen to the side he would have a crook in his neck when he awoke she felt an ache of love for him together with an ache of pain for their loss his son their son a son could continue to redeem a family name tainted by his grandfathers shady dealings he had become one of the most respected lawyers in new orleans if not louisiana and his secret motive was to silence the whispered sniggering behind hands the malicious talk of creole mob connections and worse hed served on several committees to allocate katrina relief funds and his work to help the hurricane victims had gained him some national attention for him a baby son represented a new brighter future ill take one of each charley he said one night as she rested on his chest after they had made love he had been tender with her in bed even more so than usual moving gingerly over her growing tummy neither wanted to do anything to hurt the baby the two of them as spooked as kittens but now there would be no baby no son no redemption only emptiness she blinked then closed her eyes feeling tears well she didnt cry stopping at the edge of emotion afraid to fall into the chasm of fullblown grief the drugs were preventing feelings from reaching her distancing her even from herself she must be having some kind of delayed reaction the night shed miscarried shed been so scared when she heard that she was in danger and harry too that she hadnt had time to react to losing the baby much less to mourn him her eyelids fluttered again and the background noise grew louder she was waking up there was no avoiding it she realized that the talking wasnt in the hall but it was her husbands voice he was saying dont worry shes asleep and should be up in an hour or so she looked over her vision clearing and realized that he hadnt been asleep but on the cell phone which was tucked in his neck okay good luck he said into the phone ill keep you posted jack she asked her voice raspy hey sleepyhead he closed the phone rose and came over to the bed with a warm smile how you feeling fine she didnt feel like telling the truth not now that was your dad checking on you he sat on the bed and stroked her hair back from her forehead good news hes fine hes joined forces with some people he seems to have faith in i gotta believe he knows what hes doing he does she felt relief wash over her a professional her father knew who to trust and who to run from perez leaned over and gave her a soft kiss so all we have to worry about now is you suddenly a burst of laughter came from the open door and they both looked up in time to see a stout nurse in patterned scrubs bustle into the room her hand extended palmup give it here buddy she said to perez her voice was louder than was polite but she was laughing no way he laughed too we had a deal the nurse shot back and without missing a beat she grabbed the cell phone out of his hand your husband works too damn hard she said i told him he cant use his phone in the hospital now im confiscating it perez rose mockfrowning who are you supposed to be nurse ratchett you know your poor husband hasnt eaten since yesterday lunch the nurse said he wont leave your side aww she felt a pang of guilt the nurse couldnt know that jack was guarding her in case the killer came looking for them all the other girls are crushing on him but im impervious to his charms impossible perez said with a smirk she was feeling safer now that it was morning and her father was ok plus the hospital was waking up the hallway increasingly noisy jack she said why dont you go get some breakfast take a break no im fine he dismissed her with a wave but the nurse grabbed his arm go get out i have to check some things on your wife and id throw you out anyway perez said you ok charley yes please go eat something perez nodded then eyed the nurse with amusement gimme my phone ratchett when you come back but i need to make calls go and take a break sir yes sir perez mocksaluted as he left so how are you doing the nurse asked she had a pleasantly fleshy face with animated blue eyes and a freckled nose and she wore her wiry reddish hair back in an unfashionably long ponytail fine i guess she wasnt about to open up about her feelings to someone she hardly knew the nurse tugged over a rolling cart slid out a digital thermometer and replaced its plastic tip open wide she obeyed like a baby bird and the nurse stuck the thermometer into her mouth you slept well and your color looks good i need to check your vitals the thermometer beeped the nurse slid it out read it quickly then replaced it in the cart youre back to normal she said great is that what you have to check out on me no i just said that to give us some alone time the nurse took the blood pressure cuff from a rack on the wall and began wrapping it around her patients upper arm i wanted to see how you were feeling really feeling i mean its tough emotionally i know i missed once myself missed that must be the lingo you will get through this i promise take your time the nurse squeezed the black rubbery bulb and the pressure cuff got tighter and tighter excuse us ladies called a voice from the door a doctor entered and two interns followed like a flying wedge of white coats youre early doc the nurse said her smile fading she let the cuff deflate rapidly our chief weapon is surprise the doctor said and the young interns laughed please no more monty python the nurse rolled her eyes folded up the blood pressure cuff and stuffed it back in the wire rack i cant take any more ha and now for something completely different the doctor approached the bed with a sly smile and the interns laughed again get ready to fakelaugh mrs perez the nurse said as she patted her arm theyre men so theyll buy it she handed over a cell phone oh i almost forgot heres your hubbys phone thanks she said not recognizing it as jacks he must have gotten a new one see ya wouldnt wanna be ya the nurse hustled from the room im dr lehmann and these are my interns but you dont have to know their names think of them as palin and gilliam to my john cleese she fakelaughed and the nurse was right he bought it dr lehmann had a square jaw and long nose and he smelled of fresh cologne his expression was warmuntil it changed well my dear youve been through hell yes we did get some reports back which we need to talk with you about dr lehmann frowned almost sternly a pitchfork folding in the middle of his forehead under steel gray hair like brillo your blood work shows unusual hormone levels consistent with certain medications have you taken anything we should know about she blinked confused no not at all nothing nothing at all i wont even take a baby aspirin really really well dr lehmann frowned at her over the steely top of his glasses i wont mince words to be frank your levels are consistent with someone who has taken ru she didnt understand mifeprex its best administered under medical supervision but unfortunately its commonly selfadministered by women who want to induce miscarriage much later in their pregnancy its commonly known as the abortion pill she couldnt see where he was going okay but what does that have to do with me perhaps you wanted to end your pregnancy me no no way she felt stricken never dr lehmann eyed her plainly doubtful many people who administer the pill themselves in the later trimesters dont realize that its very dangerous and could lead to extreme loss of blood which is what happened in your case you could have bled to death you think i tried to give myself an abortion yes i do you can tell me the truth or not up to you dr lehmann paused as if for a confession is that why i miscarried yes how can you be sure your levels can be explained by only one thing in fact they suggest you took two pills you wouldnt be the first woman to have thought of that either still its very very dangerous no thats not what happened i did not take the pill any pill i never would i wanted this baby im merely telling you what your blood work reveals then its not my blood work theres been a mistake she looked at his lined face then the equally grave faces of the interns there must have been a mistake look mrs perez this is your business i want to emphasize to you that it would be unwise to ever do this again dr lehmanns expression softened no judgment here im concerned only for your safety she tried to function how does it cause an abortion this pill the bottom line is that after the pill is ingested severe cramping occurs and the fetus is expelled when medically unsupervised as in your case it necessitates a d c to be complete dr lehmann checked his watch we must be going grand rounds this morning well check on you later she watched them go in silence after they had left her thoughts tumbled over one another fast and furious she hadnt taken an abortion pill much less two but shed had cramping that night so severe shed doubled over from them the cramps had started sometime after dinner she thought back to that awful night she and jack had had their typical friday night dinner which he routinely cooked as an endoftheweek treat for her hed made chicken with rosemary and mashed potatoes her favorite he even shooed her from the kitchen when shed tried to help and had served it to her at her seat doling out extra mashed potatoes over her protest the memory made her heart stop no she shook her head it didnt make sense it couldnt make sense the blood work had to be wrong any other possibility was unthinkable impossible there had to be a mistake she tried to puzzle it out turning the cell phone over and over in her hand its smooth metallic finish caught the light from the harsh overhead fluorescents and she flipped it open on impulse the tiny multicolored screen showed the menu and on impulse she pressed the button for the call logs on the screen appeared a sharpfocus highlighting of the last call that had been received it should have shown that it was her father but the callers name didnt read dad or even harry instead it read mozart huh why would jack call her father mozart puzzled she flipped through the menu to the address book and skimmed the address list the names were in alphabetical order and she skimmed them bach beethoven brahms chopin handel liszt mahler mendelssohn scarlatti schubert schumann shostakovich sibelius tchaikovsky vivaldi what they were all composers but jack didnt know anything about music her father was the music expert what was going on it looked as if the names were some kind of code on a cell phone she hadnt even known existed what was happening who was mozart had jack heard from harry had he lied about that why would he was harry really okay suddenly she didnt understand anything the miscarriage the abortion pills a secret phone with coded addresses her heart thundered in her chest her mouth went dry she needed answers she pressed the button for mozart thumbed back to the call log and pressed the button for the mozart profile it contained no real name no email and no other information except for the phone number which had too many digits what did that mean then she realized there was a country code in front of the number she didnt know which country it was but she knew it was an international number she pressed the buttons for two more profiles handel and liszt both profiles were international calls too with no other information like real name email or home phones why would jack have a cell phone entirelyand solelyof international numbers hed never even traveled abroad she was the world traveler of the two what about the baby she pushed the button and recalled mozart whoever the hell that was the phone rang three times vukasin answered a man in a thick accent she couldnt identify she pressed end her heart hammering who was vukasin what was going on she couldnt puzzle it out fast enough something was horribly wrong and jack would be back any minute she didnt know what to do confront him then she realized that this vukasin guy could call back and blow her cover there was only one thing to do she hurled the cell phone to the hospital floor with all her might the phones plastic back sprung open and the slim orange battery flew out skidding to the wall in front of the chair just then perez appeared grinning in the doorway honey im home she arranged her face into a wifely mask and turned sheepishly to the door please dont be mad she said willing herself to act natural the nurse gave me your phone but i dropped it damn charley annoyance flickered over his handsome features it was a new one i noticed sorry she eased back into bed watching her husband with new suspicion did you buy one of those insurance contracts for it no he strode to the chair bent down and began picking up the pieces of the cell phone looks like all the kings horses and all the kings men cant put it back together again she finished his sentence with ersatz remorse nah but thats ok he slipped the plastic shards of the phone into his jacket pocket and turned to his wife with a smile she had loved so much it broke her heart did you kill our baby did you try to kill me but she wouldnt ask him anything just yet she had to calculate her next move until she knew more the best course was to keep her mouth shut and her eyes open she wasnt harry middletons daughter for nothing p j parrish kaminski stood at the window staring down at the inner harbor a fog had rolled in and the lights of the buildings blinked back at her like eyes in the dark her head was poundingfrom bonedeep fatigue and the lingering effects of fausts champagne but also from fear she had never really felt fear like this before not when her parents disappeared and she was left on her own not when she had felt the press of the violin string against her neck when the man tried to kill her in rome not even after she found out uncle henryk had been murdered but an hour ago seeing the tattooed man bound in the closet his bald head pouring blood the cold hammering fear began it built as she heard him whimper as faust whispered in his ear as she saw his terrified tears smelled the stench of his urine shivering she now moved away from the window rubbing her hands over her arms she scanned the suites living room its oriental carpets and colonial furnishings a mahogany bar dominated one corner a gleaming baby grand piano the other off to the left through open french doors she could see one of the two bedrooms fausts vuitton duffle sat on the fourposter bed after the trip to the apartment faust had dropped her back at the hotel and without another word locked the door behind him and left the man he called nacho had been told to watch her when he finally dozed off in the chair by the door gun in hand kaminski had thought of running but where would she go faust had taken her passport the one with the joanna phelps name on it and her money she knew no one in this country no that wasnt true she knew of one person harold middleton who taught at the american university in washington dc and whose name was on the package containing the mozart manuscript uncle henryk had sent to signor abe days before he was murdered kaminski shut her eyes abe nowakowskis offer of help echoing in her head she had tried to call him again in rome but the operator told her there was a block on her phone no calls in or out and so she was fausts prisoner and she didnt know why nacho stirred but went back to his snoring kaminski paced slowly across the living room her eyes found the piano in the corner and she went to it she ran a hand over the sleek black surface then slowly lifted the keyboards lid the keys glowed in the soft light suddenly the image of her father was in her head she could almost see his long fingers moving over the keys of the old piano in their home her little hands had tried so hard at her lessons to please him he had been so disappointed when she chose the violin her mothers instrument almost as if she had chosen her mother over him but it had never been like that she had loved her father so much missed him so much and when he died uncle henryk had been there for her to take his place now the tears came kaminski did not stop them she sat down at the piano she played one chord then a quick section from a halfforgotten song the yamaha had an overly bright sound and a toolight action but it didnt matter just hearing the notes was soothing she played a satie gymnopedie then started eine kleine nachtmusik a piece uncle henryk had so loved she stopped suddenly mozart she wiped a hand over her face the mozart manuscript signor abe had given her was this the reason faust had brought her here she glanced over at nacho who watched her with tired eyes she went quickly to fausts bedroom he had said the manuscript was safe locked in a closet she threw open its louvered doors the closet was empty she turned and spotted his slender black briefcase sitting on the bed near the duffle there was nothing in it but an automatic gun with an empty clip nearby and a copy of il denaro she stared at the date four days ago she picked it up and unfolded the paper several yellowed manuscript papers fluttered to the bed where better for a man like faust to hide a priceless mozart manuscript than in plain sight bundled in the financial news she carefully gathered the pages back at la musica when she had first seen the manuscript she hadnt had time to really look at it but now everything registered the black scratchings were unmistakable the fine strokes of faded ink the distinctive signature and finally in the left corner very small no her heart began to beat fast she knew there were only twentyseven catalogued mozart piano concertos many of the originals that had resurfaced after the war were now housed in the jagiellonska library in krakow where had this one come from and was it the reason her uncle was dead she took the manuscript back to the piano she sat down carefully setting the fragile papers before her she began to play the first movement opened with throbbing d minor chords she had to go slowly the technical demands way beyond her skills her heart was pounding with excitement as she grasped that she might be the first in centuries to play this she was sweating by the time she reached the end of the first movement she stopped suddenly my god a cadenza she stared at the notes her father had taught her that mozart himself often injected cadenzasimprovised virtuoso solosinto his music but he never wrote them down modern performers usually filled the gaps with their own improvisations that tried to mimic the masters intent she began to play the cadenza but her ears began to pick up strange discordant sounds odd little dissonances and patterns she could suddenly hear her fathers voice speaking to her from behind as she practiced with mozart my dear with music so pure the slightest error stands out as an unmistakable blemish kaminski stopped her fingers poised over the keys there was something very strange about this cadenza the restaurant was almost empty two waiters stood at discreet attention just beyond a red curtain middleton could see from their faces they wanted to go home yet faust seemed in no hurry to go anywhere so you never suspected anything about the chopin faust asked middleton wasnt sure how much to tell him he still didnt trust the man he thought suddenly about his interrupted ride to baltimore with the two dopers traci and marcus how he had made them listen to a schoenberg recitatif and marcuss crack that it sounded like nothing but wrong notes all the easier to hid a message in he had told marcus how hard could it be then to encrypt a code within the mathematical beauty of chopin as soon as i saw it i felt something was wrong with it middleton said but i just chalked it up to a bad forgery jedynak didnt say anything faust asked middleton shook his head when we were going over all the manuscripts he seemed very interested in the chopin in particular he insisted i take it back to the states for authentication even though i told him i was sure it was a fake maybe he was trying to get it safely out of the country maybe he was trying to keep it out of the wrong hands jedynak knew the vx formula was encrypted in it faust shrugged middleton sat back in his chair so i was supposed to be some fuckin mule faust said nothing which angered middleton even more can i see it faust asked when middleton didnt move faust gave him a sad smile i told you i am desperate i need your help middleton reached down to the briefcase at his feet and pulled out the manuscript he handed it to faust across the table faust looked at it for a moment then his dark eyes came back up to middleton i know chemistry you know music he pushed it across the table tell me what you see middleton hesitated then turned the manuscript so he could read it the paper and ink alone were enough for him to offer jedynak his initial opinion that it was probably a forgery a good one yes but still a forgery but now he concentrated on the notes themselves he took his time the quiet bustle of the waiters clearing the cutlery and linen fell away he was lost in the music he looked up suddenly theres something missing he said what do you mean faust asked middleton shook his head its probably nothing this is after all just a forgery but the end of the first movementa piece of it is missing but youre not sure faust asked i wish i had you wish you had another expert eye yes middleton said i have one for you faust said come lets go but we go alone not with any visitors who else would go with us faust smiled and glanced toward the front of the restaurant where tesla and lespasse awaited alone that is one of the immutable terms of the deal ill follow your lead faust reached forward and tugged on middletons tiny wire microphone earbud unit he dropped it on the floor and crushed it he then paid the bill wait here he made a phone call from the pay phone near the mens room then returned to the table no more than five minutes later sirens sounded in the distance growing closer the attention of everyone in the restaurant turned immediately to the front windows then in a flurry of lights and horns police cars and emergency trucks skidded to a stop across the quaint street from the restaurant in front of a bar the bomb squad was the centerpiece of the operation middleton had to give faust credit not a single person in the restaurant or outside was focused anywhere but on the police action theyd discover soon enough it was a false alarm but the distraction would serve its purpose middleton slipped the chopin manuscript back into his briefcase and rose to his feet faust gestured to the kitchen through the back hurry time is short this was where felicia kaminski was m t connolly thought and it was where middleton and faust would continue their rendezvous connolly now knew what middleton had that so many people had deemed valuable enough to kill for a seemingly priceless manuscript created for pleasure but now corrupted with the possibility of mass murder even sitting alone outside this hotel in the dark privacy of her own thoughts she was a little ashamed to admit she was ignorant of the strange history of this chopin score and of the human value of such a find more so until tonight she had been as unaware as most americans about the tragedies at st sophia but she did understand a monsters need for glory no matter how twisted and unimaginable it might be to a sane person and it was an interesting side note to the events of the last few days her colleagues in law enforcement were looking for middleton because they believed he killed two cops but thanks to josef her angel in poland she knew better middleton had in his hands a formula for mass destruction and though he had formed an alliance with kalmbach and chambers she believed he needed her help to keep it away from vukasin kalmbach and chambers she did not trust in the core of her being she believed the only way to stop a chemical attack within the borders of the united states was to keep harold middleton alive she took a quick look along the street and checked her watch there was no sense in going inside the hotel until middleton and faust arrivedbecause it was only then that vukasin would appear she had left her previous post inside the restaurant only seconds before middleton and faust sure they would come here to confer with kaminski who could help them solve their puzzle now the street was asleep and silent few lights reflecting life except in the windows of the harbor court hotel a white bmw sat under a flickering streetlamp parked where it could easily be seen about feet to the south tucked into the shade of an old oak was a charcoal sedan its hood glittering with raindrops its side windows fogged connollys vukasin was hidden in the generous gray shadows of a nearby building watching her he would not move until she did nine minutes later he was rewarded for his patience an almost undetectable shift of the undercarriage told him she had readjusted to a more comfortable position he was certain she had been in the sedans quiet and security for too long though he rather it had been middleton or faust behind the wheel or even kaminski it mattered little who was in the car it could be an innocent soul waiting for a lover or a fool sleeping off the last taste of cheap whiskey a minor distraction at best but one that had to be dealt with he could not afford to be seen vukasin slipped from his invisibility and made his way toward the sedan he added a stagger to his walk and a slump to his shoulders to simulate the last journey of a drunks long night the sedan jostled again as vukasin neared it the occupant coming to life he could not see inside as he passed but he heard the faint creak of wet glass moving as the occupant cracked the window a sliver to see who was passing he decided to play he ambled back to the sedan arms spread good evening kind sir could you spare a few dollars and direct me to the nearest bus line go away connolly said her thoughts on middleton and the manuscript vukasin moved closer i am harmless i assure you he said get the fuck out of here go the window slipped lower exposing a pale feminine face her hair brassy and closecropped im a cop she said now get moving so maybe youd like a drink he asked as he reached into his pocket i have a bottle of russkaya he saw something begin to crystallize in her eyes as he started to withdraw the automatic she knows he thought with a smile she knows im not american and not a drunk just passing by her eyes widened in complete understanding she knew who he was and when she saw the metallic glint of the glock leveled at her head she knew she was about to die he fired the silenced shot sounding like no more than a small but powerful puff of hot air on the empty street lee child they used the harbor courts main street door faust led the way to it and pulled it and let middleton walk through first good manners etiquette and a clear semaphore signal to the hotels frontofhouse staff im a guest and this guy is with me a literal embrace one hand holding the door and the other shepherding middleton inside a commonplace dynamic repeated at the hotels entrance a thousand times a day the staff looked up understood glanced away vukasin didnt glance away from yards his gaze followed both men to the elevator bank the elevator was smooth but slow tuned for a lowrise building faust got out first because middleton wouldnt know which way to turn faust held his arms at a right angle like a traffic cop blocking right pointing left middleton walked ahead thick carpet quiet air the muffled sound of a piano a bright tone and a fast light action a yamaha or a kawai middleton thought a grand but not a european heavyweight a japanese baby crossstrung light in the bass tinkly in the treble a dminor obbligato was being played confidently with the left hand and a hesitant melody was being played with the right in the style of mozart but not mozart middleton thought certainly no mozart he had ever heard before sightread which might explain the hesitancy perhaps a pastiche or an academic illustration to demonstrate the standard musicological theory that mozart bridged the gap between the classical composers and the romantics the melody seemed to be saying see we start with bach and years later we get to beethoven the sound got louder but no clearer as they walked faust eased ahead and repeated his trafficcop routine outside a door blocking the corridor corralling middleton to a stop faust took a key card from his pocket it bottomed in the slot a red light turned green and the mechanism clicked faust said after you middleton turned the handle before the light clicked red again bright piano sound washed out at him the melody again started over from the top played this time with confidence its architecture now fully diagrammed its structure understood but still not mozart middleton stepped inside and saw a suite luxurious but not traditional a lean bearded man in a chair by the door with a gun in his hand his nickname it turned out was nacho a yamaha baby grand with a girl at the keyboard manuscript pages laid out lefttoright in front of her on the pianos lid the girl was thin she had dark hair and a pinched eastern european face full of a thousand sorrows the manuscript looked to be a handwritten original old foxed paper untidy notations faded ink the girl stopped playing middletons mind filled in what would come next automatically to the end of the phrase faust stepped in behind middleton and closed the door the room went quiet faust ignored the man in the chair he walked straight to the piano and gathered the manuscript pages and butted them together and left them in a tidy pile on a credenza then he stepped back and closed the lid on the pianos keyboard gently giving the girl time to remove her fingers he said time for business we have a chopin manuscript forged and faked middleton said indeed faust said and missing a page i think would you agree middleton nodded the end of the first movement possibly not a whole page maybe just sixteen bars or less how many notes thats an impossible question its a concerto a dozen instruments sixteen bars there could be hundreds of notes the solo instrument faust said the theme ignore the rest how many notes middleton shrugged forty maybe a statement a restatement a resolution but its still an impossible question it isnt chopin its somebody pretending to be chopin faust said i think that helps us we have to secondguess a secondguesser its about whats plausible we cant compose the end of something that didnt exist in the first place faust opened his jacket and took a folded glassine envelope from the inside pocket unfolded it and smoothed it behind the milky acetate was a single sheet of paper it had been torn out of a reporters note pad it was speckled with dried brown bloodstains small droplets not arterial spray just the kind of spatter that comes from small knife wounds or heavy blows to a face under the stains the paper had been ruled by hand into music staves five lines four spaces repeated four times a treble clef egbdf every good boy deserves favor a time signature sixteen measures a melody sketched in with deft untidy strokes of a pen faust laid the page in front of the girl on the pianos lid where the mozart had been he said suppose someone who had seen the missing page was asked to reproduce what had been there the girl looked at the spatters of blood and said asked faust said required then the girl said my uncle wrote this you can tell its handwritten handwriting is handwriting whether its words or musical notes middleton said your uncle faust said this is felicia kaminski temporarily going as joanna phelps but shes henryk jedynaks niece or she was then he pointed at middleton and addressed the girl and said and this is colonel harold middleton he saw your uncle in warsaw your uncle was a brave man he stole a page he knew what was at stake but he didnt get away with it who did this to him well get to that first we need to know if he put the truth on paper faust took out the rest of the firstmovement manuscript and handed it to the girl she spread it out in sequence she followed the melody with her finger humming silently she raised the pianos lid again and picked out phrases on the keys haltingly she jumped to the bloodstained page and continued middleton nodded to himself he heard continuity logic sense until the last measure the last measure was where the movement should have come home to rest with a whole note that settled back to the root of the native key with calm and implacable inevitability but it didnt instead it hung suspended in midair with an absurd discordant trill sixteenth notes battling it out through the whole of the bar a dense black mess on the page a harsh beating pulse in the room the girl said the last bar cant be right faust said apparently the girl played the trill again faster said ok now i see see what the two notes are discordant play them fast enough and the intermodulation between them implies a third note that isnt actually there but you can kind of hear it and its the right note it would be very obvious on a violin middleton said chopin didnt write like that the girl said i know faust asked whats the implied note the girl played the trill for half a bar and then stabbed a key in between and a pure tone rang out sweet and correct and reassuring she said two notes faust said sounds like one to me the last note of this movement and the first of the next thats chopin who did this to my uncle faust didnt answer because right then the door opened and vukasin walked in he had a silenced glock held down by his thigh and from six feet away middleton could smell that it had been used and recently faust said were all here he made the formal introductions one to the other vukasin middleton nacho kaminski he let his gaze rest on kaminski and said colonel middleton killed your uncle he tortured that page out of him and then cut his throat in warsaw after their lunch not true middleton said true vukasin said i saw him leave i went in and found the body three bodies two bystanders got in the way apparently faust stepped aside as nacho took middletons arms and pinned him vukasin raised the silenced glock and pointed it at middletons face then vukasin lowered the gun again and reversed it in his hand and offered it buttfirst to the girl said your uncle your job if you want it the girl got up off the piano stool and stepped around the end of the keyboard and came forward took the gun from vukasin who said its ready to go no safety on a glock just point and shoot like a cheap camera there wont be much noise then he stood off to her left she raised the gun and aimed it where he had aimed it at the bridge of middletons nose the muzzle wavered a little in small jerky circles with the sound suppressor it was a long and heavy weapon middleton said theyre lying the girl nodded i know she said she turned to her left twisting from the waist and shot vukasin in the face he had been right there wasnt much noise just a bang like a heavy book being slammed on a table and a wet crunch as the bullet hit home and the soft tumble of a body falling on thick carpet then nothing just the stink of gunpowder and pooling blood the girl twisted back and lined up on faust middleton understands music she said i can see that from here he wouldnt need to torture that melody out of anyone it was predictable like night follows day faust said i didnt know the two discordant notes the girl said making a phantom third my uncle always called it a wolf tone and vukasin means wolf in polish it was a coded message he was naming his killer i didnt know faust said again i swear talk i hired vukasin someone else must have gotten to him hired him out from under me he was double crossing me who i dont know i swear and we cant waste time on this the music holds more code than who killed your uncle hes right felicia middleton said first things first its about nerve gas it could make look like a day at the beach and its coming soon faust said kaminski nodded days away she said she lowered the gun forty notes faust said forty letters between a and g its not enough add in the mozart cadenza kaminski said thats bullshit too middleton said mozart didnt write cadenzas kaminski nodded exactly he didnt write twentyeight piano concertos either the cadenza is part of the message same board same game faust asked which first mozart he was before chopin then how many notes the two things together a couple hundred in total maybe still not enough and you cant spell stuff out using only a through g especially not in german there are sharps and flats the mozart is in dminor you cant sharpen and flatten letters of the alphabet numbers middleton said its not letters of the alphabet its numbers one for a two for b thats still not enough this thing is complex not one for a middleton said concert pitch the a above middle c is cycles per second each note has a specific frequency sharps and flats equally a couple hundred notes would yield eightythousand digits like a bar code eightythousand digits would yield all the information you want faust asked how do we work it out with a calculator middleton said on the treble stave the second space up is the a above middle c thats cycles an octave higher is the first overtone or the second harmonic cycles an octave lower is cycles we can work out the intervals in between well probably get a bunch of decimal places which is even better the more digits the more information faust nodded nothing in his face he retrieved the mozart manuscript from the credenza and butted it together with the smeared page in the glassine envelope clamped the stack under his arm and nodded to nacho then he looked at kaminski and middleton and suddenly leapt forward ripping the silenced glock from her hand he said i wasnt entirely honest before i didnt hire vukasin we were both hired by someone else for the same purpose which isnt entirely benevolent im afraid we have ricin and everything else we need but we couldnt stabilize the mixture now we can thanks to your keen insights for which we thank you well express our thanks practicallywith mercy exactly ten minutes from now when im safely away nacho will shoot you both in the head fast and painless i promise the gun in nachos hand came up and rested level steady as a rock he was back in his chair solidly between middleton and the door kaminski gasped and caught middletons arm faust smiled once and his blue eyes twinkled and he let himself out ten minutes a long time or a short time depending on the circumstances ten minutes in a line at the post office seems like an eternity the last minutes of your life seems like a blink of an eye nacho didnt move a muscle he was like a statue except that the muzzle of his gun moved to track every millimetric move that middleton or kaminski made and except that about once every seconds he glanced at his watch he took his final look at the time and raised his gun a little higher head height not gut height his finger whitened on the trigger then the door opened jack perez stepped into the room nacho turned toward him said what perez raised his gun and shot nacho in the face no silencer the noise was catastrophic they left by the fire stairs in a big hurry ten minutes later they were in an inner harbor diner and perez was saying so basically you told him everything kaminski nodded her head very ruefully and said yes middleton shook his head very definitively and said no so which is it perez said yes or no no middleton said but only inadvertently i made a couple of mistakes i guess i wasnt thinking too straight what mistakes concert pitch is a fairly recent convention like international time zones the idea that the a above middle c should be tuned to cycles started way after both mozart and chopin were around back in the day the tunings across europe varied a lot and not just from country to country or time to time pitch could vary even within the same city the pitch used for an english cathedral organ in the s could be as much as five semitones lower than the harpsichord in the bishops house next door the variations could be huge theres a pitch pipe from that plays the a above middle c at cycles and bachs organs in germany played a at cycles the a on the pitch pipe would have been an f on the organs weve got a couple of handels tuning forks too one plays a at cycles and the other at perez said so so fausts calculations will most likely come out meaningless unless unless he figures out a valid base number for a which would be what would be my guess plausible for the period and the clue is right there in the mozart the th piano concerto which he never got to the message was hidden in the cadenza if the wasnt supposed to mean something in itself they could have written a bogus cadenza into any of the first twentyseven real concertos faust will figure that out when all else fails hes got the mozart manuscript even so middleton said he turned to kaminski your uncle would have been ashamed of me i didnt account for the tempering he would have he was a great piano tuner perez asked what the hell is tempering middleton said music isnt math if you start with a at cycles and move upward at intervals that the math tells you are correct youll be out of tune within an octave you have to nudge and fudge along the way by ear you have to do what your ear tells you is right even if the numbers say youre wrong bach understood thats what the welltempered klavier is all about he had his own scheme his original title page had a handwritten drawing on it it was assumed for centuries that it was just decoration a doodle really but now people think it was a diagram about how to temper a keyboard so it sounds perfect perez took out a pen and did a rapid calculation on a napkin so what are you saying if a is b isnt not exactly no so what is it maybe who would know a piano tuner a piano tuner would feel it he wouldnt know it so how did these nazi chemists encode it with a welltuned piano and a microphone and an oscilloscope is that the only way not now now its much easier you could head down to radio shack and buy a digital keyboard and a midi interface you could tune the keyboard down to a equals and play scales and read the numbers right off the led window perez nodded and sat back and smiled jeffery deaver no leads emmett kalmbach and dick chambers were supervising the search of the suite at the harbor court which had been rented by faust under a fake name naturally middleton reflected sourly cell phone at his ear the man was a master of covering his tracks nothing he asked shaking his head to felicia kaminski and jack perez who sat across from him in the diner nope weve gone over the entire place kalmbach said and searched vukasins body and some bastard with a weird tattoo name is stefan andrzej oh and that mexican your soninlaw took out but not a goddamn clue where faust mightve gone the binoculars felicia told us about kaminski had explained about nachos game of ispy out the window and the bits of conversation that had to do with deliveries and technical information they were focused on a warehouse across the street but it was empty so hes taken the chemicals someplace else and we dont have a fucking clue where the fbi agent muttered well keep looking ill get back to you harry the line went dead no luck middleton muttered he sipped coffee and finished a candy bar he told himself it was for the energy in fact he mostly needed the comfort of the chocolate at least i gave faust the wrong information about the code in the music he can only get so far with the gas but with trial and error kaminski asked he could he come up with the right formula yeah he could and a lot of peoplell dieand the deathsd be real unpleasant they sat silently for a moment then he glanced at perez you looked pretty comfortable with that beretta as he had with the colt when he took down eleana soberski his son in law laughed i stayed clear of the family business in loseiana but that doesnt mean i wasnt aware of the family business a coy smile but you know that right middleton shrugged i ran a check on you sure you were marrying my daughter if thered been a spec of dirt in your closet charley wouldnt have a hyphenated name right now i respect looking out for kin harry ill be the same way with my his voice faded and he looked down thinking of course of the child theyd almost had middleton touched his arm squeezed kaminski asked my uncle knew you as a musicologist uno professore but you are much more than that arent you yes well i was i worked for the army and the government then i had a group that tracked down war criminals like the man who killed my uncle yes you said had what happened the group broke up why perez asked middleton decided to share the story with them there was an incident in africa the four of us tracked down a warlord in darfur hed been stealing aids drugs from the locals and selling children as soldiers we did an extraordinary renditionlured him to international waters and were going to fly him back to the hague for trial then our main witnesses against him all died quote accidentally in a fire they were in a safe house the doors were locked and it burned most of them had their families with them twenty children died without the witnesses there was no trial we had to let him go i was going to head back to darfur and make a case against him for the fire but valvalentin broccolost it he heard the man smirking about how hed beaten us val pulled him out back and shot him in the head i couldnt keep going after that i disbanded the group youve got to play by the rules if you dont their side wins were no better than they are it looks like it bothered you very much kaminski said they were my friends it was hard and one of them was much more than just a friend but this was part of the story middleton didnt share his phone beeped he glanced at the screen and read the lengthy sms message speak of the devil its lespasse and nora he explained this is interesting they talked to one of our old contacts he found out that machinery that could be used to make a bioweapon delivery systems was shipped to a factory in downtown baltimore yesterday he looked up ive got an address i think ill go check it out he said to perez you take felicia someplace safe and the man shook his head im going with you its not your fight jack these are terrorists its everybodys fight im with you you sure about that youre not going anywhere without me middleton gave him an affectionate nod he then subtly pulled his service glock from his waistband and holding the gun under the table checked the ammunition im short a few rounds let me see your beretta perez slipped him the weapon out of sight middleton looked over the clip youve got twelve and one in the hole im going to borrow three or four ah you dont have to pay me back his soninlaw said grimfaced then smiled give em to faust instead middleton laughed they left the diner and walked kaminski to a hotel up the street middleton gave her some money and told her to check in and stay out of sight until they called i want to go she protested no felicia my uncles dead because of this man he smiled at her this isnt your line of work leave it to the experts reluctantly she nodded and turned toward the hotel lobby middleton climbed into the drivers seat of perezs car and together the men sped over streets that grew progressively rougher as cobblestones showed through the worn asphalt he said the delivery was to four thirty eight west ellicott street its about a mile from here middleton then glanced to his right perez was shaking his head smiling the fatherinlaw squinted in curiosity what funny you and your friends who lespasse and nora yeah what about them the voice was now sharp with sarcasm supposed to be so fuckin good at your job and here you are chasing down a bum lead whatre you talking about the beretta appeared fast middleton flinched as he felt the muzzle against his neck his soninlaw took the glock tossed it in the back along with middletons cell phone then he undid his fatherinlaws seatbelt but kept his own hooked whats going on middleton gasped the gas delivery system was shipped to virginia not baltimore we drove it up whatevers on ellicott street it doesnt have anything to do with us us middleton whispered youre with them jack fraid so dad turn right here head to the waterfront but the black automatic prodding middletons ear now he did as he was told following directions to a deserted pier lined with old warehouses perez ordered him to stop the pistol never wavering he directed middleton out of the car and pushed him through an old doorway faust glanced up as if they were guests right on time for a party in overalls wearing thick gloves he was standing at a cluttered worktable littered with tools tubing and electronic or computer parts a pallet of gas tanks was nearby there were or so of them dangerbiohazard was printed on them in six languages faust gave a fast appraisal of middleton search him i already search him perez patted him down clean middleton shook his head i dont get it jack shot nacho faust grimaced we had to sacrifice the greasy little prickso youd believe mr perez here and give us the real musical code i doubted youd be honest with me back there he wasnt perez confirmed he claimed he wasnt thinking clearly but im sure he was lying he told me how it works he explained what middleton had said about adjusting the pitch of a and using a simple electronic tuning device to decode the formula faust was nodding hadnt considered that of course middleton said so jack coming to our rescue in the harbor court was all part of the plan pretty much what the hell is going on im just a businessman colonel the world of terrorism is different now too many watch lists too much surveillance too many computers you have to outsource ive been hired by people who are patriots idealists protecting their culture is that how you describe ethnic cleansing faust frowned protecting them from impurity is how they describe it you meddled in their country youll pay for that a hundred thousand people will pay and you jack middleton snapped the young man gave a grim laugh i have my own ideals but theyve got commas and a decimal point im making ten million to keep an eye on you and help them out yeah i went to law school and gave up the family business and it was the worst mistake of my life going legit bullshit he gazed at his fatherinlaw contemptuously look at you mr harry middleton the star of military intel the musical genius faust led you all over the world like he had you on a leash jack we dont have time faust said ill try the adjustment to the formula if it works and we dont need him anymore you can take care of him middleton said jack youre willing to kill so many people ill donate some of the ten million to a relief fund a grin or not then he stopped talking cocked his head faust was looking up too helicopter the younger man muttered but faust spat out no its two wait three faust ran to the window its a trap police soldiers he glared at jack you led them here no i did what we agreed middleton could hear diesels of jeeps and personnel carriers in the distance closing in fast spotlights shone from on high faust slapped his hand on a button on the wall the warehouse was plunged into darkness middleton lunged for faust but saw the mans vague form run to a corner of the warehouse open a trap door and vanish a few seconds later a powerboat engine started up hell middleton thought he swept the light switch on he ran to the trap door tried it but faust had locked it from below sweating frantic perez pointed his gun at middleton harry dont move youre my ticket out of here middleton ignored him and started for the front door of the warehouse harry perez aimed at middletons head im not telling you again their eyes met perez pulled the trigger click middleton pulled a handful of bullets from his pocket he displayed them when pretending to take just three or four bullets from the clip in the diner hed taken them alland the one in the chamber too his eyes bored into the younger mans that text message i got earlier it wasnt from nora and lespasse it was from charley green lantern its our code for an emergency and she textmessaged me who i was in danger from you jack i knew youd lead me to faust so i textmessaged lespasse and nora and told them to follow me from the diner middleton leapt forward and slammed his fist into perezs jaw then easily twisted the automatic away he dropped a round into the chamber locked the slide aimed at his soninlaw harry you dont understand i was just faking playing along to find out who was involved im a patriot no youre a traitor who was willing to murder a hundred thousand citizens his eyelids lowered a hundred thousand and one one my grandchild charley told me what you did how could you do something like that how perezs shoulders slumped he looked down and gave up all pretense of lying a baby didnt fit my new lifestyle and charley didnt either did she so after losing the baby my daughter was what going to kill herself in despair he didnt answer he didnt need to middleton grabbed him by the collar forced the trembling man on his knees touched his forehead with the muzzle he felt the pressure closing on his index finger this man killed your grandchild was going to kill your daughter were in the middle of a takedown he attacked you nobodyll care if you take him out now do it before anybody comes in perez squinted sealing his miserable eyes please harry please green shirt green shirt green shirt middleton lowered the gun he shoved perez to his belly on the floor the door burst open a dozen soldiers and men in fbi jackets filed into the room the agents cuffed perez as a bioweapon containment unit looking like astronauts in their protective gear headed straight to the gas tanks and equipment on the worktable sweeping them with sensors after a few minutes one of them announced nothings been mixed yet theres no danger a grizzled man in a uniform with majors stripes strode into the room major stanley jenkinss face was grim oh no middleton deduced what the man had just learned colonel sorry he got away middleton sighed well at least theyd secured the nerve gas the city was safe and faust would be the subject of one of the most massive manhunts in us history theyd find him middleton would make sure of that a half hour later jack perez was in detention and middleton was outside with tesla lespasse and jenkinshis former colleague from the army a car pulled up unmarked did the feds think people didnt recognize wheels like that it might as well have had we serve and protect in bold type on the side two men climbed out one was dick chambers the homeland security man and the other fbi assistant director kalmbach emmett colonel i chambers interrupted i dont know what to say harry your country owes you a huge debt you saved thousands of lives middleton hoped kalmbach was used to being snubbed after stumbling and letting vukasin and his boys into the country chambers was going to milk the win for everything he could he added we have to debrief you now wed like no middleton said firmly now i have to go see my daughter but colonel i have to talk to the director and the white house but all that chambers was talking to at the moment was harry middletons back she would be fine physically at least the mental battering from losing her child and the betrayal of her husband was taking its toll though and middleton had whisked her away to the lake house they spent a lot of time in front of the tv watching the news as hed predicted dick chambers and other officials from homeland security took most of the credit for stopping the nervegas attack and finding the terrorists whod slipped into the countryowing to extremely welldone forged papers he pointedly added the fbi got credited in a footnote harry middleton was mentioned not at all which was of course how this game worked the postmortem of the case suggested that faust was in charge of the plot to seek revenge against america for the peacekeeping operation rugova worked for him but got tired of prison and was going to bribe his way out with loot stolen to support the terrorists thats why he was eliminated by vukasin stefan andrzej the tattooed man whod killed val brocco was probably a traitor and murdered for that reasonand for his incompetence the hunt for faust was continuing at a fervid pace and several leads were beginning to pan out he still had some unaccountedfor muscle in the country and records from the prepaid mobile that perez had called frequently presumably fausts showed that he made repeated calls to pay phones in a particular area of dc where his cohorts apparently lived stakeouts and electronic surveillance were immediately put in place but middleton was at least for the moment not part of the hunt he was more interested in his daughters recovery and in reconnecting with nora tesla and jeanmarc lespasse hed invited them to the lake house for a few days he wasnt sure that theyd show up but they had his daughter seemed to have forgiven tesla for what shed thought was the breakup of her mother and fatherthough she also had clearly come to understand that the divorce was inevitable long before nora tesla entered the picture but the other issues loomed and at first the conversations among them had been superficial the subject of the past finally arose as it often does and they broached the subject of the darfur warlord killed by brocco and the breaking up of the volunteers because of the incident there was no concession by anybody and no apologies but neither was there any defense and through the miracles of the passage of timeand friendship arising from common purposethe incident was at last put to rest tesla and middleton spent some time together talking much about things of little significance they took a long walk and ended up on a promontory overlooking a neighboring lake a family of deer sprung from the underbrush and galloped away startled she grabbed his handand this time didnt remove it not long after the nerve gas was found middleton got a phone call abe nowakowskipresently under arrest in romehad cut a deal with us polish and italian prosecutors in exchange for a reduced sentence he would give up something something extraordinary as it turned out overnight a package arrived at middletons lake house he opened it and spent the next two days in his study holy shit was his official pronouncement and the first person he told wasnt his daughter nora tesla or jm lespasse but felicia kaminski who came to his house in person in reaction to the news he displayed what sat on the steinway in his study and its not fake no middleton whispered this is real theres no doubt in payment for his services to faust nowakowski had been the recipient of what middleton had now authenticated a true chopin manuscript previously unheard of apparently part of the trove unearthed by rugova at st sophia church it was an untitled sonata for piano and chamber orchestra an astonishing find for lovers of music everywhere also middleton was amused to learn that homeland security officials had leapt on the news and further brushing up the feds image after their nerve gas victory had pushed for a gala world premiere of the piece at the james madison recital hall in washington dc middleton called dick chambers personally and insisted that felicia kaminski be the principal soloist he agreed without hesitation saying i owe you harry violin was her main instrument of course but as she joked in her lightly accented english i know my way around the ivories too middleton laughed she grew serious then and added its an honor a musician only dreams of she hugged him and i will dedicate my performance to the memory of my uncle nora tesla lespasse and charlotte would attend as would much of washingtons cultural and political elite several days before the concert charley middleton found her father in the lake house study late at night hey dad whatre you up to dad been years since shed used that word it sounded odd just looking over the chopin how are you doing honey getting better step by step she sat down beside him he kissed her head she took a sip of his wine tasty what he used to say to her after sampling her milk at the breakfast table long long ago to get her to drink the beverage its amazing isnt it she asked looking over the manuscript to think that frederic chopin actually held these sheets and look there that scribble was he testing the pen was he distracted by something was it the start of a note to himself her eyes were gazing out the window at the black sheet that was the still lake she was crying softly she whispered does it ever get better sure it does your lifell get back on track again and harold middleton thought yes it gets better always does but the sorrow and horror never go away completely green shirt green shirt and a sudden thought came to harry middleton he wondered if hed used broccos murder of the darfur warlord as an excuseto back away from the fight that he used to believe he was born for he couldnt save everybody so hed stopped trying to save anyone and retreated into the world of music im going to bed love you dad night baby when she was gone middleton sipped his wine and examined the chopin again thinking of a curious irony here was a work of art written at a time when music was created largely for the glory of god and yet this piece he was looking at was part of a horrific plot to murder thousands solely out of vengeful religious fervor sometimes the world was simply mad harry middleton concluded jeffery deaver the men finished the work at midnight im exhausted are we through the language was serbocroatian the second man was tired too but he said nothing and looked uneasily at the third his face dark his black hair long and swept back the man whod been supervising their handiworkfausttold them in a soft voice that yes it was all right to leave he spoke in english once they were gone he walked through the basement using a flashlight to inspect what theyd spent the last four hours doing running twoinch hoseit was astonishingly heavy whod have thoughtthrough access tunnels from three buildings away painstakingly using silent hand pumps theyd filled rubber bladders with gasoline a total of close to gallons of the liquid next they placed propane tanks and detonators between the bladders and most difficult of all rigged the electronics alone now in the basement of the james madison recital hall faust ran final diagnostic checks on the system everything was in order he allowed himself a fantasy of what would happen later this evening during the adagio movement at the world premier of the newly discovered chopin sonata a unique combination of notes would slip from the microphone above the soloists piano and be electronically translated into numerical values these would be recognized by the computer controller as a command to small motors that would open the propane tanks then a few minutes later when the score moved into the vivace movement another combination of notes would trigger the detonators the propane would flare melt the bladders and turn the recital hall instantly into a crematorium this elaborate system was necessary because radio microwave and cell phone jammers were in use in securityminded public venues in dc remote control devices were useless and timing devices could be picked up in sweeps by supersensitive microphones ironically felicia kaminski herself would be the detonator now faust hid the bladders tanks and wires behind boxes he was satisfied with the plan middleton and the government had taken the bait nowakowski offered them the manuscript and it was clear they believed the entire charade all false information faust had fed to jack perez and felicia kaminskithe code in the first manuscript pages the nervegas attack the binoculars at the harbor court focused on a warehouse the mysterious talk about deliveries and chemical formulas the torture of the tattooed man in the closet his enemys defenses were down he thought of an apt metaphor they believed the concert was over they never suspected hed arranged a spectacular unexpected crescendo faust now slipped out of the basement troubled as he pictured felicia kaminski dying in the conflagration he wasnt concerned about the young women herself of course he was troubled that if she used the original score to perform from the manuscript would be destroyed after all it was easily worth millions of dollars the crowds began assembling outside early the queue stretching well past a construction site next door to the james madison hall many were people without tickets hoping for scalpers but this was a worldpremiere of chopin not preseason redskins so there were no tickets to be had harold middleton made a brief backstage visit to kaminski wished her well and then joined his guests in the lobby leonora tesla jm lespasse and his daughter charley he said hello to some of the music professors from georgetown and george mason and a few of the defense department and doj folks from his past life emmett kalmbach came by and shook his hand wheres dick he asked middleton gave a laugh and pointed across the hall to the head of homeland security gave his ticket to his boss the fbi man said at least i appreciate culture you ever heard chopin before emmett sure whatd he write that thing thing you know the famous one middleton smiled as kalmbach changed the subject the lobby lights dimmed and they entered the auditorium found their seats harry relax middleton heard his daughter say you look like youre the one performing he smiled noting how she referred to him the lack of endearment didnt upset him one bit it was a sign she was recovering but as for relaxing well that wasnt going to happen this was going to be a momentous evening he was bursting with excitement the conductor walked out on stage to wild applause he then lifted his arm to the right and nineteenyearold felicia kaminski in a fluid black dress strode out on stage looking confident as a pro she smiled bowed and stole a glance at harold middleton he believed she winked she sat down at the keyboard the conductor took his place at the stand he lifted his baton dick something interesting here chambers was in his office at the department of homeland security working late he was thinking about the concert and wondering if his boss was appreciative hed been given the ticket he looked up might want to talk to this guy his straightarrow aide said the caller was a restaurant worker near the james madison recital hall as he was leaving work early that morning he explained hed seen a man leave through the halls side door hed gotten into a car near the site thinking it seemed suspiciousthe hall had been closed all dayhe took a picture of the car and the license plate with his cell phone he meant to call the police earlier but had forgotten about it hed just now called dc police and was referred to homeland security since the concert would be attended by some highranking government officials nowadays the restaurant worker said you never knowterrorists and everything chambers said we better follow up on this where are you hed just gotten off work the man explained he gave the address of the restaurant it was now closed so chambers told him to wait in a park near the place hed have agents there soon and thank you sir its citizens like you that make this country what it is on stage at the recital hall felicia kaminski was playing as shed never played in her life she was motivated not by the fact that this was her first appearance as a soloist at a world premiere but because of the music itself it was intoxicating musicians grow familiar with the pieces in their repertoire the same way husbands and wives grow comfortably close over the years but theres something about meeting then performing a new work thats like the beginning of a love affair passionate exhilarating utterly captivating the rest of the world ceases to exist she was now lost in the music completely unaware of the thousand people in the audience the lights the distinguished guests the other members of the chamber orchestra around her only one thing intruded slightly the faint smell of smoke but then she came to a tricky passage in the chopin and concentrating hard she lost any awareness of the scent a dark sedan pulled up fast near a small park in northwest dc where a middleaged man in foodstained overalls sat on a park bench looking around like a nervous bird he flinched when the car stopped and only after spotting the plate official government use and the letters on the side dhs did he rise he walked to the man who got out of the car im joe from the diner he said i called im dick chambers they shook hands please sir the worker said he held up his cell phone i have the picture of the license plate its hard to read but im sure you have computers that can make it you know clearer yes our technical department can work miracles a man climbed from the car he called dick just heard a cnn report on the radio a fire in the recital hall it looks big real big dick chambers smiled then turned to the man who had just shouted to him from the car it was faust his two thugs stepped out of back of the car and joined him there hes the man i saw cried the agitated restaurant worker you have arrested him but then he shook his head seeing that fausts hands werent cuffed no no no he dropped the cell phone staring at chambers youre part of it i am dead yeah you pretty much are the homeland security man thought chambers asked faust whats going on at the hall they are just preliminary reports no one can see anything the streets are filled with smoke fire trucks everywhere the recital hall youve blown it up he crushed the restaurant workers cell phone under his heel im afraid you were at the wrong place at the wrong time he then glanced at faust who pulled out a silenced pistol and began to aim it at the worker please sir no which is when the spotlights slammed on fixing chambers faust and the others in searing glare the restaurant worker dropped to the grass and scuttled away as a loudspeaker blared this is emmett kalmbach chambers weve got snipers and theyre green lighted to shoot on the ground all of you the dhs man blinked in shock but he hesitated only a moment hed been in this business a long time he was four pounds of trigger pressure away from dead and he knew it he grimaced dropped to his belly and stretched out his legs and arms the two thugs did the same faust though hesitated the gun bobbing slowly in his hand you on the ground now but undoubtedly faust knew what awaited himthe interrogation the conviction and either life in jail or a lethal needleand chose desperate over wise he fired toward the spotlights then turned and began sprinting the lanky man whod made a job of running from the consequences of his actions got six feet before the snipers ended his career forever harry middleton walked forward into the lights set up by the fbi washington field office crime scene team he glanced at fausts body then shook the hand of the man whod been their undercover decoythe one whod pretended to have seen faust sneak from the recital hall jozef youre okay ah yes padlo said a scrape on my palm getting under cover no worse than that the polish inspector was stripping off the restaurant workers uniform hed donned for the takedown hed flown in that morning it was true that getting credentials for a foreign law officer to come into america was difficult but red tape did not exist for men like harold middleton and his anonymous supervisors padlo had learned that faust was instrumental in the death of his lover m t connolly and called harry middleton insisting that he come help to find faust and his coconspirators thered be no extradition of any perpetrators to poland middleton had said but padlo was willing to give the americans evidence in the jedynak murders which could prove helpful in any prosecutions here middleton joined kalmbach and flanked by two fbi agents cuffed dick chambers who was staring at the colonel but the fire you were his voice faded supposed to die along with a thousand other innocent people well a team disarmed the bomb this afternoon pumped the gas out but we needed to buy some time while we set up this sting if there was no fire at all i was afraid you might panic and stonewall so we lit a controlled fire in the construction site next door to the hall no damage but a lot of smoke enough to get us some ambiguous breaking news reports oh if youre interested the concert went on as planned the chopin piece by the way was pretty good id rate it a minus im sure your boss enjoyed it interesting you gave your ticket to him knowing that hed die in the fire should have seen his face when i told him it was you who was responsible chambers knew he should just shut up but he couldnt help himself he said how did you know well this story that faust was the mastermind bullshit i couldnt believe that he was too arrogant and impulsive i had a feeling somebody else was behind it but who i had some colleagues run a computer correlation on travel to poland and italy in the past few months tied to any connections in that part of dc where faust called pay phones some diplomats showed up some businessmen and youwho worked for the agency that quote accidentally let vukasin into the country i found out you also called nowakowski in prison the day before he offered to give up the chopin manuscript you were the numberone suspect but we needed to make sure and we had to flush faust so we set you up with a phony witness as a decoy jozef padlo who youd never met this is ridiculous you dont know what youre talking about yeah i do dick as soon as i got the call from poland about the first chopin manuscript i became suspicious and made some calls intelligence from northern europeans suggested possible terrorist activity originating in poland and rome music might have something to do with it so i went along to see what was up the trail led to a possible nervegas attack in baltimore we got the chemicals and it looked like the end of the story except for tracking down faust but i got to thinking about things the other night an attack out of revenge for our meddling in the balkans no the ethnic cleansing there was about politics and land not religious fundamentalism that didnt fit the profile maybe vukasin bought into the ideology but the main players faust and rugova no they were all about money and codes of nerve gas in a manuscript just the sort of thing the intelligence gurus would love and keep us from looking at the big picture but in these days of scramblers and cryptography there were better ways to get formulae from one country to another no something else was going on but what i decided i needed to analyze the situation differently i looked at it the same way i look at music manuscripts to decide if theyre authentic as a whole did this seem to be an authentic terrorist plot no the next logical question was what did the fake nervegas plot accomplish only one thing it brought me and the rest of the volunteers out of retirement that was your point of course to eliminate us the volunteers it was kalmbach who asked but why harry close to a billion dollars in stolen art and sculpture and manuscriptsstolen by the nazis from throughout europe and stashed in a dozen churches and schools in kosovo serbia and albania just like at st sophia we knew that chambers did a brief tour in the balkans but got out fast he mustve met rugova and learned about the loot then he bankrolled the operation and hired faust to oversee it a few years passed and they wanted to cash in by selling the pieces to private collectors but rugova preempted themand he got careless he didnt cover his tracks and word got around about the treasures it was only a matter of time until the volunteers started to put the pieces together so chambers and faust had to eliminate rugovaand us too but to keep suspicion off them they had to make it seem like part of a real terrorist attack they brought vukasin and his thugs over here well after i realized his motive i just looked for what would be the perfect way to kill all of us and it was obvious an attack at the recital hall now middleton turned to chambers i wasnt surprised to find out that you were the one at homeland security who suggested the concert dick this is all bullshit and you havent heard the last of it wrong on number one right on two ill be a witness in your trial so ill be hearing a lot more of it and so will you kalmbach and two other agents escorted chambers and fausts two thugs away for booking middleton and inspector jozef padlo found themselves standing alone on the chilly street corner a light drizzle had started falling jozef thank you for doing this i would not have done otherwise so it is finished not quite there are a few questions to answer theres one intriguing aspect im curious about eleana soberski she had a connection to vukasin but i think there was more to her i think she had her own agenda he recalled what she said just before she was shot we are aware of your relationship with faust ah padlo said so theres someone else interested in the loot or perhaps who has some of his own and would like to expand his market share i think so one of rugovas men middleton shrugged doubt it they were punks im thinking higher up someone highly placed like dick chambers but in rome or warsaw or moscow and you are going to find out who the case is my blood you know the expression i do now ill keep at it until im satisfied and are you going to do this alone asked the polish cop with a clever gleam in his eye or with the help of some friends middleton couldnt help but smile yes weve talked about reuniting the volunteers padlo fished in his pocket for a pack of sobieski cigarettes he pulled one out then frowned oh in america is okay middleton laughed outside in a park thats still legal padlo lit up sheltering the match from the mist inhaled deeply where do you think the stolen art is harry faust and chambers probably have a halfdozen safe houses throughout the world well find them and what do you think you will find there if the chopin is any clue itll be breathtaking i cant even imagine middleton glanced at his watch it was after midnight still this was northwest dc a yuppie oasis in the city that often sleeps will you join me for a drink i know a bar thats got some good polish vodka the inspector smiled sadly i think not im tired my job is done here i leave tomorrow and i must get up early to say farewell to someone maybe you know where this is he showed middleton a piece of paper with the address of a cemetery in alexandria virginia sure i can give you directions but tell you what how about if we go together ill drive you would not mind jozef my friend it would be an honor part ii the copper bracelet jeffery deaver finally the families were alone since the start of their vacation two days ago theyd been in public constantly taking in the sights in this touristy area along the beaches near nice france theyd seen the museums in antibes juanlespins the fragrant perfumemaking town of grasse the violet fields of medieval tourettes sur loup and nearby cannesa dull provincial village when emptied of filmmakers paparazzi and actors and wherever they went too many people around for him to move in for the kill now at last the americans were alone picnicking on a deserted stretch of white sand and red rocks near le plages de ondes at cap dantibesa postcard of the south of france sullen autumn was on the land now and everyone had returned from holiday today the weather was overcast and windy but that hadnt fazed the two familiesa husband and wife in early middle age and a slightly younger couple with their baby apparently theyd decided to take the day off from sightseeing and strolling past the tabacs cafés and souvenir shops and spend the day alone thank you thought kavi balan he needed to get the job done and leave there was much to do the swarthy man born in new delhi and now he liked to think now a resident of the world was observing the family through expensive binoculars from a hundred yards away in the hills above the beach he was parked in a rented fiat listening to some syrupy french pop music he was taking in the gray water the gray sky looking for signs of gendarmes or the ubiquitous governmental functionaries that materialized from nowhere in france to ask for your passport or identity card and snidely demand your business but there was no one about except the families as he studied them balan was wondering too about a question much on his mind the past few days how he would feel about killing a whole family the adults were not a problem of course even the women hed killed women without a single fleck of remorse but the younger couples babyyes that murder would bother him hed lain awake last night considering the dilemma now watching the young mother rock the infants bassinette absently he came to a decision balan had been instructed to leave no one alive but that was because of the need to eliminate anyone with certain information he hadnt seen the baby but it couldnt be more than a year old it could hardly identify him nor would it have retained any conversation between the adults he would spare the child balan would tell his mentor that hed grown concerned about somebody approaching as hed been about to kill the child and had left the beach quickly so he wouldnt be detected this wasnt unreasonable and wasnt a complete lie there were houses here cars and trucks passing nearby even though the beaches were deserted people still lived in the area year round there hed decided balan felt better and he concentrated more closely on the task before him the families were enjoying themselves laughing his ultimate targetthe american husband in his fiftiesjoked with his wife who was a bit younger not classically beautiful but exotic with long dark hair she reminded balan of an older kareena kapoor the bollywood film star thinking this he felt a wave of contempt course through him at these people americans they had no idea of the richness of indian cinema no american hed ever met even knew that that bombay supplied the b for bollywood which they also didnt know was only a part of the nations film industry nor did they understand indian culture in general the depth of its history and its spiritual life americans thought of india as customerservice call centers curry and slumdog millionaire on the beach the two men jumped to their feet and pulled out an american football another shiver of contempt raced through him as he watched them pitch the elongated ball back and forth they called that a game gridiron football absurd big men running into each other not like real footballwhat they called soccer or the most sublime game in the world cricket he looked at his watch soon he thought just one phone call away he checked his nokia to make sure it was working it was balan was known as a fanatic about details he turned the binoculars on the families again since they were about to die he couldnt help wondering where they were on the ladder of spirituality a hindu balan had an appreciation of the concept of reincarnationthe concept of returning to earth after death in some form that echoes spiritual justice for your past life his philosophy was a bit at odds with traditional hindu views though since he believed that though he devoted his life to death and torture he was doing higher work here on earth in an odd way perhaps by hastening the families deathsbefore they had a chance to lead even more impure liveshe might hasten their spiritual growth he didnt need this idea to justify what was about to happen of course all that mattered was that his mentor devras sikari had singled him out to kidnap the husbandand kill anybody with himthen torture the man to find out what hed learned on his recent trip to paris there are more than deities in the hindu religion but sikari though flesh and blood was higher than them all in balans mind in india the social and economic caste system is impossibly complicated with thousands of sects and subsects but the religious text the bhagavadgita defines only four castes the highest are the brahmin spiritual leaders the lowest the workingclass sudras devras sikari was in the kshatriya caste that of spiritual warriors and leaders it was the second most spiritual class below only the brahmin the bhagavadgita says that those in the kshatriya caste are of heroic mind inner fire constancy resourcefulness courage in battle generosity and noble leadership that described sikari perfectly his first name devras meant servant of god the surname meant hunter the man took the names when he was twice born a phrase that has nothing to do with reincarnation but refers to the comingofage ceremony for hindu youths balan believed a name was important his own first name for instance meant poet and he did indeed have an appreciation for beauty and words mahatma gandhis surname meant greengrocerand was a perfect description of the mildmannered commoner who changed the history of his country though peace and passive resistance devras sikari the hunter chosen by god would change the world too though far differently than gandhi he would make a mark in a way that befit his name balan now recalled the day he left for this mission the dark diminutive sikarihis age impossible to guesscame to balans safe house in northern india sikari was wearing wrinkled white slacks and a loose shirt from the chest pocket blossomed a red handkerchief red was the color associated with the kshatriya caste and sikari always wore or carried something red the leader had greeted him in a soft voice and gentle smilehe never shouted or displayed angerand then explained how vital it was that he find a particular american a geologist who had been making inquiries about sikari in paris i need to know what hes learned and why he wants to know about me yes devras of course sikari insisted that his people use his first name hes left india but find him kill anyone with him then torture him he said as casually as if he were ordering a cup of kashmiri shir chaipink salt tea of course his mentor had then smiled taken balans hand and given him a present a thick copper bracelet an antique it seemed a beautiful piece streaked with a patina of green it was decorated with ancient writing and an etching of an elephant hed slipped the bracelet on balans wrist and stepped back oh thank you devras another smile and the man who had brought so much death to some and hope to others whispered one of his favorite expressions go and do well for me and with that devras sikari stepped out the door and vanished back into the countryside of kashmir now remaining hidden from the victims soon to die balan glanced down at the bracelet he knew it signified more than gratitude the gift meant that he was destined for some place high in sikaris organization it was also a reminder not to fail do well for me balans phone trilled yes without any greeting jana asked coolly are you in position yes im up the beach road a hundred yards jana had a low and sultry voice he loved the sound he pictured her voluptuous body in the past few days as theyd prepared for the attack and conducted their surveillance shed worn bulky clothes that had concealed her figure only last night when theyd met in a café to survey the escape route had she worn anything revealing a thin tshirt and tight skirt shed glanced down at the outfit and explained dismissively that it was just another costume im only playing tourist meaning im not sending you a message though of course jana knew that he came from a country where the most beautiful women often wear concealing saris even to the beach and that balan had to be aware of her body so maybe there was a message but the killer had resisted even glancing at her figure he was a professional and had learned to stifle his lust sikari always came first jana now said through her untraceable cell phone i have the hypodermic ready for him the plan was that balan would stun the american with a taser and kill the others then jana would race up in the van theyd throw the man inside and inject him with a tranquilizer shed drive him to an abandoned warehouse outside of nice for the interrogation balan would meet her there soon after youll kill the family she said as if this were something theyd argued about which they had not yes all of them of course he resolved to keep to his decision not to harm the child but he couldnt help but wonder about her how could a woman be so casual about killing an infant get to work jana said abruptly because she was beautiful he didnt give her a snide response which was his first reaction instead he simply disconnected balan looked around for traffic nobody was on the windswept beach road he climbed out of the car with a canvas bag over his shoulder inside was an automatic weapon with a sound suppressor it could fire rounds a minute but he had it set to fire in threeshot bursts every time the trigger was pulled this was far more efficient than fully automatic and more deadly than singleshot the bullets werent big caliberbut they didnt need to be sikari instructed his people to look at guns as an extension of more primitive weapons like spears or knives your goal sikari said is to open the flesh and let the life flow out let the body destroy itself how brilliant he is balan thought his heart tapping hard with love and awe as he rubbed the copper bracelet and walked closer to the people whose lives were about to change so dramatically he crossed the sandy road and slipped behind a faded sign advertising gitane cigarettes he peeked out the family was pouring wine and beer and setting out food their last meal balan looked over the older husband who was fairly fit for someone in middle age from here yards awayhe was handsome in a nondescript american way all of them looked alike to him and his wife was even more striking up close the younger man balan now decided wasnt their son he wasnt young enough besides he didnt resemble either of the older couple perhaps he was a coworker or neighbor or the americans younger brother his wife the mother of the baby was blond and athletic recalling his thoughts about sports he decided she looked like a cheerleader balan reached into the bag and extracted the gun checked again to make sure it was ready to fire he then put on a powder blue jacket that said inspecteur des plages and a fake badge slipped the guns strap over his shoulder and hung the gun on his back so it wouldnt be seen from the front he thought of sikari he thought of jana the cold beautiful woman now waiting in the van would she await him later that night in her bed perhaps this was only a fantasy but as sikari taught his followers fantasies exist so that we might strive to make them reality then standing tall he walked toward the family with casual purpose one hundred yards then making slow progress over the fine white sand the american smiling from something his wife had said glanced his way but paid balan little attention hed be thinking a beach inspector those crazy french at worst ill have to pay five euros for permission to lunch here fifty yards forty he would shoot when he was yards away balan was a good shot hed learned his skill killing pakistanis and muslims and other intruders in his home in kashmir he was accurate even standing in the open with the enemy shooting back the younger woman the mother beside the babys bassinette glanced his way without interest and then turned back to her music streaming into her ears through the ipod she leaned forward on her beach chair looked inside the carriage smiled and whispered to the baby that will be her last image as she died her childs face thirty yards twentyfive balan kept a restrained smile on his face still none of them was suspicious perhaps they were thinking that with his brown skin he was from algeria or morocco there were many frenchmen around here who had roots in north africa twenty yards he wiped his palms on his blue jacket fifteen all right now but balan froze as he gazed at the family wait what was this the two men and the older woman were diving to the sand the woman with the ipod ear buds leapt from her chair and reached into the bassinette she pulled from it a black machine gun a heckler koch mp which she trained on balans chest astonished the indian looked right and left as two men in nato olivedrab uniforms and two french soldiers in dark blue sprinted from what seemed like empty cabanas they must have been hiding there all morning hed checked the beach carefully after the americans arrived a trap hed been set up one of the nato officers a boyfaced blondhis name badge read wetherbygrowled atakana in a perfect hindi accent this was followed by arretez maintenant then freeze as if balan needed an interpreter to explain that he was about five seconds away from dying if he didnt do exactly as instructed brandishing a large pistol wetherby stepped closer and repeated the warnings balan remained where he stood his head swiveling from the officers on his left to the americans then to the other soldiers on his right his eyes fell on the older husband who was climbing to his feet studying balanwith interest but without surprise so he was the one responsible for the trap and in this instant he understood too that a man so clever was indeed a serious threat to devras sikari he told himself youve disappointed him youve failed your life is pointless use your death to good purpose kill the american at least any risk to sikari and his plans will die with him balan crouched fast and reached for the gun which is when his world went mad yellow lights danced in his eyes his muscles spasmed and pain exploded from teeth to groin he dropped to his knees his limbs unresponsive he glanced down and saw the taser barbs in his side it was the same brand of weapon that hed brought with him to use on the american balans eyes teared from the pain and from his failure to go and do well for his beloved mentor he fell forward on the sand and saw nothing more his names kavi balan sir said petey wetherby the younger of the two nato soldiers assisting on the operation here he spoke with a north boston accent the eager crewcut man an interpreter by specialty nodded at the prisoner who sat with his hands and feet cuffed slowly coming to beside one of the concession stands closed for the season he was beneath a large sign that said crème glacée pommes frites hot dawgs balan never heard of him nodded harold middleton the man whod been masquerading as the older husband in the sting operation wetherby continued we found his car rented under a fake name and address prepaid credit card but weve got his real passport and we recovered a computer computer excellent middleton looked around the deserted beach then turned to one of the french soldiers in french he asked any sign of sikari no colonel middleton but the perimeter the slim frenchman gave a gallic shrug and twist of his lip meaning middleton understood they didnt have the manpower to search very far the french had been cooperative to a point but werent allhandsonboard for an operation that was primarily american and nato and would deliver the suspect not to the palais de justice in paris but to international criminal court in the haguethe tribunal with jurisdiction to try war criminals and other humanrights violators middleton had doubted devras sikari himself would be here while intelligence sources had reported that someone from kashmir had traveled to the south of france to kill or abduct the american geologist it would be unlikely that sikari would risk coming out of hiding for such a mundane crime the best hed hoped for was to capture someone who could lead them to sikari which it seemed they had middleton continued to the frenchman hell have an accomplice though you find any other cars nearby monitor any radio transmissions no the frenchman said you middleton asked wetherby the nato officers had their own monitoring system no colonel he referred to middletons rank when hed retired from the army years ago middleton preferred harry but some monikers just stick and colonel was better than some others he could think of it was then that middletons wife joined them she was in reality leonora tesla a colleague the intense woman with a mane of dark mediterranean hair held up a nokia prepaid cell phone some local calls within the past half hour but theyre all callerid blocked a flash of white in the distance caught middletons eye it was just a van accelerating slowly away into the hills tesla added jms going through the computer now he said its passwordprotected but hes trying to bypass that middleton glanced at where she was nodding in the back of the unmarked nato van jeanmarc lespasse the husband of the younger couple was pounding away at the keys on the laptop athletic with spiky black hair jm had been playing his role in the sting to the hilt referring to his boss who was only years older as dad for the past two days and asking if he should cut up middletons food for him what do we know about him middleton nodded toward their prisoner slumped on the ground and only semiconscious i just emailed interpol tesla told him theyll let us know soon the fourth member of the faux family approached twentynineyearold constance connie carson who like middleton and lespasse was former military shed returned the baby the mp machine gun to the nato van though they couldnt legally carry weapons without permissionwhich the french had not given themconnie with her muscular cowgirls body and piercing blue eyes wasnt the sort to say no to shed walked up to the nato officers pulled the machine pistol off the gun rack chambered a round and tossed the gun into the bassinette ignoring their protests shed said just gonna take her for a little stroll in an accent that pinpointed her roots in west texas she unplugged the walkietalkie ear buds disguised to look like they belonged to an ipod and examined the roads betcha hes not alone thats what i think middleton said we cant find anybody though connie continued to scan for possible offensive threats this was her nature middleton had learned hes coming to colonel the other nato officer called standing near balan sitting under the sign it looked like a cartoon with the words pommes frites in a dialog balloon over his head how long middleton asked five minutes what do you want me to do colonel wetherby asked hang tight i might need you to interpret yes sir harold middleton stretched and gazed out to sea reflecting that he was a long long way from his home in fairfax county virginia outside of washington dc where hed been only last week he was a bit trimmer than he had been a few years ago when he was living comfortablyfat and sassy hed tell his daughter charleywith two great jobs authenticating music manuscripts and teaching music history hed taken them up after retiring from one that was considerably more demanding as a military intelligence officer middleton had witnessed the results of war crimes ethnic cleansing and other atrocities in many parts of the world determined to help bring the perpetrators of those offenses to justice hed left the service and started a nonprofit group called war criminal watch devoted to tracking down human rights violators wanted by the international criminal court in the hague and by other tribunals around the world since they were not affiliated with any law enforcement agency or nongovernmental organization and made virtually no money for their work they were known as the volunteers they gained a reputation throughout the free world for their brilliant detective work in tracking down elusive criminals for various reasons the group had disbanded some years ago and middleton went on to his beloved music leonora tesla to do relief work in africa and the other volunteers to their own lives but recently a vicious wanted war criminal whod eluded them for years surfaced with plans for terrible carnage the volunteers were forced out of retirement they managed to apprehend the killerthough only after middletons exwife was murdered and his daughter was nearly killed by her own husband who turned out to be connected with the criminal realizing that he could no longer remain in academia while such evil continued to thrive middleton decided to start up the volunteers once again the group included three of the original members himself leonora tesla and jeanmarc lespasse new to the group were connie carson and jimmy chang who now was back at headquarters outside of washington dc the slightly built taiwaneseamerican had a miraculous grasp of languages advanced degrees in computers and science and a love of researchlespasse called him wiki chang after the online encyclopedia middletons daughter also helped them out glancing now at balan who struggled to sit up straight after the taser jolt middleton sure hoped the interrogation was successful they desperately wanted to capture the mans boss devras sikari was a curious character born into a poor family in kashmir the disputed territory in the north of india sikari had somehow managed the impossible hed attended an elite school in england a brilliant student his mind sharper than many of his professors hed studied engineering and computer science there were rumors that he was being bankrolled for his entire education and living expenses but no one knew who it might be the source of his underwriting was anonymous as soon as he left university hed shunned dozens of offers from large british firms and returned home to india where somehowno one quite knew howhe amassed some significant startup capital he began setting up engineering and computer companies and making millions in indias burgeoning hightech world then having made his fortune he disappeared from mumbai and new delhi where his companies were based not long after that he surfaced in kashmir jimmy chang had explained and became a combination warlord insurgent and cult figure chang had briefed middleton and the other volunteers about the kashmir conflict formerly known as a princely state kashmir has been the object of a deadly game of tugofwar for more than half a century india and pakistan each control separate portions of the region while china exercises authority over a smaller section of the northeast but the partition is merely tolerated both india and pakistan claim that the entire state is theirs and have fought frequently to assert ownership the massive fertile area has been the basis for perhaps the closest nuclear confrontation between nations since the cuban missile crisis in the s devras sikari settled in jammu in the indiancontrolled and largely hindu portion of kashmir and now lived largely underground surrounded by hundreds of followers though he was known to travel outside of the country frequently using false documents diplomatic papers and disguises hed spent the past several years orchestrating the slaughter kidnapping and torture of muslims pakistanis buddhists and christians in kashmiranyone who wasnt indian or hindu and anyone he felt had no right to be in the region of his birth or a threat to kashmir independence he was suspected of massacres of entire refugee camps and villages and he even made incursions into the pakistanicontrolled portion of kashmir prosecutors at the international criminal court had wanted to bring him to justice for some time but were stymied because india isnt a member of the court so sikaris crimes though horrific couldnt be prosecuted at the icc but middleton managed to find a loophole the volunteers discovered that sikari had been responsible for committing murders in nations that were signatories which made him subject to icc jurisdiction the only problem was finding the elusive man but finally they turned up a lead a source at interpol reported that sikari was spotted in paris making inquiries about buying sophisticated hardware and software used to find sources for underground water this was odd though kashmir was one of the few places in the world where water was plentiful the name of the state in fact comes from the words ka shimir meaning the act of drying up water referring to the draining of a primordial lake that covered much of the land many major rivers in india and pakistan originated in kashmir and other parts of the regionlike perpetually droughtplagued chinaand nursed whatever water they could from tributaries that sprung from there middleton seized this chanceas he joked to the other volunteersto flush sikari hed flown to paris posing as an american geologist and tried to arrange a meeting with sikari or his representatives but no one took the bait so middleton left a clear trail to the south of france pretending to be vacationing with his wife and friends in hopes that sikari or an associate would try to find them theyd been here only one day when nato and french army surveillance units reported that they were being followedby a darkcomplexioned man who might be indian perfect middleton had thought and he and leonora tesla set up the sting now the former colonel walked to balan and crouched down he said water food middleton believed in respectful measured interrogation there was no point in psychologicallylet alone physicallyabusing prisoners that was hed learned counterproductive i want nothing from you people he gave a faint sneer middleton glanced up once more into the hills above the beach he saw the white van again or perhaps it was another one it was about a halfmile away parked there was glare on the windshield he didnt know if anybody was inside or not perhaps it had no connection to balan but middleton was suspicious he called to one of the french troops please could you go check that van out the man squinted its just one van of many ive seen theyre very common here if you dont mind it is wise to separate our forces please middleton said patiently the french officer shrugged and climbed onto his motorcycle and roared up the beach road teslas phone rang she answered then announced its interpol theyre going to brief me about balan she turned away and jotted notes as she listened middleton said to his prisoner kavi we know you were sent here to kidnap or kill me and we know it was devras sikari who ordered it those are the facts and theyre not in dispute now youre going to jail for a long time theres nothing thats going to change that but i can make sure that the prison you go to is tolerable or is hell on earth you can do to me what you want you are all shhh middleton said amiably im not interested in speeches its a waste of your time and it annoys me now what i want to know is how can we find him sikari i dont know where he is the man laughed and if i did youd never get the information out of me he glanced down at his hands cuffed in front of him and chained to a waist shackle that wetherby had carefully locked around him middleton thought at first that he was going to complain about the handcuffs but no he was simply staring fondly at a wide copper bracelet on his wrist balans eyes shown fiercely as he continued you dont have any idea who youre dealing with youre not worthy to even stand in his shadow youll see though youll see middleton wondered about this did he mean something specific or were the words just empty posturing he asked more questions but the prisoner proved no more cooperative middletons radio cracked the french soldier was calling to report that hed found no one in the van he was checking the registration he signed off maybe it was nothing he thought of the officers comment about dividing the forces he looked around and saw no one on the beach balans phone which sat in middletons pocket rang he pulled it out on the screen nombre inconnu he said to balan youre going to answer it if its sikari tell him youre a prisoner and i want to negotiate he handed the phone to petey wetherby let him talk tell me exactly what he says sure colonel wetherby did so the prisoner said something in hindi hes saying a greeting wetherby said to middleton as he retreated its the normal way to answer the phone in then a huge orange fireball erupted next to balans ear a deafening crack of an explosion knocked to his knees middleton squinted away the stinging dust and smoke and realized that much of the prisoners neck and shoulder was gone and blood was spraying in random patterns on the sand petey wetherbys arm was missing as well blown into tiny bits wide eyed the soldier gripped the wound and fell to his knees as his spurting blood pooled with balans no tesla cried running forward and ripping off her belt to make a tourniquet for wetherby but the bomb in the phone had been so powerful that there was not enough arm left to bind middleton shouted to the other french officer call for backup and medical connie carson paid no attention to the tornapart bodies she grabbed the mp again and did exactly the right thing crouching into a classic defensive shooting position sweeping the gun in the direction from which attackers might come lespasse snatched up a pistol and covered the south side of the beach the other nato soldier holding his covered the north then from the hills came the sound of gunshots middleton knew exactly what happened the accomplice had slipped out of the van to spy on them then made the phone call and when the phone was near balans head had detonated the bomb in the phone then returned to the van and killed the french officer this was a nightmare middleton was staring in shock at the carnage wetherby was now unconscious his face white miraculously balan was still alive though he was losing blood so fast he couldnt survive long the colonel crouched tell me where is sikari dont let any more innocents die the prisoner glanced at him once with fading eyes then did something curious he lifted his hands as far as the shackles would allow and bent down his head he kissed the copper bracelet muttered a few words and then went limp he stopped breathing middleton stared for a moment then glanced down at his feet and saw a tiny bit of cell phone a thought stabbed he turned quickly to lespasse who stood at the printer next to balans computer he cried jm the computer hit the deck the former soldier was programmed to follow orders instantly he dove to the ground a second booby trapinside the computerexploded in an even larger ball of flame showering the area with bits of plastic and metal shrapnel connie carson ran to him and helped him up keeping her eye out for other attackers you all right middleton asked i guess lespasse winced as he massaged his arm and neck he joined the others her voice choking tesla nodded at wetherby hes gone middleton was furious with himself he should have anticipated the devices would be sabotaged now the cheerful young officer was dead all because of his carelessness but he didnt have time to dwell on the tragedy he was looking at the hillside the white van was speeding away he glanced at carlson who was aiming the mp at it but the woman shook her head and lowered the gun too far theyd give the information to the french but he knew that the van would soon be abandoned and the driver long gone and who was that partner the sour residue of chemical explosives smoke hung in the air and stung their mouths and noses middleton then noticed tesla who was looking at balans shattered body something was on her mind he could tell what is it somethings odd here she held up her notebook with her jottings from her conversation with the interpol officer kavi balans been with sikari for years he was his numberone triggerman been on hundreds of jobs sikari was his mentor and he was grooming balan for high places in his organization nodding middleton said sikari was so worried about us finding out something that he killed his favorite protégé to keep him quiet exactly what is it do you think lespasse said might have a lead or two he gathered up some sheets of paper hed just printed out and that had flown to the ground when the computer detonated i managed to beat the pass code and print out three emails before it blew two of them are street addresses ones in london and one in florida tampa middleton looked them over were they residences offices whats the third email the young man read kavi i am pleased that you like your present wear it forever for good fortune when your project in the south of france is finished and you send me the information on the american you must leave immediately time is very short you recall what i have planned for the village it has to happen soonbefore we can move on we only have a few weeks at the most and be constantly aware of the scorpion lespasse looked up its signed ds devras sikari destroying an entire village leonora tesla whispered more ethnic cleansing she frowned and where is it kashmir middleton shrugged it could be anywhere and its in quotes almost as if its a code word for something else altogether lespasse said and what does he mean by before we can move on carlson said something we damn well better find out and the scorpion sounds like a person but who many questions no answers tesla asked should we call the powers that be the volunteers had no governmental authority their efforts had to be coordinated through the international criminal court the european union force nato the un or local governments sometimes all of the above and that took a lot of time and a lot of red tape middleton was gazing at the body of young petey wetherbythe young man theyd gotten to know over the past few days he recalled the times theyd laughed and drunk wine together talked about sports and politics back in the states well call em after we have sikari handcuffed and in a plane headed for the hague middleton muttered he stabbed a finger at the sheets of dusty paper in lespasses hand who wants florida and who wants london silence for a moment then in her sexy texas drawl carlson said not sure how good id fit in over in piccadilly dont yall think damn looks like im stuck with tampa youve got it jm you go with her nora looks like you and i are packing bags for london though what or whom they were searching for in either of those places was a complete mystery lespasse was looking over the third email again wonder what sikari gave him as a present i think i know middleton recalled balans curious last gesturekissing the copper bracelet with a napkin he carefully removed the jewelry from the mans wrist he examined it closely making sure not to dislodge any physical evidence that might be contained in the intricate etchings around the edge of greenstreaked copper was delicate lettering probably sanskrit or hindi and on one side where the bracelet swelled into an oval was an exquisite carving of an elephant the animal was lifting its trunk and spraying water into the sky toward the sliver of a new moon carlson drawled guess it wasnt such good luck after all maybe not for him harry middleton said but it might be for us gayle lynds pierre crane had spent months working toward this moment it was odd that it would end on the outskirts of paris but then the investigation had been difficult and strange from the beginning it was oclock at night the black sky winking with bright stars as the taxi sped him along the boulevard bargue in montfermeil crane stared out alertly it was said the two frances met here to his left spread tidy prewar family homes with neat gardens and carefully painted black steel fences while to the right was his destinationa public housing project of big apartment blocks stories high sheltering thousands of immigrants and their frenchborn children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren the tenements were called les bosquets the groves evoking visions of lush natural beauty but what crane saw through his taxi window was an asphaltandconcrete jungle awash with graffiti broken sidewalks thirsty weeds and deep shadows this was the last stop before homelessness for those who could afford no other shelter which helped to explain its unemployment rate perennially hovering around percent the bleak scene only increased the oddity of cranes presence the man he was to meet was wealthy and powerful and about as likely to live in les bosquets as a nun in a las vegas whorehouse nous sommes ici crane told the driver in perfect french his mother had been french and he had spent many happy childhood summers with her family in the champagne country around reims the driver responded instantly pulling to the curb and announcing the fare he stuck out his hand sil vous plaît the expression on his worried face said it allhe was ready to leave now pierre crane handed over euros and climbed out into the night thirtyeight years old he was tall and gangly with pasty skin dull brown hair a large nose and a long neck teased as a child because of his physical appearance and called the crane behind his back by his colleagues he enjoyed the fact that he knew that he had developed a quick sense of humor and an appreciation for being underestimated in service to both he also held a black belt in karate about which few people knewand had for years dressed casually in khaki trousers and a nylon jacket zippered up against a cool autumn wind crane turned slightly on the sidewalk as the taxi squealed into traffic keeping his gaze neutral he watched as a halfdozen teenage boys reversed direction and headed toward him through a pool of lamplight snapping their fingers and doing a pimp walk to algerian hiphop music blaring from the boom box one carried on a heavily muscled shoulder as they drew closer crane bent his knees slightly found his balance and let his empty hands drift down to his sides fingers unfurled the youths appraised him with stony gazes their bodies still rolling and dipping he shrugged grinned and touched the snapbrim of his cap a few seconds of surprise showed in their dusky faces then their tension seemed to lessen but as they passed him a warning drifted backgo home français de souche the phrase literally meant french with roots slang for ethnic french he stared thoughtfully after them the bulges in the hip pockets of their lowslung jeans revealing what he had suspectedthey were carrying knives feeling a chill crane reminded himself he had walked into more dicey situations than this an investigative reporter for reuters he seldom talked about his successes but back in the s he had discovered vital information that helped lead to charges of war crimes against radovan karadzic the alleged architect of bosnias holocaust later he uncovered the atrocityfilled cosa nostra background of a top italian presidential candidate creating headlines across europe and sending the politician to prison and last year while working on a small story he had dug up a large prizeone of saddam husseins secret caches of gold despite having three mercenaries on his tail the whole time remembering all of that the journalist marched resolutely into les bosquets his large feet eating up the distance among the towering maze of dilapidated cement tenements pole lamps were alight the ones that were working he watched women in hijabs and blousy clothing move languidly in and out of doorways many holding babies radio news in arabic chattered from an open window high above colorful desert robes were draped over balconies ready to dry in the morning sun he sensed no danger but still he slowed and looked around carefully he knew he had made no mistake in the directions but none of the buildings carried anything close to the number he needed he forged onward heading toward the next corner he turned it in time to see two youths with reckless faces negotiating a drug deal watching it from a front stoop was a man in a bushy black beard who was openly cleaning a mm beretta pistol the man quickly shifted his gaze to crane his sharp brown eyes assessing a hawk spotting potential prey suddenly the scarred door of the facing building swung open and three men in denim jeans and shortsleeved shirts swarmed out cradling sub machine guns the weapons were ingram model s short compact and fitted with mac suppressors which reduced emergent gas velocity to subsonic level pierre crane froze the pair involved in the drug deal ran in opposite directions the man with the beretta vanished indoors all that remained were the armed trioand crane as they stared at him expressions grim sweat slid down his spine hoping they were who he thought they might be he said the arabic words he had been told to say adetniarabba ive been bitten by a scorpion the man to his right nodded the scorpion will see you now the words were in english and the voice was low it was the correct response which was all that mattered to crane the guards hustled him safely up the steps and inside the door closed with a loud thud followed by the clicks of a battery of locks thrown into place clearly this was no ordinary tenement and now the scorpions insistence that the meeting be held in les bosquets made sense crane had been warned to come alone and by walking through the labyrinth of buildings to an address that did not exist the scorpions people had had plenty of time to observe him and make certain he was not only by himself but had not been followed he inhaled and looked around the foyer was old but clean with a low ceiling standing in the middle of it was a fourth man unarmed and of an entirely different sort monsieur crane youre late i trust you had no trouble the man was older somewhere in his mids with an angular face a yacht tan and a halo of saltgray hair every strand in place crane studied the cut and fabric of his suitcharcoal gray silk with a carat gold pinstripe estimated cost and the shoesby berlutti in alligator with natural seamsat least the tie was hermès and worth but it was the watch that held his attentionpatek phillippe not a centime less crane raised his gaze so i meet the scorpion at last bright blue eyes twinkled back at him youre a smart lad the accent was lightly british and his manner was casually noblesse oblige as he looked past crane to his men search him crane knew the drill he lifted his arms and spread his legs no one spoke as a guard patted him down then a second ran an airportstyle wand over him they were inspecting him not only for weapons but for any kind of recording devices which was fine with crane over the years he had developed an extraordinary memory not only for documents but also for conversations few people knew he had those talents either hes clean the man with the wand reported the scorpion had been looking away now he focused on crane again well take the elevator with two of the security men leading they stepped into the elevator cage followed by the last man who touched the button that sent them not up into the apartments but downward crane asked when did you become involved in he raised a hand silencing him well discuss serious matters when were in the limo its debugged and the windows are treated so no demodulating devices can read our voices you look surprised i know about such things he shrugged its the world we live in lad pity isnt it then he beamed but it does make for good business certainly for what i understand is your business crane kept his tone neutral the older man inclined his head as you say the elevator door slid open revealing a traditional cementfloor cellar with trash bins and laundry and boiler rooms to the right was a wide expanse of stalls walled with wire fencing each gated combination locks dangling storage of some kind as crane studied the area trying to see more than cardboard boxes a powerful car engine purred to life from the shadows emerged a long mercedes limousine it cruised toward them its polished black surface gleaming in the florescent lighting like freshly spilled ink our chariot the scorpion explained while the chauffeur remained behind the steering wheel two of the guards opened the rear doors then stepped back standing at attention crane walked around to the other side and slid in joining his host the car smelled of new leather and lemon wax the driver wore a traditional muftibrown uniform and flat cap with a stiff brim from what crane could see he looked oldhe had thin white hair and the skin on the back of his neck was pale and wrinkled covering his hands were short calfskin driving gloves that revealed a copper bracelet on his right wrist the bracelet caught cranes attention some kind of words edged it even at this distance he could see the letters looked exotic which of course was always intriguing the bracelet must be very old he decided since the copper was such a rich color in fact it seemed to shimmer as if from some deep inner fire the bracelet was a stunning baublethat was why it had attracted his eye and that was all there was to it crane put on his seatbelt the doors closed and they were alone proceed the driver looked into the rearview mirror and nodded acknowledging the order then he rolled the limo toward a driveway that rose up to street level and the stars crane watched as his host settled back against the leather and said before i answer your questions you must answer mine tell me how you came to be interested in me start at the beginning it was a strange question but it was possible the scorpion did not know the whole story i was doing research for an article when i ran across something that had nothing to do with it but i was intrigued it was an anomaly go on the anomaly was three brilliant young foreign students at cambridgean indian a pakistani and a kashmiriwho graduated with firstclass honors in they were close friends all were born poor but their educational expenses in england which began when they were ten years old were paid for then when they left cambridge they started different businesses again completely funded each was quickly successful but the indian died in new delhi within five years drowned in a flood and the one in pakistan died ten years later poisoned by bad well water and the third one the kashmiridevras sikariis still alive but hes sold his company and is living in the bush as some sort of combination warlord and wouldbe saint the whole situation seemed to beg to be looked into so thats what i did i discovered the three hadnt known each other before england all were hindu and none had ever named their sponsor the one clue i turned up about that subject was in an obscure hindu journal in it sikari is quoted as saying that the benefactor was holy but of this world yes ive heard parts of that do continue crane allowed himself a brief smile sikaris quote was tantalizing why would a benefactor want to hide his generosity after all he educated three impoverished children and his story might inspire others to be equally generous unless the person wasnt altruistic at all he thought to himself unless he had a far differentand far less admirablemotive i was finally able to track down the name of the company that paid their expenses it was a front leading to more front companies but one thing was constant their security was provided by bluewatch global services headquartered in dubai bluewatch was the real deal a private security and private investigation agency with a special division servicing very deeppocket clients naturally i asked for an interview with the president and board chair mr francis xavier kimball from everything he could tell kimball did not exist still crane was not ready to point that out at least not yet because it was his probe into kimballs identity that had ignited the scorpions emails that had ended with the invitation to meet he had never heard of the scorpion but one of his sources who was well connected in the underworld of international crime had described him as rich dangerous of unknown name and origin and never seen shortly after that reuterss it security team reported to crane that the scorpions emails had been routed through multiple countries including china and russia and their signals were untraceable as he finished speaking pierre crane looked out realizing they were long past les bosquets they appeared to be in a lovely residential section of outer paris where swaying trees autumn flowers and luxuriant moonlit lawns showed on both sides of the car high hedges and pastelpainted walls appeared lining it the occasional driveway was sealed by ornate gates that were really highsecurity barricades where are we crane asked nowhere in particular it doesnt matter really does it now in fact i dont know either were simply being driven the point was for you and me to have a quiet uninterrupted conversation and that were having indeed youve just related an entertaining tale mr crane he dusted an imaginary annoyance from the sleeve of his superb suit and what do you plan to do with it id like to write a story about the brilliant young kashmiri who turned his back on the west and became an independence fighter the benefactor who funded his education and was then betrayed when sikari returned to kashmir is part of that story the name the scorpion came up in several conversations so will you confirm that you are the benefactor the good samaritan who was betrayed there are occasions when its far better for everyone to remain anonymous the man replied besides as you said yourself with two of the men dead and the third likely gone mad i hardly think anyone would want to take credit for the experiment the experiment thats even more intriguing what did you hope to accomplish no no i wasnt the one if i were and i didnt want you to know id simply dodge your questions i had nothing to do with any of it he held up a manicured hand please let me finish at the same time id like to know more too why a man cant have too much knowledge if i give you the address of a place where youre likely to uncover new information will you promise to let me know in detail what you discover crane was surprised he had expected the scorpion to try to stop him and any help he got from the mysterious rich man would have to be wormedor trickedout of him why dont you go yourself crane demanded again there was a twinkle in the older mans blue eyes through you i will it is shall we say more discreet this way from everything my people tell me youre a man of your word whats your answer all right ill give you a report after that i make no promises be very careful when you go there theres a man whos pursuing sikari hes former us army in fact former military intelligence welltrained and ruthless he slipped his hand inside his suit jacket and brought out a color photograph this is him his name is harold middleton be cautious of him at all times crane glanced at the photo but when he looked up he stopped listening he was riveted by the scene on the other side of the car windowanother black limo had appeared and was running without lights next to them on the cramped twolane residential road it was keeping perfect and very dangerous pace its front fenders aligned with their limos front fenders cold moonlight reflected off the darkened side windows he could see no one inside his lungs tightened the chauffeur spoke ive been watching it crane liked the sound of himthere was authority in the voice a man who knew how to get things done the chauffeur floored the gas pedal the limos tires spun and screeched and the acceleration threw them deep into their seats as they left the other limo sucking their exhaust the chauffeur commanded get out the weapons crane saw his host jab a button on his plush armrest a door dropped open behind the drivers seat he pulled out an mp submachine gun and quickly slid it over the seat to the chauffeur then he grabbed the other gun for himself and rested it gingerly on his lap its jana the driver said angrily i could see her through the windshield how did she find us how should i know its your job dammit youve screwed up crane was stunned the chauffeur was questioning the scorpion he was giving the scorpion orders he was telling him he had failed and the scorpion was doing nothing to take back control as the limo raced onward crane noticed that the window between the front and rear seats had remained open the whole time the chauffeur had heard everything crane thought back quickly remembering when he saw the man in the tenement foyer and asked whether he was the scorpion youre a smart lad hed said and that was all hed said which was no answer at all he had dodged the question crane felt his heart pound the disguise of chauffeur was perfect to conceal the scorpions legendary secret identity while carrying out business there was only one answer that made sensethe chauffeur was the boss could the chauffeur be the real scorpion the second limo pulled up again and the window on the front passenger side rolled down crane looked inside he caught a gauzy image of the drivera beautiful woman with long lustrous dark hair dancing in the slipstream her left hand was on the wheel her right out of view she glanced at crane and he felt a shiverfrom her beauty and from what he saw as a fanatics fire in her eyes captivating terrifying then she lost all interest in him and instead focused on the other two men in the vehicle something about her gaze as she looked at the driver registered disappointment she hesitated only a moment then lifted a machine pistol perhaps an uzi perhaps a mac as crane gasped and cringed a firestorm sprouted from the muzzle and like amplified hail the bullets slammed in the windows flicking loudly but ineffectively off the armored sheet metal and bulletproof glass dismay spread on janas face and she wrenched the wheel to the right forcing their limo into a grassy shoulder where it bounced to a halt janas vehicle vanished into a cloud of dust how did she find us the driver snapped followed him the man in the backseat glanced at crane who noticed that he held his pistol firmly in a steady hand he wondered if he was about to die the driver spun around and snapped you can never underestimate anyone in this never the man beside him said what do we do about him the driver considered mr crane theres a train station at the end of that road there you see it yes you can get a train that will take you back to paris im afraid we have other concerns yes of course follow the london lead but be careful whatever you do be careful crane climbed out of the limo which rocked out of the soft shoulder and made a u turn the opposite of the direction jana had sped in the reporter now shaking and breathless from the incident began hiking toward the road his reporters instinct gave him an important message the woman had been intent on killing the scorpion but the frown of disappointment when she saw the men in the limo told him that neither man was in fact that reclusive character anyone with common sense would walk away from this story it was beyond dangerous but somewhere deep inside him he the crane loved that he was ugly but his mind and spirit were beautiful his curiosity was inflamed and like a lover in the first fiery flush of requitement he would see himself skinned and beheaded before he would let go of this amazing story he pulled out his cell and ran down the street in the distance police sirens screamed he ignored them his mind was on london and what he would find there david hewson felicia kaminski was playing bachpartita number two in d minor the chaconne some of the most difficult solo violin music ever writtenwhen the man with the gun burst through the door there was a woman behind the frantic worried figure moving forcefully into the front room of the little terraced cottage on londons lambs conduit street she was tall and elegant with long dark hair and something that looked like a machine pistolkaminski wished weapons were not so familiarextended in her right hand the young polish musician placed her bela szepessy fiddle and bow on the antique walnut table by the window and said harold leonora so nice to see you again how is the music business these days slow or fast looking at you at this moment it is difficult for me to judge are you here for my debut at the wigmore hall if so she placed a slender finger the nail trimmed down to the quick on her cheek i have some sartorial issues i must say oh crap middleton put away the weapon and leonora tesla followed suit if a little more slowly he slapped his forehead theatrically im sorry felicia we saw there was someone inside i forgot you had the keys they shoot burglars in london harold such a beautiful little house you dont remember who you lend it to middleton glanced at the woman with him i said felicia was welcome to use the place for her he stumbled over the details for my debut at the wigmore hall felicia repeated picking up the fiddle and showing it to them i thought you wanted to see me play this it cost you a lot of money harold middletonshe refused to shorten his first name since she wasnt felicia wished to say a colleaguehad proved a good friend of sorts he saved her life on more than one occasion when she was enmeshed in the deadly game of terror and crime that should have ended in a massacre at the james madison recital hall in washington dc while she performed as the principal soloist for a newly unearthed work by chopin there had been many more favors in the intervening two years over that time she ceased to be an impoverished young polish émigré without friends at first without parents and had began slowly to adjust to the life of a professional musician taking the first steps on the international orchestral ladder occasionally and only when absolutely necessary using harold middletons many connections she was grateful she was also intensely aware that a part of his generosity stemmed from some private inward guilt for introducing her to the dark and violent world to which he had now returned one a million miles away from the music which he truly loved i will see you play middleton insisted we both will felicia leonora tesla added middleton winced when he failed to remember the date of the recital tonight she interrupted with a scowl seven oclock i texted you i emailed im sorry give me time please lifes a little he exchanged looks with his colleague hectic right now middleton strode over to the tall wardrobe in the living room a hulking ugly piece of furniturethe only outofplace item in the room and one hidden in shadow so that it couldnt be seen from the long double window that gave out onto the street the cottage was in a narrow georgian lane in a backwater of bloomsbury walking distance from the west end and the concert hall where she was due that afternoon for a final rehearsal it was a quiet discreetly wealthy part of central london away from the crowds and the tourists a village almost when he threw open the wardrobes doors felicia found herself looking at the object she had found there when she was poking around the place two days before after arriving from new yorka black heavyduty metal security cabinet with a rotary combination lock like that of an oldfashioned safe middleton dialed the numbers then pulled on the handle to open the door felicia caught her breath though in truth she knew she shouldnt have been surprised a small armorypistols rifles boxes of ammunitions other items she didnt recognizewas neatly lined up inside leonora tesla put down her shoulder bag joined him and starting picking at the hardware middleton had brought two grey holdalls for their booty the two of them looked like a couple in a fancy chocolate store trying to decide what delicacies to take away with them so the volunteers are back in business felicia said supply and demand kid tesla replied taking down what looked like a pack of small metal balls grenades of some kind maybe be grateful youre in a nicer business middleton and tesla were so utterly absorbed felicia didnt feel too bad about poking around at something else while they were so preoccupied after a minute she said i am grateful yet still in your new job you find time to buy nice jewelry nora is this for you they stopped packing weaponry into the soft grey cases and turned to look in her delicate pale fingers felicia held the glittering object that had caught her attention as leonora tesla placed her bag on a chair by the dining table the top half open the article was enclosed in a transparent plastic evidence packet and tagged with a nato label bearing the previous days date and what sounded like a french name it occurred to felicia that they must have been in a hurry indeed if they sought weapons before delivering what must she imagined have been something of importance you know when we first got to know one another i dont recall you being in the habit of going through peoples things middleton told her i got older harold quickly you remember with the company you introduced me to it seemed to make sense what is this she opened the evidence bag and removed the gleaming bright bracelet studying it closely when she was done she examined the two other items that had been alongside it a slip of paper and a recent indian passport in the name of kavi balan the photo inside showed an inoffensivelooking indian man perhaps with a bland perhaps naïve face he had she thought very prominent and unusual eyes and wondered whether they had noticed probably not harold middleton and leonora tesla were both intelligent hardworking officers trapped felicia had observed inside an organization they seemed unable to leave but small details often escaped them they possessed neither the time nor the inclination to look much beyond the obvious our business not yours middleton announced hes dead i imagine she said and they didnt reply didnt you notice his eyes she was stalling and they knew it as she spoke she scanned the sheet of paper the writing was in harold middletons hand easily recognizable for its cultured yet hurried scrawl it read kashmir search for water geology copper bracelet scorpion devras sikari it sounds like a puzzle she said i love riddles i never knew you did i hate them what does scorpion refer to it was a reference in an email from sikari i think its a person but i dont know if hes allied with sikari or is a threat to him the bracelet is beautiful it looked like copper though the color was lighter more golden than most bangles of its type in poland copper wristbands were popular among the elderly who believed they warded off rheumatism and disease the jewelry she saw hawked around the cheap street markets in warsaw looked nothing like this the metal here was softer paler as if it were some kind of subtle alloy the edges flecked with green more finely worked with a line of writing in a flowing incomprehensible indian script and most curious of all an oval feature like a badge a mark of pride for its wearer perhaps what does this mean she asked i wish i knew he replied we think its from kashmir an identity bracelet maybe denoting membership in a gang a cult an organization of some kind presumably the emblems stand for something it could be connected with india or pakistan theyve been fighting one another over kashmir for half a century i need to get it to the lab get the inscription translated felicia stared at it and frowned you have any ideas he asked what some little kid polish musician what would i know she looked at the copper bracelet again you never do crosswords do you i told you i hate puzzles thats because you think logically in one direction only crosswords are like bach or jazz they demand you think in several different directions simultaneously call and response question and answer all in the same moment she examined the bracelet again the point is all the information you need is there in front of your face nothing is missing you just have to make the links middleton looked interested it was the mention of bach that did it my problem she added is i still think in polish not english i love crosswords but theyre too hard for me in your language i used to wish you could see them instead of read them you know what i mean look at cross pictures not words that way language isnt so important they had what weapons they wanted they were ready to go middleton held out his hand and she passed to him the note and the photograph of the dead indian with the curious eyes he placed them back in the evidence packet and slipped them into his carryall she clung to the copper bangle waiting for the question if the pictures on the bracelet were a crossword middleton asked what do you think they might mean leonora tesla shook her head were giving these to a bunch of forensic people harry not a crossword expert thats a shame felicia said they looked at her because middleton asked she pointed at the moon on the bracelet this would be the answer i think the part that is calling see how its separate and the other two elements are subsidiary to it as if their response somehow answers everything the elephant the way he blows his trunk comically into the sky like a fountain except that the liquid doesnt go very far does it the stream falls to earth so quickly as if it weighs more than it should this seems obvious to me obvious he asked look its an elephant the biggest land animal on the planet whats he doing trying to spray the moon and failing two words maybe its me being crazy but remember i was born in the year of chernobyl we werent far away five hundred kilometers maybe at school they came along every six months and took our blood to see if the explosion had done something bad to us that blunt needle the same one they used on everyone hurt which was why she had read so avidly to understand its cause she put her finger on the carefully carved beast on the bracelet and said heavy then she indicated the fountain of liquid rising from the beast toward the sky and falling back again too quickly water felicia kaminski couldnt help but notice that harold middleton went a little paler when she said that chernobyl happened because there was no heavy water she said quickly the russians used some cheap and useless method of their own to produce a nuclear reactor which was why the plant exploded im sorry this is doubtless just me as to the moon ive no idea they didnt say anything for a moment as middleton looked at her his benign bland face creased with concern youre practicing here for the rest of the day he asked practice practice practice after a while stay indoors ill arrange a cab to the wigmore hall and a hotel for you this evening pack your things leave your bag here when you go to the concert well pick it up for you later but they didnt wait for anything except a few short pleasantries felicia kaminski watched them go wishing they could have stayed a little longer she knew no one in london she felt a little lonely and bored practice she hissed if i practice one more time ill go mad as the door closed she picked up a piece of paper and scribbled down the words she remembered from harold middletons note some forensics people would be running through every last one to try to forge a link maybeshe was worried slightly by the look on middletons face when she threw in her idea about the braceletthey would be looking to see what the term heavy water meant in relation to india pakistan and the kashmir question quite a lot possibly not that she wanted to think much about that the dark shadow chernobyl had cast over eastern europe had never quite lifted from her she looked at the grandfather clock by the fireplace two hours remained before she had to leave a little less if she packed as middleton had wanted she had time there was something else she could use too something she felt sure middleton and tesla would never have countenanced felicia kaminski went to her laptop computer and pulled up the web page for bicchu the new search engine shed stumbled upon only a month ago it was all the rage in the social networks the answers were sharp and relevant almost as if someone were reading the question then thinking about its context and perspective before responding it felt smart and human not part of some dumb machine best of all bicchu promised to pay you for being online for typing in queries and following through on the results just a few cents but it was something for all the glamour of an appearance at the wigmore hall she still felt like a music student when she looked at her bank balance it would be years before she could even hope to command a reliable income felicia glanced down and typed in the words on her scribbled note kashmir search for water geology copper bracelet scorpion devras sikari then she added a phrase of her own heavy water and another copper ring around the eyes it took longer than normal for the answers to appear a good seconds must have been middletons broadband connection she thought he sat in the restaurant near piccadilly circus glued to the iphone theyd given him working the private application that linked through the mobile network securely privately to the field hq hed no idea where that was in kashmir in paris two doors away in the heart of london it was irrelevant the days of fixed bases of dangerous safe houses and physical networks capable of penetration all these things were in the past it was thirteen months since hed last met another comrade in person as far as he knew anyway orders came via secure encrypted email delivered to a series of everchanging addresses plans and projects arrived as password protected zipped pdfs read absorbed and then deleted forever this was the way of the world everything was virtual nothing was real except he reminded himself blood and money a youtube video had just begunthe trailer for some new bollywood moviewhen the phone throbbed and flashed up an alert it took a second or two for the signal to deal with the amount of data that followed then as the little handset caught up he watched as a series of web search requests were mirrored to his little screen the results narrowed constantly the scope and scale of the queries made him realize why theyd got in touch a small window in the upper right hand corner showed the ip address of the source it was in central london somewhere near the british museum he tapped a few buttons there was a pause then he found himself in the my documents folder of the remote computer a long list of correspondence was stored there it was all encrypted he hunted around the remote hard drive until he found the folder where the word processor stored its templates unseen often forgotten by those who used them sure enough when he got there he found a single file marked personal letter it was open unsecured by encryption just text he clicked the icon and the document drew itself on the screen of the phone dragging his finger across the letters he managed to copy the address into a note then he clicked a button in the private app marked keylog all remote every letter and number typed on the distant machine would now be echoed directly into a file somewhere in the bicchu system then passed on discreetly encrypted from beginning to end to his phone where the private app would decode the text automatically after that he copied the house number and street in the heading and pasted them into google maps he knew the general area it was no more than ten minutes away on foot pocketing the iphone he walked back into the kitchen it was full of the familiar smells cumin and turmeric a tandoori oven and scorched spiced chicken the sous chef watched him come in as if half expecting what was about to happen the little man from bangladesh was staring mutinously at an office lunch booking for sixteen it had been pinned to the order board just thirty minutes before you can cope he said taking off his apron and his stained tocque then he walked out of the back stopping only to collect his little walther pistol on the way bicchu was feeling talkative soon the answers began to come so quickly her head started to spin she thought of the fearful years after chernobyl the pain the uncertainty and the school friends she lost two who died slowly almost in front of everyone day by day this was the world of the past or so shed thought a world of hard cruel science in the thrall of men who didnt care about the consequences of their actions watching the hints and clues and links begin to assemble as minutes turned to an hour she felt herself both repelled and attracted by what she was uncovering this was important she knew and forbidden terrible knowledge after one significant breakthrough she tore herself away from the computer made herself a cup of green tea felt briefly guilty about neglecting her instrument and chose instead to listen to one of her favorite renditions of the piece she would play later a fellow pole henryk szeryng playing his famed guarneri del gesu le duc for deutsche grammophon in fourteen and a half minutes of bliss then she went back and looked at what shed found a lot too much it made her mind turn in on itself craving the peace and simple faith of the music she called middletons cell phone there was no answer there wasnt even the chance to leave a message thats not your real number is it harold she said to herself half listening to szeryng tackle the music with a studied assurance she hoped one day she might possess he wondered what would happen in the restaurant with him gone the bangladeshi was competent but slow it was still a business still a place that needed to look after its customers later he thought the top end of lambs conduit street after the pubs and shops was deserted everyone had gone to work this was good the only vehicle around was a large black van with opaque windows on a meter at the park end of the street children leapt and danced in the little playground on the other side of the road he glanced at the van and shook his head london mothers they wouldnt let their precious little princes walk half a mile any more she typed what shed discovered into an email for middleton and made sure to mark it for encryption adding the digital signature hed convinced her to use always on the net no one could read what shed written once it traveled beyond her computer and middleton could be assured the message really came from her not some imposter who knew how to spoof an email address fact one she wrote and she shivered as she was unable to force the true import of her words from her mind the picture of the dead man kavi balan what you didnt notice was the very peculiar green brown tint to his eyes that may be normal but it may be a symptom of copper poisoning due to very heavy exposure to the metal look up kayserfleischer ring for more information the discoloration is caused by copper deposits in the eye she looked at her notes then checked her watch six minutes to the end of the bach then she really would practice fact two india is the worlds largest producer of heavy water this is a very resourceintensive exercise depending on the process it can take up to tons of ordinary water ho to make one ton of heavy water do thats deuterium haroldlook it up maybe this is why your people are looking for new sources the tea was getting tepid remember what i told you about chernobyl and heavy water you dont always need it but if you want to produce weapongrade plutonium its a wonderful way of bypassing the uranium enrichment process which involves a lot of technological infrastructure thats impossible to hide not that heavy water is easy to manufacture but the process is a little like distilling cognac from wine the difference is the conventional process uses a phosphorbronze system to handle the distillation process whereas liquor is traditionally made using a copper still she looked at the words on the page and felt proud of herself or more accurately of bicchu which had thrown up the answers so quickly she could scarcely believe the ease with which they had been assembled fact three eleven years ago a patent was filed in the us for a new heavywater development process as far as i can see its never been put into industrial production because some of the technology isnt in place to go large scale yet the patent was lodged by the us subsidiary of an indian company that appears to be a shell outfit at least i cant see any financial filings for it in the us or in india shed retrieved the entire submission from the us patents office database for free and saved it as a separate document sikaris name is on the patent too along with a couple of other people according to the patent submission the process would halve the amount of feed water normally needed to distill heavy water shorten the process considerably and allow for minimal startup costs you could almost see it as a diy kit for making the raw material for a plutonium plant and always save the best for last the dead henryk szeryng bowing away at his guarneri in the background did the particular circular piping structure used for the process is at the heart of the patent its what makes it unique the filing calls it the copper bracelet except this one happens to be thirty feet tall she finished the cold tea and listened to the music enter its final closing phase the doorbell rang as she hit send felicia cursed the interruption one of the less attractive aspects of lambs conduit street was the number of people who came to private houses trying to sell everything from fake dvds to chinese paintings middleton had a little sign by the front of the house no hawkers it was useless this being england he didnt have a door video camera there was trust in a quiet upperclass street like this along with big powerful locks and a hightech alarm system the bell rang once more while she was walking out of the living room into the corridor i dont want any she shouted and was surprised to hear an american twang in her voice two years in new york did this to you she guessed she unlocked the latch and half opened the door a stocky man of middle eastern appearance was standing there he was no more than wore a chelsea football shirt under a jacket a trendy slickedback haircut and the kind of stupid selfsatisfied grin some young london men liked to sport when they encountered the opposite sex i dont want any she repeated with a sigh he looked pleased with himself and held up what looked like a brand new iphone her email to harold middleton was there with the last few paragraphs including the words except this one happens to be thirty feet tall visible in large black lettering puzzled felicia kaminski blinked you got it anyway the man said she drew back to slam the door in his face the wood hit something along the way she heard a yelp of pain but he was through and there was no way of getting him outside again a glancing blow struck her cheek and she stumbled toward the living room and grabbed the wooden inner door sending it flying behind her he got struck hard in the face a second time and yelled again anger hurt she liked both of them she propped herself against the sofa trying to think trying to locate something that might pass as a weapon hey he said he had his hands up and looked offended his right eye had gone purple from where the door had caught him we just want to talk he said thats all who wants to talk she asked still looking feeling behind the sofa with her right hand some big guys they dont mean you no harm they told me that they just want you to visit there are nicer ways to ask he reached into his jacket with his free hand and took out a handgun there are nastier ones too alive isnt the same as undamaged you choose little girl one way or another youre coming with me szeryng was playing one of her most cherished passages felicia kaminski hated this anonymous man for ruining it she looked him in the eye and said they wont hurt me thats a promise a promise he still had the iphone in his left hand she watched the way he held it the obvious affection he had for the thing she put a hand to her head and let down her long brown hair she had fastened for practice he watched her smiling again isnt that like the new version she asked pointing at the phone the one with gps or something they all loved them sometimes it seemed there was nothing more precious on the planet yeah he held it a little higher and pressed a button a video of mia began to play on the screen i got she was wearing the pointed leather boots shed bought in a gucci outlet place near san giovanni those needlelike toes were going out of fashion but she liked them she took one strong step forward let her right leg fall back a little to gain momentum then let loose with a kick as hard as she could manageright where it hurt most he screamed the gun went sideways she took his wrist and punched it back against the sharp edge of the wardrobe that contained harold middletons armory the weapon clattered to the floor the iphone he held on to but not after the second kick by then he was on the ground squirming looking madder than ever if he gets up im dead she thought her hand strayed to the nearest available object she felt it and wanted to cry it was the precious bela szepessy that harold middleton had bought for her the finest musical instrument felicia kaminski had ever owned she smashed the bonehard composite chin rest hard into his face the bottom of the fiddle tore away from the body immediately it was gone and she knew it so she took the neck in both hands swung the centuryold instrument round like a mallet dashing the jagged wood into his head until he fell once more to the floor his nose a bloody mess his eyes filling with pain and fear there was an old vase big and heavy within reach she let go of the ruined violin picked up the vase and threw it at his head hitting him square on the temple he went quiet quickly efficiently she snatched a set of spare metal strings from her fiddle case kicked him over onto his chest put one knee on his spine and bound his hands behind then his feet by the time shed finished he was coming to again he wasnt moving anywhere she was thorough just in case she bent down retrieved his gun and held the weapon tightly in her right hand hating the feel of the thing with tears beginning to well in her eyes she looked at the ruined remnants of her fiddle and then the crushed man on the floor and said i am not little and i am not a girl a noise made her look up the front door was still open she could see it from the living room and cursed herself for being so stupid a tall gangly man with exceptionally pale skin and an ugly face was marching through the door looking both scared and determined at the same time felicia kaminski wanted to say something but at that moment her mind locked szeryngs luscious rendition of the bach partita was reaching its final note a delicious d played double stringed one open one fingered with vibrato then dying into silence she loved that touch and had wished for so long that one day she might emulate it tonight maybe in the wigmore hall tonight it took pierre crane one strike to knock the weapon out of the fingers of the slender prettyplain young woman and a second to render her unconscious as she stood dumbfounded over a man who lay bound on the floor face swollen yet still visibly terrified she crashed down in a heap next to him cranes eyes strayed around the room there was no one else in the little house he could sense this crane made a fast search of the flatwhich belonged to harold middleton the american that the driver of the car outside of paris had warned him about he found what looked like a gun safe and scanned through a number of documents and notes on the desk find anything helpful pierre said a female voice behind him one so calm and unflustered it made his blood turn cold sent his hand dashing for the gun in the holster beneath his jacket something stabbed into his shoulder before his fingers got halfway dont be foolish she said he turned and saw the woman he now knew as jana she held a long black handgun with a lengthy silencer a professional weapon she looked at him carefully her gaze reminiscent of what had passed between them on that deserted twolane road outside of paris not long before we meet again pierre crane gave a faint laugh though he shivered at the memory of the bullets snapping against the windows of the limo you know me you do your background work as a reporter jana shrugged i do the same in my line which told crane that she had indeed followed him to the meeting outside of paris with the man posing as the scorpion wheres middleton she asked i dont know the woman he works with tesla crane shook his head i dont know her in the distance the urgent bray of a police siren grew closer had someone reported a disturbance seen a weapon she grimaced looking at the flat and apparently realized she had no time for a thorough search jana ordered take the girl outside theres a van there she hesitated go with her i will join you in a moment you dont think ill run a smile no why he asked trying to see some window of attack realizing from her careful stance and the steady gaze in her eye this was impossible nor was he sure he wanted to somethingthe journalist within him or the mantold him to simply go with what was happening because youre after the truth arent you pierre jana reached out and removed the weapon from his jacket then she watched as he picked up the unconscious young woman in his arms and walked outside there was a mercedes van with opaque windows by the front door and a driver in a black uniform gloves and a cap sliding open the rear door as crane reached the gate with the girl in his arms he heard the sound from behind and recognized immediately what it was the low explosive growl of a silenced weapon followed by a curt agonized shriek of pain one that lasted a second no more jim fusilli a gray morning in paris had given way to a lovely tranquil afternoon and as she crossed the place de la concorde and entered the pebbly pathway that cleaved the jardin des champs élysées she reviewed her day an early jog along avenue george v across the seine at point d alma back through the parc du champ de mars and under the tour eiffel a shower in her room at the hotel queen elizabeth on pierre er de serbie and in a thin peach vneck sweater jeans and a short buttery leather jacket shed bought for a small fortune in usd at a shop on boulevard saint germain a walk around the corner to the hotel george v for a bowl of oatmeal sprinkled with brown sugar as she read the wall street journal europe and usa today then she went back to the queen elizabeth sat on the floor with her back to her unmade bed and sobbed it wasnt working come to paris her father had said you need a little magic thanks no harry too many memories shed replied charley maybe youll make new memories he said gently taking her hand we need you among the living we really do but everywhere in paris reminded her of what shed lost her baby the miscarriage induced by of all people her late husband who was part of a conspiracy that took her mothers life as well every day was a relentless replay of what couldve been and what would never be even now as she strolled through dappled sunlight under leafy trees whose branches crowned the pathway she saw young children toddling comically as they chased pigeons their contented mothers smiling as they watched nothing else existed for her at that moment neither the dignified old men in their brown suits who chatted knowingly the businessmen and women on the champs élysées who were making their way back to their offices nor the tourists wandering toward the obelisque and jardin des tuileries all she saw were stout laughing children and their beaming mothers and she felt the weight of hopelessness and a profound hammering sense of loss she knew she would never be whole again and would never trust any man enough to love him as for a child of her own she feared she would never be able to provide the sense of security and optimism the child would need to thrive she was counting her days wondering when she would be consumed by the void inside her and so all that remained for charlotte middletonshed returned to her maiden name when she learned the extent of her husbands participation in a plot to kill thousands in washington dcwas the work she was doing for the volunteers her father had told her he needed her it was possible that he did protesting shed said harry i cant given how pointless how empty damn it i wish i could explain so youd know charley he replied when i think about what my life would be without you i know at a kiosk near the théatre marigny she bought a sandwich of thin slices of ham a sliver of gruyere and salty butter on crunchy bread and a bottle of badoit and sat on a bench in a stream of sunlight the étoile and the arc de triomphe in the distance the relentless traffic coursing along the cobblestone in an attempt to dispatch her thoughts she recalled some of the research shed done for the volunteers her mind wandered to connie carson and the bravado instilled in every task undertaken by that little texas firebrand and then to wiki cheungs fascination with second life and how the adorable yearold computer geek had given himself a black avatar with a s afro and chiseled body any athlete would kill for try it wiki had suggested everybody needs someplace to be somebody new as soon as the words passed his lips he recoiled in embarrassment im not saying your life is not good charley no what im sayingim saying charley the gamemaybe youll make new friendsif you want new friends charley ah damn it around the same time leonora tesla who she admired more so now that she understood what the volunteers had achieved had asked her to join her for a drink after hours theyd gone to a latin lounge in dupont circle where they were surrounded by careless singles floating between youth and responsibilities six fresh faces crammed at tables for four giddy conversations rose over bubbling music charley tesla shouted heres my advice dont take any advice listen to your own heart in your own time now on the champs élysées reflecting on those memories fourthousand miles away charley watched a tour bus scored with hangul script wheezed to a halt blocking traffic she grimaced as taxi horns blared and then returned to her solitude perhaps yards behind charlotte middleton in the park was a selfsatisfied man in his s tanned with saltandpepper hair his blue suit cut to perfection was impressive even in the arrondissement that hosted the houses of saint laurent dior chanel and lacroix as he sat he removed a silk handkerchief from an inner pocket and wiped the sides of his berlutti shoes removing a coat of dust his cell phone vibrated as he returned the kerchief to its post im on middletons daughter he said in paris ill stay with her he hung up without waiting for a response ian barrettbone had gotten over the shock of nearly being gunned to death on a road outside of paris he and his employer were used to wielding money and threats of violenceand violence itselfto force people to do the most despicable things many of them sputtered and swore and promised to get even but few did jana was different of course barrettbone himself was motivated by money and thrill he considered a desk job the purest of tortures but jana what drove her idealism he supposed how childish a motive how meddlesome yet her appearance on that road outside paris was a sharp reminder of the danger everyone was facing how many other deaths would occurall because of the copper bracelet he watched as charley rose from the bench she took a long final swig of the sparkling water and tossed its green plastic bottle in the trash along with the heel of the bread then she thought better of it retrieved the bread crumpled it and offered the crumbs to pecking pigeons she couldnt be more american if she tried barrettbone muttered to himself as he regarded the attractive woman with a measure of disgust he glanced at his patek phillippe wristwatch as he resumed following middletons daughter from a discrete distance he imagined she would continue to wander aimlessly her guard down defenses nonexistent felicia kaminski now conscious and pierre crane sat side by side in the back row of the mercedes van their wrists cuffed together with plastic their ankles tied to each others the driver had managed to shackle them in seconds while jana trained her gun at the two captives a double beep of a cell phone sounded jana answered she spoke in a language crane took to be hindi then she spun to face the prisoners i have just learned she said in thickly accented english that you are not charlotte middleton felicia said nothing jana barked at crane who is she i have no idea i can ask her but it will have to be in english but i dont think she speaks french you jana said in halting english what your name is felicia jana looked at crane is french she said in english is polish he replied in french he was going to mention her accent but knew jana couldnt detect it no more than he could distinguish between an algerian or a moroccan when they spoken french she may be his maid a maid who can fight i think she was defending herself a lucky blow with the instrument you have the wrong girl crane knew they were heading southeast i think shes a little off he added incompetent you know felicia seemed to will herself not to stare at him not to stomp his foot jana had cranes gun in her lap let her go the reporter said the driver glanced at jana let her go and ill help you crane was after a story he was after jana he had no quarrel with the young woman how how can you help me im searching for the scorpion and so are you i know things about him i saw your face when you noticed the men in the limo you were disappointed neither of them was him give me a fact something i can use and youll let her go she stared at him maybe i kill you and her jana replied or maybe i help you and nobody dies pay for one life yours or hers give me a fact crane thought for a moment what would be dear to her yet not give too much away theres a dubai connection dubai what thats all ill tell you for now for my own protection jana debated then she turned to the driver and spoke in arabic dump her by the o she said we keep him middleton stood on the drivers side of his car his head hung in frustration the london address jeanmarc lespasse found on kavi balans computer was a mosque just south of tufnell park a thriving neighborhood in north london populated by hundreds of muslims and far far fewer hindus the mosque had a noxious reputation its new moderate leadership couldnt quite erase before his conviction for murder and racial hatred its previous imam advocated jihad with suicide bombing its primary formno one seemed to doubt his involvement in the attacks supporting alqaedas violent activities it had offered training in assault weapons and served as a clearinghouse for untraceable telecommunications equipment a ruse he said a joke from the opposite side of the car tesla replied not necessarily maybe someone hereshe nodded toward the mosque and the squat brick buildings that lined the streetknows of an attack on the mosque it might not be a dead end but its a lead that will take weeks of infiltrating to develop we dont have the time not with whats going on tesla tugged on the car door but it was locked youre right we need to strategize middleton dug into his pocket and tossed her the keys take the car he said he gestured in the direction of the tufnell park underground station im going to wigmore hall to see felicia it was damned thoughtless of me to forget her recital lose the weapons and catch up with me if youd like we can talk to connie and jeanmarc once they get settled in tampa middleton emerged from the underground at oxford circus amused by how quick the trip had been even with the transfer at euston he imagined nora still on the motorway if traffic was lurching by instinct he checked his common cell phone first one message from felicia probably chiding him for failing to remember her recital or his lack of interest in crossword puzzles cryptograms and such when he looked at his encrypted phone he saw he had no messagesnothing from nato the french interpol or the icc as a postmortem on the cap dantibes operation nor from charley nora jeanmarc connie or wiki as he crossed the park at cavendish square he thought for a moment of wetherby the bright nato officer who gave his life to help prevent another godless execution of innocents to steel himself from grief long ago middleton learned to shift his thoughts quickly to the mission at hand to complete it would honor the likes of young wetherby sikari and fresh water devras sikari had developed an interest in fresh water what could it mean middleton left the park and as he waited for black cabs to pass he saw a crowd milling under the halls glassandfiligreediron marquee ticketholders he assumed waiting to enter not that he wouldve delayed he loved the halls alabasterandmarble walls the painting in the cupola over the stage in which a figure representing the soul of music stared in awe at a fireball that stood for the genius of harmony the wigmore stage was an altar and the music represented an offering to the heavens for middleton music was mankinds link to divinity it was his respite his relief from the ugly banal truth of the world of anguish and hatred in which he found himself while pursuing the likes of devras sikari only watching charley blossom had given him a feeling of contentment and transcendence as had the music he loved is there a problem he said to the first patron he saw a middleaged woman dressed against the threat of rain they arent opening quite yet she replied but they havent said exactly why middleton thanked her and headed toward the artists entrance around the corner on wimpole street hed never known felicia to be an overly demanding artist so he assumed the problem was with the house perhaps the pianist had taken ill his encrypted phone rang its call an oldfashioned american bell chime rather than an identifying ring tone like the chopin hed had on his other line harry tesla said nora harry youd better come home jeanmarc lespasse caught up with connie carson on the concourse at tampa international airport he smiled as he saw her volley with a sweet smile the attentions of one of the men who had tried to woo her on the flight from nice through paris from his seat several rows behind her lespasse watched as one male passenger after another found a reason to approach her connie wasnt the only appealing woman on the flight but she glowed with that sort of naïve funloving selfconfidence men were drawn to like bees to bluebells as was her way she managed to tell each one to buzz off with so much charm that they hadnt realized theyd been swatted there you are she cheered as lespasse approached the last man quickly withdrew and carson lifted her bloated leather satchel hoisting the strap on her shoulder she hooked her arm in his and they strode off the picture of a happy couple check your pda she asked so i guess im the lucky fellow dont start jeanmarc a few of those boys had me searching for a parachute she released his arm you get the same message from wiki she nodded big files ill use a computer in the executive lounge he said and ill get the rental car give me your bag connie give me the damned bag lespasse had seen carson dislocate a mans nose with a blow so swift he wouldve sworn her hand never left her side yes maam he replied they met minutes later carson leaning against the hood of a prius in a nostanding zone where to she asked as she opened the passenger door when carson jumped behind the wheel lespasse read from his notes get on interstate two hundred seventyfive east she laughed as she pulled from the curb i love how you say that interstate two hundred seventyfive east all formal and such itwo hundred seventy five east is better two seventyfive east will do how long have you lived in america jeanmarc almost ten years he said he slid on his sunglasses as they drove into stark sunlight beyond the airport grounds tampa was as bright as nice had been ten years and its still interstate and all that tired i guess anxious same she said you came here to work with the colonel well i had worked with him before but yes harold middleton was the reason i came to america you couldve stayed in france my wife preferred north carolina your wife jeanmarc i didnt know you were married she looked at the third finger on his left hand no ring we worked together at technologie de demain your company she began as a systems analystwhich was not the reason i noticed her i can tell you but johanna was very clever very precise soon she was invaluable to me and of course i was in love she was tooif im hearing you right lucky for me carson checked the passenger side view and eased toward the highway the first exit lespasse said dont get on interdont get on route four the prius took the ramp with ease jeanmarc i see youre not wearing a ring he undid the top buttons of his oxford and withdrew a chain he wore around his neck it was looped around a gold wedding band jeanmarc she was killed on september at the pentagon a newbusiness presentation scheduled for in the morning she was early as usual we had no chance for the business of course but that was johanna a fighter very american like you connie carson saw his bittersweet smile jeanmarc im so sorry as am i thank you lespasse peered through the windshield theres the exit carson tapped the blinker cookiecutter she said as they approached the long onestory building in the corner of an industrial park just short of mckay bay glass and steel they throw down a foundation and drop em out of the sky yes but this one has palm trees lespasse said there were fedex dhl and ups boxes out front and a tin box labeled doolittle diagnostics with a warning that it contained blood products on the first floor drawn blinds revealed an empty lunchroom with vending machines and newspapers scattered on tabletops carson and lespasse entered the vestibule to look at a blackboard dotted with white plastic letters sindhu power electric he said twentysix south so theyre still here unless no one cared to change the sign we can imagine sikari has been here perhaps he returned ok but i dont guess well find him at a desk no lespasse said as he continued to study the board but lets see what we can see they stepped toward the receptionist a young brownskinned woman who was hiding a college textbook under the crescentshaped desktop she greeted them with a warm smile and a cuban accent lespasse said my wife and i have an appointment with dr faraday carson nodded we know the way the receptionist hesitated you can go she said finally as they turned onto a long carpeted corridor carson said dr faraday his office is eighteen south ah the wooden doors to each office were closed muting the buzz of activity at the end of the hall two women were using a smaller reception area to review a presentation on a laptop lespasse followed carson along a dogleg turn and soon they passed dr faradays office twentysix south was at the end of the hall and carson realized its windows faced the parking lot which teemed with cars glistening in the afternoon sun whats the play she said lespasse dug into his wallet and pulled out a technologie de demain business card a cold call he said i will ask for the head of it you think theyll have staff here i mean this office is probably the biggest on this side of the building but its a shell if anything i suppose you can file a patent from a post office box why go to the expense of opening an office if you dont intend to use it carson reached for the door ready he held up a finger forgive me but i will put on a heavy accent maybe it will explain why im so so wrinkled she smiled at least youre wearing slacks im in jeans and a tshirt yes but your tshirt is the same color as your boots and no one wears jeans like you connie maybe men on our flights will swear to that he didnt mention the makeup she applied at the airport nor the lipstick she refreshed before they left the car well to be safe im calling you boss très bien lespasse replied carson swung open the door and lespasse stepped inside the office was empty thin wires dangled from displaced ceiling panels and a few telephone handsets sat on the floor there was room for perhaps desks but there were none in sight the airconditioner had been turned off as carson passed him lespasse switched on the overhead lights they flickered then glowed someone paid the bill he said carson had stepped into a private office it too was empty its carpet musty and soiled its closet flung open and bare so much for sindhu power electric across the office space was another closet the kind that held paper products outofdate files in cardboard boxes maybe a space for jackets and personal effects someone had started to clean itprobably to get the place ready to lease again together carson and lespasse went through it and found nothing enlighteningexcept for a blank label from an international shipping company shed never heard of she also found a discarded postit note call moscow hours carson jotted down the information thats it she sighed when someone skedaddles they usually leave something behind she looked around the blinds were drawn tight but under the overhead lights she could see there was dust everywhereon the ledge below the windows on the phones on the floor every door inside the suite was flung open except for another closet door maybe they have lespasse said as he approached it lets see what we as lespasse pulled open the door an explosion burst from the closet rattling the building the force flung him across the room a fireball trailing him as the windows shattered throwing glass and debris onto the parking lot carson awoke under the flood of water raining from the overhead sprinklers through ringing ears she heard sirens drawing nearer she tasted blood in her mouth she tried to stand to find lespasse but couldnt manage collapsing she lost consciousness again and dropped to the damp carpet john gilstrap felicia fought to control her hammering heart and by so doing control her racing head she didnt understand what her captors were saying but she easily comprehended the body language they were angry but in a way that went beyond whatever prompted them to take her twice while the woman was on the telephone jabbering in what she assumed to be an arabic dialect the word charlotte rose above the gibberish and each iteration brought increased levels of ire the pieces fell into place easily theyd thought she was charley middleton and why wouldnt they she was in harolds house after all and she and charley were close enough in age that it would be a simple conclusion that she was his daughter oh god my bela szepessy she whined silently of all the potential weapons at her disposal why did she have to choose something so valuablesomething so close to her soul after the bitch with the gun hung up her phone the heated discussion with her fellow captive confused her they seemed to have the kind of knowingif uneasyrelationship that comes of people who have worked together before why then was felicia bound to this man and why did he continue to speak to his captor in tones that were as cordial as they were laced with fear each in turn looked right at her as they spoke clearly she was the focus of their disappointment felicia knew she was in trouble when the woman talked directly to the driver it was something about the way she made a tossing movement with her head at once dismissive and definite a moment later the driver changed lanes and headed for an offramp they were going to get rid of her they were going to kill her at this point given all that had happened what choice did they have hadnt they already killed one of their own back in harolds flat murder was murder in the eyes of the law whether you killed one or twenty if they were done with herand she was certain they weretheyd be crazy not to kill her it was just a matter of when and how her heart continued to slam itself into her breastbone as she weighed her options the clarity of her thinking shocked her even as she determined that she in fact had no options carson dialed back slowly into her surroundings there was light and there was pain though considerably more of the former than the latter as she climbed out of the dark well that was her unconsciousness she had the odd nonsensical thought that she was living in a bowl of red jello the light had a certain red tinge to it so that was part of the illusion but she could talk herself into believing that her head had been crammed with the stuff as well hearing was muted and her sinuses felt as if they had been stuffed with cotton closer to the mouth of the well the light grew brighter still and the buzzing drone of which shed been barely aware finetuned itself into voices any time now i cant say for certain of course but i dont think i need to speak to her as soon as possible who who did they need to speak to what was the urgency and why wouldnt man a allow man b to do whatever the hell he wanted as the voices clarified so did the pain it was as bright and red and piercing as the light and now equally inescapable it radiated from the base of her neck down her right arm to the ends of her fingernails and inward toward her belly button with that kind of pain youd think youd have some idea where it came from maybe thats what they wanted to talk to that other person about maybe she could tell them all why she felt as though shed rolled in razor blades and swum in alcohol it was a terrible image but something about it amused her razor blades and alcohol throw in a little fire to boot fire thered been a fire jeanmarc she had to warn him he was in danger she opened her mouth to scream but the well wouldnt let her not yet yelling as loudly as she could all she could produce was a moan look out she shrieked but there was no sound shes stirring a voice said shes waking up yes tell her about jeanmarc warn him connie yes im here connie can you hear me the light grew brighter still and some of the color drained away help me im here pull me up jeanmarc is she still out of it doc another voice asked this one wasnt as friendly wasnt friendly at all in fact shes coming to the first voice said hello connie i need you to wake up for me wake up wake up from what from the explosion oh jesus jeanmarc was taken by the she returned to consciousness with a giant gasp the sheer effort of it made her jump and the jumping added more alcohol to the razor blades the light turned to white and surrounding the white there was even more white and then a face staring down at her his silhouette mercifully casting a shadow over her eyes hello connie the face said he spoke english but with a thick accent that she knew she recognized but couldnt quite place it was indian maybe pakistani just where the hell was she jeanmarc she said to her own ears her voice sounded normal if distant but the angle of the mans head told her that she was wrong save jeanmarc she insisted she tried to sit up but that proved impossible the instant her wounds flashed again connie youre fine the face said youre in a hospital i am doctor ahmed youve been in an accident fragments of a thousand accidents raced through her mind how did she get to india or pakistan where am i you are in tampa general hospital you were flown here by helicopter tampa she said testing the word tampa florida it was coming back to her the abandoned office the dust the closet is jeanmarc ok she asked but as her head cleared even more the true imagery of that moment crystallized for her there was no way he could have survived that blast ms carson another man said from off to her left it was the other man whod seemed unfriendly as she was climbing out of the jello well my name is detective langer with the tampa police department i need you to answer some questions for me she moved to look at him but another stab of pain stopped her what happened there was an explosion langer said carson snapped i know there was an explosion i was there i meant what happened to me why do i hurt so badly you broke your right arm the doctor said in three places and there are some burns her stomach flipped bad burns she asked it was the injury that she feared perhaps more than any other the pain the disfigurement youll need some surgery but i need to talk with you first langer interrupted a bomb like this we need as much information as quickly as we can get it you can say no if you dont feel up to it the doctor said actually you cant langer said not if you want to avoid obstruction of justice charges either one of you all over the world police forces drew their personnel from the same breed then why dont you stand where i can see you carson said langer turned out to be a ken doll sixone with a head of thick blond hair he wore khaki slacks and a blue knit shirt that made her wonder if her misfortune hadnt pulled him off the golf course tell me what happened he said it took all of two minutes to relate the facts when she was done she concluded jeanmarc is dead isnt he langer nodded his eyes showed pity but she sensed that it was manufactured yes im afraid he is you never said why you were there i know carson said thats a longer story i have time apparently i dont she glanced toward the doctor who recognized it as his cue to move ahead with his treatment plan langer raised his hand to freeze the action dont push me ms carson right now youre the only living person found at the scene of a bombing that makes you a suspect im not going far she said she has a point dr ahmed intervened speak with her now speak with her in twenty hours after surgery and recovery what difference does it make it makes a lot of difference langer said this wasnt just any bomb doc he shifted his gaze to carson this was a thermobaric device much more carson gasped she hadnt intended to and if it werent for whatever meds she was on she never would have shown her hand like that that mean something to you ms carson langer asked hell yes it meant something to her thermobarics were a class of explosives that allowed lowdensity charges to produce highdensity yields whereas standard explosives contain chemical oxidizers in high concentrations to allow the mixture to consume all of its fuel in a single instant thus producing its blast effects a thermobaric device has relatively low levels of oxidizer but is packed with highly combustible often exotic fuels when the charge detonates the finely divided fuel is dispersed over a wider area and the oxygen in the air performs the role that the chemical oxidizer performs in standard explosives in effect the disbursed cloud of fuel continues to detonate often at higher temperatures thus expanding the kill radius tremendously not a thing carson lied i dont believe you then arrest me consider it done excellent carson said she turned to the doctor can i go to surgery now dr ahmed smiled absolutely consider her to be in custody doc langer said but he seemed suddenly flummoxed as if this new turn had been totally unexpected it will be foremost on my mind the doctor said three minutes later they were on their way to the elevatorall three of them plus a couple of nurses and seeming hangerson langer made a point it seemed to always be within carsons eyesight the elevator took them to a set of double doors over which a sign read surgery authorized personnel only below that was a smaller sign with an arrow that directed everyone else to the waiting area you cannot go in ahmed said to langer the cop seemed to be struggling for words shes your responsibility then he said he probably wanted it to be a more withering threat than it turned out to be on the far side of the double doors carson and the doctor exchanged victory smirks i often dont like police officers ahmed said he was only doing his job the best he knew how carson said surprised at her own maternal tone if lespasse had been there he would have been shocked to hear such forgiveness lespasse shed seen too many friends die over the years to mourn them one at a time anymore but she wished him well on this next leg of his great journey doctor i need a telephone she said their shared moment collapsed in his expression to more confusion excuse me a telephone its an urgent matter your health is the most urgent matter at the moment ahmed said carson grabbed the hem of his scrub shirt with her good arm igniting a lightning bolt of pain from her bad one doctor please stop the gurney glided to a halt its really not she said i love my own health as much as the next personprobably more in fact but in this case its nowhere near as important as the phone call i need to make gun bitch and the driver spoke with each other again and felicia knew that the crescendo was about to begin it was their manner of speaking the conspiratorial tone when gun bitch looked at her at the end of their exchange felicia knew that it would be bad for her the driver clicked the turn signal and started drifting toward the lefta shift in the natural order of a righthanded world to which she didnt think that she could ever truly adjustand as they slowed gun bitch reached into her purse looking for something felicias heart rate quadrupled what could she possibly pull out it turned out to be a pair of clippers that looked like pliers and for a moment she thought she was looking at the instrument of her upcoming torture when her captor leaned forward however and reached toward felicias ziptied ankles she sensed that the bad ending to this adventure was at hand felicia heard a snip and instantly her feet began to regain sensation that she hadnt even realized theyd lost she thought about kicking out at her captor but then what with her wrists bound to the man seated next to her what would her next move be even if she knocked the bitch out with a kick to the head she still wouldnt be able to save herself dont be stupid gun bitch said in english she leveled her pistol an inch from felicias forehead move i shoot she pulled roughly on felicias left shoulder to pivot her to the right when she was facing the door her arms stretched painfully beyond their limits she first felt the closeness of her captors shoulders and then the coldness of the clippers against her flesh as the tiny jaws slipped between the flesh of her wrists snip she was completely free and she knew without doubt that she was seconds away from death the instant her hands belonged to her again felicia knew it was time to act just as she knew that her window to do so could be measured in seconds not minutes her first kick caught gun bitch in the stomach triggering a cry that was equal parts pain and surprise but the punch that landed squarely on her captors nose launched a shriek that was all pain and a fountain that was all blood the car slowed instantly as if the driver himself had been the recipient of felicias attack that instant of inattention opened another window of opportunity she lunged for the door handle and pulled introducing a hurricane of wind and road noise clearly still blinded by the blow to her nose gun bitch swiveled her weapon in the direction of the noise and issued a command in a language that felicia did not understand yet whose meaning was universal stop or ill shoot felicia punched the womans wrist connecting squarely with the tendons on the soft underside and sending the pistol spiraling into the lap of her cocaptive who grunted reflexively on impact the vehicle slowed even more as the driver pivoted to see what was going on but when gun bitch barked another order he whipped back around to face front and acceleration forces kicked in again felicia dove for the racing pavement middleton knew that the urgency in teslas tone had been driven by the presence of a corpse in the middle of his flat his wrecked flat the body was a concern of course but middleton had seen way too many of them over the years to get overly spunup about one more with a dead body you got analytical you could take your time someone dead today would still be dead a week from now so the urgency was gone the spattered blood and brains were literally and figuratively custodial matterstroubling annoyances to be cleaned up later with a little time patience and detergent far more troubling to him was the shattered violin on the floor resting as it was scattered among the flotsam of overturned furniture and broken trinkets middleton knew in an instant why the concert had been postponed it wasnt a missing pianist or a technical problem it was the missing star of the show who took felicia tesla wondered middleton muttered whoever left a dead man in my foyer they didnt just leave him here they shot him here tesla said we need to notify the locals now that theres a murder we need to get them involved fine middleton couldnt have cared less where the hell was felicia why would anyone attack her like this you say that so easily tesla said trying to draw him into the present but theyre going to ask some damn difficult questions middleton scowled at her and cocked his head as if hed just heard a foreign language being spoken what then it fell into place oh ok fine whatever let them ask their questions nora we need to find her she shook her head no we need to find them they come as a package deal but where to begin with so many moving parts how the hell were they supposed to his cell phone chimed in his pocket jesus he spat and as he looked at the caller id display and didnt recognize the number or even the exchange he almost hit the ignore button but then he thought better of it when this much was going so wrong so quickly you never knew where the next turn was going to lead he brought the phone to his ear middleton carson he recognized the difference in her voice and his gut tightened are you all right lespasse is dead she said the simplicity of the delivery could have seemed harsh but in this case he sensed that by saying the words aloud shed freed herself of a burden dead how at the exclamation from her colleague teslas head whipped around tampa was a trap place looked like itd been empty for weeks they had a bomb planted for us his landline rang he ignored it for you how could they plant a bomb for you they couldnt know that you were coming if not for us for someone jesus harry cut me a break on the grammar ok im on my way into surgery so carson was hurt too he hadnt thought of that what happened to you the landline cycled through its third ring and middleton nodded for tesla to answer it for him some burns and broken bones not too bad i dont think despite her words he could hear the pain and fear in her voice is that what you say or does that come from the doctor carson said i didnt call for sympathy harold i have important news that i need to share before i go under the knife across the room tesla covered the mouthpiece with her hand and waved at middleton still stunned by the news of the death of his comrade and friend middleton stared at her blankly as he tried to focus on his own call hold on connie tesla said its about felicia is she ok this is the police on the line they say that she wandered into the station bruised and bloodied and saying something about diving out of a moving car theyve sent her to the hospital who snatched her a woman youngish pretty tough middle eastern maybe indian pakistani sri lankan harold what should i tell the police that youll call them back he returned his attention to carson ok connie go ahead the texan was explaining her own urgent matter one phrase jumped out and refocused him entirely on his cell phone wait a minute he said did you say thermobaric explosive i did carson said even through the phone he could hear her pleasure that hed connected his own set of dots just like all those we dealt with in kosovo just like the ones the afghanis have been disarming for a decade thermobarics were perfected by the only nation he knew of whose troops regularly deployed them so you think theres a russian connection sure could be i found a note about calling moscow no number and a shipping label in the trash blank but they may have records she gave him the name her voice quivering in pain he thanked her connie im sorry toughening her drawl she said later harry ive got to see a man about a knife the phone sagged in middletons hand he turned to tesla and inhaled deeply then he shared the terrible news about lespasse no my god no and connies been hurt but then he controlled the emotion and continued telling her what carson had explained about the thermobarics russia possibly then he nodded at teslas phone what about felicia she told the police that her kidnapper was angry that theyd taken the wrong person she thinks they were actually after charley middleton felt the color drain from his cheeks sure felicias young and was in my apartment they thought she was my daughter then they realized she was polish not american they were probably going to kill her thank god she got away shes still in the emergency roomthey wont let her call but she sent a message you should read your email he lifted his cell phone furious at himself for not opening felicias message immediately jesus he said as he read sikari patented technology for a new heavywater system for making nuclear material what she was telling us about heavy water right middleton pulled out his encrypted cell phone and placed a call to the volunteers office outside dc he took a deep breath and when a man answered he said wiki boss whats wrong i have something to tell you after a moments hesitation he delivered the news about lespasse no harry oh no im afraid so connie was with him shes in surgery in florida right now i need you to stay on top of whats happening down there you bet of course boss im sorry then

and from sindhu power in tampa connie found their shipping label and thats the outfit in florida where connie and jm were yeah the address on balans computer middleton clicked his phone shut and

thermobarics on the black market ive got to get there as fast as i can stepping over the body he snagged his suitcase which he hadnt had a chance to unpack tesla looked at the body the police i have to call them back what should i tell them middleton paused for a moment to think tell them anything he said everything if youd like he started walking toward the front door we wont be around when they get here anyway a nod at the body hes their problem now joseph finder at just after three oclock on a gloomy afternoon the boeing touched down on runway number at moscows domodedovo international airport the reverse thrusters kicked in with a loud whine and before long the roar of the engines subsided as the plane was powered down for several minutes the pilot and his threeman crew just sat there waiting patiently for the tedious rituals to beginborder control and customs clearing first the crew and then the cargo hours of forms and questions but most of all waiting the soviet union was no more but its bureaucracy lived on rain thrummed against the plexiglas cockpit window which slowly began to fog up and they waited since this was a cargo plane there were no passengers to deplane the main cabin was a cavernous cargo bay packed with eleven containers of cargoigloos they were called in the businesswhich were in turn jammed with boxes everything from flatscreen tvs to iphones from armani suits to armagnac seated along the bulkhead in the small compartment aft of the cockpit the second officer spoke quietly to the new man who had been added to the crew at the last minute just before takeoff in frankfurt you dont talk much the second officer said he hadnt stopped talking since they departed frankfurt yeah well said the other man ever been to moscow before once or twice long time ago you wont recognize the place so i hear well you got one whole night to see moscow before we turn around and fly out of here in the morning i know a couple of awesome nightclubs smokin hot russian babes thanks anyway the new man said i thought i might just do a little sightseeing come on man whatre you gonna do go see lenins tomb or something this place im going to itll totally blow your mind when you see the way these russian babes im good said the new man im wiped ill probably just walk around see what moscows like these days well be careful buddy the second officer said they got street crime now you know some parts of the city you dont want to walk around at night being a foreigner and all ill keep that in mind said the new crew member the second officer stood up and said i gotta use the john when he emerged from the lavatory he heard a sharp rap on the planes exterior a beefy uniformed agent from fsb frontier control came aboard passport the russian barked the second officer handed his passport over and watched as the agent scanned it with a handheld device then the second officer turned to look at his colleague but the other pulldown seat was empty no one was there as the russian entered the cockpit to check the passports of the pilot and copilot the second officer looked around bewildered he got up glanced into the cockpit but the new guy wasnt there either he yanked open the door to the cargo compartment but there was barely enough room for someone to squeeze in between the rows of igloos the guy wasnt there very strange colonel harry middleton strolled along the old arbat a cobblestone street that had been converted into a pedestrian mall crowded with shoppers and peddlers bearded minstrels playing strangelooking guitars and teenagers just hanging out there were souvenir shops selling ornate lacquer palekh boxes and russian nesting dolls painted with the faces of foreign leaders and pop stars hed visited moscow once before during the height of the cold war everything looked and felt different now colorful instead of gray boisterous and teeming instead of quiet and ominous the rusty old volgas and zhigulis had been replaced by ferraris and bentleys but the immense stalinist tower that housed the ministry of foreign affairs was still there at the end of the arbat just as it was half a century earlier maybe the changes didnt really run all that deep after all the last twentyfour hours had been tense and exhausting but he suspected the next twentyfour hours would be even worse just getting into moscow had involved calling in a stack of chits like an old friend from his time in kosovo an apache helicopter pilot with the us armys nd airborne division whod taken his retirement from the army and risen up the ranks of an international airfreight companyand was willing to add a fourth crew member to a moscow flight and another old friend a wily kgb careerist named ruslan maksimovich korovin whod been in kosovo at the same time and became one of middletons mostvalued sources inside russian intelligence theyd gotten him into moscow but middleton knew that if anything went wrong they wouldnt be able to get him out now middleton found himself staring at the display window of an antiquities shop across the street from the old praga restaurant the shop window was a jumble of dusty curiosbrass kaleidoscopes and bad copies of icons and russianmade victrolas and shabby oil paintings he wasnt inspecting the antiques of course he was watching the reflection in the plate glass but so far he hadnt detected any followers it was only a matter of time before russian intelligence took notice of a foreigner walking the streets of moscow a foreigner whod somehow managed to slip into russia without leaving any fingerprints in the databases if he were brought in for questioning well it was better not to think about that possibility middleton pulled opened the heavy front door a shopkeepers bell tinkled pleasantly no electronic entry alert here the place looked even smelled a century old musty and mildewed middleton half expected to see aleksandr pushkin who once lived on this very street browsing the wares behind a crowded dusty glass counter was an elderly man with a pinched severe face and oversized round blackframed glasses dobryi dyen the clerk said good afternoon middleton replied im interested in icons the clerk raised his eyebrows and his big round glasses rose along with them ah anything in particular sir im particularly interested in the novgorod school the flash of recognition on the old mans face disappeared quickly yes of course sir he said they are some of our finest but there are very few and theyre quite costly i understand middleton said please the clerk said gesturing toward a maroon velvet curtain that divided the front of the shop from his back office please to follow me it was dark in there and even mustier and dust motes swam in an oblique shaft of light that came in from between the curtains the russian took out a battered leather briefcase from a file drawer and popped open the clasp inside the case was lined with black eggcarton shell foam set snugly in a cutout at its center was a brandnew sig sauer p a compact semiautomatic pistol with a matte black finish middleton checked it quickly pulled back the slide and was satisfied chambered for mm he said the old clerk nodded pursed his lips middleton peeled five hundreddollar bills from the roll of cash in his front pocket and set them on the counter the russian scowled and shook his head he held up two fingers two thousand he said that was not the deal middleton protested then i am so sorry that we cannot do business today said the russian middleton sighed then put down another fifteen bills he hated being held up this way but it wasnt as if he had a choice i assume youll throw in a box of ammo he said the russian produced an ancientlooking dogeared box of winchester cartridges from another drawer about twenty or thirty bucks back home today we make special deal the clerk said only five hundred dollars ruslan maksimovich korovin was a russian bear of a man short and rotund with a neatly trimmed goatee that adorned a fleshy ruddy face he extended his short arms and gave middleton a hug garrold korovin exclaimed this was as close to harold as korovin was able to say he escorted middleton into a large comfortable room that looked like an english gentlemans club oriental carpets covered the floor here and there were leather chairs in which doddering old men snoozed behind tented copies of pravda except for the choice of newspaper it could have been boodles in london actually it was a mens club of sorts only the men were old kgb officers in this nineteenthcentury townhouse on a narrow street off pyatnitskaya street former and retired russian intelligence officers gathered over vodka and sturgeon and cabbage soup to reminiscence about the bad old days ruslan maksimovich middleton said stumbling slightly over the unwieldy patronymic thanks for seeing me on such short notice in a lower voice korovin said i trust my friends at the airport treated you with the proper deference korovin whod spent more than three decades in the kgb was a legendary operative who knew how to pull strings that most people didnt even know existed his web of contacts extended even into the facilities maintenance operations at domodedovo airport where a refueling crew had smuggled middleton off the cargo plane and into central moscow a risky infiltration to be sure but middleton knew he could trust korovin to make the plan go off flawlessly the old kgb mans directions had been precise and theyd been relayed to middleton using the simplest yet most modern of all spy tradecraft techniques korovin had written an email but instead of sending it hed saved it as a draft on a gmail account for which both men had the password the email account was one of many set up by wiki chang back at the volunteers small office headquarters in virginia intelligence agents no longer needed things like microdots and burst transmitters not when they could use the good old internet it went far more easily than i expected to be honest middleton said from me you should expect only the best korovin said and i hear you made a purchase at volodyas shop on the arbat yes he has the finest selection of icons in all of moscow pricy though middleton said well after all it is a sellers market my friend korovin said i didnt dicker said middleton korovin led him to the dining room dark and dismal and mostly empty they sat at a small table which was already set with mineralnaya voda and dustylooking tumblers and shot glasses a waitress shambled over with a tray an old crone with thinning white hair and pale gray eyes who looked to be in her eighties she wore a long black shirt and a longsleeved white blouse probably middleton thought a pensioner from some back office at the lubyanka with fumbling hands she set down an assortment of zakuski russian appetizers like beet salad and mushroom caviar smoked fish and pickled onions then she unsteadily filled their shot glasses with a domestic brand of vodka korovin slid a cigarette from a pack of marlboros lit it with an old red army lighter and then offered a toast to their work in kosovo the two intelligence operatives had played a behindthescenes role in that ugly conflict a decade earlier a role the world would never know about ten years ago theyd seen how close the kosovo conflict had brought the two superpowers to war the russians backed the serb guerrillas and nato and the americans defended the ethnic albanians even though there was plenty of ethnic cleansingthat grotesque euphemismon both sides when russia finally agreed to abandon the serbs in exchange for a separate role in the peacekeeping process nato reneged on the deal the russian forces found themselves taking orders from a us general they felt humiliated and doublecrossed the tensions could well have boiled over into a war between two nuclear powers were it not for the quiet backchannel efforts of a few intelligence officers like korovin and middleton now the two men drank and then korovin poured again but before he could offer another flowery toast he gave middleton a sideways glance i thought you were retired garrold i thought i was too middleton said yet you needed to enter my country off the books which tells me that you have gone active again in a manner of speaking he gave his russian friend a quick sanitized version of the work that the volunteers had been doing and then told him about the bizarre incident on the côte dazur that had activated the volunteers once again i need some information ah which might have meant yes absolutely or the opposite information about thermobarics its easier to get you the explosives than it is to get you information about the explosives safer anyway well let me ask in any case middleton said i had my associate look into the records of a shipping company that delivered some merchandise to an outfit in florida i think it was explosives he contacted me on the flight and told me that a number of shipments labeled construction items were sent from albania to moscow to mogadishu to algiers and finally to the us the company realized he was into their system and blocked him out but not before he got me the names of all the freight forwarders involved youre looking at me rather knowingly friend i believe i am nervous now though korovin didnt look nervous he looked amused in that indulgently conspiratorial way former soviet army officers and kgb operatives slip on their faces like bank robbers do a ski mask and you want to hear a funny coincidence middleton asked no i do not all the shipping companies were incorporated by a single law firm in moscow and guess who they also represent your boss arkady chernayev arkady chernayev was the richest man in russia perhaps in the world he divided his time between his estate in knightsbridge london and a mansion on the outskirts of moscow not to mention a dozen other properties around the world several private planes and three obscenely large yachts chernayev had gotten rich in the oil business during the freeforall in the last days of the soviet union no not boss a scowl ruslan youve done private security work for him dont even bother trying to deny it my sources on this are impeccable korovin looked away then busied himself by sectioning a herring with the delicacy of a cardiac surgeon performing a coronary bypass he placed each slice of herring atop squares of black bread then looked up that was long ago he said finally his expression hardened why is this so important to you because if chernayev is behind this which im beginning to believe i think hes channeling money or explosives or both to a dangerous fanatic named devras sikari the point of contact for their interests was tampa florida then lets say for the sake of argument that you are correct this is why you wanted a weapon because you think you will shoot your way in to chernayevs dacha do you know how many bodyguards this man has surrounding him at all times and just one of you middleton shrugged said nothing and for what you plan to kill chernayev and hope to survive kill him no of course not i need to talk to him can you tell me anything about him hes grown reclusive he had some financial problems the richest man in the country not any more wealth comes and goes like the tide my friend but hes on the rebound now we hear no one knows what his good fortune is i cant give you firsthand knowledge tell me what is this about middleton had a thoughtsindhu power lowering his voice he went fishing because of the copper bracelet a nervous smile flitted across korovins face then disappeared i have no idea what you are talking about i think you do korovin snubbed out his cigarette then slid another one from the pack and lighted it when he next spoke it was through a mouthful of smoke his voice muzzy the copper bracelet he said this is nothing more than what we call skazki folk tales what you call old wives tales stories told by frightened old men to inflate their own importance try me middleton said no the copper bracelet is no more that snake was killed long ago decades ago amuse me it originally described some old scientific process but then the name came to refer to a cult a cult of madmenfanatics as you saythat rose from the ashes of the second world war you know of the norsk hydro plant middleton shook his head this was a factory in norway jointly owned by norsk hydro and i g farben the giant nazi corporation yes it was destroyed by the allied forces and the norwegian resistance movement one of the most remarkable sabotage acts of the war what did the factory makeweapons in a way yes the copperbracelet system produced heavy water it was a revolutionary way to produce nuclear material middleton thought immediately of felicias insights and her encrypted message to him heavy water sikaris patents the nazis needed it to make an atomic weapon but once the factory was destroyed the nazi atomic bomb program was ended the story garroldthe skazkais that the plant may have been destroyed but some of the records of the technology survived a group of russians and germanssuccessors to the nazis you could sayhave been hoping for someone to reconstruct the science behind it connection to chernayev none that ive ever heard of well i need to find out how can i reach him i korovin fell silent as the doddering old waitress approached she said something to him in a quiet voice you will please excuse me korovin said rising from the table his knees cracking there is a call for me on the house phone ruslan korovin followed the waitress across the dining room and into the small antechamber next to the kitchen there in an antique wooden booth an old black phone was mounted on the wall korovin picked up the phone heard nothing he depressed the plunger a few times then turned to the waitress and said the line is dead yes the waitress said her voice sounded strangely deeper stronger it is dead she slid a latch on the kitchen door locking it suddenly she lunged at him vising his neck in the muscled crook of her elbow korovin struggled gasped but this womanwho was surely not an old woman he now knewhad overpowered him she twisted his head one way his torso another there was a terrible loud snap and korovin sank to the floor and the last thing he saw was the copper bracelet on his attackers left wrist barely visible under the dainty ruffle of her sleeve lisa scottoline devras sikari needed time to think and when as now he wasnt in his beloved kashmir he would come here to his second favorite place in the worldhis colonial farmhouse in rural pennsylvania specifically to the chicken coop sikari was sitting in his directors chair in the pasture watching his chickens enjoy the sun he loved his little farm some ninety acres with its backyard quarter horses and tiny flock of pullets and though he was indian bywayof belgravia he felt his most relaxed in this unlikely spot here he could shed his dinner jackets and hermés ties take off his clothes like so much costuming and finally become himself it made little sense even to him sikari wasnt raised in the country but to him this farm was home away from home the air had a raw october nip but his baggy jeans and old flannel shirt kept him warm with a waxed jacket still dusty from the mornings ride when he crossed one leg over the other a red cashmere sock peeked from the top of his scuffed blundstones in his hand was a phillies mug with bad coffee which he had brewed himself his housekeeper could make coffee the way he liked it but it was her day off so sikari was stuck with his own swill he took a sip and it tasted bitter and now cold he shook his head at the irony he had patented a formula that would stump most nuclear physicists yet he was defeated by dunkin donuts squawk went one of the hens startling sikari from his thoughts his attention shifted back to the brood settle yumyum he said softly though the pullet only blinked in response a flash of a perfectly round golden eye yumyum was an araucana an illmannered bird with brilliant plumage of russet rich brown and flecks of black sikari kept three araucana because of their unusual greenishblue eggs and he also had a pair of brown sussexs that reminded him of england as well as some docile bard plymouth rocks a spoiled american breed and a dramatic blackandwhite wyandotte named princess ida all of his hens had been named for his private passion the operettas of gilbert sullivan though the bard rocks looked so much alike that he simply called them the womens chorus his farm manager tolerated his naming the hens thinking sikari an eccentric multimillionaire which suited his purposes his staff believed he was an international reinsurance executive and he paid them well enough to ask no questions sikari eyed the chickens and the sight cheered him some of them clustered together on the soft dirt around their coop roosting together wingtowing their feet tucked under them and their chubby feathered breasts forming a scalloped edge others were lying flat on their sides their heads resting in the dirt as if it were an earthen pillow their yellow feet splayed out straight sikari had never known that chickens did such a thing the first time hed seen them lying down that way hed thought they were all dead it made him think again of kavi balan and for a moment he watched the chickens without really seeing them deep in thought his coffee forgotten sikari had to deal with the fact that things had not been going well for him everything had been in placethe geology the personnel even the scorpionbut middleton was still alive and kavi balan was dead that alone was a major disruption sikari had been grooming balan to be his number one but now his plans had gone awry the past nine years wasted the situation was unstable which threatened his future and his fortune and stole his peace of mind he had been mulling over the solution but had yet to come to a final decision time had passed without him acting but he trusted that his path would become clear in due course sikari was a deliberate man and that was one of the reasons he was so successful put simply he planned where others did not his modus operandi was goaloriented behavior whether his goal was losing weight or building weapons of mass destruction he always reached his goal he took a sip of cold coffee as princess ida blinked herself awake and rose to her feet stretching one yellow foot out behind her then the other sikari smiled at the sight of his poultry diva craning her feathered neck to stretch it out too making herself taller and more powerful princess ida was the dominant hen and he watched her ruffle her wing feathers then settle them back into place the simple motion bringing yumyum peepbo and the womens chorus to their feet where they all began scratching and pecking at the brownish grass following princess idas lead it reminded sikari that all of nature had a pecking order which insured stability he thought to himself stability will be restored once my pecking order is restored thats all its that simple it made his decision for him and there was no time to delay he set his coffee mug on the ground reached into his moleskin pocket extracted his cell phone then pressed one letter when the call was answered he said into the phone come to the coop and bring your brother he closed the phone with a snap and repocketed it his gaze falling on princess ida the hen looked back at him with approval ten minutes later his twin sons stood before him with identical halfsmiles and as always the sight pleased him they were part of the plan too he couldnt say exactly that he loved them for he traveled too much to know them but he liked the notion that he had two such bright active goodlooking sons they were six feet tall and with their curly darkblonde hair round blue eyes and confident grins archer and harris were almost impossible to tell apart they couldnt have looked more different from sikari but of course he wasnt their biological father he had bought them as babies on the backstreets of prague he had no idea where they had come from and it didnt matter anyway he had told them his farm staff and the tutors who homeschooled them that he was their godfather a dear friend of their deceased french parents because he knew that passed for exotic here in the boondocks arent you two cold sikari asked because neither wore coats they were dressed in a way that people used to call preppy turtlenecks khaki pants and navy crewneck sweaters the boys shook their heads no dad they answered almost in unison they were more than each others best friend they were so close they were almost the same person it was the way sikari had wanted it essential for what would be expected of them someday they had been trained in the martial arts and were both remarkably gifted schooled especially in geology and the sciences their iqs tested even higher than his they both were slated to enter harvard next year but that would change now college couldnt teach them what he could he could offer them the world literally theyd be too young to succeed him even in ten years time but balans death had left him with no choice sikari would be around to guide them for the next thirty years or so and if he started grooming them now theyd be ready ultimately to take the helm the problem was he only needed one of them he had known this day would come which was why he had bought twins so hed always have a backup the heir and the spare but now he had to choose one and he wasnt sure how they were doppelgangers and their temperaments were the same as far as sikari could tell when did you get home father archer asked his tone casual and duplicate sets of blue eyes looked at him this morning you boys were in the gym listen we have a problem what archer asked harris cocked an eyebrow arch did it he said and the twins laughed echoing each other sikari smiled for show listen to me this is serious you have been preparing for this day your whole life you just didnt know it the two boys fell silent and blinked at exactly the same time which sikari found eerie theyd had their own language as toddlers and hed always wondered if they were talking about him princess ida began to peck at archers loafer but the boy didnt notice sikari said i need one of you to succeed me in the family business when the time comes but i need only one of you i assume you both want to ascend of course they both answered and suddenly neither looked over at the other their gaze fixing on sikari so how do i choose between you archer smiled crookedly whoever can catch princess ida gets the job great idea harris clapped his hands together like punctuation at the end of a sentence how about it father ha sikari laughed and this time it was genuine they had no idea of the enormity of the position they were vying for it was like drawing straws to become president of the united states for some reason the absurdity of the notion appealed to him he smiled to himself but nobody can catch princess ida i can archer said harris gave him a playful shove so can i you loser archers mouth dropped open im the one who catches them at night not without my help harris shot back whoever catches her first then sikari said standing up he had no better way to choose between them and it may as well be arbitrary if the twins were that much alike either would do he raised his right hand when i say go archer and harris planted their feet in the dirt and bent their knees slightly a perfect footballers stance the chickens reacted instantly sensing something afoot princess ida flapped her wings signaling to the womens chorus and peepbo and pittising clucked loudly rousing from their dirt baths and scampering around ready steady go sikari said bringing his hand down on it archer cried taking off but princess ida ran full tilt toward the chicken coop with harris sprinting after them both the clever hen veered to the left before she reached the little door to the coop which sent archer crashing into the wall and harris gave chase bolting after princess ida his legs churning and his arms pinwheeling comically the speedy hen dodged this way and that halfrunning and halfflying from the boys squawking loudly in alarm and protest refusing to be caught go ida go sikari heard himself shout lost for a moment in the spirit of the contest it charmed him to see these two strapping young men laughing and running prime specimens in the fullness of their youth and promise their golden hair blazing in the sunlight and sikari found himself wishing he had been a real parent to them bawkkk bawwkk princess ida screamed as the two boys chased her toward sikari and he stepped back so they wouldnt barrel into him the twins ran neckandneck next to each other their faces alive with the thrill of the battle and just as sikari was about to shout again he noticed archers expression darken as if a storm cloud were passing over his features in one unexpected movement archer raised his right arm and whipped it backwards into harriss neck no sikari heard himself cry and the sound was drowned out by a sickening guttural noise that emanated from harriss throat the boys eyes widened in shock his hands flew reflexively to his crushed adams apple and bright red blood spurted in an arc from his gaping mouth sikari couldnt believe his eyes he was accustomed to violence but not here not at home not now he couldnt process what was happening he watched in horror as harris crumpled to the ground his legs bent gro tesquely under him his face crashing into the dirt instinct drove sikari to the stricken boys side and he threw himself on the ground calling harris harris harris he turned the boy over by the shoulders but harris was already dead his eyes fixed at the sky his mouth leaking his lifes blood cradling harris sikari looked up in shock and bewilderment above him stood archer with princess ida tucked under one arm i win archer said simply and sikari found his voice why he asked hushed because im stronger smarter and better than him and because my time has come but he was your brother so dont worry father i can handle the responsibility i know whats required of me i know everything what how sikari asked astonished ive been through your papers ive hacked into your computer i even broke the code on your passwords i know everything i need to know you understand what that means sikari understood but he went for his holstered berretta a splitsecond too late the last thing he saw was the tip of archers loafer kicking forward to drive his nose into his brain devras sikari realized that his successor was now in place and that the new king was smarter stronger younger and even more ruthless than the old one and as he died he thought what have i unleashed upon the world david corbett harold middleton regarded the crumpled butt of korovins marlboro mashed into his plate of zakuski and for some reason it brought to mind felicias rebuke that he too often lacked the time or inclination to look beyond the obvious he would have very much liked a view beyond the obvious at that moment bits of tobacco flecked the pickled onions the charred aroma of cold ash lingered with the vinegary jolt of stewed beets and smoked herring a glance at his watchwhat sort of phone call would demand so much time perhaps middleton thought uneasily his secret entry into russia at domodedovo was no longer secret perhaps korovin was being dragged across the coals by a younger more officious and less forgiving man his replacement in russias new intelligence megalith the fsb then again maybe poor ruslan was merely arguing with his wife or his loverand azerbaijani perhaps or a sultry uzbek look beyond the obvious he reminded himself he sank into a guilty humor felicia had barely escaped death in london the cost of her staying at his apartment how much misfortune can you visit upon a friend he thought before the friendship twists into a curse and what of charleyhadnt he inflicted the same jeopardy on her insisting she join him on this quixotic crusade what kind of father does that to his daughter the questions lifted him from his overstuffed chair and sent him ambling ruminatively toward the window the distant reaches of moscow sprawled beneath layers of urban haze fouling an ashen moonlit sky his impression of a transformed russia had vanished trash fires dotted the less central reaches of the cityscape surest testament to the countrys lingering third world status the putrid stench of the rancid smoke filtered through the window glass shoddy glazing one more relic from the workers paradise the gloss of prosperity hed glimpsed on his way into moscow was no more substantial than the paintonrust veneer of the soviet era the main pretense to wealth being the surge in petro revenues the past few years even that was suddenly at risk with plummeting oil pricesso much so even oligarchs like arkady chernayev had to seek bailouts from the government just last week hed been literally moments away from losing his chief subsidiary to european banks oil middleton thought the mephitic sinkhole of modern politics correction he told himself oil and drugs those were the two gluttonous wants that kept the us beholden to tinhorn despots like putin chavez and ahmadinejad kept it tied to dubious friends like saudi arabia and colombia or perpetually failing states like nigeria and mexico somewhere during the course of my life he mused the country i grew up in the land of selfreliance and initiative devolved into a daytime talk show populated by the obese the whiny the addicted it was enough to make a patriot weep which brought him back to feliciapolish by birth she was in truth a gypsy he suddenly felt the shock of an impossible and poignant envy in which he sensed that what promise the future held belonged to the felicias of the worldthose with talent for a passport as long as they kept moving maintaining an ever fluid distance from men with patriotic obsessions and idealistic whimsmen like devras sikari men like harold middleton the door to the back room swung open and middleton turned to greet korovin returning at last from his interminable phone callexcept it wasnt his bearish friend who approached it was the ancient waitress perhaps it was because hed just had felicia on his mindor more to the point her reproach of his inattentivenessbut he detected now what he should have noticed before something artificial in her shambling gait a subtle vigor in her movement that belied the womans age and the snowy white hair offkilter just slightly a wig middleton intuited instantly that his friend ruslan korovin was dead the insight slamming home at the same instant his gaze met the imposters pale gray eyes he reached inside his jacket tugged the sig sauer p from his belt as the waitress lost all pretense of disguise and lunged forward middleton thumbed the safety down pulled the trigger point blank range nothing the gun didnt fire in an instant of adrenalincompressed recollection he wondered whether hed loaded it remembered that he hadno the clip was full hed even chambered a bullet by then the fake waitress was upon him delivering a kick to the chest that sent him reeling backwards into the room crashing against the low serving table with its tray of zakuski the attackers wig fell free her real hair was closely cropped a manlike burr she pulled a knife from inside the shabby white blouse middleton struggled to his feet slipping in the briny mess changing his grip on the pistol to use it as a club sensing vaguely that the exkgb officers in the room were stirring ready to rise the attacker hadnt bargained on middletons discernment shed hoped for a quick kill a darting escape she lunged not slashing with the knife but thrusting with it no hesitation no squeamishnessslashing was for cowards middleton fought off the blow with the pistol parrying it but the woman responded with a thundering left that caught him at the templehis vision went white his knees buckled his mind coughed up a single word charley the unmistakable pop of a makarov pm erupted seemingly inside his earfrom somewhere close behind him one of the old apparatchiks had stirred to action choosing at least for now the side of the american whom one of his old cohorts had befriended through the watery film his field of vision had become middleton saw the waitress clutch her shoulder tumble back a step crumple to one knee the old kgb man stepped forward and murmured something brief and blunt in russian the knife fell from the shorn womans hand the man kicked it across the room where one of the others shuffled hurriedly to retrieve it the woman was panting clutching her shoulder pale hand over the growing bloodstain the old kgb man looked down at middleton eyeing the worthless sig sauer in his grip his lips curled into a withering smile as in syrupy english thickly accented he said an excellent icon the novgorod school yes nothing speaks to good old angloamerican homesickness like a bowl of oatmeal charley glanced up from her wall street journal europe the man addressing her was the same natty stranger whod been tailing her yesterday as shed walked along the champs élysées lunching in the sunlight with the étoile and the arc de triomphe in the distance he was handsome in an aging roughtrade sort of way tanned fit saltandpepper hair he dressed expensively conspicuously so like a social climber hoping to escape the inescapable his class so british she thought too british why she wondered does he want to kill me he said might i join you his accent had a flat mersey drag to it that she recognized from specials on the beatles she hadnt understood then that john lennons accent wasnt perfectly upper crustor lardy as they said if the beatles werent nobility who was please do she said resisting a glance toward leonora tesla who sat across the hotels elegant dining room shed flown over from london to warn her that her life was in danger and to watch over her felicia kaminski had been kidnapped from middletons bloomsbury apartment in the mistaken belief she was charley the dapper brit pulled back the opposite chair sat down ian he said charmingly extending his hand charlotte i know a darkskinned busman appearedalgerian perhaps maybe a turkbearing a coffee pot barrettbone declined charley affecting an ingénues innocence you know my name youre in considerable danger ms middleton id like to help leonora materialized behind him nudging the back of his chair one hand rested inside her pocket the other settled gently on his shoulder the hand in her pocket held a pistol with which she gently prodded the back of his head he broke into a helpless smile you yanks it would appear charley responded gesturing for the check that theres considerable danger all around that wasnt really necessary you know they were seated in the back of a taxi driving aimlessly through the eighth arrondissement the cabbys rai music turned down so they could talk prayer beads strung from his rearview mirror rattled with every turn ian barrettbone sat between the volunteers leonora tesla still had her pistol trained on him from her coat pocket glancing out the back window charlotte middleton watched for trail cars tesla demanded what do you want with charlotte she was concerned but not overly so shed gotten his name from his british passportit was one of several of courseand called somebody in another country he could tell that from the number of times she punched the keypad the information that came back was as he knew it would be that ian barrettbone was a business consultant without any criminal record and did not appear on a single watchlist around the world theres a lot of money at stake in this matter what matter oh sikaris efforts his companies i would like to participate in a little of it to that end id like to get a message to harold middleton he was perfectly calm vaguely amused i might be able to spot him a few details on sikari such as you can understand why i might want to share that solely with colonel middleton and you can understand why that wont happen barrettbone feigned a sulk pity youll talk to us and if i dont please dont throw out idle threats your reputation precedes you thats the problem with being honorable you know damn hard to scare people tesla took his face in her hand squeezing till his lips pursed you tried to kill an innocent woman he shook off her hold but for a moment his insouciance wavered ah thats where youre wrong the people i represent and i had nothing to do with that that was sikaris cockup a woman on his payroll named jana south asian lass lovely to look at nasty disposition none too trustworthy either and what people do you represent i think you missed a subtle hint in what i just said this jana shes none too trustworthy shes a bit of a loose bird shes playable if the conditions dictate and the price is right why should we believe you well for fucks sake luv why should anyone believe anybody tesla leaned close whispering in his ear she said if you call me luv again ill shoot you for the sheer pleasure of it he regarded her with mock horror what is it with american women what people do you represent look ive already put a few cards on the table here whos the scorpion he withdrew behind a mask of coy bemusement im not sure i know who you mean sounds like a comic book hero to me a villain im betting he shrugged the narcissism of minor differences the driver honked at a wayward cyclist who responded with a handflick to the chin tesla said you work for him the scorpion im here talking to you on my own graces and just to confirm my bona fides im going to fill you in on a little detail that should make it clear i know of what i speak he cocked an eyebrow the two women waited youve seen a bracelet no doubt you took it off the body of a poor sod named kavi balan jana was the one who blew him upthe old exploding cell phone ploy understand she damn near got you with the laptop so she was the one at cap dantibes thats right the bracelet has a certain significance a meaning if you will the elephant the spray of water the moon tesla said quite tell me what the moon means barrettbone cocked an eyebrow and youll ill consider your request to speak with colonel middleton more mindfully he sighed youre a tough one miss the moon tell me well im sure youve realized it has nothing to do with islam sikari being hindu and all go on the crescent moon as a symbol predates islam actually byzantium chose it long before mohammed ever came upon the scene as it were it represented the goddess diana she was a huntressstop me if you know the storybut she was also a protector of the weak and vulnerable a heavenly light in the darkness oh my he fluttered his hand a music hall wave sometimes you see her as a torchbearer lighting the way for others she was regal proud majestic driving her chariot through the wilderness what does that have to do with sikari he shook his head the question you should be asking is what does it have to do with jana well shes looking for the scorpion everyones looking for the scorpion sikari too i assume what if i were to tell you that sikaris dead tesla struggled to conceal her shock the man who was the center of the volunteers missiondead barrettbone continued and killed by his own son it seems but janas still a loose cannon looking for the scorpion and maybe thats not all go on tesla snapped tell us look one more hint then im finished have you heard about the baglihar hydroelectric dam despite herself charley middleton stiffened wiki had been hacking and cracking nearly roundtheclock the past few days trying to break through encryption codes and fending off countermeasurestrojan horses root kits backdoors key loggers bots zombie attacksin an attempt to determine what sikaris next move would be that effort had revealed the existence of the scorpionthough no details about himas well as turning up mentions of the baglihar dam tesla shrugged its a dam being built in india kashmir barrettbone corrected more precisely the jammu region of indiaadministered kashmir the area sikari comes from quite what about it you know theres a bloody serious dispute over the thing pakistan had protested to the un that the dam threatened irrigation from the chenab river on which the countrys agriculture relied it even went so far as to accuse india of deliberately going ahead with the project simply to deprive pakistan of the water it needed to survive negotiations between the two countries had broken down over the issue of islamic terrorism in the region and so the world bank which brokered the indus water treaty for kashmir had appointed an arbitrator to review the dispute just recently the arbitrator had issued his determination india which claimed the dam was needed to provide muchneeded electric power was fully within its rights to finish the project with a minor concession of lowering the spillway five feet tesla said what does the dispute have to do with sikari his side won did it now barrettbone sank back into the seat arms crossed winking im afraid thats all im prepared to say for now till i get my facetoface with the fabled harold middleton as prison cells went it wasnt half badone of those vast drafty rooms in some provincial estate house on the outskirts of moscow or possibly out in the neighboring countryside a relic from the romanov era showing all too well the inevitable wear and principled neglect of the socialist century the floorboards were dull and pitted the walls dingy and waterstained the windows had been sealed up leaving a musty smell of mildew and rot tinged with the scent of wood smoke seeping in from somewhere not hereno wood in the fireplace no warming blaze just a ridiculously claptrap space heater resembling a helmet with a redhot face behind the grille it gave off about as much heat as a nightlight except for three rickety chairs it was the only piece of furniture in the room middleton gathered his coat tight around his body breath purling out from his nostrils in airy plumes his lips felt numb how many hours had they kept him here how many more to goand what then at least thered been no torture not for him hed heard the cries from elsewhere in the large housethe woman with the buzzcut hair he supposed his attacker ruslans killer theyd spare her no excess the questioning would almost be secondary he glanced up at the ceiling a stained expanse of yellowing plaster blistered and cracked to the point it resembled a contour map hed sat there staring up at it for hours at a time creating an imagined landscape tracing the rivers the feedstreams and tributaries the floodplains the drainage basins the terraced hillsides and marshy wetlands and vast beckoning steppes where would the cities reside he wondered where the outlying villages from which direction would the mongol horsemenor the nazis vaunted sixth armyinvade when this manner of passing time faltered he closed his eyes and tried to mentally reconstruct the late beethoven sonatas the hammerklavier in particular with its echoes of bach in the fourth movement fuguewhich of course only reminded him of felicia and this was his third manner of passing the time he wondered where she was if she was all right if she was alive his guilt quickened into rage that melted into fatherly concern that dissolved into hopeless sorrow in time the despair would slither on to charley then leonoranamed for leonore heroine of beethovens only opera fideliowhich would return him to his mental reconstruction of the sonatas until at last the ceiling beckoned once more he tried not to think of ruslan the bearish russian had known the risks they all did even so the rooms lone door opened mealtime he supposed breakfast lunch supper hed lost all sense of time but instead of the hunched and ferretfaced cronea real one this timewhod delivered his tray of borscht and black bread earlier served with a raw quartered onion and a glass of vodka a tall and welldressed man appeared vigorous vaguely military with that chiseled slavic bone structure the uniquely soulful eyes he wore a simple black suit beneath a heavy wool overcoat his bluchers were muddy entering alone he closed the door behind him to the clatter of deadbolts from the hallway outside mr middleton the man said his english suggestive of british tutelage not american i trust youve not been too terribly inconvenienced his smile seemed sincere his tone matteroffact middleton thought of the screams hed heard through the walls just hours beforeinconvenienced not in the least he wrapped his coat tighter and glanced up at the ceiling ive been admiring the view the stranger obligingly followed his eyes my apologies for the delay we wanted to be sure we had the facts before troubling you the facts of course thats what torture provides the troubling facts i suppose it would be impertinent of me to ask who exactly you mean by we middleton said he assumed the old kgb men whod saved him had fobbed him off on some shadowy element within the security apparatus gangsters maybe perhaps both the stranger smiled pulled up one of the other two skeletal chairs brushed its dusty surface sat im at liberty to tell you this there are several groups very interested inhow to put itacquiring you lets say considerable sums have been offered tempting sums but weand no i will not tell you any more about who we aredo not concern ourselves so much with financial reward as the singular satisfaction provided by one thing and one thing only information we like knowing whats going on its our reason for being bingo middleton thought remaining pokerfaced he said would it be too much to have your name yes im sorry the smile remained rigidly in place no names were prepared to protect you mr middleton from those who would gladly pay for the privilege of your company people who would im afraid most definitely make things very difficult for you but in return for this protection we are offering we expect something in return the man with no names voice trailed off into the void he extended his hands in either direction to suggest the vast store of knowledgethe informationhe expected to receive several groups middleton said i can think of just two who might be interested you underestimate your worth this interest is current no some of it appears to go back a ways you have made your share of enemies mr middleton i find that admirable incidentally but yes two groups originally found their way to a back channel contacted us inquired then a third came forwardsame realm of interest lets say the others seem to bear old grudges but once they learned there was a bidding war they were spectacularly obliging three middleton thought sikari the scorpion and who else chernayev but why would he bid against sikari and how could he know that middleton was interested in him it appears i have little choice the impish smile lingered even as the man shrugged as sartre says one always has a choice if only in how to die middleton considered it he could hand himself over to his enemies but why they would suffer no hesitation they would most certainly make things difficult they would inconvenience him he shuddered picturing it he knew he had his virtues knew himself to be selfless and moderately brave but he lacked certainty on the issue of withstanding torture hour after hour day after day week upon week perhaps he would have the spine to lie buy time but when there was no more time to purchase what then and it wasnt just his own torture to consider the old kgb apparatchiks had taken both of his cell phones the encrypted one and his regular one all it would take is one call to wiki leonora felicia charleythe signal would pinpoint their locations middleton chafed his hands together to warm them how shall we do this you would have thought hed just praised the mans taste in lovers the smile turned gracious his sad eyes shone well dont laugh but i prefer the dialectic approach who is this character middleton wondered fire away lets start simply you are interested in devras sikari correct middleton didnt hesitate yes very good and why did you come here in that quest to russia that wasnt a question it was a test one of my people was killed another badly wounded by an explosion in florida at a location linked to sikari the device used was thermobaric which suggested a russian source given the armys use of such weaponry in chechnya and the man raised his hand please mr middleton do not insult me the smile faded us marines have used thermobaric weapons in iraq they were used extensively in the second battle for fallujah the device is called a smaw shoulderlaunched multipurpose assault weapon it was used against fortified positionshouses mosques you think we dont know this good god a sixyearold who can google could tell me as much middleton replied and did you think i wouldnt have other leads im serious mr middleton if you are not candid with me your value plummets especially visàvis the sums of cash being offered middleton pulled the collar of his overcoat tight against the chill if youll let me finish this russian connection was arkady chernayev i hope to speak to him i want to know about these explosives the mans smile vanished entirely you were going to talk with arkady chernayev i had to try to accomplish what do you hear what you sound like the group i represent does not have much but persuasion in its arsenal you hoped to persuade him yes youre either a fool or a liar for a moment middleton wondered if hed been wrong perhaps this man wasnt some rogue intelligence agent after all but one of chernayevs operativesthough his protestations had a vaguely theatrical ring he was vamping trying to goad a response and what would middleton tell himthe truth that he believed chernayev and a great many other russians saw an arms race on the subcontinent as inevitable worse that china before that arms race proceeded much further would invade kashmir from its own controlled areas in aksai chin and the transkarakoram tract doing so for the water contriving some pretext for the offensive such as protecting an otherwise expendable ethnic minority russia could either get drawn into a ground war with china or let proxies wage the fight for itenter chernayev the reason his company had been bailed out during the recent financial crisis was because of his pledge to use his private army to facilitate the development of a friendly force in kashmirnationalists perhaps rabid idealists no doubt but still susceptible to simple bribery would they remain so with a secret source of heavy water a cache of nuclear arms was chernayev aware of the copper bracelet were his russian facilitators all of this went through middletons mind as he pondered the mans question why would chernayev involve himself in such an outlandish scheme but in any case middleton needed information he decided to play the man right back he took a gamble i didnt have any choice but to come here my leads to the scorpion dried up chernayev was all i had left he bluffed the reaction was subtle but telling trying not to sound eager the man said what do you know of the scorpion so hes not bidding for me no answer middleton had a flash and tried another gamble i dont know much he said but ill tell you it was confusing we couldnt figure out how one individual could pay for all of sikaris education and then stake him after he graduated with startup capital for his corporations it had to be companies or foundations that were involved the man replied as if the scorpions support of sikari were common knowledge you never thought that the companies he or she owns ultimately were set up as subterfuge layers upon layers of companies like bluewatch bluewatch middleton frowned the security outfit in dubai bluewatch had been the subject of a number of investigations following the shooting deaths by overly enthusiastic employees around the world most of the investigations had ended without any prosecutionssome said the company had intimidated prosecutors and judges forcing them to drop charges the man said but the cash ultimately came from one individual who controlled all the companies the scorpion so hed not only confirmed the scorpion had paid for sikaris education and financed his companies but that for some reason no name and his organization whatever it was had been following the kashmiris story very closely and undoubtedly they too were eager to find the scorpion which told middleton that heor shewas the answer to everything well he told his captor like i was saying we werent successful in finding the scorpion no name continued do you know sikaris own description of his benefactor he said he was holy but of this world yes but i think that was a corrupted translation the words sikari used were jnana and vijnana the prefix vi when added to a noun tends to diminish or invert the meaning of that noun jnana is spiritual knowledge vijnana then is practical or profane knowledge sometimes vijnana and jnana used together are meant to suggest knowledge and wisdom all he meant was the man had not just a worldly but philosophical bent no name shrugged what more do you know about this scorpion tell me and ill make your life here easier not much another gamble he thought of felicias email to him aside from the copper bracelet of course no names attempt to conceal his surprise was futile his reaction was even more pronounced than at the reference to the scorpion as if unable to stop himself he asked and the relation between the scorpion and the copper bracelet how do you mean colonel middleton wanted to play the man out longer but he knew that if he told too much hed use up whatever value he had i think ive said all im going to for the time being the man leaned forward persisting do you know about the technology involved what have you learned middleton smiled and shook his head no name studied him for a moment then rose and turned toward the door staring at the back of his heavy wool coat middleton felt an odd premonition as though life itself were about to leave him there alone hed established his value and learned some facts but had he inadvertently exposed himself to long bouts of torture to learn what else he knew what now he tried not to sound frightened ive cooperated how much longer do you intend to keep me here the man rapped gently on the door the deadbolts rattled open without looking back over his shoulder he said regrettably thats not for me to decide ian barrettbone stood outside the léglise de la madeleine leaning down so his face was level with those of charley middleton and leonora tesla he said youre making a mistake you know you can always talk to me tesla said he sighed laboriously not acceptable how many times ill pass word on to colonel middleton then if he wishes to contact you we have the number you provided he leaned closer laying a hand on the roof of the cab the offer stands till midnight not a tick longer after that im afraid the race is on and youre at a distinct disadvantage you know been a step behind the whole time i can change that truly but ill expect a certain recompense you understand only fair as i said ill pass that along she signaled for the cabbie to drive on thank you for your they were out of earshot before she knew how to finish the two women watched through the rear window as the dapper thuggish enigmatic englishman grew smaller staring right back at them through a ghostly plume of black exhaust tesla tried her phone yet again but was unable to reach middleton a call to wiki chang revealed that hed sent their boss information on some shipping companies suspected of sending explosives to florida from russia and that middleton was investigating that lead in moscow but the tech expert had been unable to reach him either the taxi turned onto the place de la concorde and merged with traffic funneling onto the champs élysées charley turned toward the front her voice an empty whisper know what i admire most about you nora lacing her fingers together she stared at her folded hands in her lap as though not quite sure to whom they belonged you convinced that man and quite possibly yourself that my father is still alive linda barnes the fourposter dominated the room like a throne on a dais royal blue drapes floated over ivory walls a turquoise satin coverlet turned the bed into a shimmering pool fat cherubs chased each other around the intricately carved molding outdoors lovers who shared a kiss as they watched the brightly painted dhows cruise by on the creek could be jailed here in one of dubais finest hotels a mirror was mounted to the ceiling over a bed large enough to sleep four jana found the decadence both disturbing and provocative her longsleeved navy sheath was conservative in cut as befitted a woman traveling in the middle east the kind of dress an airline hostess might have chosen or a nun although neither would have cinched it with a wide leather belt she located the blackberry with no difficulty tucked in the corner of the middle drawer of the bureau to the left of the bed as arranged at exactly eight she pressed the keys the connection took time but the voice when he answered was clear the right voice archer had learned hindi from the man he called father devras sikari they conversed in that language jana proud of her fluency in her mothers native tongue she rarely spoke it aloud letting others see her as the ignorant south asian almost equally tonguetied in english and french the assumptions of others wearied her particularly the assumptions of men yes she said he is with me hes assured me theres a lead and i believe him she listened awhile nodding her head all the while wrestling with the news archer had just delivered rather casuallythe death of his father devras sikari it was inevitable of course though the particular circumstances had turned the matter into more of a shakespearean tragedy her heart pounded hard as she considered the implications of the mans death there were many of them is there news of middleton she asked detained by the russians i doubt we need concern ourselves further with the amateurs they beat us with balan she replied but we made that work to our advantage no it was the overhead mirror that betrayed pierre crane jana might not have noticed the journalist if shed been scanning the room at eye level but reflected in the ceiling mirror the slight movement of the door to the suites living room was clear as was its cause she neither lowered her voice nor changed her tone so then when do we move the equipment archer said soon it is set it will be done the wise control the world the wise control themselves she said quickly pressing the button that ended the call jana returned the blackberry to the drawer and as she unpacked her small duffle thought of crane who lurked in the next room she had mixed feelings about the reporter her sources had given her a lot of information about him he wasnt about money or power he was about journalism and the storywith a capitol s which meant she could trust him up to a point jana though never believed in trust daughters whose fathers are murdered rarely do but crane had access to important facts and in this murky business facts were what she needed besides the gawky reporter was lusting after her and therefore it would be easy to tap the spigot of what he knew about the scorpion middleton and the others after the girl she thought was charlotte middleton had escaped in london jana had cut crane free and hed behaved just as she knew he would like a puppy with no desire to stray from his mistress leash or none shed tried to charm from him what information he had but hed continued to withhold details other than the lead was centered in dubai jana had immediately sized up what was going on and suggested that they go there together shed find the connection to the scorpion first hand while he continued his research for the story its what hed been hoping for all along he immediately agreed now crane approached with deliberately noisy steps and knocked come in you people do yourselves well jana he said in french the bedroom on the far side of the living room is spectacular plenty of room lovely view too you can see all those odd little boats he changed gears quickly tell me about yourself questions jana said always questions i gave you dubai you promised me the truth for my story so really pierre yet another question can we concentrate on something other than talk weve been on airplanes for hours jana let her voice fall but kept her eyes steady she knew how to play this game a matter of tone and body movement rather than words crane took the bait you are a very attractive woman jana a compliment from a man who tells lies for a livingwhat is that worth again her words meant little im a journalist i dont lie well not very often besides beautiful women dont need compliments from homely men so now i am beautiful you know perfectly well you are ah but you call yourself homely thats absurd to a woman being handsome is about making a woman feel like a woman i think you understand what i mean smiling jana folded her arms under her breasts giving them an unnecessary boost well we do tend to try harder crane said but how could you and i achieve mutual trust janas eyes crane noticed had flecks of caramel almost gold in the iris her lashes were long and thick like her hair perhaps we would have to start by searching each other he said jana lifted her chin and lowered her lashes really if you wouldnt mind she held his eyes for a moment then slowly turned her back lifting the heavy hair from the nape of her neck with her left hand exposing the thin zipper that ran like a snake down the length of her navy sheath women as you know must be carefully and thoroughly searched the third time connie carson woke she didnt feel nauseous she was aware she was recovering in a hospital room and the cool white light no longer terrified her nor did the lack of feeling in her right arm an absence so strong shed been afraid to look down sure she would see nothing but a stump but she was startled by a face peering down at her langer she thought the kendoll cop do you think you can stand move he asked hurriedly the quiet intensity of his voice flooded her system with adrenaline you sure stirred up a hornets nest he looked around as if he anticipated action come on weve got to go if she hadnt needed all her strength to sit up and swing her legs over the side of the narrow bed carson would have said thats exactly what i meant to do her phone call and middletons response must have grabbed somebodys attention let me help langer reached for her left elbow i can thank you does dr ahmed know youre ahmeds way too interested in you already hes not our friend now that she was standing on her own langer tossed her a robe then quickly grabbed her chart from the end of the bed and tucked it into a carryall hes been on the phone to friends in pakistan the room didnt spin exactly it did a lazy halfcircuit an aborted pirouette whoa come on connie stay with me langer jumped to her side arm around her waist helping her don a blue chenille robe twice the size of her slender frame were on the third floor we turn right out the door twenty steps to the second door on the left three flights down handrail all the way you hear me pushbar door at the bottom opens directly outside theres a black van at the end of the path the back doors will open as you approach there are clothes for you inside why carson whispered as she sank back onto the bed deciding for the moment not to press the button that would summon a nurse she was wondering whether langer could be trustedwhether she had hallucinated the entire episode suddenly the door opened and he was back this time pushing a gurney get on you didnt answer me what was the question why should i trust you langer lifted her like she was a three year old and set her firmly on the gurney she had already parted her lips to scream by the time his response reached her ear wiki chang wiki were trying to save your life connie in bed jana thought of herself not as the girl in the movie the slut who spread her thighs for any hero any villain but as the great film director she was the girl yes but she was completely in control sometimes the girl looked like janas own reflection a sultry twin with shiny dark hair sometimes she was a younger jana a jana as she had once been the naïve younger sister of brothers whod taught her too soon what girls like her were good for sometimes she was a remote ivoryskinned blonde the director in jana rarely enjoyed the kind of opportunity afforded by the dubai suite champagne glasses on the bedside table satin sheets glinting in softly diffused light this was no cheap porno reel but a james bondlike thriller an upscale fantasia crane she admitted to herself hardly looked the part his long limbs were fishbelly pale his hair was dull his nose long but he was surprisingly muscular very sturdy jana watched the reflection in the ceiling mirror studied the splay of cranes limbs as he lay across her dark skin there was little jana would change about her body she was pleased with the swell of breast and hip she wished her nose were shorter a touch more retroussé more than that she wished she did not sweat the movie girl always looked glossy and cool in bed during and after the most passionate of exertions a bond girl shimmered and glowed jana sweated it interfered with her closeups making them uncomfortably real crane snorted jana tightened her hand at the base of his spine murmuring in his ear rotating her hips slowly encouraging him to stay longer film directors she found concentrated on the mans pleasure jana the director concentrated on her own why not she thought she had time to kill crane considered himself so clever so subtle with his veiled questions about the scorpion about ian barrettbone as if they were important as if they were the movers and shakers the planners and undertakers of the mission it was like the buddha said in the ancient sanskrit motto engraved on the copper bracelet the irrigators direct the water fletchers fashion the shaft carpenters bend the wood the wise control themselves perhaps archer had been right to alter the last phrase the wise control themselves making it the wise control the world already he had altered the second phrase no longer the fletchers fashion the shaft but the archer shoots the arrow jana smiled at the conceit then her thoughts of archer faded and an image of devras sikari soon followed her mood changed instantly she faked a second more theatrical orgasm when she squirmed her discomfort he dismounted and lay beside her one ungainly arm draped across her belly he seemed entirely pleased with himself a schoolboy whod passed his final exam with flying colors when he caught his breath he said now dont you think i deserve the answer to a question or two certainly pierre thats what any pliant bond girl would reply but i must use the bathroom darling if he had any doubt that hed won her over this was the danger point this was when the man would protest try to grab her or flee jana the director watched the action on the overhead screen hurry back was all crane said clanging bells announced the elevator turning her head to the side carson read a sign warning hospital staff against discussing patient care in public places langer had his sig sauer p under the top sheet where he could retrieve it quickly carson wondered whether shed be able to reach itlanger had convinced her she might need to she watched the white light as the elevator descended each time they passed a landing without interruption langer said steady connie were closer closer at the basement level langer pushed the gurney out of the elevator his eyes searching left and right this corridor leads to a loading dock he said carson stared helplessly at the ceiling ready langer asked her throat dry carson nodded suddenly langer began to run speeding the gurney along the endless corridor the whoosh of automatic doors preceded warmer air the scent of ocean sunlight as they rolled down a ramp carson saw a black chevrolet express waiting at the end of the path she heard the squeal of tires in the near distance langer raced her toward the van where jimmy chang the man jeanmarc lespasse had christened wiki waited near the open hatch he called to her waving his hand frantically his eyes wide a black town car bounded toward the loading dock she knew it was someone connected to sindhu power the company might be defunct but the people who wished to keep its secrets were alive and well the detective said heres where we say goodbye connie what dont think my jurisdiction includes wherever you and your people are going to follow up leads in this case the best thing i can do is play defense here now get moving he pulled out his sig and turned to face the oncoming lincoln the car slowed langer go thank you chang jumped out and lifted carson from the gurney her injured body stiffening in his arms he bundled her inside and the van took off roaring toward the exit hey you look great chang said as he settled into a seat carson could only imagine how she looked standing there with no makeup a huge bathrobe bare feet she felt a tingling in her right arm i mean youre just like your picture i mean youre pale but otherwise the vans bay was converted to a cross between an ambulance and a computer lab a workspace for wiki that came complete with a cot along one side three glaring widescreen lcd monitors and a couple of gooseneck work lamps nested on a long shelf twined with cables small green lights pulsed chang said do you want to get into bed dammit that sure didnt come out right what i mean i mean theres a cot because of your operation your arm must hurt like hell im glad to see you wiki he looked like his photo too not at all like his glamorous wellmuscled second life avatar in person chang was like an elongated twelve year old with a round face oversized spectacles and a bad haircut whatever you did to that cop you turned him into a pussycat i thought he was gonna arrest me as soon as i revived langers not bad his people were keeping an eye on the industrial park the one that blew up the one where jeanmarc died chang seemed to hear her thought yeah tampa pd had information that one of the outfits in the park was a front for a bunch of mexican narcotraffickers from the juarez cartel they had it under surveillance the department even put someone on the front desk an image of jeanmarc danced before carsons eyes too bad the man didnt the operation was shut down months ago before sindhu power and electric cleared out the tampa cops say sindhu seemed like an ordinary business but if they had someone on the front desk they must have noticed something better than that they kept copies of everything shipping manifests stuff like that they searched through the dumpsters you know looking for stuff on the drug runners but pretty much going through all the garbage folks at sindhu were avid shredders langer told me but one day the surveillance team found a disk musta fallen under a desk or something and the cleaning crew tossed it and youve got it the van sped toward langer tried to read the thing said it was encrypted all to hell and back figured with a name like sindhu and them clearing out somebody ought to check it so he notified a pal in homeland security guy might have gotten back to him in four or five years but youve got the disk i sure do yeah you bet her arm throbbed she was thirsty and exhausted but carson had to smile at his enthusiasm then she remembered jeanmarc and a lump rose in her throat chang was so young though she was only a few years older she felt ancient by comparison she said fill me in whats our next move whos driving this rig a friend hes cool he was an army medic too in case you you thought of everything his grin was infectious if youre up for it were heading to a military airbase macdill middletons orders the young mans face grew grave not exactly connie colonel middletons gone missing what no phone to trace nothing headed to russia and then vanished you havent heard anything from him not a word tesla will fill you in you wont be going with me im supposed to hold down the fort here right youre not supposed to leave the lab are you hey he said smiling expansively and waving his arms at the interior of the van i brought it with me on the whole pierre crane thought he had not done badly he was alive he wasif no closer to the secret of who had financed sikaris education or the riddle of the scorpionat least closer to the woman who was in some way entwined in the scorpions life who wanted him dead or wanted to use him the woman who was quite possibly his equal he had acquitted himself well in bed casanova he had heard had been if not an ugly man a man of no particular physical distinction he assessed the danger at the moment and found it minimal their lovemaking had proven that and besides he knew himself to be more than a match for jana physically he was an expert in several forms of unarmed combat after all and he was confident that it wouldnt come down to a matter of firearms hadnt he been with her when shed disposed of her pistol before entering the terminal at heathrow hadnt he sat beside her on the long flight and accompanied her in the taxi directly to the hotel and she was naked now he was wondering what she might shed on the story of the three young south asians staked to an education and startup capital what he thought of as his anomaly story the story of the scorpion as a journalist he honored the maxim follow the money the scorpion raised money had money but it galled crane that after all these months he was still no closer to knowing who exactly the man was that he was a man of no particular allegiance was a given such men operated across national borders money and the economy were global so crime was global as well perhaps he should be paying less attention to figures of political intrigue more to those of organized crime organized crime had the networks international terrorism needed the smuggling routes the purveyors of forged documents the weapons and moneylaundering connections money moved with lightning speed and money begat more money the kind of wealth that could build palaces in the desert entire cities like dubai whose money was behind such rapid development oil money yes but he had heard tales of the wealth of powerful russian oligarchs crane heard the water running in the bathroom he thought again of janas body and thoughts of the scorpion slipped from his mind wiki chang flicked on an overhead light carson blinked fluttering her eyelids until her irises adjusted to the bright fluorescence the interior of the black van thats where she wasa van speeding toward a military airbaseand she was lying on a cot not unlike the gurney on which shed escaped from the hospital except this one was bolted to the wall opposite the computer screens did i you tried to take a nap standing up i caught you before you fell and carried you here im stronger than i look changs face flamed scarlet not that youre heavy thats not what i meant uh i hope you dont mind really carson thought he was totally adorable no no dont get up he insisted when she tried to sit you should be lying down i researched your postop care but having your chart really helps in about twenty minutes youll need your pain meds ive got those ready your antibiotics will be im sure youve got it under control carson said please go back to work you said the disk was encrypted a real bear you havent been able to decode it carson didnt know how long shed been unconscious so she tried to keep the disappointment out of her voice everyone said wiki chang was the best but if langer a hobbyist and tampa pd hadnt been able to crack it and his pal at homeland security a pro had already given it a whirl no ive got the disk decoded see as if the other three monitors were only for show chang held up a slim laptop tilting the screen until she nodded her approval im not even sure what im looking at its a zip file an archive containing a bunch of other files i opened it using fcrackzip this terrific bruteforce zip cracking program for linux i mean it really didnt have a terribly complicated password and even if it had been way more complex there are tons of cryptanalysis tools i could have used the encryption in zip files just isnt all that good ill take your word for it carson said chang hurried on pointing at the screen with an index finger for emphasis now the coded files are all picture files see they were taken by a nikon except for this one this ones pretty cute its not a photoits a diagram see a blueprint of a hydroelectric dam i matched it to the architectural drawings and schematics for the baglihar dam project in jammu and kashmir right good old j k but see this the blueprints have been altered altered added to these look like plans to set up a heavywater reactor at the core of the dam in a kind of subterranean chamber carson couldnt keep the excitement out of her voice but that could be what weve been looking for what sindhu power and electric was shipping overseas the parts for the heavywater reactor does it say when the reactor will go online does it give a date weve got to get in touch with middleton hold on connie the plansthe alterationsto accommodate the heavywater reactor ive been looking at them and excuse me but theyre either bullshit or theyre incomplete the way they are now theyre like a highclass con a way to justify some incredible expenditures but they wont actually do the trick theres a reason the patent for this stuff was applied for but never granted this whole copper bracelet technology seems to be built around faulty assumptions copper bracelet yeah because of the shape of the copper pipes he said okay so the reactor wont actually go online light glinted off changs oversized lenses and carson shifted her head to get a clearer look at the screen doesnt seem it will the young man said there could be a way to fix it but nobody seems to have the technology to do that at this point in any case theres no heavywater generator at the dam connie this whole thing doesnt smell right you think the files are some kind of trap like the one set in the office i think this disk is more than it seems what do you mean the picture files take a look at them chang flashed a series of images on the laptop screen carson would have shrugged if her arm and shoulder had functioned it looks like an office the office at sindhu the image of the place was seared on her retinas along with a picture of jeanmarc lying there eyes staring blankly into space chang said do they look like anything youd want to encrypt a picture of a desk a chair a table maybe they were just keeping them on the same disk maybe or they might be something else i mean why put these innocentlooking photos in with a file thats so complex i decided there must be another layer beneath the images but how would you find out if steganography chang said it can embed information into a file but getting it back isnt just a matter of running a simple cracking programyou have to figure out how it was done because there are so many different ways i tried a couple of approaches while you were out of it and i finally got a handle on it with the digital invisible ink toolkit and theres definitely embedded information in this picture so ive got it but its encrypted too and you dont have the encryption key wheels within wheels carson thought how many layers would they have to penetrate not yet chang said this is an oldstyle pencilandpaper cipheryou can tell because its just lettersbut wait a minute look at the letter frequencies i havent seen one of these in years but i think this might be a playfair cipher playfair carson said spies used it a long time agoin world war ii right how do you find the encryption key if its playfair itll be a group of to unique letters it could be a single word but sometimes its say a long phrase in a book a song lyric a phrase all the members of the group would have to know chang nodded anyone who needs to decode messages wiki you called the technology for the heavywater reactor the copper bracelet right yeah when we were in france the copper bracelet was an actual physical copper bracelet jewelry as she spoke carson tried to circle her left wrist with her right hand the effort made her gasp there were words engraved on it in hindi or sanskrit do you want your pain meds now its a little early but ill wait youve seen it the bracelet with the elephant and the moon sure middleton sent it to me at the lab ive got it with me you know what it says yeah sure its a quotation from the buddha irrigators direct the waters fletchers fashion the shaft carpenters bend the wood the wise control themselves wheres it from the quote a text called the dhammapada its a compilation of the buddhas words could that be the key word dhammawhatever chang shook his head too many repeating letters well could the quote itself be the encryption key its a long enough phrase wiki said lets give it a whirl i think i remember how to do this carson said you make a fivebyfive grid right yeah the most common way to do it is to take the first letter of each word in the phrase so wed start out i d w f then a from the second letter of fashion since weve already used the f then h s and so on you arrange the letters at the beginning of your grid one to a square followed by the rest of the letters in the alphabet in order with the q or sometimes the j omitted and if the first letter in each word doesnt work you try the last letter or so there are a lot of possibilities this could take a while take me a few minutes to write a tiny perl program really its way quicker than filling in the grid hit or miss perl sorry its this really easy computer languageim boring the hell out of you arent i no wiki i love puzzles she stopped the pain was waking in earnest now fire blazed down the length of her arm maybe you better give me a pill or two hey im sorry i forgot chang disappeared from carsons view with a clatter using the wheeled desk chair to scoot around the vans interior he retrieved a vial of pills from a satchel a paper cup and a bottle of water from the monitor shelf before returning to the side of the cot you lie back and relax okay youre turning paler every second but i hey doctors orders obediently carson swallowed the pills chang scooted his chair back to the shelf turned a gooseneck lamp to focus on his laptop keyboard flexed his fingers and went to work not the first letter of every word he said not the last dammit carson closed her eyes it had felt right basing the encryption key on the quote from the bracelet so much for hunches now what do we do hey come on if they can code it i can crack it hey wait a sec ive got it just the thing its perfect a little gem of a program i once wrote for a puzzle contest a puzzle contest yeah its kind of embarrassing right for the american cryptogram association bunch of retired crossword addicts and a few computer geeks too i never thought this thing would come in handy but lemme see now yeah this wont take longer than a minute or two itll run way faster on this baby than on the computer i used when i wrote it changs fingers flew across the laptops keys howre you doing connie pills working yeah i think so the fire was subsiding carson welcomed the throbbing in its stead hey hey we nailed it whoa look at this sucker fourth letter in every word whats it say oh shit chang murmured under his breath dammit to hell it didnt work carson felt utterly deflated by the letdown she heard the chair wheels cross the floor changs dark eyes peered down at her from behind his spectacles no it worked all right he said but heres the thing theyre not planning to go online with the heavywater plant there is no heavywater reactor never was a heavywater reactor sindhu didnt send any copper bracelet the copper bracelet is the organization not some shortcut to a nuclear reactor but what about those shipping manifests sindhu sent something you know where the plant is right on the chenab river its an indianfunded project but the location is in disputed territory between pakistan and india i know connie said impatiently traditional enemies with nukes chang added yeah so so they didnt send copper piping and coils they sent thermobaric explosives theyre going to blow the baglihar dam sky high just as the blackberry had been preplanted in the drawer the browning buck mark was taped inside the toilet tank jana appreciated the compliment the was a marksmans gun a larger weapon would have been overkill the bathroom was easily as large as the room she had shared with her brothers growing up white veined marble surrounded the tub and steam shower aqua tile gleamed on the walls and floor she used the facilities quickly flushed the toilet and turned on the hot water in the jacuzzi using the noise to cover the sound as she screwed the gemtech suppressor to the threaded end of the traillite barrel she jutted her head into the bedroom crane was naked on the bed scanning the room service menu pierre she said come here crane looked over the menu i was going to order us this is better she said over the rushing water in a moment he replied as he reached for the telephone he ordered something she set the pistol down temporarily on the edge of the jacuzzi opened a jar of bath salts the source of the jasmine aroma and inhaled deeply on the edge of the tub white towels were folded into a thick stack she checked her appearance in the mirror over the twin sinks rearranged her hair please pierre crane rolled from the bed and opened the door he stood naked in the frame ive ordered us a bit of caviar jana stopped him just inside the doorway by aiming the silenced pistol at his knee not so close that he could move in and grab it away in one of his karate moves shock registered in cranes eyes youre surprised pierre this is what its come down to if you want to live answer me first what do you know about harold middleton a flash of recognition in his eyes the man didnt try to bluff hes former us military intelligence maybe a killer im not sure the implication is that he has some connection to the scorpion thats why i ended up in london look im on your side where is he i dont know i swear what else do you know about him tell me i didnt have much time to find out anything if you recall you stopped me at his flat youre lying i tell me she said it calmly and that she didnt thrust the weapon forward theatrically seemed to scare him all the more i did see something in his flat a note about his daughter what about her where shes staying in paris the queen elizabeth hotel registered under her mothers maiden name jana knew that the daughter sometimes worked for the volunteers she filed this new information away the name rosewald i think all right now tell me everything you know about the scorpion no games no pillow talk facts his eyes were searching for his play but he was naked and too far away to try marital arts his look of betrayal was feigned he hadnt trusted her to start with and in any case he knew deep down that she wasnt one to be moved by hurt looks or pleas for compassion he bankrolled sikari and a few others anonymously but im not sure what he wanted from them hes in itwhatever it isfor the money if hes a he im not even sure he is he might even be a group think about that whats the dubai connection why are we here he regarded her eyes and his lost their playfulness completely the scorpion is connected with bluewatch crane said as calmly as he could which is headquartered here her eyes glowed at this information the security company yes tell me more theirand presumably the scorpionsinterests currently involve india and pakistan and what are those interests i dont know that i dont the reporter was now showing fear she wondered if hed start to cry im asking you again do you know anything more about his identity no i swear please jana she believed him another question in the limo that night outside paris who were those men i thought you knew you tried to kill them i tried to kill them because i didnt recognize them tell me i was led to believe one of them was the scorpion i was wrong they never identified themselves other than that they were trying to get information out of me i assume they sent me to middletons flat in london but i dont know why his tone and delivery convinced her that he was being truthful crane gave a weak smile now ive done my part your turn to answer some of my questions he reached for a towel to cover his nakedness she knew instantly this was a feinthis submissive pose gave him away so she was fully prepared when he flung the towel in her direction and leaped forward in what must have been some classic karate move swinging his long arm and knifelike flat hand directly at her throat she only had to step back two feet and pull the trigger several times the recoil was negligible jenny siler something was happening harold middleton thought listening to the muffled sounds emanating from the world beyond the cracked plaster walls of his cell after so much uncounted time in solitary confinement middleton was like a blind man his senses as finely tuned as the strings on felicias beloved szepessy he had learned to distinguish the various footsteps in the hall outside his door and what they meant whether his meal of rancid soup would be served with an angry smirk or merely an apathetic one if there was a purpose to the questions about to be posed to him or if the impending interrogation was merely a way of passing the time but this was different there was an urgency to the raised voices and hurried movements that he had not heard before from somewhere outside the boarded windows came the faint but steady thrum of an engine and the unmistakable hint of diesel fumes they were getting ready to move him middleton was almost certain this was the case though why was less clear had one of the factions interested in him finally placed a winning bid or had the russians grown impatient and decided to wash their hands of himpermanently given the circumstances neither possibility boded well for his survival if he was going to get out of this alive middleton decided he would have to act now quickly he glanced around the room searching for anything that might function as a weapon his eyes lit on the ancient space heater and he lunged for it kicking the cover with the sole of his boot feeling the rusted screws that held it to the wall give way another kick and the cover swung open to reveal the glowing heating element a crosshatch of naked metal sharp and hot middleton told himself as he delivered a third kick knocking the element free in a shower of sparks he could only hope it would be more effective in his hands than at its intended purpose there was a flurry of footsteps in the hallway just outside the door and middleton recognized the voice of the sadeyed russian whod visited him earlier pulling the sleeve of his jacket down over his hands he picked up the redhot element slipped it into his pocket and hastily kicked the heater closed praying the man would be in too much of a hurry to notice the mangled cover almost instantly the door swung open and his inquisitor accompanied by a shorter beefier and decidedly meaner looking compatriot in a black leather jacket and stiff jeans strode into the room out the brutish man commanded producing a pistol from the waistband of his pants motioning toward the door whats going on middleton demanded taking note of the mans choice of weapona russian military issue yarygin pya the sadeyed man took a black cloth bag from his pocket and handed it to middleton if you could be so kind as to put this on he crooned in his cultured accent middleton hesitated feeling the weight and heat of the metal in his pocket contemplating his options if they were in fact moving him to another location hed do better to wait until they were outside to use his makeshift weapon i have other ways of asking that are not so nice the russian reminded him reluctantly middleton took the bag and slipped it over his head a hand grabbed him roughly by the arm and he felt himself propelled forward out the door and down the corridor then down a narrow twisting flight of stairs in his blind state he stumbled on a riser and pitched forward his shoulder slamming painfully into the wall up up up the man with the yarygin yelled cursing middleton in russian prodding him with the pistol he smelled of fried onions cheap tobacco and the saccharine stink of halfmetabolized vodka in the confines of the stairwell the stench was overpowering trying not to retch middleton staggered to his feet and resumed his hurried descent he could hear more voices now urgent shouting in russian hurry hurry and that engine again louder and closer then suddenly there was a blast of frigid air and they were outside middleton took a deep breath trying to gauge exactly what was going on around him dim early morning light filtered in through the mask the air was heavy with the odors of fastfood grease and industrial pollution from the movements around him he guessed that there were at least four men possibly more no doubt all armed still if he could get the yarygin away from his captor he might stand a chance it was now or never slipping one hand into his pocket and grabbing the heating element middleton reached up and pulled the bag off his head before the russian could react middleton whirled around jamming the jagged end of the metal element into the mans eye the makeshift weapon found its mark with a sickening thwack lodging itself firmly in the guards upper cheek the man groaned in pain middleton caught his gun hand and wrenched it backward delivering a sharp blow to the russians ribs with his free elbow he pried the yarygin free then pivoted to face the others a splitsecond was all the time middleton had to survey the situation but it was long enough for him to realize that he was seriously outgunned hed been right about the five armed men who were loosely gathered around a battered niva a lowrent russian version of a range rover what he hadnt anticipated were the other four guards manning the tall iron gate that blocked the entrance to the villas courtyard all were carrying light machine guns israeli negevs from the looks of them one of the men by the niva fired first initiating a hail of gunfire fueled by a jolt of adrenaline middleton dove for the only cover available the doorway hed just come out of out of the corner of his eye he saw the beefy guard hit the ground his chest riddled with bullets crouched in the darkness middleton briefly considered his dwindling options fighting his way out of the courtyard he knew would be tantamount to suicide the men had just shot one of their own theyd kill him as soon as he stepped out the door the only alternative was to head back into the villa though this didnt seem any more promising already he could hear footsteps above him desperately he rose up on the balls of his feet willing himself to act but before he could do so a deafening roar filled the air it was a sound middleton knew all too well the unmistakable snarl of an incoming rpg there was a flash of whitehot light and a single thunderous clap the force of the blast knocked middleton off his feet slamming him into the wall behind him showering him with plaster the villa shuddered swaying and pitching like a boat on a swell there was a sickening snap as one of the beams holding the ceiling up gave way then in an instant everything went black cant sleep leonora tesla turned from the glowing screen of her laptop to see charley middleton framed in the doorway to the hotel suites bedroom looks like im not the only one you should try you know charley smiled weakly so should you she retorted padding across the room settling herself on the sofa besides its morning tesla glanced at the clock in the bottom corner of her screen and was surprised to see that it was almost five barely she said what are you doing just following a hunch you want to fill me in im not going anywhere the queen elizabeth hotel with its friendly livedin atmosphere and compliant staff was a charming cage if ever there was one but it was for the time being at least a cage nonetheless after their confrontation with the welldressed brit they were reluctant to venture outside the walls of the hotel if that man could find them tesla knew others could as well i found out more about what your father was telling us about sikaris younger days tesla said when he was a teenager he was chosen along with two other boys to go to school in england the whole thing was financed by an anonymous source six years at boarding school then cambridge and after they graduated they were each given startup capital we havent been able to figure out why but we think it was some kind of social experiment all three boys were hindu but one was pakistani one was indian and onesikariwas kashmiri social experiment sounds kind of ominous charley remarked what makes you think it wasnt just plain old philanthropy thats what we thought before we found out that sikari was the only one of the three still alive the indian a man named sanjiv das drowned in new delhi twenty years ago and the pakistani santash grover died after drinking bad well water a few years later are you starting to see a pattern charley looked skeptical thats not the only thing tesla continued guess what all three studied at cambridge dont tell me you guessed it engineering energy and hydrology so whos the source charley asked there doesnt seem to be one so far all wikis been able to find is an impressive collection of shell companies but thats not what im interested in no theres been so much focus on sikari that no ones bothered to find out about the two dead men tesla explained i figured it wouldnt hurt to do some poking around charley middleton sat forward on the couch propping her chin on her palms and what did you find tesla scowled not much so far but then i dont have a lot to work with charley pointed at black and white photograph of a group of people displayed on the screen whats that its a groundbreaking ceremony some project santash grovers engineering firm was working on i just pulled it up from the daily dawn archives she pointed to a slim man in a western suit holding a shovel thats grover whos the little girl charley asked leaning closer to get a better look at the lithe teen who stood slightly apart from the group the intensity of her expression was disarming tesla squinted to read the caption thats odd what this says shes grovers daughter jana but nothing else ive found so far has mentioned anything about him having a child his obituary in the dawn didnt list any survivors maybe its a mistake tesla looked from grover to the child and back again the girls curly hair and mostly mediterranean features were distinctly out of place in the predominantly south asian crowd but at the same time her resemblance to grover was uncanny they both had the same high forehead the same full lips or just maybe shes gone to great lengths to conceal her identity what are you looking at jana snapped as she ducked into the back of the limousine outside le bourget airport in paris her young moroccan driver had not been able to take his eyes off of her since theyd met outside customs but now he quickly averted his gaze looking down at the tips of his cheap dress shoes normally jana might have welcomed the flattery even from a mongrel like him but she was in no mood for it this morning she was furious shed been forced to kill crane and hadnt able to interrogate him further shed spent hours trying to learn what she could about the connection between the scorpion and the bluewatch security company curiously despite her considerable talents shed been able to find out very little the company was shrouded in layers of corporate disguise like a russian matryoshka doll fortunately though one of the reasons she hadnt made much headway was that many bluewatch employees had left the uae for a big mission this in itself was an important findall the more so when she learned that the flight plans had taken them to mumbai and new delhi she wasnt sure what to make of this yet but she had some ideas she fought exhaustion but in just two days jana reminded herself shed have all the time in the world to sleep but for now it was imperative that she focus on the task at hand she and archer agreed to follow one lead that crane had provided jana would fly to paris and take charlotte middleton preferably alive to neutralize any danger from her father and find out what information the man had shed convinced archer that middleton was indeed a threat at the very least she could kill the woman her death would distract middleton and perhaps make him give up his mission altogether avenue pierre er de serbie jana barked as the driver climbed in behind the wheel giving him the street address of the hotel queen elizabeth the man nodded then pulled away from the curb merging with the gleaming black stream of corporate limousines leaving le bourget and heading into paris jana pressed a button on her leather armrest and raised the partition between them a french breakfast was laid out on the small bar a selection of pastries on a china plate a thermos of café au lait butter in the shape of a rose tiny jars of lavender honey and apricot conserves flanked by delicate silver spoons enough to feed a small nation jana thought the excess making her suddenly uncomfortable ignoring the food she reached under her seat and pressed a small and discreetly placed lever immediately the armrest popped open revealing a hawlen mm with a matching silencer and a half a dozen spare clips jana took the pistol from its hiding place and fingered it lovingly here at last was a luxury she could appreciate harold middleton opened his eyes to a roiling cloud of greasy black smoke he couldnt have been out for more than a minute or two but in that brief amount of time the drafty villa had been transformed into hell on earth the ceiling where it still existed was crawling with flames the walls baking hot to the touch the air smelled faintly of burning flesh middleton struggled to his feet trying to orient himself hed lost the yarygin in the explosion but that was the least of his problems the stairway hed come down just moments earlier was gone replaced by a gaping hole a burning beam lay across the doorway his only exit moving quickly middleton sloughed off his jacket and tossed it across the beam hoping to temporarily douse the flames and create a narrow passageway for himself the tactic worked if barely seizing the brief window of opportunity he leapt over the beam and barreled out the doorway the situation outside was only slightly less dire looking around him middleton was reminded of the puzzles charley had loved when she was a little girl drawings where everything was slightly off where you could look and look and still not see the man wearing the shoe on his ear or the bicycle wheel that was really a button bodies lay scattered across the courtyard several of them burning one missing its head another an arm the niva was engulfed in flames shards of glass and other debris from the villa littered the ground the tall iron gate at the courtyards entrance had been blown off its hinges an ordinary explosive device couldnt have caused this much destruction middleton knew his brain slowly beginning to function once again now that he was out of immediate danger no this much damage had to be the result of a thermobaric bomb as he picked his way through the debris heading for the gate middleton listened for the sounds of approaching emergency vehicles it was only a matter of time before the fire department arrived and he didnt want to be there to welcome them but strangely he didnt hear any sirens in fact he suddenly realized he couldnt hear anything not the roar of the inferno not the howls of pain from the guard by the gate with the metal rod stuck in his thigh the explosion had numbed his eardrums fighting back a wave of panic trying to focus on anything besides the fact that he was stone deaf middleton forced himself to put one foot in front of the other and keep moving wait here jana told the driver as they pulled to a stop outside the front door of the hotel the man reached for the key but jana stopped him keep it running she said opening the door for herself swinging her black leather boots out onto the curb i wont be long it was not quite six oclock when she stepped into the hotel queen elizabeth her timing if not perfect was propitious half an hour later and she would have had to contend with a doorman and a bellhop but at this early hour there was just a lone receptionist behind the front desk may i help you the man asked glancing up from his computer screen as jana made her way across the small but elegant lobby he used the formal vous to address her but the tone of his voice was pure contempt jana knew exactly what he was thinking what is this arab whore doing in my hotel he was about to find out give me the key to charlotte rosewalds room jana demanded approaching the front desk the receptionist raised a single black eyebrow would madame also like the combination to the safe he asked with caustic sarcasm the key jana snapped pulling the hawlen from beneath her jacket raising the silenced barrel to the level of the mans heart now calmly he glanced at the gun we dont use keys he said holding up a plastic card for jana to see his nails were perfectly manicured coated with a thin layer of clear gloss i will have to program it for you do it jana told him keeping the mm trained on his chest charley put her ear to the bathroom door and listened with satisfaction to the sound of the shower running she understood leonoras reluctance to leave the hotel but she was starting to go stir crazy if she didnt get out and get some fresh air soon she felt like she might hurt someone she wasnt asking for much just a quick run and a stop at the patisserie across avenue george v for something other than the disappointing croissants the queen elizabeth served once tesla tasted a real pain au chocolat all would be forgiven besides it wasnt like she was sneaking off shed left leonora a note explaining where shed gone and that shed be back in an hour or so with breakfast still she felt a twinge of guilt as she slipped into her running clothes and let herself out into the hallway the elevator was just outside the door of their room but it was notoriously slow and creaky more often than not she opted to take the stairs instead of waiting for it to creep upward but for some unknown reasonlack of sleep affecting her brain perhapsshe pushed the call button somewhere far below in the bowels of the building the aged mechanism rattled to life the receptionist tapped the keyboard a few times then swiped the card through the encryption device next to the computer before handing it to jana the room number she asked two nineteen he sneered how many guests two women one older and madame rosewald he was still sneering when jana pulled the trigger shoving the receptionists body out of sight behind the desk jana headed for the stairs sprinting for the secondfloor landing as she stepped in the hallway she heard the elevator door slide shut an early riser she thought testily no doubt there would be others shed have to work quickly methodically she made her way down the corridor checking the room numbers as she went stopping in front of she paused to listen she could hear the elevator laboring noisily downward and inside the room the faint whine of water running with her left hand jana slid the pass card into the electronic lock and watched the light change from red to green keeping the mm ready she turned the brass handle and let herself inside so two occupants charlotte middleton and presumably some babysitter her father had brought in jana closed the door softly behind her and made her way across the small sitting room moving toward the sound of the shower her wrists were locked in place her finger light on the trigger of the hawlen her mind sharp she nudged open the halfclosed bedroom door and stopped scanning the room the two unmade beds unless theyd taken to showering together only one was here now suddenly the shower stopped jana heard the curtain slide open and the sound of someone climbing out of the tub charley a womans voice called out the babysitter jana thought squaring herself with the bathroom door aiming for the height of an average womans head charley the tone was slightly more urgent the door swung open to reveal a darkhaired woman older but far from old in a white bath towel seeing jana standing there with the gun she drew back slightly where is charlotte middleton jana demanded the woman didnt answer her eyes were hard on jana searching for something then suddenly a look of recognition flickered across her face youre santash grovers daughter she said triumphantly jana flinched it was impossible that this woman should know about her father and yet she did where is charlotte middleton she asked once again reminding herself that any knowledge the woman had would soon be irrelevant the woman smiled go to hell you first jana told her pulling the trigger david liss the smoke the heat of the fires the falling debris the ash that caked his mouth and choked his lungsall these things were near unbearable as was the clutching fingers of death at his heels but what pained him most as he ran through this scene of destruction was the belief that for the rest of his lifewhether the rest of his life spanned decades or minuteshe would never again hear the music he loved so much his hearing was gone no ringing no hum nothing harold middleton felt as though he were trapped in a horrible violent snow globe able only to peer helplessly at the world outside he ran through the shattered compound leaping over crumbled walls scattered furniture dead bodies trying to find his way out of the destruction holding on to the strange and childish notion that if he could escape soon enough perhaps his hearing would be restored as his prize he felt battered and bruised and hot but other than his hearing no injuries seemed serious or permanent and for that he was grateful in his right hand he clutched a battered ak hed found among the ruins scarred but its metal was not superheated hed fired off an experimental roundstrangely disorienting in its silencebefore heading off again and now middleton was glad he had picked it up for as he turned a corner around a ruined toppled wall he saw two panicked russians heading directly toward him behind them a shattered wall spat out hot tongues of fire like an angry demon one of them stopped in his tracks as though stunned by the presence of another living being the other better maintained his composure he raised his weapon and began to fire off bursts of silent gunfire middleton hit the ground rolled and took shelter behind a twisted mass of metal and stone he felt broken glass slice into his palm and in his silent world the pain was somehow more vivid more real than it would have been before he felt rather than heard the impact of the rounds against his shelter and he crouched low assessing his situation he was protected here he was safe for the next few seconds he could form a plan it was all so absurd yes hed done highrisk work before with the volunteers but it was not that long ago he had been a professor of music a man who investigated and verified musical manuscripts now here he was in a destroyed burning compound somewhere outside moscow fired upon by men whose affiliations and allegiances were a mystery to him it was all a mystery to him so much had happened since that day on the beach in the south of france and none of it made any sense at all in a dreamlike state that accompanies the loss of one of the senses middleton peered over his shelter one of the russians stood with his feet wide apart his shoulders hunched moving his weapon back and forth he had a crazed desperate look in his eye and at once it became clear that the russian believed that if he could kill middleton it would somehow lead to his safety just as middleton believed that if he could escape quickly enough his hearing would return middleton squeezed off a short burst and the russian went down now the second russian who had stood still and impassive raised his own assault riffle middleton began to duck but his shirt caught on a protruding piece of metal it took only a second to disentangle himself but that second should have been his end except the russian went down in a spray of ash and blood middleton felt it before he saw it the faint whump whump whump of a helicopter when he looked up it was hovering perhaps fifty feet above the wreck of the compound perhaps two hundred yards from his current position one man in the helicopter squatted with his weapon scanning the chaos while another threw over a rope ladder and waved middleton on he shouted something but middleton could not hear over the noise of the chopper but he could hear that noise his hearing was returning along with the ringing but his hearing was coming back middleton had few choices he could attempt to find his way out of this burning mess fighting off more russians as he found them or he could take the escape offered by the helicopter that seemed to be the better of the two options he would worry about the choppers bluewatch logo later in her paris suite leonora tesla had fallen to her knees she pressed her right hand against the wound in her left shoulder it bled horribly but it was not a lifethreatening woundcertainly not if she could get medical attention soon it hurt like hell and she tried to think clearly through the pain see clearly through the tears of agony that clouded her vision she still wore nothing but an oversized bath towel wrapped around her and absurdly she felt embarrassed she should have worn something more appropriate to her own shooting above her hovered the daughter of santash grover the man who had studied with sikari jana was tall for a south asian beautiful dark in complexion and she moved with a kind of ease and grace that tesla could not help but admire she was also very cruel tesla could see it in her eyes that said the woman in her accented french gesturing with her weapon toward the wound is to let you know that i am serious nothing more than that you may think you are in pain but it is nothing compared to what you will feel if i shoot you in your knee in addition you will have the knowledge that you will never walk unaided again think of what will happen then if i shoot you in both knees take a moment to consider these things and then i will ask you again i dont believe i will ever walk again in any case tesla replied in french trying to think of something anything to give her more time to throw this woman off balance you wont leave me alive i suspect it is the way you work but even if it werent i know you are grovers daughter you think you can kill me to contain the secret but the secret is already out ive already sent a dozen emails something dark crossed the womans face but it was followed by a cruel smile then i will have more questions to put to you i only hope you will answer easily once i put bullets into your knees and elbows any place else i shoot will have little effect ive seen it happen that way im sure you have tesla said with a grunt her eyes scanned the room around her looking for something she might use as a weapon a lamp a phone a phone cord a chair in truth tesla did not know how much torture she could endure before betraying what she knew she supposed it was a good thing she knew so little apparently charley was no longer in the suite she had impulsively slipped out well good for her but she would be back that was what tesla knew or perhaps assumed charley would sooner or later be back and what would she find upon her return teslas dead body and this assassin waiting jana held up her silenced pistol you do not get to ignore my question without me destroying your kneecap so i hope you are prepared to answer me where is charlotte middleton tesla forced herself to grin broadly why shes right behind you the ploy ought not to have worked indeed it would not have worked had tesla not looked so supremely satisfied when she spoke the words all of this womans training and instinctsand tesla did not doubt they were considerablefailed in the presence of what seemed to be real human emotion she turned and looked though it caused her the greatest agony she had ever known hoped she would ever know tesla sprang to her feet and slammed into the woman with her good shoulder ramming into her like an american football player she struck the assassin just below the ribs and the pain was fierce in itself but it reverberated throughout her body and felt as though someone had thrust a hot poker into her bullet wound tesla cried out but so did the assassin the dark woman stumbled back and collided with a chair which she tripped over falling and hitting her head hard upon the carpeted floor the carpet was not thick and the concrete below was heavy tesla heard the womans teeth snap together and a trickle of blood began to flow at once from her mouth grovers daughter had undoubtedly bitten into her tongue she still held onto the gun however and tesla could not afford to wait to discover how stunned the assassin might be in a sweeping gesture graceful and excruciating she raised the wooden chair as far as the wound would let her and smashed it down against the assassins back she wanted to stun her to incapacitate her but hopefully not to kill her she wanted the woman alive and able to answer questions but tesla would kill her if she had to the pain rocked through her and she thought she might faint but she willed herself alert willed herself to ignore the agony she hardly noticed that her towel had fallen off she lifted the chair again this time no higher than her waist it felt impossibly heavy and she felt herself stumble both from her diminished strength and from dizziness her vision went black around the edges as she raised the chair preparing to strike again that was when the door opened charley middleton her face glowing with perspiration walked into the room carrying bags from a parisian bakery she froze and tesla could only imagine how shocking things must seemthis strange woman motionless on the floor mucusy blood oozing from her mouth and tesla herself naked and bloody wielding a chair like a club tesla dropped the chair fell to the floor and burst at once into tears and insane laughter by all rights archer should have been afraid any sane man would be afraid well he amended any sane normal man but he had never been a normal man could not understand what it would be like to be a normal man his brother harris had been a normal man and harris was dead there was much truth to be learned from that simple fact he sat around a low table in a small village outside jhelum in pakistan near the border of the jammu and kashmir he sat with three men all darkskinned south asians and understood his own fair complexion was his greatest obstacle he had always known it would be and he had calculated the solution it seemed hardly possible to archer that these men with their suspicion of outsiderstheir suspicion of everyone reallycould outmaneuver his calculations even so for a moment archer envied sikari and the easy passage his appearance had brought him he a devout hindu had fooled these muslimsfools but clever fools it could not have been easy for him and now archers task was that much harder well what of it he had made it his lifes work to deceive he had deceived his brother almost every day greater and greater deceptions only to see what he could get away with no harris i dont know what happened to your books no harris i have no idea how the stolen whiskey bottle ended up in your room no harris i did not subscribe to those pornographic magazines in your name they were little things of course childish pranks but then they had been children but hed taught himself how to lie how to explain away the impossible to make others believe him when his falsehood was so obvious now he sat with the three men in the dark hovel there was but a single light above them a naked bulb powered by a generator that hummed outside all three stared at him in hot suspicion and dull curiosity but mostly only one spoke their leader a man named sanam he was very tall and painfully thin with a long beard and very intense eyes he wore the same white robes and taqiyah as archer sanam sipped his tea it is all very sudden he said in urdu he had been switching all night from english to urdu to kashmiri to arabic as if to keep archer on his toes to make him slip up but archer spoke all of the languages perfectly just as sakari had made certain he could death is often very sudden said archer my fathers death is a terrible blow to me personally and of course to our cause but it is also the will of allah my father has died and i will mourn him but i will also honor him by continuing his work it is unfortunate that he should die just as events are coming to a head but we must not let our trials stand in the way of our goals i do not love to hear this fairhaired american speak of allah or the prophet or the holy koran said umer one of the other men of the three men he was the most uncomfortable with sikaris disappearance from the scene all night you have sprinkled your conversation with such things as though you were salting your meat but are we children to be so easily deceived you do not look like a muslim you look like an american underpants model archer sensed umer would be his greatest obstacle i do not see how my european ancestors must keep me from following the path of islam he said speaking now in arabic my father raised me as a muslim man ought to raise his son that i am adopted is no matter sanam nodded it would be a sin to doubt his faith because of his appearance nevertheless you must understand our suspicions these are dangerous times we are hunted by the pakistani government your government indias government we must be cautious we must be convinced you are who you say you are archer laughed who else could i be i know my father spoke to you of his sons so my existence cannot surprise you perhaps i am an agent of the cia an organization whose highest ranks concluded that the best way to infiltrate your organization would be to send a fair skinned blueeyed man and of course the cia has no higher priority than infiltrating groups that are primarily interested in the future of kashmir continuing his sarcasm he added and it is well known that the cia has many agents who speak arabic and of course urdu and kashmiri sanam snorted you raise good points your skill with languages ought to be enough to convince us you are not an american agent your knowledge of our ways and customs is impressive and seemingly natural and the information you have offered us is not only vital it corresponds with what we have been able to glean my only question is why should you care your father cared because he came of age in kashmir and understood full well what it means to have our land in the hands of the infidels you are however much a muslim still an american what does kashmir matter to you it matters to me said archer because it mattered to my father it was my fathers jihad and so now it is mine is there one among you who thinks this is not reason enough there were grunts of approval even umer appeared satisfied and archer was careful to keep his expression blank to show no satisfaction and he had every right to be satisfied something had shifted within the room for sanam now spoke much more confidently let me hear how you think we should proceed and i hope you will tell me of your urgency we have planned this attack for a long time why must we act within five days sanam archer believed was a natural leader his men revered him much as sikaris men had revered him his was a band of some fifty or so men an offshoot of the harakatulmujahedeen group it was sikari that had convinced sanam to leave harakatulmujahedeen and form his own group committed to real definitive even final action in kashmir they had for years planned that event lead by sikari every step of the way sikari had used a different name of course convinced them that he was an islamic extremist and so he had intended to play these men like pieces upon a chess board he had set them up and now archer would move them the american secretary of state will be making an unannounced visit to the baglihar dam in five days said archer i can think of no better time to attack you will destroy not only this accursed dam which threatens to render feeble the chenab river but you will strike a blow against the american regime that will be felt all over the world the secretary of state is well knownshe is a household name in all nations her death will make certain the whole world understands the risks of taking indias side as it tries to steal muslim land sanam nodded there can be no better time i agree with that even if the secretary of state were not to be there archer said the time would be upon us soon the baglihars secret heavywater production facilities will be online we cannot allow that to happen we must strike soon and if we can strike and humiliate the american regime i think it would be inexcusable not to take advantage of the opportunity sanam nodded again you can get us what we need what your father promised the explosives yes i shall consider everything you have said sanam announced now rising from his table i will discuss it with my men and we shall let you know dont take too long said archer rising himself we have much to do and little time to prepare you shall have our answer within hours in the car as he drove toward his border crossing archer listened to the men discuss their options they had commandeered the house at random and once they were done they would never return to it they believed that made it safe it certainly made it safe for archer to bug the house the listening device that archer had left under the table would never be discovered because they had no reason now to sweep the room we must do it said umer to finally be rid of the dam and to kill that vile woman at the same time it will glorify allahs name so you are more trusting now asked sanam archer heard umer snort i trust no one you know that but the american has arguments that are hard to refute who would send him to act against us and what have we to lose let us agree with his plan and if the explosives appear where he says they will we will use them if not we will not and we have sacrificed nothing we cannot be any more hunted than we are right now we cannot take more precautions than we already do we exist to act and now is our opportunity to do so i think so too said sanam and if the truth be told i like this american he may be a white man with light hair but he is one of us i feel it as he drove his car archer laughed one of them indeed he had just tricked these fools into their own destruction into the loss of kashmir and very possibly into the destruction of pakistan sanams group would kill the american secretary of state the pakistani government which would by then have obtained the falsified blueprints for the baglihar dam would naturally refuse to condemn the attack instead accusing india of poisoning the waters of the chenab the americans outraged over the death of the secretary of state will side with india especially since they will regard the pakistani claims of a heavywater production facility as the nonsense they so clearly are both sides will be deceived and both sides will be utterly certain they are in the right india certain that pakistans claims are lies meant for the muslim street will be mad with the desire for revenge pakistan believing itself wronged will never forgive india and its western allies the inevitable result will be allout war with the americans aiding india archer will goad sanam into more attacks against american targets and soon the fight against pakistan will be perceived as the center of the absurd war on terror it was not easy to pass from pakistan into kashmir undetected and archer had a difficult night yet before him but a feeling of peace and contentment came over him major global events were now in his hands soon hundreds would be dead then thousands and they were like toy soldiers knocked about on a childs play table the fight for the final disposition of kashmir was about to begin the only remaining problem was middleton and his ridiculous volunteers reviewing sikaris notes archer was convinced his father had made a terrible mistake in targeting middleton indeed it was partially for that reason that he chose to kill sikari rather than just killing his brother had his father left things alone middleton would never have known the value of the information he had gathered during his trip to india maybe he might have put it all together after the fact but never in time to stop things now that he was hunted middleton and his team would be looking to make sense of it all and there was the danger that he would find what he did not know he had that he would be able to piece the puzzle together in time that had been the danger while sikari had lived but that danger was past by now middletons daughter would be with jana and the volunteers would squander their time searching for her perhaps jana would send them a finger or ear from time to time to keep up their interest by the time they realized that charlotte middletons abduction was but a distraction it would be too late at the thought of jana archer felt himself growing erect how he loved her how he desired her sikari had always instructed archer and harris to regard her as a sister archer enjoyed that it made things more interesting he longed to have his sister with him now but they would be together soon enough the journey by helicopter had not taken long but by the time they landed much of middletons hearing was restored how wonderful he thought wryly that the return of sound should be met by the monstrous roar of the chopper the russians who had pulled him in were a taciturn lot and middleton suspected theyd been instructed to tell him nothing but that was fine answers he knew would be forthcoming middleton glanced down at where they were landing a beautiful mansion patrolled by contractors wearing the uniform of bluewatchthe very company whose affiliate had funded devras sikaris educationand that he had betrayed by taking his marbles and going home he understood that the scorpion had learned about him and had brought him here as they lowered onto the helipad atop one of the mansions towers middleton had to laugh to himself over this irony why had bluewatch rescued him and what did they now want with their trophy the russians on board the bluewatch helicopter firmly though not forcefully escorted middleton out of the chopper and then across the helipad and inside the tower only once inside and away from the relentless noise did middleton realize how much his ears were still ringing still he could hear the sounds of his footsteps the rustle of clothing the sound he made when he snorted in air through his nose one of the russians a man with a pale and pasty face and an alarmingly receding chin and yet the shape of a body builder led middleton to the elevator colonel middleton he said in russianinflected english i understand if you would wish to clean up before greeting your host but matters are very urgent you may clean up afterwards certainly well that suggests i will still be alive said middleton enjoying the sound of his own voice thats good news i cant remember the last time i had a proper meal is there any chance my host can have his urgent conversation with me while i get something to eat the russian smiled as though indulging the whims of a child mr chernayev can arrange anything that must be gratifying said middleton the elevator brought them to a massive room that seemed to be very much like a lobby though why a person should need a lobby in their own home was beyond him the theme was baroque and everywhere were gilt statues and th century paintings in gilt frames and baroque settees along the walls the body builder led middleton to a hallway with the same rococo theme and then into a sitting room that was starkly modern with chairs and tables with hard lines and sharp angles on the walls were relatively contemporary portraits but middleton did not recognize who they were the body builder excused himself and middleton found himself standing alone in the spacious room he was not particularly cold but he walked over to the fireplace and rubbed his hands before the fire mostly because it was something to do and doing something distracted him from his own stench hunger fatigue and discomfort besides his hands were filthy and bloody and he was hesitant to touch anything after no more than a minute one of the doors opened and a pretty serving girl set down a tray upon one of the tables it contained much to middletons amusement a hamburger french fries and a glass of cola perhaps the body builder thought americans were incapable of eating anything else it would not have been middletons first choice but it would do fine for now he cleaned his hands with the warm towel to one side of the tray and then devoured the food within minutes shortly after he was done the door opened again middleton had been hoping for the pretty serving girl as hed been hoping for a refill of his soda but it was not her the man standing before him was easily recognizable from the intelligence reports and press photos arkady chernayev and the pieces fell into place chernayev was the scorpion the man was tall and elegantly handsome a man who appeared in the vaguely ageless realm of men in their fifties or sixties who were in excellent physical shape and who dressed in impeccable clothes chernayev wore a dark suit with a perfectly knotted red tie and a highcollared white shirt he appeared very much like a politician about to give a televised address colonel middleton i am pleased you are well you have had enough to eat and drink i hope said arkady chernayev middleton held up his glass i could use some more cola yes said chernayev being rescued from a burning complex is a thirsty business at once the serving girl appeared with a fresh glass she took middletons old one and departed chernayev now gestured for middleton to sit on one of the chairs near the fire he did so the russian joined him so said chernayev i understand you wish to ask me some questions i do and i have some that have just occurred to me chernayev smiled very thinly i can imagine you want to know why perhaps i attacked the compound i was going to start with if said middleton but i am happy to move along to why the why is simple enough you have some very important information and i need it to get out into the world the men who held you did not care about such things who were they they call themselves the group a name very preposterous in its simplicity in my opinion but its vagueness suits them their predecessors were formed in the late years of the second world war a gathering of scientists and academics and politicians who gathered together the leavings of the nazi nuclear program mostly germans and russians but they are not weapons traders not exclusively they do hope to exert their pressure upon world events the cult that his friend ruslan was telling him about the outfit that wanted to resurrect the copperbracelet technology you say that with such contempt said middleton you dont approve i disapprove of how they do so not that they do so at all i would be a hypocrite to take issue with them for i am guilty of such things myself i take you into my confidence now colonel middleton and i hope you understand i would not do so were events not so dire you see i too try to shape world events but for nobler reasons i hope in that capacity i go by a code name the scorpion you know that he asked surprised middleton nodded chernayev held up a hand as if to ward something off i know i know it is absurd i absolutely need my anonymity you understand that the name scorpion was given to me against my will but that is another story there are so many other stories and there will be time for all of them later but for now i know you must be tired and in need of a shower so this meeting will be short there is but one thing i require of you colonel middleton and what is that the american secretary of state will be paying an unannounced visit to the dedication of the baglihar dam in a few days time its important for you to be present on that visit where is that he asked on the chenab river in northern kashmir the nearest town is a resettlement of people displaced when the dam was built i dont recall the indian name but everyone knows it as the village in her paris hotel suite leonora tesla was now fully dressed though her hotel towel turned makeshift bandage had soaked through and was staining her dark blouse charley middleton stood over jana grovers daughter she sat on the floor her hands tied behind her back with telephone cord her feet tied together with an electrical cord ripped from a lamp her mouth was gagged with a torn shirt charley middleton held the gun tesla a letter opener she had found in the suites desk nora we really should get you to a hospital middleton said its mostly stopped bleeding well go to the hospital soon enough but well have to figure out what to do with her first tesla set down the letter opener removed the gag from the assassins mouth and quickly stepped away she picked up the letter opener once more so said tesla perhaps you will tell us who wants ms middleton and why the woman looked up at both of them her eyes dark with hatred and contempt in french she said there is no amount of pain i cannot endure tesla met her gaze lets find out if that is true p j parrish a whimpering sound drew teslas eyes to the corner charley was slumped against the wall the hawlen mm was still in her hand but the barrel with its long silencer was pointed at the floor charley tesla said sharply keep the gun on her her eyes came up brimming with tears when she raised the gun she had to hold it with two trembling hands tesla turned back to jana who was seated on the floor in front of her her dark skin glistened with sweat and her breath was coming so fast and shallow tesla could actually hear the whistle of air through her lips as she struggled to keep calm for the third time tesla snapped a flame from the lighter and positioned the blackened tip of the silver letter opener over it a slither of smoke curled from the bladenot from the char of the silver but from the sear of the tiny bits of flesh that clung to it as she reached toward janas face a memory flicked into her head the beach at cap dantibes harold questioning balan in the same manner he questioned all suspects no matter how vile their crimes respectful measured interrogation there was no point in abusing prisoners he said it was counterproductive tesla pushed harolds face and words from her mind that was him not her tesla held the letter opener in front of janas face the womans eyes filled with defiant tears her dark hair was matted with blood from the gash inflicted when tesla hit her with the chair and her lip was swollen from teslas fists nothing had made her even flinch until tesla had brushed the redhot metal of the letter opener against the smooth olive skin of janas finely sculpted cheekbone vanity that was the key to unlock this womans tongue why are you trying to kill charley middleton tesla demanded jana shut her eyes who are you working with jana pressed back against the wall trying to get away from the letter opener tesla warmed its tip again holding it to the flame until it glowed red then she pressed it against janas cheek jana jerked to the side and screamed as jana slid to the carpet a cell phone fell from the pocket of her trench coat tesla saw the womans eyes skitter to it she snatched it up and tossed it out of reach who are you working for tesla demanded i never tell you jana whispered in english through gritted teeth i never betray him betray who the scorpion your father hes dead dead jana whispered you to be dead soon she looked to charley her too tesla pressed the letter opener to janas cheek again she screamed again as the smell of burning flesh filled the room stop charley middleton screamed teslas eyes spun stop it stop it charley had wedged herself in a corner covering her mouth with one hand the gun dangled from the other charley tesla said evenly but she wasnt listening she was sobbing now tesla stared at her debating whether to go to her or make her leave the room but the bullet wound in her own shoulder was throbbing and even with jana bound and weakened she didnt trust herself to handle things alone right now and she had promised harold she would keep charley safe that was the last thing he had asked of her as they parted in london he told her of his plan to get into russia and when she insisted on going with him he had asked her to meet charley in paris instead nora i cant lose her late that night as tesla had lain curled against his sweating chest the sheets damp with their lovemaking she had felt a rawness a sadness in harold middleton she had never felt before his guilt was palpable over putting his beloved daughter in jeopardy over what he called this quixotic crusade in the dark she had held him and promised to protect her poor little charlotte at the sound of janas voice teslas eyes swung back to the darkeyed woman pressed against the wall shut up tesla hissed jana managed a swollen smirk in french she said the daughter does not have the courage of the father i said shut up tesla swung and hit jana hard with the back of her hand the cut on janas lip ripped open spraying blood on the wall stop it charley cried no more nora please tesla stared at her what was this where was this coming from for the last fifteen minutes as tesla had interrogated jana charley had been quiet even as janas moans of pain had grown deeper charley had not moved not made a sound now suddenly she was coming apart no more nora she whispered please please i cant take this i cant do this anymore suddenly tesla knew for all her bravado charley had never witnessed anything like thisthe interrogation and torture of another human being a woman no less despite harolds willingness to let charley play around the periphery of the volunteers he had never brought her into the violence of its world charley middleton had hacked computers done research her reality was virtual her hands were clean but her own past was clouded with violence the brutal murder of her mother by her fathers enemies the betrayal and death of her husband the loss of her baby another thought flashed through teslas head yesterday in a café charley let her guard down long enough to talk about her mothers death and what she said after i know you and harry were lovers and i used to hate you for that but i dont now i admire you nora and second flash of memory the threat she had made to ian barrettbone yesterday in the taxi as charley listened ill kill you for the sheer pleasure of it charleys sobs filled teslas ears she glanced back at jana whose dark eyes glittered with hatred poor little charlotte jana said her voice almost maternal death is around you mother husband your baby cut from your tesla spun and smacked jana hard sending the woman into a spasm of coughing and spitting blood a soft thud from the corner of her eyes tesla saw charley slump to the carpet one second of diversion but it was enough jana brought her bound wrists up in a quick jerk catching tesla under the jaw and sending her reeling backwards the letter opener went flying a second blow hit tesla in her wounded shoulder white knives of pain sliced through her body for a second the room swirled graygoingblack and she felt herself drop down to her knees jana was just a blur flailing and pulling against the electrical cord on her ankles tesla fought back the waves of pain and nausea one thought in her head gun get the gun tesla threw herself toward charleys body the dark barrel of the gun was just visible beneath the blue of charleys running suit tesla grabbed the hawlen jerked to a kneeling position and leveled it finger curled on the trigger she blinked the room back into focus nothing just a flash of black boots and white trench coat disappearing behind the open door of the hotel room jana stumbled down the stairs but when she hit the hotel lobby she froze a large man in a green windbreaker and ball cap was standing at the desk his face was red and he was banging the bell on the desk hello hey anybody here from her vantage point jana could see the shoes of the dead clerk behind the desk but the american could not a commotion at the door as a fat woman tried to drag a huge suitcase through beyond the window jana could see the open trunk of a taxi and the driver letting loose a stream of crusty french as he pulled out more luggage the taxi was doubleparked blocking her limo and there was no one behind the wheel where the hell was her driver then she spotted the moroccan across the street buying cigarettes at a tabac jana cursed as she gently touched a finger to her seared cheek a sound behind her on the stairs the bitch was after her there was no time she bolted down the narrow hallway to the back the tiny kitchen was a blur as she threw open the door and stumbled out into the cold morning air a quick look told her she was in an impasse with one exit no choice she would have to take her chances on the street jana began to run in the lobby tesla quickly assessed the situation body behind the desk two bewildered and bedraggled americans but no jana holding the hawlen at her side tesla scaled the mountain of luggage blocking the door ignoring the american mans yelling she slid to a stop on the street tesla mentally clicked through the options with computerspeed taxi you couldnt hail one on any paris street and there were no cabs at the nearby stands metro the nearest was george v a good fiveminute hike no jana would try to contact the person who had sent her tesla gave the street a quick scan even at the busiest times of day rue pierre er de serbie was a staid street of stonefacade apartment buildings now at seven on this cold october morning there was only one café owner out the crank of his unrolling shutters breaking the quiet except a lone figure in white just disappearing around the far corner tesla took off in pursuit but when she reached the corner she came to an abrupt stop a swirl of motion sound smells and people damn saturday market day tesla started down the narrow aisle eyes darting between the overflowing stands of vegetables fruits fish and cheeses the crowd pressed closeyoung women pushing strollers old women toting straw baskets boys on mopeds tesla was careful to keep the gun down hoping her loose slacks offered some cover the last thing she needed was a panicked crowd she pushed on her eyes raking the crowd for jana the woman couldnt go unnoticed for long her face was a pulpy mess and her white trench coat was covered in blood where the hell was she tesla grimaced in pain she caught a glimpse of herself in a café window wild hair and a fresh stain of blood on her blouse from her seeping shoulder wound her reflection was framed by orange and black crepe paper hung from the café window paper skeletons and black cats halloween today was halloween a holiday the parisians had just recently appropriated from americans tonight the champs d élysées would teem with drunken kids in vampire teeth and theater blood two women stumbling down the street drenched in the real thing would hardly get a glance today twenty yards away a flash of white amid the riot of color at a far stall tesla reached the flower stall just as jana disappeared again to the left was a narrow alleyway just like the impasse back at the hotel tesla made a quick choice and raced to the open door about halfway down kitchen deserted a brush of a heavy drape and she was in the bistros small dining room a thin man in a white serving coat had been folding napkins but now was just staring where did she go tesla demanded the young mans eyes widened when he saw her gun la femme dans blanc où estelle allée la bas he pointed to a spiral staircase removing the silencer tesla drew in a shuddering breath and started down the narrow stairs she quickly searched the two small toilets nothing there was a third door it opened into a small dark storage room tesla slapped the cold wall and her hand found a switch the small room came to life under the single hanging bare bulb rough stone walls a cracked tile floor piles of old tables broken bistro chairs boxes and crates it was filled with junk except for a path leading to the wine rack that stretched across the length of one stone wall tesla swept the gun slowly across the shadows she knew jana didnt have a weapon but she wasnt taking any chances she crept through the debris her twohanded grip on the hawlen tight she stopped and stood perfectly still listening for any sound nothing but then she felt it a hard stream of cold air at the back of her neck she spun and leveled the gun toward the bistro chairs she approached carefully her eyes alert for any movement behind the tenfoothigh tangle of legs and shredded rattan seats the stream of air grew stronger tesla grabbed a leg atop the pile and gave a sharp pull the top chairs clattered to the tile one clipping the hanging bulb sending it swinging wildly jesus a small open door in the stone wall with each sway of the bulb tesla could glimpse what lay beyond tunnels not stone but some rough graywhite material a low curved ceiling not more than six or eight feet above the dirt floor a dusty stench poured out what was this but then the odd smell registered chalk and with that came a flash of memory harold that night five years ago when in the highest heat of their affair he had brought her here to paris for a weekend dinner at taillevent a threehundredeuro haut brion and to impress her even more a trip to the restaurants wine cellar there the sommelier told them that the sleek vault used to be a dank cave part of a network of tunnels below paris that had once been the citys thriving chalk quarries the tunnels ran for hundreds of miles below apartments cafés and shops all but a few had been abandoned and boarded up tesla drew in a breath and stepped into the darkness the swinging bulb offered up moving slices of black and white but beyond thirty feet all light disappeared tesla stood perfectly still senses pricked for the slightest sound of movement the drugrush of adrenalin had dulled the pain in her shoulder she advanced slowly with the dying sway of light she could see now that the tunnel ahead branched off into two others a skitter rats a drip of something on her neck water a smell of something dead and close the blow came from the left aimed at her bad shoulder but she was quick enough to jerk away so the wine bottle hit her upper arm instead tesla gritted her teeth against the pain and gripped the gun tighter a crash over her head and she was sprayed with glass and doused in something cold another bottle exploded and she shut her eyes against the sting of the wine in her face nearby a slap of wood against wood and tesla saw jana fleeing out a service door struggling to control the pain struggling to breathe the wounded woman followed her assailant as quickly as she could the foot pursuit south through subdued streets of upscale townhouses and private hotels seemed to last forever and ended only when jana streaked across lavenue de new york making for pont dalma but despite her pain and exhaustion tesla closed in and just as jana made it to the bridge she collapsed unable to see any further hiding the gun tesla hurried through the traffic heading directly for her assailant jana managed to pull herself to her feet she glanced up and saw that tesla had now crossed the road and was getting closer resignation and despair filled janas dark face had tesla not been in such pain had she not seen in vivid memory the young nato soldiers arm shredded by the blast jana had ordered had she not known what carnage this woman was capable of she mightve felt pity for her but janas face clearly explained that she knew the end had come and that she wasnt going to allow herself to be tortured any longer she glanced over the side of the pont dalma toward the seine and noticed the approach of one of the famed bateaux mouchesthe fly boats that take tourists up and down the river janas eyes met teslas and they struggled up the railing of the bridge no tesla cried thrusting out her hand jana hesitated only a moment and then tumbled into the murky water directly into the path of a boat tesla saw her vanish under the prow the ship passed the captain unaware of the tragedy the tour guides voice echoed uninterrupted over the water tesla waited only a moment until she could see in the wake the outline of the womans torso floating on her belly arms outstretched head bent completely under the brown water a police car was just arriving as tesla returned to the queen elizabeth hotel she detoured to the impasse entrance and went upstairs the door to their room wasnt locked shes gone tesla whispered dead charley was curled on the sofa hugging her knees she looked up at tesla face ashen it wont stop she said tesla set the gun on a table charley was in shock she went and sat down next to her its ok charley tesla said it wont stop i know but the phone charley said it wont stop teslas whole body ached and her head was spinning but she realized that charley was staring at something on the carpet it was janas cell phone tesla picked it up the screen showed five calls and three messages did you answer it she asked charley just shook her head tesla quickly scrolled through the calls all from the same number but she didnt recognize it she punched in the message retrieval the first one was in hindu unreadable to her but the second was in french òu êtestu it was the third one that made her stop it translated to report cm mission status cm charlotte middleton but what was the mission tesla hesitated then punched in a text response in french mission accomplished immediately the cell hummed then the message appeared alive or dead so there was her answer it was harolds daughter they wanted but why then she realized that she hadnt heard from harold since he leftfrom either his regular cell or his encrypted one which meant he had either been apprehendedor killed one call to charley or her would have pinpointed their locations harold did not want his daughters whereabouts discovered tesla looked over at charley rocking slowly back and forth bait a distraction that is what charley was they wanted to use her against her father somehow she was his one weakness and if harold thought she was in danger they knew he would do anything to get to her suddenly tesla knew what she had to do she punched in a text response cm dead tesla shut her eyes waiting for the response when it came her blood chilled send proof again she looked to charley could she do this could she get this shattered young woman to help tesla went to the sofa and took charleys hands in hers charley i need you to listen to me she said gently charley just looked up at her charley i need to take a picture of you picture tesla scanned the wreckage of the room she spotted the bloody blouse she had used as a gag on jana help me quickly she said leading charley by the hand she picked up the blouse and took charley over to where jana had been sitting put this on tesla said charley recoiled what please charley we dont have much time why what charley this will help your father it will help harry harry put the blouse on charley shook her head no not unless you tell me why wheres harry whats happened to him tesla bit back her impatience she quickly told charley that her father was in russia and that he couldnt do what he needed to do unless he believed she was safe then why do you want him to think im dead not your father i want whoever sent jana after you to think youre dead your father has to be able to to do what he needs to do can you understand that charley looked away charley do you trust me she nodded slowly but wouldnt look at her then please do what im asking you to do please charley took the bloody blouse and slipped it over her tshirt but then she stopped and went to the desk charley she scribbled something with bold strokes of a felt pen and brought the paper back to tesla put this in the picture she said tesla took it charley had written three words green lantern evac what is this when i was little harry and i made up a code in case i ever got in trouble mom thought it was stupid but we her eyes filled with tears green lantern is our favorite comic book hero evac means ive gone somewhere safe to wait for him to come get me tesla hesitated then wrapped charley in a hug it took just minutes to position charley for the photograph she posed slumped against the wall with the backdrop of janas blood on the wall and carpet tesla positioned the note so it looked like a harmless piece of paper spilled from a waste basket tesla was sending the photograph by the time charley emerged with her suitcase downstairs they hurried out the kitchen avoiding the quickly expanding crowd around the dead clerk in the lobby a plan was already forming in teslas head she would send charley on the first plane to the states once charley was safe she would find a way to get to harold janas cell buzzed as they exited the hotel and started along rue pierre er de serbie tesla glanced at the cells screen one word in english beautiful brett battles you must know what sikari has in mind harold middleton said to chernayev his blood had run cold when the russian had told him the us secretary of state would be visiting the baglihar dam he told the man about the email message from sikari to kavi balanthe plan for the village to blow up the dam with the thermobarics explosives from florida middleton now understood chernayev seemed to consider middleton for a moment sikari is dead he said dead the american gasped by his own arrogance from what i understand a man he called his adopted son has assumed control of sikaris interests sikaris interests were in the dam itself it is the son archer who has seen the opportunity the secretary of states visit will create middleton stared at nothing stunned by the news the whole point of the volunteers mission was to find sikari and bring the war criminal to justice and yet even with the man gone it seemed more horrifying events were now in motion but youre responsible chernayev you sold him the explosives no my companies sell explosives yes and i shipped some to the site of the dam along with a lot of other materials im a partner in the construction project thermobarics are military grade chernayev gave a faint smile thats why i had to ship them in a lets say circuitous route my engineers didnt want to use tnt the foundation work takes forever they wanted the real thing well that real thing is going to be used to blow the village to smithereens chernayev grimaced you traced me through a company of ours in tampa right sindhu power thats right before we closed it up we were robbed explosives were stolen that explained why sikari was interested in the place and why the thieves had left the bomb that killed jeanmarc lespasse still you funded sikaris education ah the past the past how i wish we could change it yes i recognized him as brilliant one of the sharpest young men ive ever known i wanted him to work for me creating lower cost nuclear energy for developing countries we had a falling out i didnt like where he was going he wasnt interested in peaceful use of heavy metal he was interested in weapons but would he listen no like so many young idealists he wanted to go back to his home country and fight for independence and the technology that the group is after what sikari developed was based on the old nazi copperbracelet theory but what he created was only partially successful it wouldnt operate as a supergenerator the way he wanted look im a businessman colonel middleton i make more money off the living than the dead if something happens to the american secretary of state its not just war in the indian subcontinent we will need to worry about harold middleton wasnt sure he believed everything the russian said but it was true that if the secretary were assassinated the whole world would reel from the repercussions if this archer sikari were truly moving forward with his fathers plan then the arrival of the secretary of state would be too irresistible to pass up one of the goals the secretary had laid out not long after being sworn in was to ease the tensions between india and pakistan with an emphasis on the troubled region of kashmir this was undoubtedly the reason she was traveling to the area middleton said weve got to contact the state department immediately of course theyve been notified but theyre in agreement that the visit should go on security is going to be very highboth state department and my company bluewatch in any case we have no knowledge that archer even knows about the visit why do you want me to go there its not just me the russian handed middleton a decoded communiqué from the state department he recognized the name of one of the deputy directors it authorized middleton and the volunteers to locate archer sikari and coordinate with local authorities to arrest him a final paragraph added that tesla carson and chang had been notified and had acknowledged receipt that meant they were fine middleton noticed the document didnt say anything about charley i have to contact my daughter encrypted emails only chernayev said my compound is constantly scanned for cell and text signals he wrote out a message for charley chernayev gave it to a young man in a bluewatch uniform he hurried off to send it now will you go to kashmir of course middleton said one of my men will take you to a room where you can get some rest arrangements are being worked out now and as soon as everything is ready you will be on your way he held out his hand to middleton i wish you a safe and successful journey middleton looked at the scorpions hand then reluctantly reached out and shook it as archer knew he would sanam had called him to tell him that they were ready to carry out the plan archer had already set in motion the delivery of the explosives through his american subcontractors within hours sanams men had begun placing the charges in the predetermined locations within the dam archer felt extremely satisfied the only thing left to be determined was where he was going to be at the time of the big event the dam was located in a mountainous rural area but there were plenty of places he could choose where he would be able to see the dam as it crumbled into a useless pile of cement carrying the secretary of state to her death most of the locations were only reachable by helicopter but that wasnt a problem for him with his fathers fortune now at his disposal he could purchase a fleet of helicopters if need be he could feel the power that was rippling just below his skin it was an electrical force he could only dream about before on all those nights when he and harris shared a room and after his brother had fallen asleep archer had let his mind imagine this very momentthis time when he would be in charge when he would be the power if there was one thing that troubled him it was jana she was his sword and his lover but he hadnt heard her voice in over two days not since before she had forwarded him the photographic proof that charlotte middleton was dead too bad for that he had hoped they would have been able to take harold middletons daughter alive but better dead than running free jana sent a text that said she would come to him as soon as she could but that a member of harold middletons volunteers was trailing her so she would have to take care of that problem first he so wanted to call her but refrained their procedure was to avoid voice contact this had been archers idea he wanted no one to know what his voice sounded like even with the absolute best encryption there was always a chance that someone somewhere would be able to break it archers power would rest in his ability to remain a ghost feared and unknown so until she arrived he would have to content himself with the anticipation of having her at his side something he was already practiced at doing we have a problem umer whispered to sanam they were sitting in a small restaurant in a village kilometers from the baglihar dam the restaurant was really the front room of a dilapidated shack the rest of the shack served as the home for the family that ran the place at the moment sanam and umer were the only customers the young boy who had been serving them had gone into the back to leave them in peace while they ate what is it sanam asked the remote controls for the detonators what about them they dont work sanam froze for a moment startled by his old friends words they are defective not exactly when we put them inside the dam there is too much concrete the signal must not be getting through but they work otherwise i had one of the men smuggle a remote back out and i tried it outside it worked fine the idea of eating no longer appealed to sanam everything they had been working toward the years of infiltration and manual labor all the pressure hed put his men under for the last two days it was all for nothing and the opportunity they were going to squander undone by something as simple as a blocked radio signal how could this have even happened the american umer said we shouldnt have trusted him hes given us equipment he should have known would not work sanam could see murder in his friends eyes calm down umer theres still time ill talk to him and get remotes that will work and if they are faulty too we will deal with that if it happens i dont like this umer said his unhappiness still written on his face the sound of shuffling feet from the back of the restaurant announced the return of the serving boy he approached their table to ask if they wanted anything else nothing more thank you sanam said as soon as the boy had cleared the dishes and returned to the back umer said i tell you i dont like this and i tell you that i understand sanam said i am not happy about this either i will talk to the american and i will see what can be done middletons eyes flew open what the hell was that hed been dead asleep then something pulled him out of it so fast his heart raced a dream if it was it would have been the most intense one hed had in years what then he reached over to the nightstand and checked his watch it was am middleton knew he should try to go back to sleep lying there awake would only drive him crazy as he started to close his eyes he heard a muffled pop then another and another gunfire it was coming from the front of the estate he pushed himself up instantly knowing there must have been an earlier shot a shot that would have pulled him out of his sleep he threw his covers back but before he could even push himself out of bed he heard the rattle of a key his door flew open quick get dressed you must hurry it was the guard who had brought him his dinner the evening before but unlike last night he was now carrying a machine gun behind him was another guard similarly equipped middleton jumped out of bed and felt around for his clothes in the semidarkness outside the gunfire intensified it was hard to tell how close it was but the fact that there were two guards anxiously waiting for him to get dressed told middleton all he needed to know as he pulled on his final shoe the first guard said come come he grabbed middleton by the arm and shoved him into the hallway that way the guard pulled him forward and started to run middleton had no choice but to do the same from elsewhere in the house he could hear people yelling orders and feet racing down other hallways the guard whipped him around a corner then angled toward a wide stone stairway instinctively middleton veered for the flight leading down but the guard yanked him to the left no up up they took the stairs two at a time racing upward not stopping until they reached an open metal door beyond it middleton could see the night sky and the flat surface of the mansions roof as they stepped through the door the intensity of the gunfire increased this is a dead end middleton said what are we doing suddenly another sound drowned out the sound of the bullets it was loud rhythmic and familiar middleton turned in time to see the helicopter rise up from the rear of the mansion just high enough to clear the lip of the roof he realized it must have flown in low over the rear of chernayevs estate keeping out of sight of the attackers out front as soon as it touched down the side door flew open middleton didnt wait for instructions he immediately began heading for the helicopter as he climbed aboard the pilot motioned for him to take the seat farthest from the door and strap in as soon as his safety harness was buckled middleton looked up and gave the pilot a wave to let him know he was ready but the helicopter didnt move the runners remained firmly on the roof then movement beyond the open door caught middletons attention someone else had come onto the roof but this had barely registered on middleton when the sky flared bright from a large explosion the noise was deafening even momentarily overpowering the sound of the rotors the moment the noise subsided he leaned toward the pilot and yelled weve got to go yes kiril its time middleton turned toward the sound of the voice pulling himself through the doorway was chernayev as soon as the scorpion was seated the helicopter took off it left as it had arrived flying low away from the firefight once he felt reasonably sure they werent going to get shot down middleton looked over at chernayev what was that my apologies chernayev said seems we didnt get all of them the other day the group chernayev shrugged of course middleton sat silently for several moments so where we going same destination i told you about india the only difference is that ive decided to come with you the doctor had asked no questions he was used to the kind of patients that appeared at his back door with any number of injuries from broken ribs to thirddegree burns to knife wounds so when tesla showed up with a gunshot wound to one shoulder and charley middleton propping her up by the other he had not even flinched he had merely quoted a price then did what he could to repair the damage afterward the two women took a room in a small hotel near the latin quarter where they hid out venturing into the streets only when it was necessary most trips were for food but once they had appropriated a laptop the owner probably a student had left it unattended in a café near the sorbonne while he went to the toilet charley only agreed to help if tesla promised they would later find the student and return it when they were done she then kept watch while tesla slipped it into an oversized bag and casually walked out to the street back at the hotel they reestablished contact with wiki chang any word she asked nothing the bosss phones are both out of commission tesla sighed the two of them then worked to come up with a plan to track down the person who had sent the text to janas phone wanting to know what had happened with charley tesla had a pretty good idea of who it might be ian barrettbone had said that sikari was killed by his son and that jana was in on it tesla guessed the person was either the son or someone working for him the sender wanted to know when jana would arrive where he didnt say but tesla gathered from the tone of the messages that there was more than a business relationship between jana and the sender this made her guess that it had to be the son and if it was it was even more important that they get a fix on his location hey this isnt exactly easy chang said he had been at it for several hours his image was in a box that filled the upper right corner of the laptop you say that every time then you figure it out tesla said yeah well youre not going to tell me the senders phone doesnt have gps on it are you tesla said im sure it does but every time i get a lock on it it moves from belize to japan to mali to denmark to wherever hes using software thats bouncing his location all over the place and making it impossible to get a fix on him locking in on his transmission signal isnt giving me any better results hes only sending text messages as far as i can tell that usually shouldnt be a problem but the origin of the messages is being immediately obscured the moment theyre sent so theres no way we can get a lock on his location tesla asked i didnt say that wiki said tesla couldnt tell but it almost looked like wiki was smiling what have you got well if we cant follow a message out then i thought wed just have to follow a message in ive rigged it so i can send a text to archer directly from my computer that hell think is coming from the phone you have there itll be carrying a tracer packet to follow thatll send me back a location just as it arrives teslas eyes widened so why havent you texted him already do you really want me to write the text to him i mean what would i say tesla started to laugh but stopped abruptly as her shoulder started to bark in pain instead she gave chang a smile then told him what to send archer had been expecting a text from sanam for almost hours it was almost a disappointment that it had taken the pakistani so long to figure out there was a problem but no matter the contact had been made the meeting set archer chose a remote spot a kilometer and a half north of an old hindu shrine that had fallen into neglect while sanam would be traveling by car archer would be arriving via helicopter this would give him the opportunity to scan the area around the meeting point for any heat signatures that might indicate a possible trap it wasnt that he thought sanam would try to pull something the pakistani was blinded by the belief they were working toward the same goal but it was just a good practice to be cautious as his father had taught him there was no such thing as paranoia in their world as he had expected the only heat signature within a kilometer of the location was that of sanam he was standing near his car exactly where archer had told him to be satisfied archer gave the pilot permission to set them down as soon as the runners touched the ground the side doors flew open and out jumped four of archers menmen who had only recently served his father each was armed with a mini uzi obtained from a diverted shipment meant for the sri lankan army they were all hindi but had had plenty of practice under sikari on how to pretend to be muslim archer waited an additional seconds then he moved into the doorway and stepped down onto the grass per instructions two of his men moved over to walk just behind him while the other two stayed near the helicopter pretending to cover his flank it was a show of course all aimed at sanam now more than ever archer wanted to reinforce with the pakistani just how powerful he was assal mu alaykum archer said stopping two feet from sanam wa alaykum assalaam sanam said his eyes strayed to the gunmen standing behind archer you face no threat from me of course not it is not you i am worried about but we are in territory controlled by our enemy and if they knew i was here they would do everything they could to stop me sanam bowed his head in concession you are alone archer asked those were your instructions good archer said then he smiled broadly shall we walk they headed across the field in no particular direction archer could sense sanam reluctant to start the conversation so he took the lead your message mentioned a problem archer said yes sanam said well the remote controls for the detonators weve tested them but the thickness of the dam prevents them from working of course they didnt work but he now raised his voice in indignation are you saying i gave you faulty equipment no i am not saying that the remotes under normal conditions work fine but the radio signal is unable to penetrate the concrete perhaps you dont have them rigged properly archer said he was enjoying toying with this man who thought of him as an ally they are rigged exactly per the instructions archer grew silent acting as if he were in deep thought somehow the security services must have added special masking material in the dam he said but we cannot miss this opportunity i agree we are hoping you can get replacements that will work in time i will try but the window is short and i fear they may not make it but if they dont we will be forced to abort archer paused for effect then leaned toward the pakistani actually thats not entirely true sanam played archers words over and over in his mind on the drive back to the hut where he would be spending the night archer had promised to do all he could to get the new remotes but sanam knew the probability of this was very low it was archers suggested alternate plan that was troubling sanam most it would solve the problem but sanam wished he could come up with something better unfortunately by the time he arrived nothing had come to him umer and two of his other men were waiting for him inside so umer asked he is trying to get us replacements trying umer said if he doesnt get the replacements all our work will mean nothing the other two men voiced their agreement what do you expect to happen sanam said more anger in his voice than he meant that they appear out of the air no one said anything for several moments then umer asked did he at least say when he would know if he could get them he told me he would contact us by the morning umer nodded then we will at least know if we will be able to carry out the plan if he cant get them in time we can use the explosives elsewhere there are plenty of other worthy targets but none as big as this sanam said the room fell silent everyone knowing he was right with a deep breath he looked at his men the plan will go forward with or without the remotes what are you talking about umer said how will we set the explosives off without the remotes there is a way sanam said what way umer asked sanam paused still hoping an alternative answer would come to him but none did we will set them off manually they can be rigged so only one man can do it umer stared at him it is the only way sanam said it can not be just anyone umer said it would have to be someone we trust will not back out we dont have anyone i trust that much we have one sanam said sanam locked eyes with his friend and in that moment he knew umer realized the only possibility me umer said not a question sanam said nothing lee child the trouble with laptop computers was battery life the trouble with stolen laptop computers was that they rarely came with chargers unless you were lucky enough to target the kind of dork who carried an ugly nylon case everywhere full of wires and accessories but the sorbonne student hadnt been that kind of dork all nora and charley had was the guys macbook air thin sleek naked and eating power like it was starving an icon shaped like a black empty battery suddenly changed to a red empty battery then it started flashing it was winking away to itself upper right margin of the screen directly above wiki changs face tesla told him this thing is going to shut down any minute well have to find an internet café chang said no dont do that youre in paris for all we know the internet cafés are hooked up to the security services so what do we do duh go buy a charger where anywhere its an apple its got a weird little doohickey changs eyes left teslas and flicked away to another screen then they came back they were planning to build an apple store under the glass pyramid at the louvre maybe its open now ok well find it not yet stay with me i have news at least i think i do the trace on the destination cell its still bouncing around i got kashmir argentina sweden new zealand and canada thats not news it means their software is still working thats all im not so sure it switches every two seconds like clockwork which is how i would expect it to be written but at the beginning it showed kashmir for three seconds not two im wondering if it failed to lock first time maybe it exposed its true location thats a leap not really think about it from the other end who wrote this program a guy like me thats who and what do i know about countries of the world not much i cant sit here and name them all i certainly dont know them all to me kashmir is a led zeppelin song so so i would need some kind of list theyre called atlases a printed book i dont think so not for a programmer hed hack a list from somewhere the un maybe but thats probably too secure my guess is he tried an inside joke and hacked nokia or someone for cell phone sales by country and you know what turns out kashmir isnt a country not officially no answer from tesla and even if it was i bet nokia doesnt sell much there the red icon was still flashing chang said ok i know its only a hunch but i think im right i think the software failed just briefly i think kashmir is the true location weve got to tell harold still no word on my end you no well theres more be quick i have other programs running mostly for fun but theyre all linked i got a flag from a federal aviation authority database theres a flight plan filed from dc airspace to lahore which is the nearest long runway to the kashmir region the tail number comes back to a crop duster in kansas wiki make your damn point will you we have no time ok a crop duster from kansas doesnt need to file a flight plan and it certainly cant fly intercontinental so its bogus its something ive seen before its what they do when one of the air force ones is prepping to fly what do you mean one of theres only one air force one no there are three whichever if the president is on board thats called air force one otherwise its just a government plane so what are you saying either the president or some bigshot cabinet member is going to kashmir soon and thats where the bad guy is the laptop screen died the helicopter came low over an outer moscow suburb and banked and turned toward an airfield a mile away to the east not domodedovo a private field maybe once military and now civilian or shared but it was a big place runways and taxiways were laid out in a huge triangle there were enormous hangars and long low buildings there were parked planes of every size small gulfstreams and lears and grummans big airbuses and boeings nothing less than twenty million dollars the biggest was a widebody boeing two hundred feet long two hundred feet from wingtip to wingtip probably two hundred million to buy chernayevs middleton thought it was a definitive russianrichguy statement and the helicopter was heading straight for it the transfer was fast chernayev and middleton ducked low under the beating rotor and ran bent over to a set of steps set on a pickup platform they hustled up and entered through the boeings forward door and stepped into a space that reminded middleton of the house off pyatnitskaya street where he had met korovin which in turn had reminded him of boodles club in london there was oak paneling everywhere and dark patterned carpet and oil paintings and heavy leather furniture and the smell of cuban cigars business must be good he said chernayev said i cant complain the door sucked shut behind them and the world went quiet except for the hiss of air and the whir and tick of the spooling engines the cabin pa was relaying the cockpit chatter every statement made first in russian and then again in english world aviations default language clearance for takeoff was immediate middleton guessed that no one ever kept chernayev waiting the engine noise got louder and the plane started to taxi no delay it turned onto the runway and didnt even pause it just accelerated hard and bucked and strained and then took off carrying two men in a space fit for three hundred chernayev said enjoy the flight harry which middleton was prepared to do except that his musicologists sense of harmony was disrupted by two things first the oil paintings were wrong they were renoirs beautiful canvases no question rich glowing intimate and worth probably thirty million each but inappropriate london club decor was frozen in a time before renoir ever picked up a brush gainsborough or stubbs or constable would have been more authentic the second thing on middletons mind was exactly the way the planes interior recalled the club in the house off pyatnitskaya street he couldnt get over the way he had pulled the sigs trigger and nothing had happened he had been ripped off which wasnt the end of the world although it might have been but it could be the end of the world for chernayev and people like him middleton said do you own a guy called volodya own chernayev said i dont own people hes a gun dealer in an antiques store on the old arbat right across from where the praga restaurant was a guy like that in the new moscow someone owns him could be you i know him thats all ill admit did he displease you in some way he sold me a sig p for two grand plus five hundred for the ammunition the gun didnt work thats not good damn right its not business requires trust youll suffer in the end youll be back in a plain old gulfstream before you know it i apologize ill make it up to you when were done ill give you a sig that works i dont want a sig i prefer berettas the american military always did but you must let me give you something middleton smiled there was a stall selling russian nesting dolls with foreign leaders faces on them my daughter would like them those things theyre just crude attempts at humor you know how paranoid russians are the assumption is that behind our leaders are other leaders and behind them others still who do you suppose they paint at the very center i dont know middleton said the other trouble with stolen laptop computers was that people generally wanted them back the student from the sorbonne sure did not really because of the euro value of the hardware but because of the value of the files it stored his poems were on there his play the start of his novel the stuff that would win him the prix goncourt one day plus some term papers like everyone else in the world his backup routine was haphazard he went to the cops he took witnesses no one had seen the actual snatch but three friends recalled two american women the cops werent very interested paris was full of bigger stuffmuslim unrest terrorism heists dope but then one of the three friends said that one of the two american women had been pale and moving awkwardly like she was in pain and she had a dark stain all over her shirt like blood a possible gunshot wound in a city where guns were still rare and in a city where two victims had just turned up shot to death the cops werent dumb they knew the chances were that the laptop would be trashed when the battery ran out on the other hand the macbook air was an attractive thing very desirable so maybe the thieves would try to buy a charger which gave them a limited number of destinations in paris easy enough to stake them all out no shortage of young officers willing to hang around such places when they were bored with the shiny toys they could look at the tourist girls archer looked again at the picture of charley middleton dead he revered it because he liked dead people and because it came from jana it was like a love letter it showed the girl down and crumpled in a bloody shirt the resolution wasnt great but it was good enough to be interesting and good enough to be a little unsettling there were two things archer wasnt quite sure about the first was the dead girls posture archer had seen plenty of dead people some quite recently there was nothing like the slackness and the emptiness of a corpse and he wasnt sure those characteristics were there in charley middletons body and the bloodstained shirt didnt look organic it didnt look like she had been wearing it at the time of death it looked thrown on maybe afterward which made no sense and there was a scrap of paper that had apparently spilled out of a trashcan scribbled green handwriting that seemed to make no sense either a code perhaps or a foreign alphabet maybe cyrillic or a combination of foreign letters and numbers he stared at it for a long moment then he turned his phone upside down green lantern evac he thought of harris immediately for a moment he wished it had not been necessary to eliminate him harris had loved comic books which was a part of what had made him a useless wastrel but he would have understood the reference maybe archer texted jana call me now janas phone made a sound in noras pocket just as she and charley stepped into an apple reseller on the boulevard saint germain there had been no apple store under the louvre pyramid planned but not yet built mired in bureaucracy old europe the saint germain place had been recommended by a clerk in an orange cell phone store orange was the old france telecom and was the exclusive carrier for the new iphone in france an iphone charger was ok for an ipod but it wouldnt fit the macbook air doohickey hence a taxi ride and a short search along a row of chic boutiques there were two guys loitering in the corner of the store tesla noticed them immediately she thought cops then janas phone made the sound and she delayed for a crucial second she saw the cops staring at her at her face at her shirt at her awkward posture she said charley yes run what now the big boeing flew on straight and level thirtyeight thousand feet middleton finished his soda and said dams are big things chernayev said tell me about it i paid for most of the concrete too big to destroy with explosives the problem has been studied many times both defensively and offensively i know so whatever wild card is in play here is not only wild but also quite possibly stupid so why worry the dam will survive no doubt about that but we cant issue the same guarantee about your secretary of state she dies therell be a world war chernayev said i dont want that just a regional war first things first harry tesla was hampered by the raging pain in her shoulder so charley got out to the street first nora turned at the door and flung the first thing that came to hand which was janas cell phone from her pocket it caught the leading cop hard under the eye and he spun away and crashed into a glass display case and sent small technical items skittering across the floor the second cop stumbled and sidestepped and tesla had a twoyard lead by the time she hit the sidewalk charley had bolted straight through the traffic panic probably but smart too tesla plunged after her through yelping tires and blasting horns together they made it across they ran they had no idea where they were going they turned randomly left and right in alleys and entrances and barged through knots of people every step sent bolts of agony through noras body and every accidental contact with passersby nearly killed her but adrenaline kept her moving moving but not fast enough the cops were in their own city and they had radios to tesla and charley the streets were a maze to the cops the streets were a map they knew by heart alleys had exits and exits could be blocked sirens were howling everywhere feet were pounding whistles were blowing radio chatter was loud in the air twice tesla and charley had to jam to a halt and spin around and take off again in the direction they had come twice the streets behind them were blocked so they ducked into stores and barged through and came out through rear entrances to start all over again once a cop got his hand on charleys sleeve and she whirled and ducked and pulled loose and fled in the end teslas pain saved them they stopped running counterintuitive but the right move in a mobile game fugitives run pursuers look for rapid movement people sitting still pass unnoticed they dragged themselves through a shirt makers door and collapsed breathless on a sofa two seconds later a squad of police ran past the entrance to the store without a second glance the shirt maker approached tape measure around his neck charley said were waiting for my father the shirt maker withdrew charley whispered what now tesla said airport but our stuff is at the hotel passport here well leave the rest of our stuff we have to go where cant talk to wiki cant talk to harold its up to us now so where kashmir thirtyeight thousand feet but middleton saw mountains ahead on the right that looked almost exactly level with the plane hundreds of miles away probably a trick of perspective in terms of distance but there was no doubt about their elevation a gigantic range white icy jagged majestic shrouded with low clouds down around their knees unmistakable famous the himalayas but on their right middleton asked where the hell are we going chernayev said who do you think is painted on the innermost doll who do you think we all serve ultimately and at that moment two jet fighter planes rose alongside one to port one to starboard both of them slow and respectful and gentle unthreatening an escort for safety and for courtesy the fighter planes were painted with muted camouflage patterns and toward the rear of their slim fuselages they had bright red bars separated by red fivepointed stars middleton said china jon land middleton tried to use the mountains to orient himself keep his bearings but before long the sky stole them from him the jet vanishing into the clouds in the moments of silence that followed he felt its steep descent in the pit of his stomach the clouds cleared to reveal the mountains gone from sight and some sort of airstrip below were landing his words drew only a smile from chernayev and middleton realized the altitude was playing tricks with his damaged hearing his voice sounded like someone elses and the lameness of his statement made him wish it actually had been middleton had landed at enough secret airfields to know this was something quite different from any of them far too barren to be military and much too isolated to have ever been civilian no landing lights were anywhere in evidence until he spotted discolored patches in the ground on both sides of the strip those patches his experience indicated likely concealed highpowered halogens that could be activated with the proper signal from an aircraft approaching under cover of darkness upon which the fake turf would recede so the lights could surface someone had taken great measures to hide whatever truth lay here the strip boasted not a single building not a hangar tower storage or refueling facilitynothing well not quite middleton thought as he felt the jets landing gear lower because parked at the far end of the airstrip where the tarmac widened into a football fieldsized slab was another jet he heard the zooming hiss of their fighter escorts soaring away as chernayevs jet touched down and taxied toward the second jet a come chernayev gestured after their plane ground to a halt middleton started to rise realizing hed forgotten to unfasten his seatbelt he joined chernayev in the aisle where are we middleton asked him where we need to be where the world needs us chernayev stopped and smiled almost sadly at him you wanted answers comrade and now youre going to get them though i suspect you may regret ever posing the questions the cold assaulted them as soon as they emerged from the jet it seemed to push out from the mountains now visible again off to the west their snowcapped peaks poking through the clouds and stretching for the sky middleton had known far more frigid colds than this but the one he felt now was different deeper somehow which he passed off to the anxiety and expectation racing through him as they approached a set of landing stairs set before the s bulkhead the door opened to reveal a pair of armed chinese soldiers beyond it chernayev led the way up the stairs into the plane the soldiers stiffened to attention and saluted seeming to recognize him while ignoring middleton altogether chernayev return their salutes and then led the way through a curtain and into a majestic library complete with wood paneling and leather furniture its smell rich in the air the sight further disoriented middleton casting an opaque dreamlike translucence over his vision he tried to remind himself he was on a plane but the thought wouldnt hold then he saw the figure of a chinese man wearing a generals uniform rise from a highbacked leather chair and stride past ornate shelves lined with a neat array of leatherbound books he was tall and thin his hair raven black except for a matching swatch of white over both temples the man grinned approaching chernayev with arms extended they hugged briefly then separated and bowed to each other before the chinese mans gaze fell on middleton and this must be the american he extended his hand outward i have heard much about you mr middleton most of it well before today who am i i have many names today i am general zang my opposite number in the chinese government said chernayev you mean military same thing said zang retired as well somewhat anyway the russian added zang turned again toward middleton we are protectors protectors of what zang shrugged fill in the blank with whatever you choose our countries have become much less insular and mutually dependent you know what the butterfly effect is of course a butterfly flaps its wings in boston and a monsoon sprouts in china zang interrupted again completing his thought especially appropriate in this case of course my russian friend and i like to think of ourselves as protectors of that mutual dependence there was a time when we looked on the western world rooting for the inevitable fall that would lead to a chaos capable of consuming it now we find ourselves dreading that chaos above all else and working to prevent it because of that mutual dependence chernayev said colonel yes i have a financial interest in the dam but this is about far more than money he took a pair of cigars from his jacket pocket and handed one to zang cuban he proclaimed at least our communist comrades there are still good for something mr middleton zang said still admiring his cigar you have spent your career especially with the volunteers fighting the same enemies and battles as we find ourselves fighting now you just didnt realize it chernayev added you have fought to preserve order perhaps not in those words but that has been the ultimate effect and you have watched the world change into a much more dangerous place because of the butterfly middleton interjected exactly we all grew up in an era of clarity where the enemy announced himself by the uniform he wore now we wear the same uniform a business suit which makes it all the more difficult to spot the enemies among us and all the more easy for them to disturb the delicate balance were fighting to preserve what does this have to do with you your quest your daughter my daughter our new enemies dont play by the same rules we used to in fact they play by no rules at all family members are considered fair game now the tactics are brutal revolting they turn my stomach zang said lighting his cigar and savoring the first puffs you are standing in my home mr middleton it is too dangerous for men like myself and comrade chernayev to stay anywhere long enough for them to find us there are fifty airfields like this scattered across china and i never spend more than a single night at a time in any one of them middleton studied zang closer matching the face to a different era a different man same brilliant confident smile draped in the shadow of hair not yet touched by white shorter slighter more effusive but with the same eyes i think i know you he started from the chinese secret po the tewu middleton said before zang could finish zang held his cigar at arms distance frozen im impressed perhaps our paths have crossed somehow not yours your fathers he was one of the tewu charged with infiltrating the united states after the korean war not just one of it was his operation you sound proud of his efforts of our heritage yes the tewu dates back to bc ive heard the group even has its own clandestine dialect that makes infiltrating it impossible zang spat off some words in chinese that made no sense to either chernayev or middleton but now he resumed switching back to english we find ourselves with a different enemy a different mission sikari chaos in general of which sikari represented only a small part small but very dangerous because of its capacity to inflict incalculable harm on our precariously mutually dependent world the butterfly zang nodded as he blew huge plumes of cigar smoke and in this case that butterfly is going to land on the baglihar dam just hours from now and if we do not force it to take flight again the price will be the end of the new world stitched together by the precarious threads of euros and dollars war between india and pakistan exactly no middleton disagreed we know the explosives sikaris people have cant destroy the dam and even if they manage to assassinate the secretary of state middleton let his voice trail off something in zangs suddenly tentative expression telling him he had it all wrong that he was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle its not the secretary of state whos coming the head of the tewu told him tesla was seated next to charley middleton on the last leg of a series of exhausting flights that would ultimately end in kashmir the coach compartment was crowded adding ample camouflage to the clever subterfuge theyd enacted inside orly airport aware french authorities would be looking for them as well as archer sikaris people alerted by the suspicious communications over janas salvaged cell phone tesla had disguised charley as an old woman the ruse was accomplished with a combination of makeup hair product and clothing all culled from shops inside the terminal the transformation handled inside a handicapped restroom stall obtaining a wheelchair from the airline proved a simple matter and tesla had booked the tickets by phone so as not to arouse suspicion spurred by a walkup sale harried authorities on the alert for two women meeting charley and teslas descriptions would have no reason to pay heed to an old woman slumped in a wheelchair chin resting near her frail chest and snoozing while her daughter eased her through the terminal sikaris people would be more astute and discerning but tesla doubted even their ability to marshal significant forces in so short a period of time to throw them further off the track she had tucked janas phone into the carryon of a passenger bound for new york leaving them to chase their gps tails around the world tesla met charleys gaze in the coach seat next to her and managed a reassuring smile youll be with your father in no time that doesnt mean well be safe perhaps you dont know your father you could be right i dont know anything anymore the makeup tesla had used to age charley had begun to cake and she noticed tear streaks down both her cheeks evidence she had been crying in the moments tesla had managed to steal some sleep on this final stretch of their exhausting journey she didnt bother to deny the younger womans assertion youre right charley once you go down the road were on theres no going back how do you live with it what you do easily because not doing it is much worse at the expense of everything else charley muttered shaking her head if we fail there will be no everything else the stakes are that high people have died and more will if we cant stop sikaris people in kashmir charley sniffled i just want to go home its not safe charley will it ever be again probably not charley settled back in her seat taking a deep breath thank you for telling me the truth tesla laid a reassuring hand atop charleys upon the armrest in the end its all we have it is the only way it can not be just anyone it would have to be someone we trust will not back out we dont have anyone i trust that much we have one me standing within view of the nowcompleted dam archer replayed the conversation between umer and sanam in his mind both were fools easily manipulated to serve his ends and appropriately enough the business about the detonators and placement of the explosives was a fools errand but they had supplied archer with the army he needed in the form of the offshoot of harakatulmujahedeen loyal soldiers willing to die for the cause archer and his associates had secured press credentials to accommodate all it was left to archer to complete the process of getting them their video and camera equipment all constructed to pass the scrutiny of any security check even one undertaken as expected by the american secret service archer held his gaze on the dam a bit leery over the fact that the building security apparatus was considerably higher than he had anticipated he felt a knot tighten in the pit of his stomach anxiety over the fact that his mission had been compromised robbing him of his destiny and his dream you were a fool father you should have left this whole project to me he knew sikari had died admiring even revering the son who would succeed him actually exceed him but if his plan at the dam failed it would all be for naught his dreams and the dreams of his father would die here the maelstrom that would follow never to grow into the fiery inferno certain to consume the world and when that world was remade it would be in the image chosen by archer and others like him an image foreseen by his father starting here in a mere matter of hours pacing will not get us there any faster my friend chernayev told middleton as their boeing streaked through the sky en route to kashmir general zangs airfield well behind them middleton stopped we cant let this happen and we wont my men will be meeting us there along with us security forces and indian security sikaris people will be stopped middleton slid closer to chernayevs seat and glared down at him that isnt good enough this is the president of the united states were talking about the secretary of state was one thing but this i admit its an unexpected complication unexpected complication is that the best you can do you didnt let me finish comrade its an unexpected complication we must nonetheless not let distract us from destroying sikari once and for all sikaris dead but not his cause his mission we find this heir of his and we can end this forever its not worth the risk you speak as if we have a choice the president is coming here under cover even his most trusted advisors believe hes sick with the flu in the white house he is coming to the dam opening to make a statement and nothing we can do can stop him hes been made aware of the danger and hes coming anyway middleton could feel the heart racing in his chest in the face of a threat to his life those explosives cannot destroy the dam we know that now remember were not even sure archers there then were missing something weve been missing it all along middleton thought for a moment sikaris son couldnt have anticipated his presence here either now what is your point everything all sikaris plans wouldve been based on the secretary of state less security a different upshot to their plans i dont follow comrade zang said it for both of you chaos thats what this is about from archers standpoint to set the world on the road to a nuclear confrontation between india and pakistan you know what that would mean ive read the same studies you have chernayev said joining middleton on his feet the complete collapse of the world economy a decade or more of deep depression and thats just for starters a possible but unlikely scenario before now with the president likely if not inevitable exactly said middleton pakistani militants will be blamed for the attack the united states response will be god i cant even find the word the vision suffices pakistans retaliation aimed at india because its all they have destroy our proxy nuclear war said middleton a world of chaos not if we can stop it chernayev told him keeping up the ruse tesla wheeled charley through srinagar airport the airport and the city known as the summer capital of jammu and kashmir was located in the heart of the kashmir valley a mile above sea level tesla knew the inland and lowlying waterways made it the ideal site for the baglihar dam as a smaller airport this facility offered light security even token but the grounds both inside the terminal and out on the tarmac itself were teeming with indian soldiers and district police whats going on charley asked still slumped in her chair to avoid detection look tesla pointed to a large sign that welcomed visitors to the opening ceremonies of the dam then she gasped charley she grabbed the younger womans arm at the bottom of the sign was some information about the damsize electrical output and factoids one of which was that the people displaced by the construction and flooding had been relocated to a beautiful new town nearby it was affectionately called the village the warning in balans email somethings going to happen here now she stepped to a kiosk and bought a prepaid mobile when it was activated she called all of middletons numberseven his landlinesand sent text messages and emails after finishing she slipped the phone away and wheeled charley out the door if your father can get to any phone or computer hell find out where we are and why if hes alive charley muttered stop it tesla said though not unkindly hes fine i know he is he might even be here if he knows about the village the two of you are fools what charley cocked her gaze upward enough to briefly meet teslas stare why bother saving the world if you cant enjoy it charley please no whatever it is the two of you share i want you to know im fine with it im honestly not sure you have any better idea how to define it than i do but you need to make sense of it for your own sakes thank you the doors slid open mechanically and tesla wheeled charley into the steaming air it assaulted her skin like a blast furnace seeming to instantly melt the makeup that had already turned her face into a halloween mask tesla eased the chair up to the curb and raised a hand to hail a taxi almost instantly a grimeencrusted white sedan screeched forward cutting off another cab in the queue a fierce exchange of explosive hindi shot back and forth and the winning cab the sedan pulled up in front of the women tesla busied herself with helping the costumed charley out of the chair and helping her into the backseat leaving the airlineissued wheelchair by the curb she walked around and climbed in the taxis driver side what is your destination the ancient turbaned driver asked in awkward english his massively wrinkled face glanced at them in the grimy rearview mirror take us to the baglihar dam tesla said archer still had not heard from jana and was fearing the worst even before word reached him that she was apparently en route to the united statesat least her cell phone was he wondered if this was some form of cosmic punishment that taking the life of his father had sentenced him to a life in isolation without the distractions of love and romance no matter he was young enough to enjoy the fruits of his labors and eventual power that would come once his work at the dam was done still he found janas failure to contact him disturbing as he did the anomalies in the picture of the apparently dead daughter of colonel harold middleton and if charlotte middleton was still alive then so was the female volunteer tesla holding fast to archers trail it was a good thing hed taken precautions another legacy bequeathed him by sikari himself as if on cue archers scrambled cell phone beeped and he raised it to check the incoming text message from the man he had dispatched to kashmir mission accomplished middleton stood in the cordonedoff security area gazing up at the sky in expectation of the presidents arrival the structure of the baglihar dam beyond made for a magnificent spectacle the only thing that even remotely approached it in size and scope was nevadas massive hoover dam then as now construction had gone forward in essentially a wilderness desert for the hoover rural unpopulated land for the baglihar if the concrete used here was even half what it had been there middleton could see no way any explosives short of the nuclear variety including thermobaric could possibly destroy the facility nor could it result in the kind of collateral damage capable of reaching the place where the president would be speaking essentially a sprawling natural amphitheater built to offer stunning touristfriendly views of the chenab river its vast power now harnessed between a million tons of concrete and steel what exactly had devras sikari meant in his email to balan you recall what i have planned for the village it has to happen soonbefore we can move on as he gazed at it he thought no wonder pakistan had lodged such a vigorous protest with the un irrigation to a great bulk of the nations agriculture was now endangered especially if the season turned any drier than normal from one side of pakistan to the other people could find themselves going hungry the perfect pretext on which to strike back middleton couldnt help but wonder if that had been the plan from the beginning i have something you need to see comrade chernayev said suddenly at middletons side holding out his blackberry the man pictured is named umer a known associate of both sikari and archer who helped them obtain the explosives general zangs intelligence indicates he will be the one to trigger the explosion it makes no sense what why go through all this trouble to set off explosives inside a dam they cant effectively destroy chernayev shrugged a show of force perhaps of power as a precursor to something much worse no this was about assassinating the secretary of state from the beginning now its the president thats what were facing once my men locate archers men itll be sometime before well have to face him again and if were lucky enough to find the boy himself middleton turned about gazing off toward the huge throng stretching well into the thousands pulsing into the natural amphitheater from which the president of the united states would christen the opening of the dam with unprecedented pomp and circumstance any luck so far chernayev shrugged again it is a very large crowd comrade but my men are good and know what to look for the bluewatch people da and believe me colonel theyve been trained for this kind of work what kind of work is that upclose termination like shooting a radioactive pellet into a defectors leg chernayev grinned winked now comrade where did you ever get an idea like that their eyes moved to the sky simultaneously alert by the distant whooping sound of a helicopter middleton could feel the russian tense even as his own spine snapped erect the president was arriving i wont be able to get you much closer than this thats ok tesla told the driver well manage the driver regarded the hobbled charley in his rearview mirror and continued but there is a vip section much much closer to the official ceremony perhaps you have some sort of press or political credentials as a matter of fact i do tesla lied and passed him he beamed then i will do my best to get you there the driver swung right drove down an isolated stretch of hastily flattened road toward a security fence manned by a trio of indian special police they signaled the cab to stop one coming round to the drivers side while the other two kept to their posts ahead of the cars hood tesla turned toward charley prepared to offer some reassuring words when a sudden flash of motion snapped her attention back to the front seat the drivers hands were suddenly off the wheel both grasping silenced pistols before she could react he had thrust them out the window and opened fire on the approaching guard and the two standing at the front of the car the angle of the shots should have been impossible unless it was practiced no one was around to see their murders tesla gasped her first instinct was to protect charley weaponless there was little more that she could do then from the corner of her eye she saw another man slip from the bushes where apparently hed been waiting dressed in local clothing with a long beard he walked quickly to the drivers window he spoke in hindi to the driver then turned to the women you are please to come with me now he said something else but his words vanished as the presidents helicopter flanked by a pair of gun ships soared overhead archers cell phone beeped to signal an incoming text and he raised it upward shielding it from the sun to read umers message in place all is ready archer clicked the phones screen dark again without replying there was no need to he watched as the presidents helicopter settled onto the secure makeshift landing pad that had been constructed to accommodate it for the opening ceremonies the gun ships hovered protectively overhead their rotor wash whipping dirt and debris into a swirling cloud if the day had been too windy for the chopper to land he mused all his plans might have been for naught even the fates smiled upon him he could feel his fathers presence nearby approving as well understanding the need for his own death so that a great destiny could be achieved middleton listened to the indian cabinet minister say after his introductory remarks ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure on this joyous and momentous day to introduce the president of the united states middleton wasnt watching when the president mounted the stage to tumultuous groundshaking cheers and applause from the assembled throngs instead he stood alongside chernayev sifting through the crowd with his eyes searching for umer or any of archers men for that matter the vast sea of humanity gave up nothing as the president began reading from his prepared remarks on the dam opening middleton continued his gradual progress through the crowd angling toward the jampacked and ropedoff area reserved for the press corps cameras flashed and whirred some no smaller than a palm recording the presidents every word and gesture how would i do it middleton tried to place himself in archers shoes the thermobaric explosives hed managed to obtain had never been intended to blow up the dam itselfthat much was obvious what wasnt obvious was what did that leave the stage and amphitheater platform itself had been dutifully checked for all varieties of explosive to no avail which meant which meant the explosives had never been here in the first place and that could only mean archer had concocted a plan to bring them in through other means after the speeches had begun on this day i stand before you representing indias staunchest and foremost ally prepared to welcome in a new age of energy independence that has come to your doorstep middleton gazed up at the helicopter gun ships that had taken positions too high in the sky to render them dangerous to the president if they exploded so what did that leave fifty men he thought if i had fifty men how would i utilize them layering the thermobaric explosives into suicide bomber vests would have been a possibility had everyone who entered not been required to pass through portable detectors so what did that leave fifty men nothing chernayev reported receiving another report over his nearly undetectable earpiece tens of thousands of indias people will now have light and power without damage to the environment or further waste of resources the opening of this dam serves as an example for what the latest in wind water and solar technology can accomplish we never should have let this go on middleton snapped to chernayev as they were jostled suddenly when the crowd reacted to another powerful line spoken by the president what choice did we have chernayev challenged him who would have listened to us we will find this umer we will stop this wed better said middleton umer made his way to the front of the crowd sliding along slowly not about to do anything that would bring notice to him he need not get this close to trigger the blast but he had promised his men he would join them in their glorious mission and be the first to greet them when they reached heaven it hadnt been a difficult sacrifice to make after today nothing he ever did could equal the service he was performing he needed to share in that glory be celebrated as a hero even if that be limited to the tiny circles that knew his role his men shared his ambition and courage each and every one of them knowing they had been born for this day each had gone into this with eyes wide open prepared to give themselves to the service of the almighty umer felt strangely calm aware in a godlike moment that he was the master of a fate controlled by the tiny detonator in his pocket flip the switch press the button and the world would change forever in a nanosecond umer prayed hed be able to view the aftermath from his spot in heaven let us not let ourselves be held prisoner to the vestiges of the past let us embrace the future without fear of the complications that come with boldness and the bright expanse a new direction imparts the time for fear and tentativeness is gone youll never get away with this tesla told archer weakly from the private booth in the vip area archer seemed to feel quite confident that he could get away with whatever he wanted to my father would have wanted middleton to die here he said but i prefer having him watch me kill his daughter better to have him live in misery hell hunt you to the end of the earth archers lips flirted with a smile clearly unfamiliar with the gesture if he survives which is unlikely and if he does let him come after me let his personal hatred consume his failed mission and not long after today that earth will be a considerably different place tesla thought briefly is it true you killed your father archer stiffened didnt respond ill take that as a yes some would call that the ultimate betrayal age betrayed him archer shot at her weakness betrayed him he had played the game too long is that what this is to you as it was to my father but he no longer cared enough about winning you just answered my question tesla said this was your plan all along it was your plan and he refused to go along with it he changed his mind so you killed him archer didnt bother denying it we had come to see the world a different way security badge dangling from his throat middleton was nearing the front of the vast mass of humanity when he glimpsed a man standing off to the side on first glance he wouldnt have paid him any heed at all except for the fact that his eyes were held closed as if he were asleep or praying second glance brought a flash of recognition from the picture chernayev had shown him umer middleton had barely formed that thought when one of the reporters squeezed into the press rows plowed his way into the aisle his face a sheen of dripping sweat middleton watched him tear the camera strap from his neck and toss it aside as security personnel moved toward him middleton swung back toward umer his eyes had snapped open and his hand was digging into his pocket in that moment it all became clear the fifty soldiers thermobaric explosives the discarded camera archers men were disguised as journalists the explosives laden into their nikons canons and video cameras the equipment would have been remodeled to include a lead shielding rendering the explosives mostly invisible to detection devices add to that the fact that thermobarics were so new that their signature may not have been identified and coded yet middleton made his way toward umer wishing now he and chernayev hadnt separated ive got him he said softly into a tiny handheld microphone the russian had provided him front crowd southeast facing middleton saw umer cupping his hands around a tiny oblong detonator and raising them into a position of prayer he closed his eyes again he started to go for the beretta chernayev had supplied but didnt dare risk firing even a kill shot to the brain could result in a spasm more than sufficient to activate the detonator middleton would have to win this battle in close a commotion in the press corps drew archers gaze away from his two captives harold middleton was fighting his way down the aisle no archer rasped and then his voice dissolved into the throaty scream of a spoiled child no with that he lashed a blinding whipsaw of a blow to teslas throat that would have crushed her windpipe had she not turned at the last instant the blow impacted instead against the side still mashing cartilage and dropping her momentarily breathless to her knees gasping tesla saw archer jerk charley forward and drag her downward toward the crowd taking advantage of umers resolute focus middleton slammed into him from the side hand thrust forward to jerk back all the fingers he could find umer whelped in pain enraged eyes finding middleton as if aroused suddenly from a beautiful dream the commotion spilled those crowded closest to the front into a dominolike fall leading secret service personnel to storm the stage and enclose the president in a protective moving bubble chaos the word locked in middletons mind as it raged around him he slammed an elbow into umers face crushing his nose and mashing his front teeth he heard something clack to the concrete and knew it could only be the detonator as umer dropped to feel for it middleton joined him amid the thrashing feet moving in all directions at once if one of them pressed down on the detonators button on stage he glimpsed the secret service just now starting to rush the president to safety still any number of long long seconds before he was out of range of the kind of blast separate thermobaric explosions would wreak middleton felt a knee smack his skull a foot jab his ribs courtesy of the fleeing throngs he continued to grope about the ground for the lost detonator afraid to spare the hand it would take to draw his gun on umer he grabbed sight of him pawing about the ground through the sea of churning legs and desperate fleeing frames middleton glimpsed the detonator its black casing now cracked stretched a hand toward it only to have his fingers stepped on as another foot kicked the device from him it bounced once and skittered straight toward umer who lashed a hand toward it the fingers on his right hand throbbing and useless middleton drew his pistol with his left and fired in a single motion the bullet took umer in the cheek blowing off a hefty portion of his face he collapsed atop the detonator shielding it from the onrushing feet long enough for middleton to close desperately on all fours and jerk it from beneath his body rising to his feet proved an arduous almost impossible task as he clung to the detonator with both hands to protect it his eyes fell on an impossible sight conjured certainly by the sharp blows to his head a vision of his daughter charley but then the haze cleared revealing archer holding a gun to charleys head give it to me archer bellowed looking surprisingly young and desperate give it to me or she dies james phelan archers hand exploded and painted charleys face with gore a highcaliber rifle round took out his pistol he dragged charley back with him to the ground and dropped out of middletons sight the crowd was surging around them thousands of people in a stampede to get out of the amphitheatre middleton hunched and bent his knees to lower his center of gravity being jostled as he went against the tide making it over to where theyd fallennothing blood on the ground archers pistol in pieces no trail middleton had made a career out of helping others hed never asked for anything in return right now as the spooked crowd streamed around him he wished otherwise connie carson and wiki chang sat in the cargo area of an mvb osprey tiltrotor aircraft us marines around them game faces on m assault rifles ready they took off vertically as a helicopter would the flying style converting to that of an aircraft as the two massive engines charged forward for horizontal flight and they were hammering hard and fast to the north squashed between a marine three times his size and carson chang hugged his backpack so tight it seemed he wanted to crawl in there to escape the incredible noise inside the cabin as two other ospreys flew in close formation hed held on but no morechang threw up into the bag hed been given by the crew chief carson patted him on the back youre smiling been a while since ive done an infil with marines she said cheerleader exterior masking a former doorkicker with the us military she was not so much taking to the situation like a duck to water but rather felt a happiness like a pig rolling in filth she scratched at the fiberglass cast on her arm its not really like a computer game is it his teeth felt like they were rattling out of their sockets as the marine seated next to him slapped a box of rounds into his m saw and cranked a round into the chamber chang shook his head chernayev called his name over the radio middleton scanned around stood tall and tried to look over heads and was almost knocked overthere behind the press pool the assembly still corralled in their cordonedoff area below and out of the sightline of the president while potus was being evacced and the civilians exfilled en masse not even all the number of security personnel present were able to control this crowd moving as one over there middleton followed chernayevs outstretched arm and pointed finger archer dragging charley back toward the raised vip area the sound of a helicopter behind him two minutes the marine co yelled masks all the marines donned gas masks carson looked to chang his face a mixture of apprehension and pure fear just twenty minutes ago theyd been stopped at the major road checkpoint ten kilometers south of the dam and she had managed to talk the indian military sentries into letting her speak to the us marine colonel a man who now stood looking forward through the shoulders of the pilots wiki are we in range yet carson asked chang shook his head and turned a new shade of sick swallowed some vomit that rose up his throat she put an arm around his shoulders saving not only their president but also this region from a potential nuclear war yeah that would do it to you the secret service had the president behind a tall wall of bulletproof glass that deployed whenever the commanderinchief was giving a public speech the protective detail all with service firearms drawn were scanning the crowd some looking up at the sound of marine one the big sikorsky vhd sea king coming in fast toward the landing zone middleton ran hard carving a path through anyone in his way werent for the flare in his knees he could have been back years a wide receiver at west point a gap in the crowd another gunshot behind him he didnt flinch eyes searching sucking in air there dead ahead near where the base of the dam met the stairs up to the raised vip platform archer turned to face him arm tight around charleys waist bloody stump of a hand to the front of her his other hand out of sight behind her back could be a gun could be a knife middleton looked to his daughter all thoughts of the running crowd left his mind the bombs too it was like he was in the eye of the storm even the sound of the helicopter was silenced in this moment people ran screaming all around them as he stood still and faced her charleys eyes pleaded with him this wasnt her fight his work had again put her into jeopardy no way a guy one of chernayevs bluewatch operators had his pistol drawn and was coming at himhis head snapped back and he fell to the ground secret service or marine sharpshooter middleton almost wished hed ditched the beretta but hed instinctively tucked it into the back of his belt as hed stood hopefully it wouldnt be clocked and seen as a threat the controller middleton or she dies charley screamed as archer pushed something into her back they were ten yards away middleton closed the gap to five stopped held the controller loose in his right hand visible to archer you want this this ends here you know it maybe for me and you middleton replied its not going to end for her maybe notfor her archer gave a flick of his head over his shoulder what about your other bitch middleton followed where archer motioned at the top of the stairs that led up to the vip area tesla gasping for breath a stream of bright red ran out of the corner of her mouth her face sunken and tired shed been trampled by the crowd let them both go archer middleton said turning back only deal youre gonna get you think you can draw down on me and not get taken out by a sniper go for it sixty marines in full battle dress ran flat out in doublefile carving a path through the middle of the mass exodus chang had a hand on the back of carsons belt as instructed and he didnt argue or question when she peeled off from the stream of marines and ran up the stairs to the vip area to their left the only way this ends archer you let my daughter and my colleague go you give them time to leave archer almost smiled charley winced as he shifted his grip and his warm blood pumped across her neck the detonator on the ground and i let them run for thirty seconds archer said theres a clear path behind me into the dams maintenance area theyll be spared from the blast middleton knew he had no choice but to go along even though charleys eyes said no twentyfive seconds he scanned rightmarine one was coming in to land he thought of lespasse and wetherby two fallen comrades he thought of charleys mother he thought of all those who left too early who were taken by greedy men this was what hed formed the volunteers to prevent twenty leave it longer and they wont make it middleton looked around againspotted a familiar face chernayev was coming behind him ok middleton said he held his hand out and put the remote detonator on the ground a few paces from archer he let charley go shoving her toward tesla who was doing her best to hurry down the stairs run middleton yelled at them run tesla grabbed charley by the arm with all her remaining strength she dragged her away pulled her in a run toward the safety of the dams reinforced concrete the crowd had broken through the barrier and the line of security at the landing area of marine one still several thousand people were jostling for a chance to escape the amphitheatre hundreds of them taking this new route secret service were forced to keep the president behind the bulletproof glass screen some two hundred yards off their nowbusy evac site marine one stayed on station hovering directly above its lz they all donned gas masks even the president and his bodyguards archer squatted to the ground revealed he had a small pistol picked up the remote in the same hand nursing his mangled hand across his chest the whole time looked at the little plastic box smiled content flipped the cover off the switch he thought of that place his father had told him about a little town of pedigree goat herders in kashmir where pashmina came from alexanders caravan was said to have passed through there almost two and a half thousand years ago and the people there still have evidence of that today with sandy hair and ruddy cheeks and blue eyes since a young boy hed longed to see itmaybe death would bring him there suffering has its joyous side despair has its gentleness and death has a meaning every death hovering above the crowd the side door of marine one opened an agent leaned out fired three cs rounds directly below onto the lz the mm grenades from the m launcher took less than half a second to hit the ground fifty yards below the tear gas had an immediate effect no chernayev shouted through a screen of running people archer pressed the detonator middleton closed his eyes he thought of charley nothing happened middleton opened his eyes archer looked at the remote incredulous he tucked the pistol into his belt pressed the button again nothing again again nice try archer carson said she came down the stairs with chang who held up the polena handset that was wired to his backpack he jammed the signal middleton said hed seen connie carson and chang in the brush nearby signaling to him that it was all right to give up the remote control saving him from the very difficult decision his daughter or the president chang nodded looked wornout and relieved like he might faint with the passing of the adrenalin for all his advanced computer and science degrees and language skills that had aided the volunteers from the comfort of his desk in dc never was a sight so welcome in the field as this slightly built taiwaneseamerican before him first i thought they might be using a garagedoor opener but then i realized that the secret service must be wise to that sort of thing from all the ieds and stuff in iraq he said holding up his handset he was taking comfort in techspeak so i barrage jammed all frequencies as soon as the marines dropped us off middleton smiled looked to archer who was now standing up pistol still tucked in his belt radio detonator in his useful hand his eyes were darting around then he seemed to relax nice work wiki no problem boss chang replied he looked over at the commotion of marine one hovering to land the bubble of security protecting the president holy crap he said it really is the president and for the record chang added there was no heavy water the copper bracelet referred to the organization yeah middleton said i figured that one out too he saw chernayev approaching a couple of his security guys with him looked like this was working out as a victory after all hacked into bicchu that search engine chang said and youll never guess who its owned byhey middleton turned he saw wiki chang on the ground rubbing his jaw chernayev had taken the backpack jammer from him walked over to archer flicking switches on the handset as he went owned by one of my corporations chernayev said he dumped the jammer by archers feet and took the detonator from him as a dozen heavily armed bluewatch security men pushed onto the grounds he glanced down at the younger man this should work now almost time and ill see your hands please colonel middleton potus was being ushered to his helicopter a hundred and fifty yard dash the marines were at the lz now a wall of percent pure american muscle to keep the crowd away from the raised landing area the gunships were close in too their immense sound adding to the message to those below this is not the way out the press corps kept their cameras trained on the lz waiting for the moneyshot of a gasmaskwearing president to headline the news services middletons world was spinning chernayev hed set this up he built this dam to attract a us official he set it all up he lied about the communiqué from the state departmentand of course never sent the email to charley and the reference to tampa on balans computerit wasnt one of devras sikaris companies but chernayevs sikari was probably worried about what it meant and was going to send balan or someone there to check it out and chernayev was responsible for the death of his dear friend and colleague lespasse originally i was going to choke pakistan into being more submissive to what i could provide them he said his eyes drifting from middleton to the scene of the presidents detail moving through thick cs smoke im afraid im not that patient we knew some of your volunteers would make it here archer said in fact we were always going to have you here harold dead or alive oh middleton felt connie brush close against him he made sure he kept his hands out front in view of chernayev who had a silenced pistol pointed at them concealed under his jacket it was clear youd come to me chernayev said he motioned for archer to see that the president was almost in the kill zone the tear gas was dispersing blowing to the south chasing at the heels of the evacuating crowd even dead which youll be soon enough you serve a purpose todays events will reshape not only this area it will be a final nail in the coffin for your little group pakistan as the world knows it will end afghanistan too kashmir some of india maps drawn up by old colonial masters will be redrawn again this is the beginning of the endfor your volunteers too buying us the time we need to build up the icc and un will be all over this i dont think so chernayev said a smile on his face we kill you volunteers and more will comebetter organized more resourced i get that but we implicate you in this and your organization will be as dead as you middleton looked at the president at the hundredyard line from marine one about to come into view of the assembled press the only group here who seemed to be enjoying what was going on around them my men archer said all fifty of them are pointing their cameras at your president now behind their lenses copper discs theyd be concave up to an inch thick shaped charges designed to penetrate armored vehicles like in iraq and afghanistan middleton knew all about them hed seen what they could do it will be like fifty sabot tank rounds going off nothing would be left nothing shaped charges kill with kinetic energy such incredible force that converted to heat blasting and melting through anything and everything game over chernayev lifted his sleeve revealing above his watch a thin copper bracelet slightly different than the one middleton had seen on balans wrist this bracelet nothing more than offcuts from the process made into intricate gifts worn with pride by those involved chernayev think about it middleton said this will start a war he shook his head resolute took the remote detonator from archer thumb over the button this region will need many peacekeepersi have a proposal with the un right now for a hundred thousand of my bluewatch contractors to move in to fill the security void where else would they come from the us i dont think so a hundred thousandthat was a big army in any nations book middleton couldnt imagine that the russian had that many boots to field but he had the money then he understood china middleton said this is ultimately all about china right his stalling tactic was tinged with genuine interest chinas secret political leadership the tewu must have been behind the schooling of the three men this is so that china can move in on kashmir they already run part of it and theres no doubt they need the living space and water the giant panda is dying of thirst china was doing the same thing here as they were with the tibet situation in trying to choose the next dalai lama back in the mids they took in the child gyaincain norbu now a young man hes believed by china to be the next incarnation of the panchen lama a position second only to the dalai lama in the hierarchy of tibetan buddhism he will help to choose the reincarnation of the dalai lama and given hes been brought up to obey the chinese communist party it will undoubtedly lead to the creation of a probeijing power in tibet call it insurance devras sikari archers father was part of their insurance for gaining kashmir and maybe even more following what was set to transpire here and these guys youve got out there these bombers and umer sanam middleton asked they all had a purpose as do you chernayevs men from bluewatch were hovering around middleton had no chance of stopping him from pressing the detonatorhed not make it more than two paces and it was a dozen away at least archer gasped reeling from the gunshot wound and called out in a rasp my father wanted your investigation cleared up and he was right for that and for the future we cant have anyone in our way we didnt care if you came here dead or alive so long as you were here for the crescendo what the death of the president whos nearing the kill zone now they looked acrossmarine one was coming in to land potus was in his protective bubble of secret service men sixty seconds out archer said why not discredit the volunteers while we achieve our objective middleton understoodhe himself would get the blame chernayev said right now the fbi is searching your house in fairfax county theyre finding all kinds of iedmaking material there including the lathe that made the concave copper discs of which these are a byproduct the copper bracelet on chernayevs wrist glinted in the sunlight why the intricate carvings a ruse to get us here to make us believe in something that this place was not its more like a hobby of mine chernayev said he walked over to middleton and passed him a small russian nesting doll that fit in the palm of his hand it was solid the innermost doll it was painted in shades of white and grey smooth to the touch from the clear lacquer marine one landed the massive rotors of the sea king creating a new wave of cs smoke that remained in the vicinity the presidents men hit the crest of the lz hundreds of camera flashes going off and illuminating the smoke the press corps were shouting questions but the protective bubble didnt stop moving the dolls face was blank its whoever you want it to be chernayev said standing taller thumb on the switch its your worst fears painted on there middleton had heard of this exact type of doll had even seen pictures in the iccs files from the russianafghan war investigators theyd turned up at several sites of war crimes a kgb osnaz kill team had been giving them out to highvalue targets as a marker for death the locals and even the regular russian army started spreading rumors that it was a group of mythical female snipers the white tights unstoppable unscrupulous theyd garrotte you in your sleep theyd shoot you from two kilometers away theyd take out your whole family with ieds that would make modernday iraqs look like they belonged in the stone age icc files had a different name for this assassinand they were convinced it was just one lone man assigned to osnazs alpha group they called him the doll maker the name was given to me against my will but that is another story there are so many other stories and there will be time for all of them later i know who you are middleton said pity we could have talked about that some more out of time out of the corner of middletons eye he saw a figure running through the crowd coming at them whatever whoever it was too late chernayevs hand was lifting the remote detonator arkady why do it this way middleton said to him his voice deflated at the inevitable whatever name this man was known bythe doll maker the scorpionone thing was constant his art was death and he was about to paint his masterpiece sorry harold its complicated jeffery deaver the president was thirty yards away from the lz dust leaves branches fleeing from the turbulent wake of the helicopter the rotors were dispersing the tear gas too the commanderinchief was sprinting like a running back surrounded by a phalanx of teammates toward the goal line the safety of the chopper the fake reporters their weapons up moved closer chernayev was poised with the detonator in thirty seconds hed fire it get ready gasped archer his face gone white he had struggled onto a hill and had a good view of the landing zone he was dying but hed see this through to the end middleton strayed toward the russian but two bluewatch guards painted him with their complicated black machine guns he stopped twenty seconds the scene out therethe chopper the president the crowds the reporters legit and phonywas utter chaos but this area by the viewing stand was nearly deserted there were no witnesses to the horrible drama playing out middleton shouted to chernayev dont arkady there are a thousand reasons why you cant do this the russian ignored him and glanced at archer ten seconds the wounded man gasped it was then that another voice intruded actually not a thousand but there are several very good ones a sweaty dusty but welldressed man broke from the brush the accent was british it was the man swimming through the crowd not long before reasons for not pushing that button i mean chernayev stepped back the bluewatch shooters swinging their guns onto the brit ah ah dont be too hasty there the man said he looked toward chernayev ian barrettbone he said as if introducing himself at a cocktail party who the hell are you the russian asked the man ignored the question first of all my team has been recording everything for the past half hour pictures of you are on hard drives in several very secure locations you push that detonator some of the best law enforcement agencies in the world will come after you and they will find you thats if you get away of course which you probably wont since three of my snipers are sighting on you at this moment the russian looked around uneasily you wont spot them theyre much better than his voice trailed off as he contemptuously regarded a swarthy bluewatch security man nearby the brit continued oh the second reason you dont want to push the button and kill the president it would be a bit of a waste of time owing as how hes not really the president chto the man gasped oh please arkady think about it american foreign policy can be counted on for some monumental blunders but the administration is hardly foolish enough to send their chief executive into a known threat zone like this the real presidents in washington monitoring everything thats going on here by the way a lookalike connie carson whispered quite so we werent exactly sure what would happen here but i knew it involved the scorpion and some associate from the peoples republic we put this charade together to flush the main ops into the open archer was staring at the lz dismayed he raged somethings wrong the marines and the secret service theyre not leaving theyre targeting sanams men middleton asked the logical question and whos we barrettbone said mi foreign operations division were working with the cia and us and british military he spoke into his collar and immediately two dozen men in serious combat gear stepped out of bushes guns trained on chernayev and the nearby bluewatch security people middleton recognized the uniform and the winged dagger insignia of the famed british special air service an infantry unit like the uss delta force or navy seals the gravity of their mission was heralded by the fact that two were armed with fn minimi machine guns and the rest had their sa assault rifles mounted with ugliesunderslung grenade launchers preparedno eagerto light up hostiles big time if it came to that there are two hundred others here surrounding the grounds and to be quite honest i doubt your bluewatch chaps feel their paycheck is worth going up against our sas now dont you agree barrettbone frowned oh and for the record im obligated to inform you that were here with the full knowledge and sanction of the lieutenant general of the indian armys northern command in udhumpar and of indian special branch which is the diplomatic way of saying your men discharge a single bullet from a single weapon you will all vanish and quite unpleasantly chernayev hesitated his face red with anger he looked around then he bent forward set the detonator on the ground and backed up in two seconds sas soldiers had him in cuffs and relieved of his weapon phone and personal effects in only a bit longer than that wiki chang had deactivated the remote detonator the british soldiers then disarmed and cuffed the bluewatch security men none too gently middleton was pleased to note barrettbone spoke again into his collar captain the detonators in our control move in and arrest the mujahedeen the thermobarics cant be detonated by them but some may have other weapons and theyre undoubtedly all fired up he sighed fundamentalists are soooo completely tedious a medic from barrettbones team arrived and middleton immediately pointed out archer i want him alive he said do what you can to save him yes sir but before the medic got to him archer sat up suddenly stared with unseeing eyes toward middleton and then collapsed onto his back he shivered once then lay still the medic ran forward and bent down over the man he touched his neck then looked up grimacing lost too much blood sir im afraid hes gone the volunteers were sitting in a large workmans trailer near the site of the dam charley was in a separate one her father wanted to minimize the trauma shed been through everyone was dabbing their eyes from the remnants of the cs tear gas middleton had been on the phone with washington the hague new delhi and london everything barrettbone had told them checked out the standin for the president the monitoring that mi mi langley and the indian special branch had been doing chernayev was being housed in an impromptu prisonanother trailer guarded by indian northern command troops and barrettbone had just reported that a covert ops team had completed an extraordinary rendition of general zang beijing may or may not have been allied with him and chernayev but they distanced themselves from him instantly and ordered twothirds of its soldiers on the kashmiri border as soon as feasible despite the rescue tesla was irritated at barrettbone you hid a tracker on us didnt you in paris of course i did on you actually i wasnt sure if ms middleton would go along for the ridewhatever the ride was going to be but you tried to kill us think back luv i warned you about luv sorry but obviously i wasnt going to kill you i was looking out for you it would have been awkward if youd been captured or killed awkward she muttered and i did need to get in touch with harold here we tried everything but hed gone missing you could have said something about who you were how could i do that if you were captured i didnt know how much youd tell i know the volunteers dont go in for intense interrogation but a lot of people do you know at this for some reason nora tesla fell silent avoiding middletons eyes middleton then said wryly to the british agent and you also needed to use us for information a knowing smile obviously colonel that is the way the games played right theres a lot at stake here ive been after the scorpion for several years now undercover posing as someone with an interest in sikari a businessman a mover and shaker but the leads dried up funny that considering all this ado about water we heard some chatter about that bizarre reporter crane that he had some leads we put him in play and got him to the suburbs of paris we tried to make him think one of us was the scorpionthe fellow driving was our station chief in paris he even wore a copper bracelet i bought at selfridges crane didnt fall for it i think but he did follow up on our suggestion to go to your flat middleton you used him as bait tesla snapped the british agent looked at her as if shed exclaimed why the earth is round it worked didnt it we got onto jana that way but she slipped usthanks to crane himself he flew off someplace with her to dubai it seems a night in paradise he mustve been thinking it turned out to be literally true of course since she killed him tesla snapped thats how jana got on to us in paris that wouldnt have happened if you hadnt meddled i do recall apologizing the smarmy man said with irritation i was there looking after you remember but not very goddamn well since i got shot and charley was nearly killed whats going to happen now wiki chang asked well spirit both of them back to londonchernayev and zang see what we can arrange for a trial zangll ultimately go back homeand end up shot most likely as for your russian friend if the criminal court wants him fraid youll have to stand in line theyre both yours for the time being middleton said the only warrant we had was for devras sikari then he had a thought and laughed what connie asked the scorpionsikaris benefactor middleton shook his head all we knew about him was that he was holy but of this world but im wondering if that was a mistake maybe the phrase started in english before it got translated into hindi the original phrase might have been wholly of this world the british agent said cant disagree with that it certainly describes chernayev talk about greed selling out a whole country middleton cocked his head that raises a question chernayevs motive was money and zangs was annexing territory with a good source of water for china but sikaris motive was an independent kashmir so what was his real involvement in all this he waved his hand indicating the dam it seems like he was a pawn used by chernayev but he clearly had something planned for the villagethat was in his email to kavi balan there were plenty of unanswered questions he reflected i better make some arrangements for transport now barrettbone checked an extremely expensive watch he saw middleton regarding it he laughed i didnt steal it i come from money my friend believe it or not im a civil servant because i like the work one cant be a benefactor to the world of arts and music full time and not get bored besides im also a bit of a patriot as out of vogue as that seems cheers now he walked into the dusty heat middleton pulled out his new phone and got a status update the fifty mujahedeen and their leaders had been taken into custody as had the bluewatch people the grounds and the explosives were secure he now rose im going to check on charley his soul was heavy with the knowledge that shed been drawn into the midst of this terrible affairat a time when what she needed most was a chance to heal ill go with you tesla said he was nearly to the door when his phone buzzed yes colonel middleton the british voice asked thats right commander ethans here sas go ahead stumbled on a bit of an odd situation thought it best to apprise you weve got the body of that archer sikari but well the queerest thing seems he didnt die from loss of blood he probably would have but thats not what finished him off he was shot in the back of the head what no question middleton recalled seeing the man sit up suddenly and then collapse but he hadnt heard any shots he told this to the sas officer and asked what about your men no sir none of ours or yours were issued silencers can you clear it for me to have a chat with chernayev ill check with mr barrettbone sir but from sass perspective its fine he thanked the officer and hung up he told the other volunteers what had happened but none of the bluewatch people would have shot himthey were working together middleton said this one has too many questions left for me i need some answers he headed out the door into the blaring sun nora tesla beside him they approached the trailer where the prisoner was being held middleton identified himself to the six indian guards who checked ids and then nodded them through the temporary barbed wire perimeter after verifying that barrettbone and the sas had okayed their interview the trailer was biga doublewide american model with airconditioning in the front office two guards sat in metal chairs gripping h k machine guns one checked their ids and placed another call to their superior officers and it seemed to barrettbone middleton didnt mind there couldnt be too much security with these particular prisoners then he hung up and said you can go in in a moment as soon as the nurse is finished nurse british army nurse middleton frowned is chernayev injured no no she said it was a routine check to allow him into london he smiled maybe he needs inoculation against mad cow disease allow him into london theres no quarantine coming from india anyway hes not going on a commercial flight who approved it an officer in our command inside now keep your weapons ready she was just a nurse ill call northern command if i have to the guards regarded each other they rose readied their machine guns one covered the door while the other unlocked and flung it open he peered inside his face a mask of shock there is problem no no the other indian soldier raced into the room middleton and tesla right behind they stopped fast seeing chernayevs body it was in the middle of the small office whose windows were covered with thick steel mesh hed been shot in the back of the head as he tried desperately to claw his way out the nurse a guard whispered gesturing at the only other door in the room leading to a third office theres a back door no just the one the front the nurse was trapped theyd keep her pinned and call in a marine tac team ill get no we will stop her wait middleton whispered she cant they flung the door open and blinked as a brilliant light the sort used for construction site work at night clicked on blinded they staggered back as four wellplaced silenced rounds found their targetsthe mens foreheads in a blur the woman rushed out she was dressed in a british army soldiers uniform but the poor fit and a small red stain on the chest told middleton how shed come by the outfit he didnt recognize her she hesitated in shock not expecting the other two to be in the room but before she could lift the again middleton drew the beretta that chernayev had given him when he touched the muzzle to her head she debated only a moment and dropped her own weapon tesla then stepped forward grabbed the woman and wincing from the wound in her own shoulder flung the attacker to the floor hard then she struck her furiously in the head and face nora stop middleton said pulling her off and securing the shooter with one of the dead guards handcuffs you didnt have to do that oh yes i did middleton frowned tesla said you dont know who she is do you no its jana grover in paris did you check on my body jana snapped contemptuously at tesla did you call les gendarmes did you call le deuxieme bureau no of course not what you saw floating in the seine was my jacket and you took that at face value im sorry i escaped and deprived you of another chance to torture me middleton glanced at tesla silent at this he now understood the earlier reaction to what ian barrettbone had said he let it go they sat in the same trailer that had been chernayevs cell and his coffin the body had been removed and a forensic team was going through the place in addition to connie carson and wiki chang ian barrettbone was here he was lipbiting mad at the indians for letting the hit woman into the trailer the officer whod been bribed by jana to okay access was in custody but that was small consolation why the british agent asked she treats all colleagues that way tesla said bitterly if theres any chance they might be witnesses against her just like she killed kavi balan in the south of france im not so sure middleton said again considering unanswered questions i think something else is going on here ah youre as sharp as i thought colonel how i wish balan had been successful that day at the beach at cap dantibes i dont understand barrettbone said no you certainly do not the beautiful pakistani said you havent understood anythingany of you from the beginning i wasnt with chernayev or the chinese they were my enemies id been struggling for months to find them and kill them what on earth do you mean as if speaking to school children jana said some time ago devras sikari was negotiating with the mujahedeen here in jammu about power sharing if he could secure an independent kashmir but he learned that this person known as the scorpion and a chinese associate wanted to fabricate some terror attack as an excuse for the chinese to invade and occupy kashmir they planned to blame the terrible incident on devras he learned about their scheme and came up with a plan to expose them he pretended to enlist the mujahedeen to help him blow up the dam yes he arranged for some explosives to be stolen and shipped there but he knew the dam was too solid to be destroyed he was an engineer remember tesla said but the email we found on kavi balans computer said he planned to destroy the village wait no it didnt middleton countered it just said he had something planned for it and he did jana continued he planned to get to the truth of the scorpions plot he wasnt going to destroy the village he was going to save itand expose the scorpion and his associate to the world if we couldnt stop them first middleton had to laugh he realized that he and the volunteers were the ones who had accomplished sikaris goal protecting the village and exposing the scorpions and zangs plan jana continued my job was to find the scorpion and eliminate threats thats why i needed your daughter to use her to find out what you knew after balan failed to kill you i learned who you were not some spy for the scorpion or for those crazy men with the group but the volunteers her face darkened i was getting close to stopping you and to learning who the scorpion was and then tragedy archer killed his fa ther barrettbone said tragedy why you helped him do it are you mad she raged devras was my mentor a colleague of my father he was a genius archer was a street thug a fool the woman shivered in disgust he never understood the politics the culture the depth of our region and like most stupid men he was easily seduced by the scorpion he never realized that the last thing devras wanted was a real incident here especially the deaths of foreigners it would destroy forever his hopes for a free kashmir middleton said so youre the one who shot archer she sighed my only regret is that i couldnt get close enough to tell him how i despised him before i pulled the trigger and crane barrettbone asked the reporter i thought he would be valuable in finding scorpion he led me to your daughter and her a contemptuous nod toward tesla but he gave me little else you wanted chernayev and zang stopped right connie carson said yes of course i did well they were stopped we had them in custody why did you kill chernayev why didnt you jana replied with contempt a vastly powerful man it would only have been a matter of time until he escaped or bought his way out of prison theres another reason though isnt there tesla asked jana smiled at her coldly yes chernayev was responsible for the death of my father he and zang killed him and the indian student they also sponsored they only kept devras alive to use him in their plot i decided years ago that whoever the scorpion was whatever else he was guilty of hed die for the murder of my father poisoned by well water he died in pain middleton said so chernayev using the mujahedeen here today that was a fallback plan right originally he and zang were going to claim that the dam had the copper bracelet technology in itthat would be the chineses excuse to occupy kashmir exactly a weapon of mass destruction and by the time it was learned there was none theyd have the country all locked up sorry we didnt find any weapons but were not leaving she offered a grim smile to the americans that worked well for you not long ago no and what about the copper bracelet technology wiki chang asked eagerly devras was obsessed with it the project consumed him at university and afterward but he never perfected a practical system he could never recreate what the nazis did he patented parts of the technology but it never could work as he dreamed still he thought of the project affectionately if anyone became dear to him hed give them his greatest symbol of affection and gratitudea real copper bracelet middleton glanced outside and saw a cluster of indian troops walking past more security he assumed though they no longer had the key prisoner to guard theyd have to be satisfied with a mere hit woman then he felt an itch something was wrong what was it he glanced at archers phone which sat nearby in an evidence bag he recalled again the last message mission accomplished and he realized something else jana wasnt the least troubled by her capture and shed been talking quite freely in the past ten minutes shed admitted to several murders hell the only way she would share information like this was if her dark beautiful face turned to him and smiled middleton understood the text message archer had put an extraction plan in place to get him out of the area after the explosions at the dam one of his associates texted him that the plan was ready to go jana had undoubtedly been in touch and explained that archer was dead but she was taking over the operation and needed to be extracted from the dam site middleton cried everyone get down get automatic gunfire erupted outside and with a piercing crack a frame charge ripped a large hole in the flimsy side of the trailer tear gas canisters rolled inside and filled the room with unbearable fumes despite the near blindness and the fire in his lungs middleton lunged for jana her hands were cuffed but her feet werent shackled and though she was as impaired as the rest of them by the cs gas shed noted exactly where the rent in the trailer wall was before the cloud filled the room she stumbled to it and flung herself outinto the waiting arms of the rescue party the band of insurgents loyal to archer unaware of janas betrayal laid down covering fire as they retreated middleton and barrettbone struggled outside crawling from cover to cover more tear gas clouds were rising and none of the indian or sas troops knew what was going on middleton finally spotted a group of a dozen people vanish into a clearing where a helicopter was waiting he didnt see jana but he knew this had to be the raiding party as one man stepped through a band of sun middleton saw a golden flash off his wrist its source he knew was a copper bracelet what was about to happen had been a long long time coming this was the thought in the mind of the slim woman walking down the busy street of an overcast london autumn wind swirled grit and papers and crisp leaves around her at a street corner she paused and pulled her overcoat more tightly around her she oriented herself and spotted her destination the tufnell park mosque someone jostled the briefcase she carried but jana grover kept a firm grip on it no enemy knew she was hereit was just a teenage girl obliviously on a mobilebut had a mugger tried to take the case from her she would have killed him in an instant yes the briefcase was that important indeed its contents were the centerpiece of devras sikaris ultimate plan she glanced down at the street and saw the faded whitepainted message look right a warning to pedestrians that traffic could come barreling along from an unexpected direction this amused her a great deal the light changed and she started across the street toward the mosque trying to imagine the consequences of what was about to happen monumental dodging the stream of pedestrians some were anglo girls and boys in school uniforms or hoodies delivery people stiffly dressed businessmen solid women navigating shabby perambulators mostly though arabs iranians pakis a few sikhs and indians too london what a melting pot jana was wearing western clothing but pants also of course a head scarf she had to blend in and she thought again a long time coming clutching her precious briefcase she arrived at the mosque and walked around the nondescript building which was one of the few here free from graffiti it was one of the biggest in london nearly twentyfive hundred men prayed here daily women too though shunted ignominiously away behind dirty curtain partitions jana looked for security nothing out of the ordinary she neednt worry all was going according to the plan she paused near the entrance shivered as a gust of wind swept over her and she turned walked into the café nero across the street ordered a latte in this neighborhood even in a starbuckslike coffee shop chain it was a bit unusual to see a woman alone without her husband or brother or a clutch of girlfriends traditional values flowed strongly here in fact an honor killing by a pakistani brother of his eloped sister had taken place only two blocks away as jana took her coffee sat and shrugged off her coat a bearded man in a turban walked in and regarded her contemptuously despite the conservative outfit she wore and the scarf she decided if he made any comment to her she would at some point hurt him very very badly he took his tea muttering to himself undoubtedly about infidels women and respect another glance at the mosque and she felt the exhilaration of a mission nearly completed the mission that was devras sikaris life plan devras had been one of the most brilliant revolutionaries of his time while chernayev and zang and archer and the mujahedeen believed that their goals could be achieved by explosives and gunfire devras knew that was shortsighted the approach of the simpleminded childish why look at palestine and israel look at sri lanka and the tamal tigers england and the ira look at africa oh there was nothing wrong with violence as a surgical tool it was necessary to eliminate risks but as a means to achieve a political end it was inefficient devras understood that the best way to achieve his goal of kashmiri independence involved a different far more potent weapon than thermobaric explosives snipers or suicide bombers that weapon desire want craving at cambridge and afterward devras sikarialong with her father and their indian classmatehad indeed managed to duplicate the copper bracelet technology that had been perfected by the germans during world war ii shed lied to middleton and the others about that in fact the three men went far beyond the original design and created an astonishingly simple and productive system for the creation of heavy water but realizing its potential and how he might exploit it devras insisted on patenting only a portion of the technology leaving out key parts of the science without which it would be impossible to bring the system online in the briefcase she carried now were the encrypted diagrams formulae and specifications of these core elements omitted from the patents this was devrass plan to trade the copper bracelet technology to the major opec countries in exchange for their agreement to force india china and pakistan into partitioning kashmir and ultimately granting independence if the three occupying nations didnt do this the petroleum producers would start to turn off the spigots of oil and the factories and utilities and the ohsoimportant cheap cars filling the subcontinent would die of thirst the middle eastern countries craved nukes china and the indian subcontinent craved oil she would spend the next few hours here meeting one at a time with representatives from these countries men who were presently praying in the mosque their souls longed for spiritual ecstasy their hearts for fissionable material allah was presumably satisfying the first and jana would fulfill the second she hefted the briefcase onto the table inside were six gig thumb drives with the encrypted technology on them she knew the men would be delighted with what she brought to the table and what was particularly attractive was that the technology was compact and efficient and the facilities would be largely off the grid hard to detect by even the sharpest eyes in the sky glancing at her watch the first of the representativesfrom syriawould be here in three minutes what an ecstatic moment this was if only devras were here to experience this with her she sipped her latte and glanced again at the turbaned fellow nearby still muttering his face dark the door to the coffee shop jingled open and an arab in western clothes entered she recognized him as the syrian assistant attaché for economic development and infrastructure support read spy she noted his shirt flirtatiously open two buttons his bare head a beard vainly trimmed such a hypocrite she thought in their countries no alcohol no pork no drugs no women other than the wife or wives here in london anything went still she smiled his way jana grover was as efficient a businesswoman as she was a killer he glanced at her and smiled an oily flirt her way he started forward at last devras kashmir will be free then the man froze looking out the window police cars were screeching to a halt men jumping out no what was going on he turned to flee but was stopped by a dapper man in a business suit coming through the door he shoved the syrian to the ground jana understood that shed been discovered the whole plot had been found out she pushed back from the table and rose going for the high standard under her blouse but a strong arm grabbed her wrist and bent it painfully behind her the gun fell to the floor she glanced back it was the turbaned arab who had shoved a pistol into her neck she struggled furiously bloody hell luv special branch give it a rest why dont we sounding just like ali g shes all yours harold middleton said to ian barrettbone whose slacks had been badly smudged in the takedown of the syrian he brushed with some irritation at a stain they were on the sidewalk in front of the café nero jana grover was being taken into custody for the drive to new scotland yard where the metropolitan polices antiterror unit one of the best in the world would interrogate her middleton was the only volunteer present at the moment though wiki chang was in mis tech lab on euston road preparing to crack the encryption on the thumb drives which according to the documents found in janas briefcase included details on the copper bracelet technologythe secret elements that would make the system operative you were spot on harry have to ask howd you figure it out middleton considered his answer you could say by looking at what wasnt in front of us hows that questions i kept coming back to unanswered questions first of all the email which ones that from sikari to balan we found it on balans computer which sikari and jana were pretty damn eager to destroy he quoted it for barrettbone it said you recall what i have planned for the village it has to happen soonbefore we can move on we only have a few weeks at the most ah before we can move on exactly that told me he had something planned after the incident at the dam but how did you connect it here that was another nagging question we had a lead to the mosque in the very beginning but it didnt pan out we knew it wasnt a misdirection because that was on the computer too the one they blew up but we couldnt find any connection when we investigated the first time that told me it might have something to do with what sikari had planned after the dam and why did you think it had to do with the heavywater system that was speculation i admit but i got the idea because of my kind host a few days ago mr no namefrom the group oh those mad nazi bastards right they were so adamant about finding the technology that it suggested they knew sikari had gotten further along in developing a heavywater system than it seemed theyd seen the patents and known his copper bracelet wouldnt work then why were they so eager to kidnap me and track down the scorpion they suspected that sikari had withheld some of his research middleton had then contacted barrettbone who arranged for increased surveillance around the mosque easy enough in a city that boasts one cctv camera for every three residents metropolitan polices keeneyed team immediately recognized several cultural or economic affairs representatives from major opec nations arriving for prayers there was no reason for them to be in london let alone in this neighborhood unless some operation was going down middleton had a feeling jana grover would make an appearance and today finally she had circling the mosque and then ducking into café nero a special branch agent of pakistani descent slipped inside for a cuppa to verify it was she and cover her when the operative from the syrian consulate stepped inside the trap closed suddenly a womans voice raged youll never beat us jana grover was staring at him as she was being slipped into a squad car youll never win seems like we just did middleton thought but didnt reply barrettbone asked youll want to interrogate her i assume i can arrange it the american glanced at his watch barrettbone the spy with patek philippe taste couldnt help a faint frown of pity as he noticed the timex middleton laughed at his reaction later i have plans at the moment then he frowned but maybe there is something you can do for me ian whatever it might be my friend name it the houselights dimmed the concert hall audience slowly fell silent but the curtain didnt rise and a moment later the lights rose and a voice came over the pa system ladies and gentlemen if i may have your attention please the management regrets to inform you that there will be a short delay the concert will begin in fifteen minutes felicia kaminski standing in the wings sighed she hadnt fully recovered from the kidnapping the injuries the psychological horror nor from the loss of her beloved bela szepessy violin she now clutched a functional but uninspiring instrument borrowed from a musician with the london symphony besides she was lonely she hadnt seen harold middleton since hed returned to london to arrest the woman whod kidnapped felicia she hadnt seen nora tesla or charley either felicia knew she needed one hundred fifty percent concentration to give a concert of this sort yet under these circumstances she wasnt anywhere close and now this nonsense with the delayed start made matters worse the concert she knew would be a disaster what was the delay she wondered despairing the answer came in the form of a low american voice behind her hello felicia turned she gasped to see harold middleton she set her instrument down and ran to hug him i heard you were all right but i was so worried eyes tearing she regarded cuts and bruises im fine he said laughing he looked her over too you seem all right she shrugged you know middleton continued we have one thing more in common now what is that harold weve both been kidnapped and escaped then she stepped away and dried her eyes you are i suppose responsible for the delayed start he smiled you deduced that she nodded well there is a security problem no what she looked out into the crowded hall not to them he said a risk to your heart what do you mean you lost your bela szepessy at my flat im responsible harold please you could play on a childs toy and make angels weep but i thought you should have an instrument worthy of your talent ive borrowed one for you to use until your bela is repaired i asked the management for a delay to let you get used to it he handed her a package she opened it up and gasped its not oh my god she was holding a violin made by giuseppe guarneri del gesuthe same instrument shed been listening to in harolds flat when she was kidnapped only three hundred or so still exist throughout the world half the number of those made by the famed stradivarius you couldnt find a guarneri for under a million dollars playing an instrument like this just oncea dream of all violinists how harold theyre impossible even to find i made a new friend in the course of the case a civil servant believe it or not but he leads a rather posh life to use one of his words he made a few phone calls my only request is that you dont brain any kidnappers with it what is brain oh you mean hit anyone with it yes ill only use cricket bats for that from now on harold so go tune up or do whatever you have to do the audience is getting restless felicia held the fragrant wood in her hands light as a bird oh harold she took the bow from the case and tightened the horsehair strands and plucked the keys which she found perfectly tuned and at concert pitch she turned to thank him again but he was gone after ten minutes of practice she was aware of the houselights dimming again the orchestra walked on stage and then the conductor finally felicia the soloist entered to even louder applause she bowed to the audience and then to the conductor and the other players and took her place stage left the conductor tapped his baton leaned forward and the concerto began as she counted the measures waiting for her cue felicia surveyed the hall finally she saw them two dozen rows back charley harold and nora tesla whose hand he was holding she gave harold a slight smile and despite the spotlight in her eyes she believed he smiled back then the orchestras part grew softer signaling the approach of hers she lifted the priceless instrument to her chin at a glance from the conductor felicia closed her eyes and began to play abandoning herself completely to the music which flowed over the audience like a gentle tide
