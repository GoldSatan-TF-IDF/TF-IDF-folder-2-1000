the valley it is a late afternoon in september the scene is a valley in southwestern france the river flows slowly between the steep wooded hills the sun is shining on the water it is quiet a man is sitting on a flat rock which sticks out into the river he is alone he sits absolutely still like a stone statue after a while he bends to look at something in the water a fish perhaps as he does so something hits the water and there is a sudden splash he puts his hand to his ear it is covered with blood he falls forward into the river and disappears into its muddy water chapter one the river the pain exploded in my ear sending shockwaves through my body when i saw the blood on my hand i knew it was a bullet someone had shot at me from the hillside i immediately fell forward and swam underwater further up the river far above me the green and yellow light of the surface seemed out of reach but i had to swim as far upriver as i could they might fire at me again if i showed my head above the surface when i felt as if i could swim no further i came up under some trees by the river bank here i was safe no one could see me from the hillside my heart was racing someone had tried to kill me why would anyone want to kill me where were they now what would they do next i forced myself to be calm all my old spy training came back to me stop and think before you act decide on the most important thing to do take one thing at a time above all never panic never lose your cool always stay calm whoever had shot at me would probably come to check that i was dead i decided to find a place to hide and wait there slowly and carefully i crept on hands and knees along the river bank until i could see the rock clearly again i sat down behind some bushes and waited i pressed my wet shirt against my ear to try and stop the bleeding only five minutes later i heard the sound of someone coming down the path from the hillside he was a tall man about my age he had his back to me so i could not see his face but when he looked in my direction i saw that it was heid he turned and walked down the path chapter two on the hillside two hundred metres up on the hillside a man and a woman were arguing through the branches of the trees they had a clear view of the rock in the river they spoke in whispers so no one would hear them but they were very tense and angry the man was still holding the rifle he had just fired what happened did you get him the woman asked im not sure he moved just as i fired but he fell into the river so i think i got him you think whispered the woman fiercely thinking is not good enough we have to be sure we have to find the body to be sure hes dead ok ok dont lets waste any more time ill go down to the rock if i cant find him there ill look further up the river youd better take the path down towards the bridge its possible his body has been carried down by the current of the river but the river is flowing very slowly so it will take some time im not happy about splitting up maybe we should stay together suppose he isnt dead you know how dangerous he is i wouldnt want to meet him on my own dont worry about it the man said here take my pistol but im pretty sure you wont need it he must be dead all right i just hope youre right where shall we meet go to the cafe by the bridge if you dont find him you know the place where we left the car ill join you there jurgen heid a friend why had he tried to kill me i didnt understand we had been on the san cristobal operation together heid nina cas and me we were a team until the operation failed we had all been sent to safe houses after that but we were not supposed to meet again ever we were all told to disappear to start new lives to become other people above all we were told never to meet each other again that was five years ago so how had heid found me someone must have sent him but who and why what had happened to bring him here as i watched heid came back to the river bank he put his rifle against a tree and took out a pair of binoculars slowly he looked along the other bank of the river he was obviously looking for my body i suddenly felt angry he had been my friend and he had tried to kill me and now he was looking for my body i had to find out why he had tried to kill me and who had sent him i picked up a thick piece of wood lying near my hiding place my ear was bleeding heavily but i tried to ignore the pain quietly and carefully i crept up behind heid he was so busy looking at the river through his binoculars that he did not notice me i brought the stick down hard on the back of his head he fell down and rolled a little further down the river bank i thought i had knocked him out but as i bent over him he suddenly grabbed me i felt his hands around my throat slowly squeezing the breath out of me the stick was still in my hand and with the last of my energy i brought it down on his head he let go of my throat immediately in a sudden burst of anger i began to hit him again and again with the stick as my anger left me i realised that i had gone too far heid was dead i had foolishly lost my chance to find the answers to my questions and all because of my anger heids body was now at the bottom of the river bank his face was in the water and the slow current of the river carried away a steady flow of blood i pulled the body along the river bank to a place where some overhanging trees and low bushes hid me from any curious eyes i need not have worried it was evening and i knew that anyone out fishing or hiking would already be going home the surface of the river was still except for the occasional fish jumping for flies far away a church clock struck seven it was a perfect autumn evening first i had to hide the body then i had to find out if it was safe to return to the house after this attack it would not be safe for me to stay in the village but where should i go and then i had to find out why heid had come after me and who had sent him in the pocket of his shorts there was a set of car keys with a registration number on the key ring i put the keys in my pocket there was only one place where heid could have parked a car outside the cafe it might be useful later i rolled the body into the water pushed it into a hole under the river bank and put some large stones on top of it to hold it under the water i picked up heids rifle and then set off for the village it was almost dark by the time i reached the house i had chosen the house for its position it stood on the corner of the steep road which led up into the village of sauvelagarde just outside the village itself behind the house there was a steep rock face the village itself was on the top i had a view of the whole valley in both directions no one could approach the village without being seen and no one could reach the house from behind it was perfect and something which only i knew there was a small entrance to the house from below the road i had put in a steel door which led along a tunnel under the road and into my cellar and from there into the house above i checked that no one was around then pressed the combination on the lock and made my way along the tunnel into the dark of the cellar i always left a torch in the cellar and once i had found it i waited in silence for a moment i knew that if there was anything unusual in the house i would know i had a kind of sixth sense that always warned me of danger it had often saved my life in the past above me the house creaked but the sound was not unusual just an old house settling down for the night i could hear bats flying around in the darkness of the cellar that too was normal everything felt normal i felt sure that there was no one in the house i placed heids rifle carefully against the wall i unlocked the door into the house i didnt switch on the lights no one from the village must know i was still around i stuck some bandage over my ear to try and stop the bleeding then i quickly packed an overnight bag and changed into clean dry clothes lastly i took the picture off the wall and unlocked the steel safe hidden behind it i took out my automatic pistol some money my passport and the brown envelope containing the cds i was just about to put everything into my briefcase when i heard footsteps coming towards the front door i quickly switched off the torchlight put everything into the kitchen table drawer out of sight and stood completely still the footsteps stopped at the front door hello said a voice monsieur daniel monsieur daniel anyone home i recognised the voice as an old man from the village i kept quite still after what seemed an age i heard his footsteps returning to the village above i switched the torch back on but the light died almost immediately damn i opened the drawer in the dark and hurriedly put my things into the briefcase i felt my way like a blind man back down the stairs into the cellar through the tunnel and out of the house the sky was still glowing pink with the memory of the day and i could see the dark shape of the church at the top of the hill from the village above came the familiar sounds of people talking over supper i made my way soundlessly down towards the river staying off the road at the bridge i crouched down behind the wall until i was sure no one was around then i ran quickly across the bridge to the darkness of the car park next to the cafe i stayed out of the pool of light coming from the cafe windows i could see customers inside i recognised two villagers drinking at the bar they were regular customers nothing unusual there but then i saw a woman sitting at a corner table in halfdarkness my heart almost stopped beating it was nina i hadnt seen her for five years she was still as beautiful as i remembered her so nina had come with heid two of the old team had come to kill me the third she looked at her watch with a worried expression she was obviously waiting for heid suddenly she looked up towards the windows i immediately crouched down out of ninas sight she was a dangerous woman i walked over to the cars in the cafe car park there were only three of them i checked the registration plates against the keys id taken from heid and quietly got into his car luckily it was parked at the top of the slope running down towards the bridge i took off the brake and let it roll silently down the slope and on to the bridge as it gathered speed i started the engine and drove down into the valley a few hundred metres down the valley i pulled off the road under some trees i switched off the lights got out of the car and crouched down in the darkness among the trees i waited for ten minutes no cars passed i could just see the lights of the cafe through the trees there was no movement there i got back into the car and drove away chapter five hotel des templiers i drove towards toulouse what was going on i tried to sort out my thoughts again heid had come to kill me he had not come alone nina had been with him so two of the old team had worked together to kill me it was unbelievable my old colleagues how had nina and heid found each other and how had they found me and what was more important why had they tried to murder me nina heid and daniel we were the only three left of the four we had left cas dead at bambacocha the only person who knew where we all were was sir george our former boss in london but i could not believe he would be involved in something like this unless there was someone else a memory suddenly flashed across my mind two men deep in conversation in a dark berlin office i pushed it away and concentrated on my driving in the distance i could see the lights of a village on a hilltop i checked the time nine oclock already i tried to guess what they would expect me to do by now nina would have gone out to look for heid and discovered that the car was gone she would have put two and two together and guessed that i had somehow escaped she would have phoned someone to let them know where would that someone look for me they would probably expect me to make for toulouse and the airport i decided not to do what they expected halfway to gaillac i turned off down a narrow country road towards puycelsi half an hour later i parked the car at the hotel des templiers in the old town luckily they had a room free i checked in and suddenly realised how hungry i was it was well past dinner time but the owner kindly made me a plate of country ham sausage and goat cheese which tasted like food for the gods especially when washed down with a bottle of the local red wine before going to bed i walked round the narrow streets of the small town outside the post office i found a public pay phone and dialled a toulouse number annie yes is that you dad whats going on what do you mean well i havent heard from you for ages then this evening someone called i dont know who a woman asking if ive seen you i nearly collapsed i told her what youd always told me to say i said that you were dead that youd died five years ago and now you call whats going on dad her voice was full of suspicion what are you up to annie im sorry ill explain when i see you ok dad but when will i see you where are you its better i dont tell you now do one thing for me though will you id like you to pick me up outside the supermarket in castelnau tomorrow morning at nine thirty can you do that in the meantime dont tell anyone weve spoken and dont say where youre going tomorrow morning wed both be in danger if anyone found out and bring an overnight bag and dont forget that the phone went dead my coins had run out chapter six meeting in casteinau i parked the car in a narrow road behind the main street of castelnau heid had hired the car at toulouse airport and the hire papers in the name of baumann were under the seat i had a quick look at the papers heid had given an address in schleswigholstein germany there was also a telephone number it might be worth trying later i got out and looked in the boot of the car there was a small suitcase it contained womens clothes poor nina would have to do without clean clothes today i locked the car and threw the keys into some bushes if they found the car they would have to break into it castelnau is a red brick village with a big red brick church only twenty minutes from toulouse it was just small enough to make sure that we wouldnt miss each other and just large enough for the meeting to attract no attention i checked the time nine fifteen i had arrived early to check the meeting place just in case annies phone had been tapped and they knew about our meeting i ordered a coffee in a bar just across the road from the small supermarket the man served me without speaking he was a silent man with a cigarette hanging from his bottom lip he spent his time rearranging the dirt on the bar counter with what looked like some of his wifes old underwear i wondered uneasily what the man had used to filter the coffee there was nothing unusual across the road one or two old ladies entered and left the store but no one was waiting around at nine twentyfive annie appeared driving her old car just as i remembered it i paid for the coffee leaving it still undrunk on the counter ran across the road and got in quickly just drive towards toulouse well talk in a minute the rush hour traffic was getting lighter now so we were soon approaching the ring road round the city how much time do you have i asked im not working at the moment so im free for the rest of the week i need to be back by friday though ive got to take lucien to see his mother in hospital you never said but i guessed you might need the car for some time lucien oh yes the one i met last time the one with purple hair i smiled are you two still together then dad you know that i dont allow questions like that i live my life the way i want ok all right all right annie forget i asked ok just dont do it again all right now where are we going she bit her lip nervously and suddenly i remembered her as a little girl again it was something she used to do whenever she was really unhappy or worried about something i decided it was better not to ask any more questions can you take the motorway to barcelona we can be there by this afternoon you can stay overnight and come back tomorrow morning have you got your passport yes dad and my overnight bag remember what you taught me be prepared you certainly prepared me to look after myself she smiled a bitter smile ok ok i know i was a terrible father please dont remind me dad you werent a terrible father just a bit unusual lets say but ive had a really bad time dealing with your secrecy all those times you arrived in the middle of the night and then just disappeared again all those strange phone calls i wish you could try to trust me a bit more im sorry annie but its too dangerous for you if i tell you everything well cant you explain what happened last night at least she reached for a cigarette and lit it with one hand with the other hand she guided the car at kph around the ring road moving in and out of the morning traffic slow down a bit annie youre making me nervous with your driving i dont want to get killed now after all ive been through and i dont want to die of cancer from your cigarette smoke either mind your own business dad if you ride in my car you have to put up with the drivers habits if you dont like them you know what you can do ok chapter seven journey to barcelona all right ill tell you what i can what its safe for you to know ok she nodded that should help to pass the time and maybe itll take your mind off my driving ok five years ago i was involved in a special operation in central america the americans the cia wanted someone to do their dirty work for them so they called mi in london one of our mi directors saw his chance for promotion so he dreamed up this plan the president of this central american country was someone the americans had supported he was very antiterrorist and procapitalism but he was also heavily involved in the drug business the americans looked the other way for years but he started getting too greedy he was becoming an embarrassment to the us government newspaper and television journalists back in washington were starting to ask awkward questions so the cia decided to get rid of him but and heres the complication as ever there was a revolutionary group that opposed the president and his government if anything happened to the president they wouldve taken control and the cia didnt want this to happen so four of us from mi were supposed to go in and give the revolutionaries support and training to take out the dictator then we would leave and hand over everything we knew about them to the cia after that the cia would knock out the revolutionaries too they would then arrange for democratic elections and bring back an oldstyle politician to lead the new government winwin for the cia lots of praise for mi promotion for the director in london do you follow me yes but why couldnt the cia do it themselves the political situation was too sensitive if anyone had found out there would have been big trouble back home embarrassing questions in the house of representatives articles in the newspapers all that kind of thing and the new us president was concerned about the activities of the cia at the time it was easier to get us to do it so you went right four of us our cover was that we were a group of independent soldiers or mercenaries the revolutionaries were told that we were paid by an anticapitalist organisation in europe we knew that if they ever found out the truth we would be on our own london would deny that we had anything to do with them washington would pretend they knew nothing everyone would turn their backs on us and look the other way it sounds a bit risky to me why did you agree to do it youre right there i said i should have smelt trouble before we even began so there was trouble oh yes plenty of trouble i went on everything went fine to begin with we landed by boat at night the revolutionaries met us and we went with them then we spent three months in their camps training them in weapons and explosives we nearly got to the president too one of our team was a very attractive woman and he loved attractive women she was supposed to poison him during a performance at the opera but that was when things started to go badly wrong what happened someone obviously knew about our plan and we were stopped on our way to the opera house luckily we were able to kill the soldiers who stopped us we had a plan for this kind of emergency we had all agreed to escape back into the jungle and meet up at a village called bambacocha near the chichiguarani falls but government commandos were waiting for us they caught one of us our leader and shot him the other three of us got away we spent a month hiding in the jungle eventually we got to the coast and found a boat to escape to honduras the british high commissioner was very surprised to see us then what happened when we got back to london it was obvious that we were an embarrassment to mi they kept us locked up in a big country house in oxfordshire for what they called debriefing we were all questioned about what had happened they were especially interested in what we had found out about the drug business in san cristobal i think they couldnt decide what to do with us it would have been better for them if we had all died then there would have been no problem so they decided to make us disappear instead what do you mean they gave us new identities new names new passports everything we all got a generous amount of money to live on and they sent us to different safe places to live for the rest of our lives but we all had to sign up to special conditions we had to agree never to contact each other again no phone calls postcards nothing we were told never to contact mi again and never to tell anyone who we really were or what wed done especially the press in a way our new identity was a kind of prison anyway i dont know where the others went i kept my promise i never tried to contact either of them and i kept my mouth shut about what wed done this is the first time i have told anyone anything about that operation so why are you here now dad why are we going to barcelona well everything went well for five years till yesterday then two of my old team suddenly turned up and tried to murder me murder you but why would they want to do that thats just what ive been wondering myself in fact its made me wonder about a lot of things i wonder if they intended us all to die in bambacocha perhaps they wanted us to be killed we had failed to kill the dictator but we knew far too much you mean they would kill their own people yes of course these people have no principles at all its all about power politics and money of course but that doesnt explain why your old team came to kill you does it i mean why were they trying to get rid of you anyway what happened exactly well i was lucky im still here though part of my ear isnt as you can see one of them wasnt so lucky and ive no idea what the other one the woman is doing now but i need to find out and ill have to go to london for that so why are we going to barcelona you could fly to london from toulouse couldnt you of course i could but i think that is just what they are expecting me to do i dont want them to know where i am barcelona is better ok dad if you say so we stopped talking for a while soon afterwards the towers and mediaeval walls of carcassonne appeared in the distance it looked like disneyland the kilometres sped by and we were soon turning south heading for perpignan and the spanish border isnt it strange the way these motorways have changed the way we think about things how do you mean dad well before motorways roads were sort of natural they grew out of the shape of the country the shape of the roads fitted the shape of the valleys and hillsides motorways just cut holes through the countryside if you want to get from a to b you just draw a line on a map and then build a road through so when we travel on these roads we dont look at the landscape or not in the same way as before its all speed everything has to be immediate instant instant noodles instant coffee theres no time for quiet thinking or enjoyment i remember driving down from paris to the mediterranean coast with your mother over years ago it took us three whole days now you can do it in one there was an uncomfortable silence dad can i ask you something of course you can what about well its always bothered me but i never found the right time to ask you before what exactly happened between you and mum why did you split up i could never understand its difficult to explain i suppose we reached the point where we disagreed about almost everything she didnt like my lifestyle all those unexplained absences the long trips away from home i had no real friends friends didnt go with my kind of job and i couldnt stand her friends she wanted a life where everything was in its place everything was certain everything was safe and respectable a nice house a nice garden a nice car a nice husband wearing a nice suit and tie she should have married a bank manager but she got me instead but you stayed together for so long dad nearly ten years i know but you get into the habit of living with someone so in a way its more comfortable to continue with the habit than to break it its a mixture of being lazy and weak the one day you wake up you look at this person who you thought you knew so well and you simply cant recognise them any more i think thats what happened i was so unhappy all that time we lived in paris dad there was always so much tension in the air then after it was over all those tears i remember those weekends we spent together you and me you didnt really know how to pass the time you tried so hard to make me enjoy myself all those trips to cinemas in paris to places you thought id like the luxembourg gardens the zoo but that made it feel even worse i couldnt wait to get back to mum again but then the moment i got back i felt miserable with her too because when i was with her i missed you so much i wish i hadnt hurt you like that you were the main reason i waited so long before but in the end i had to do it theres no point in worrying about it now its past history at least you learnt how to look after yourself how to be independent thanks for nothing she said with a bitter grin the motorway climbs steeply into the pyrenees towards the border luckily customs hardly bother to check cars these days we are all europeans now they only do random checks mainly on longdistance lorries annie was waved through and we were suddenly in spain rolling down towards barcelona we checked into a small hotel in the old town and i left annie to rest while i went to a travel agent i was in luck there were seats on a morning flight to london the next day i paid cash that evening i took annie to one of my favourite restaurants in the tangled web of narrow streets off the ramblas as we ate and talked i think we both sensed that it might be a long time before we would enjoy each others company like this again but for the first time in years i felt close to my daughter it was a rare and special moment i took a taxi to the airport early the next morning i didnt want to risk anyone identifying annies car so i left her at the hotel i cant tell you exactly where im going i told her but i will be in touch as soon as i can lets use email and be nice to lucien ok oh and drive carefully then i left airports are wonderfully anonymous places no one knows who all the other people are the crowds gather mix together then go off through the departure gates to the four corners of the world as they leave new groups of tired or excited travellers arrive but airports are also dangerous places especially if you are a wanted person those video cameras are everywhere eyes that never close for sleep and there are those apparently ordinary men so ordinary that no one notices them men who sit for long hours checking the crowds pretending to read their newspapers occasionally one of them will take out a mobile phone and make a call on the other side of the airport another man will reply sometimes police will then appear and lead away an ordinarylooking passenger this was the trap that i had to escape from it was a risk i still wasnt sure if id been followed i felt the palms of my hands grow sweaty as i approached the checkin desk but i neednt have worried i passed through without a problem the flight was called soon afterwards it wasnt full and i had a window seat in a row by myself i thought back over the events of the past two days trying to make sense of the attack at the river how had they got together nina and heid and how had they found me my mind wandered as i thought about all the parallel lives going on at this moment below me i imagined annie starting the long drive back to her lover in toulouse i thought of nina where would she be now i thought of hugo strang the ambitious country director in mi then quite suddenly the figure of herbert perkins came into my mind what would bert be doing now i wondered in fact herbert perkins or bert to friends was doing exactly what he did every weekday morning as regular as clockwork he got up at six and made his wife doris a cup of tea which he left by her bed he had his own breakfast of tea toast and marmalade alone then he had a bath shaved and dressed carefully in a clean white shirt doris always left one out for him his grey suit and his old army tie he listened to the seven oclock news on the bbc went up to give doris a goodbye kiss and left the house at exactly a quarter past seven he carried his old black briefcase in one hand and a newspaper in the other he walked to south woodford underground station and by half past seven he was sitting in a corner seat on the central line train reading the sports pages anyone looking at him would think he was just another office worker starting another day in a dull office job from the outside he was indeed a grey man in his midfifties average height glasses his grey hair carefully combed to cover a bald patch a typical example of middleaged respectability he had lived in the same house in woodford for over years ever since he joined mi from the army his daily routine never changed he left the house at a quarter past seven in the morning and returned at half past six in the evening at weekends he would work in the garden watch tv with doris and occasionally go down to the local pub for a beer herbert perkins was not however quite what he seemed to be his father had been a sergeantmajor in the army he had been a big man with a big voice when bert finished secondary school he wanted to go to university his father would not hear of it the army was good enough for me bert and itll be good enough for you forget all these silly ideas about university ill get you into the army itll make a man of you berts mum made a weak attempt to change her husbands mind but it was too late at the age of bert went into the army bert was good at physics and maths so he went into the signals regiment a unit dealing with all forms of communication in the army he was good and soon afterwards he was moved to a special unit working on codebreaking it seemed he had a special gift for this kind of work not long after that mi discovered him he transferred out of the army and into mi and so at bert found himself decoding messages from soviet nuclear submarines and east german agents one evening he met doris at a church dance it was love at first sight they married a year later and a year after that their son peter was born they moved into the house in woodford and life settled into a steady routine berts career steadily developed he could never hope for the very top jobs he had no university degree but those who do get the top jobs depend on people lower down in the organisation they depend on people who can provide information at a moments notice who can recall events from far back in the past people who act as the heart of the organisations memory bert had become one of these key people he was a sort of office manager in charge of the details of operations reporting briefing and debriefing and of the records he was a grey spider sitting in the middle of a very large and sensitive web of information there was not much he did not know about all the operations run by mi in the past years or more he now worked in the large headquarters of mi next to the river thames and as usual at exactly half past eight bert was arriving there chapter nine nina rowlandson nina rowlandson was awake lying in bed in the only hotel in latouyrie she had not slept well the whole operation with heid had turned into a nightmare she had waited in that horrible dirty little cafe until it had got dark when she went outside to get some air there was still no sign of heid what was worse the car had gone what had happened she was stuck in the middle of nowhere with no transport no luggage it was all in the car heid had hired and no idea of what had happened to heid she suddenly felt cold and scared she knew dan well from the san cristobal operation they had even been lovers for a brief while during their escape he had saved her life several times during that terrible journey through the jungle she knew just how dangerous he could be she couldnt risk asking questions about dan in the bar she felt helpless all she wanted to do was to get out of this place eventually she phoned for a taxi from latouyrie ten kilometres away the village had a single hotel with a badtempered owner uncomfortable beds the smell of old cigarette smoke left by previous guests and noisy water pipes by the time she arrived it was too late for dinner instead she went out for a walk it was not a long walk as there were only two main streets which crossed each other at a bridge where two rivers joined however she did find what she was looking for a public pay phone she pushed her phone card into the machine and dialled the emergency number in london she spoke quickly and urgently fox here the voice on the other end was sharp and badtempered why are you calling fox is the hunt over no i mean i dont know our friend is missing and so is the car im alone and im stuck in the middle of nowhere ill try to get to paris by tomorrow i feel we are in trouble big trouble come back to london immediately use the safe house wait there till we send someone dont call again the line went dead she went back to her uncomfortable room she could not stop thinking about what had happened her head was full of questions why had strang forced her to go with heid to kill dan strang had told both of them that dan was a threat to them he said that dan was about to release the story of the operation to the press if he did that their pictures would be all over the newspapers if they did not kill dan they would lose their safe lives but nina wondered why strang had not sent someone else perhaps he had some other reason she did not trust him nina spent the rest of the night trying to get to sleep every time she began to fall asleep terrifying pictures would flash through her mind dan still alive gun in hand chasing her through the streets then she was drowning in mud in san cristobal a boot pushing her head under the surface the pictures played endlessly in the theatre of her mind she could hear the cold voice of cas you stupid idiot you didnt think i loved you did you and hugo strangs upper class accent you have no real choice my dear its him or you if you dont do it youll lose everything you decide she tossed and turned fighting her nightmares until thankfully daylight came through the thin curtains there was a station in the town though only two trains a day stopped there luckily there was a local train at eight with a connection with the toulouse to paris express she waited on the empty platform she was the only passenger to board the train from then on the return journey went smoothly from paris she took the eurostar express train to london via the channel tunnel but it was late evening before she let herself into the big victorian house in wimbledon using the key strang had given her this was the safe house but somehow she did not feel safe there she took a long hot bath and fell into bed within minutes she was sleeping deeply chapter ten hugo strang as dan arrived at gatwick airport hugo strang was leaving his fashionable west london flat he was a little late that morning as he had entertained a group of visiting american politicians the night before it had been a late night strang was slim and classically handsome keeping fit was almost a religion with him it was part of his competitive character he was always perfectly dressed with a quiet but fashionable elegance and always knowledgeable and charming something that meant he had hundreds of friends needless to say these friends were all highflyersleaders just like him and he treated ordinary people like rubbish kicking them out of his way when necessary his friends greatly admired how much he knew how well he spoke foreign languages they also admired his clever jokes and his expensive lifestyle but people who worked with him or worse worked for him hated him for his ambition his total selfishness and his pride of course he had all the right connections his family had been rich landowners for centuries he was educated at public school and oxford university leaving with a first class degree he had been interviewed and chosen for mi as soon as he left oxford his sharp cold mind and his skill at making himself useful to his superiors had led to immediate success after working in berlin he had been moved back to london there he became one of the inner circle of people who really made the important decisions it was while he was head of the latin american department in london that he had planned the san cristobal operation yet although he was so successful no one really trusted him perhaps that was why he was still not married and many people asked themselves where he got all the money he needed to support his expensive lifestyle there had also been that unfortunate event involving peter perkins which had almost ruined him but that was all a long time ago now but people still talked about him behind his back of course as he entered his office the phone rang strang he recognised sir clives voice immediately it sounded angry and aggressive whats going on the woman called the emergency number last night the operation in france went wrong you promised me that everything would be taken care of our friend escaped we dont know where he is what are you going to do about it but but sir everything was planned down to the last detail i dont see how it could possibly well it did go wrong very badly wrong so how are you going to put it right daniel combes is a double danger to us now he knows what he knew before that was why we needed to remove him but now he also knows that someone tried to kill him and it wont take him long to work out who was behind it all so you dont have long to take care of it i cant afford to have all this in the newspapers thats why we decided to deal with him in the first place i er ill take care of it sir dont worry i understand i hope you do if i go down ill take you with me and by the way i think youll need to get rid of the woman too ive decided to get you know who back from the us he can deal with her weve already been in touch with him he arrives this evening on the ten oclock flight from new york youd better meet him make sure he knows what he has to do and dont lose sight of him we will need to deal with him too later chapter eleven death in berlin i had no problems coming through passport control at gatwick i couldnt make up my mind where to go first in the end i decided to head for somewhere near south woodford the memory of bert perkins had given me an idea i hired a small car and set off eastwards on the boring m motorway which runs around london in a big circle as i drove through the heavy traffic i tried to think about what i should do next i suppose i could have just called sir george my former boss and told him what had happened at the river in france but that didnt seem like a very sensible thing to do if sir george already knew about the plan to kill me i would be in greater danger if sir george didnt know about it i would be drawing unnecessary attention to myself sir george maybe later but not now i even thought about breaking into hugo strangs flat and beating the truth out of him i was sure that strang was involved somehow though i could not work out how or why but if i broke in and beat up strang they would know i was back in england anyway what good would it do i decided to deal with strang later too the only person i could really trust was bert perkins we had always got along well in the old days bert and me i always thanked him for what he did for us all other people often treated bert like a servant but not me and we had become real friends during that terrible business with his son peter peter was his only child and bert had given peter the university education which his own father had prevented him from having peter was a brilliant student and graduated from university with a firstclass degree in international relations in his final year he had been approached by someone from a government organisation working for the good of the country they always did it like that i always thought that employing peter was a bit peculiar though mi didnt normally employ members of the same family but of course peter had no idea what his fathers real job was bert never spoke about his work at home someone somewhere must have known who peter was and who his father was too yet peter had been approached and he accepted the job his first job was in berlin where hugo strang was the mi bureau chief it was just before the berlin wall came down the political situation was dangerous but life in west berlin was exciting and peter soon settled down he was a hard worker and often stayed late in the office he got on well with strang although they were so different strang spoke highly of peter and began to give him more and more responsibility some of the other people in the office were even a bit jealous of him i found out later but then something went wrong between them no one was quite sure what it was but strang suddenly began to treat peter badly he gave him only the most boring jobs and he openly criticised peters work in front of the others it was soon after this that strang gave peter a particularly difficult and dangerous operation there is no doubt that he acted wrongly peter had never worked on this kind of operation and strang could easily have found a more experienced agent to do the job at the inquiry into peters death strang argued that peter had needed the field experience strang was never punished but the suspicion remained that something dishonest had gone on something which was never mentioned something which strang wanted to cover up something which the inquiry wanted to cover up too peters job was to arrange for the escape of a senior east german government official the man had been passing valuable information to the berlin bureau of mi he now suspected that he had been found out he needed to get out as fast as possible peter had to help him escape peter made arrangements for false papers and a car but their car was stopped well before the checkpoint between east and west germany they shot the official as he tried to escape then they took peter away for questioning soon after that the east germans contacted the mi office they said that they were interested in exchanging peter for one of their own agents who was in prison in britain for spying this mans name was holzmann gunther holzmann they badly wanted this agent back he was obviously very important to them london agreed and i was the one who was sent over to berlin to arrange the prisoners exchange i went to see bert in his office before leaving for berlin bert had no formal or official part in the exchange but he knew about it he was terribly upset he needed support and he needed it badly i spent several hours with him listening to his worries trying to set his mind at rest i promised bert i would do everything i could to bring peter back safely but when i arrived in berlin there was a surprise waiting for me my east german contact called me to say that the exchange was off i spent over a week trying to find out why the east germans had changed their minds and trying to find out what had happened to peter i got the answers to my questions in a dark and dirty bar in tegel a suburb of berlin i had arranged to meet kurt klassens there kurt was my oldest berlin contact he looked like a retired boxer with scars on his cheeks and a broken nose he wore a leather overcoat smoked cigars and drank beer followed by small glasses of strong apple schnapps he was now on his fourth drink kurt was tough i was never quite sure whose side he was on when we needed information he sometimes found it for us if we paid him enough though im pretty sure he also provided the east germans with information about us too if they paid him enough yet i trusted him he had never betrayed me as far as i knew and he knew his way around the dark complicated world of berlin spy land im sorry dan but the boy is dead they said he was killed while trying to escape but you know what that means but why did they call off the exchange thats the interesting bit the way i heard it it was your people who called off the exchange of peter for their man holzmann a message came from your berlin office no exchange there was no explanation but i guess someone in london thought peter wasnt valuable enough to exchange for holzmann sorry man this peter wasnt a friend of yours i hope not exactly but i know his father whats holzmann like have you ever met him once or twice you know how it is dan i do a bit of business over here a bit over here too sometimes if theres any money in it i have to make a living somehow so whats he like why is he so important why would we want to keep him in britain well he was one of their top spies a sort of master spy but there might be other reasons i suppose they say hes number one in the drugs business too you know all the opium that comes from afghanistan its like the old silk road from china only now its not silk its heroin berlin is the crossroads between east and west and holzmann has all the right contacts in the east he knows everyone i cant confirm any of this of course its just a theory but maybe it has something to do with the case i dont know maybe he has contacts in the west too who knows lets have another drink he ordered more drinks heres to the end of the wall he said raising his glass and the success of the free market you can be sure that holzmann will always be here with us and doing well whatever the political situation is he laughed drained his beer threw his cigar into the ashtray and left quickly by the back door when i got back to the berlin office i tried everything to find out who the no exchange message had come from i questioned everyone but i didnt find anything i even interviewed strang of course he said he knew nothing about it how can you possibly think that anyone here would even dream of doing such a disgusting thing he spat when i asked him the evening before i was leaving for london i realised i had left some papers at the office i went back to get them it was late almost midnight the security guard let me in i heard voices coming from strangs office they were arguing i picked up my papers and walked back to the lift strangs door was half open as i passed but the office lights were off i looked in the light from the street caught the face of strangs visitor it was somehow familiar i had seen it before somewhere but where the two men were still deep in conversation so i didnt think they saw me i hurried downstairs and left the building but the picture of the mans face lit by the street light stayed in my memory the day after i got back to london i went to see bert this time at his home in south woodford someone had already told him the bad news he sat in an armchair with a dead empty expression on his face i tried to explain what i had done to get peter back bert remained silent his cup of tea cold on the table beside his chair it was only as i got up to leave that he spoke youre a good man dan i know you did everything you could to find peter but someone is responsible for this ill find out who it is even if it takes me years and when i do find out ill know what to do about it thank you for everything dan from that time on bert started to look like an old man he still did his work in his usual professional way but he seemed to have lost interest in life the light in bert and doris lives went out when peter disappeared chapter twelve the san cristobal operation my thoughts were interrupted when a car braked suddenly in front of me i realised i had been daydreaming i was already approaching the dartford tunnel which runs under the river thames and the traffic was very heavy as i moved slowly i began to think about how we had all got involved in that san cristobal business heid nina and me had all been part of the same team so there had to be some connection between san cristobal and the attempt to murder me but what was it the four of us had been given our instructions by hugo strang in the main meeting room in mi headquarters overlooking the thames he introduced us in turn nina rowlandson jurgen heid daniel combes and charles cousins youve never worked together before and its not likely youll ever see each other again once this operation is over i therefore suggest you tell each other as little as possible about yourselves you have of course been specially chosen for this operation nina for her training in medicine and he paused with a faint smile on his lips for her physical attractions heid for his telecommunications skills dan for his weapons and explosives knowledge and last but by no means least charles or cas for his organisational qualities and his language skills cas will be your team leader cas smiled at us all as strang named him as our leader he and strang also exchanged looks they seemed to be sharing some kind of joke they obviously knew each other quite well already i remember looking carefully at each of my team mates nina was extremely beautiful tall and slim with olivecoloured skin green eyes and long red hair when she moved it was like watching a cat move smoothly and effortlessly i could hardly take my eyes off her though she carefully avoided eyecontact with me heid was about my own height and build with slightly square germanic features and very blue eyes his eyes were strange they seemed to be looking in rather than looking out he rarely spoke in the months to come i realised that he was an entirely private person someone who never showed his true feelings who never shared his thoughts who never opened up cas personality was the complete opposite of heids he was tall dark and handsome the sort of man women fall in love with easily his eyes were dark and full of humour his energy was like electricity running through his body i noticed the way nina kept looking at him and i felt a little jealous strang was clearly enjoying himself he described his special operation like a schoolboy showing off a new toy as you know we work closely with the cia in certain geographical areas particularly in asia we also work together in operational areas such as drugs weapons terrorist groups and that sort of thing the operation you will be working on is slightly unusual normally the cia deals directly with problems in latin america this time however they have asked us to act for them there is no need for you to know the reasons for this just believe me that they are good reasons the republic of san cristobal was through latin america in the late nineteenth century its small less than two million people most of them indians physically its less than half the size of honduras theres a flat coastal area most of it covered by jungle and banana plantations and a central range of thickly forested mountains apart from bananas about the only thing the country produces is coca as you know coca is the plant used to make cocaine and the majority of this is smuggled into the usa san cristobal is described as a democracy but in fact its a military dictatorship the president is julio ramon menendezarroyo de ybarra y figueras most people just call him el jefe the chief now el jefe won an election twenty years ago in highly suspicious circumstances and he has been in power ever since then occasionally he holds another election but votes are cheap and there is no organised political opposition so the president and his friends treat the place like their own property they give the orders and collect the cash and the indians do the work pay the taxes and keep quiet people can simply disappear overnight in san cristobal well this was the situation until about ten years ago that was when one or two of the indians whod been overseas to study came back with some different ideas one of them was called raoul guayateca he formed a new party the frente por la libertad de ixtulpaca or fli for short he was a bit like the president in the sense that he wasnt interested in elections either he wanted a revolution so that he could establish a communist government in san cristobal he planned to give the country a new name an indian name ixtulpaca the indians would take over from the spanishspeaking upper class a better country and society would be created weve heard it all before of course its the same old story but thats when the americans began to take a closer interest in san cristobal before that it was just a name on a map but it was in an important geographical location the americans did not want it to fall into the wrong hands and there were plenty of wrong hands in cuba just across the water from san cristobal so they invited el jefe up to washington and signed an agreement for military cooperation with san cristobal this included the usual financial aid in dollars naturally el jefe and his people were very happy to accept all this free money the cia of course knew that he was involved in cocaine smuggling but they chose to do nothing about it at least for a time they supplied him with weapons and training for his army in return he had to keep the fli revolutionary party under control this arrangement worked very well until last year then after the elections in the us things started to change the new us president wanted to help democracy worldwide he also needed to make some progress in the fight against drugs at the same time the fli began to have some success in san cristobal and el jefe started to lose control the americans began to worry as el jefe lost control of his country the drugs business began to get out of control too at one point the president of san cristobal was openly using military planes to drop drugs north of the border he had to go he was an embarrassment but how could they get rid of him and who would replace him and thats where we come in our job or should i say your job is to go in and get rid of el jefe well do this by supporting the fli and training the revolutionary group to bring down el jefe at the same time youll find out as much as you can about the fli and their plans once el jefe is dead you get out quickly you pass on all your inside knowledge about the fli to the cia and theyll take care of the rest the americans will make sure the fli does not last long now there are a lot of details to go through but thats the main idea well leave you on a nice quiet beach in san cristobal at night youll be met by someone from the fli take this training of the fli seriously youve got make them believe that youre working with them please remember that once youre in you are on your own we cannot help you if you get into trouble the british government cannot afford to be publicly involved and neither can the cia so make sure it goes well now any questions he did not wait long enough for a reply good then ill hand you over to the support team for the operational details i shall see you again on your return good luck chapter thirteen epping forest i left the m at the m junction and turned south towards london there was a signpost to epping and woodford i turned off there i had to find a way of meeting bert perkins without being noticed it was too risky to phone him i decided to find somewhere quiet to stay and to meet him off the train when he came back from london just outside epping i found a quiet motel what i like about these places is that they are cheap clean and above all impersonal you check in you pay in advance you get your key and they leave you alone no one wants to know who you are or what your business is most of the customers are tired businessmen who check in late go straight to bed and leave early next morning as i unpacked my bags i suddenly felt cold fear where was the brown envelope with the cds i looked everywhere for it but it was gone for a moment my mind went blank where were they then i realised what had happened the envelope was still in the house at sauvelagarde in the darkness i had left it by accident in the drawer of my kitchen table the cds were my insurance they contained details of the san cristobal operation and a lot about berlin and other information i had kept them in case mi ever broke its promises to me i had planned to release the information to the newspapers if that happened now they were hundreds of kilometres away in france i knew that somehow i had to get the cds back i had a shower and a rest trying to forget about the cds i thought about my meeting with bert what would he say what did he know would he agree to help me i lay on the bed and fell asleep with these questions on my mind when i woke it was already four oclock i knew bert would not arrive at south woodford station until about six oclock i decided to go for a walk in the forest there was that lovely autumn smell as i entered the forest wood smoke and wet leaves it reminded me of my childhood the happy times before my parents were killed before i married francoise before i joined this dirty profession i thought about the wasted years how i had ruined my life how the years had flown by how i had failed as a father to annie so much wasted time so much i was sorry for so much bitterness by six i was sitting in the car near the station entrance a train came in from the direction of london the crowd of tired men with briefcases and young women in business suits and highheeled shoes poured out their mobile phones pressed to their ears bert was not among them ten minutes later another train pulled in bert was one of the last people to walk out through the entrance he began walking towards home a grey figure walking slowly with his head down his eyes on the path in front of him i drove the car slowly alongside him stopped and opened the passenger door bert its me get in he had been deep in thought he looked up surprised dan its you how strange i was just thinking about you he got in i need your help bert can we meet to talk of course he said quietly i dont think youd better come home with me now though it wouldnt be safe drop me off at that corner over there and well meet later at a pub bert paused for a second the kings head he said is a pub just on the other side of epping i dont usually go there and its quiet eight oclock i nodded and bert got out of the car and walked slowly away on my way back to the motel i stopped off at an internet cafe to check my email there was nothing i mailed annie dear annie good to see you hope you got back ok ive mislaid forgotten something and may have to ask you to go and get it are you busy would you have time take care dad i waited for half an hour but there was no reply chapter fourteen waiting in wimbledon nina got up late she felt more tired than when she had gone to bed the bad dreams had returned to disturb her sleep during the night she showered and made coffee there were some croissants in the freezer and marmalade in the cupboard she put two croissants in the microwave and had breakfast there was plenty in the freezer for lunch even wine in a rack in the corner but what she really needed was clean clothes her case was still in the car heid had hired but she couldnt go out they had told her to wait until someone came she waited all morning but there was no sign of anyone she thought about calling the emergency number again but decided against it at two oclock she decided to make a quick trip into wimbledon to buy some clean clothes by four oclock she was back in the dark victorian house preparing supper she poured herself a glass of champagne and waited the clock on the wall ticked loudly and it was starting to annoy her why hadnt anyone come yet the hours passed she watched some television made herself a sandwich and even tried to read one of the novels in the bookcase when the clock struck midnight there was still no one by then she had finished the bottle of champagne and started a second bottle suddenly she felt exhausted she slowly climbed the stairs to the bedroom and fell into a deep sleep nina woke slowly it was dark but she knew that someone was there in the room with her she reached under her pillow for the pistol she had put there a dark shape suddenly appeared by the bed before she could use the pistol strong hands grabbed her wrists and held her tight she struggled her legs kicking against the bed but it was no use he was too strong for her nina its me dont you recognise me in the dark the man switched on the bedside lamp and let her go as she turned to face him her eyes grew wider cas i cant believe this is happening but youre dead i saw them shoot you in bambacocha she paused waiting for cas to explain but his lips closed her mouth she pressed herself against him oh cas is it you am i dreaming i thought i would never oh yes i want you yes ive waited so long for this after love they were quiet for a while he held her close and she lay sleepily in his arms then he gently led her from the bedroom and downstairs to the kitchen as she sat in her bathrobe he opened another bottle of champagne and took some bread and cheese from the fridge lets have a midnight feast he said just like the old days the clock on the wall showed three oclock it was still like a dream for her he had come back at last back from the dead i dont know what to say cas she began i thought you were dead i saw you being shot they told me someone would come here but you i cant believe this is happening how did you escape and why didnt you ever contact me its been five years cas five long years since i last saw you cas said nothing he simply smiled at her in that dreamy way she loved so much eventually he spoke i had to disappear my darling believe me it was too dangerous for us to be in contact nina now felt more confused than ever she wanted to believe him one part of her desperately wanted to believe him but she wasnt a fool cas i dont know whats going on help me what has changed if it was too dangerous for us to meet before what has changed now all those threats from strang and the orders to kill dan what is it all about at the mention of dans name cas expression hardened i cant explain now its too soon youll understand everything later my dear nina all i can say is that dan knows something that puts us all in danger dan has to go and the sooner the better so what do we do now cas he must have got away from heid where is heid anyway yes he got away from heid and he got away from you his voice took on a cold edge and where is dan now you dont seem to have been very successful do you now it looks as if ill have to do the job myself you dont understand cas heid was so sure he had hit dan he went to look for the body in the river i waited for him but he didnt come back then i found that the car was gone i panicked i didnt know what to do thats why i called london that was not what i expected from you you are a trained agent and you behaved like a schoolgirl his voice rose dangerously whats wrong with you he didnt wait for nina to answer my guess is that dan will show up again soon hes too hotheaded to hide hell be angry and looking for whoever tried to kill him and that means you my dear so when he pops up ill be waiting for him i have to go away this weekend an important meeting ill leave early in the morning and come back on monday morning then well decide what to do he looked at her with his hard cold eyes and she suddenly felt frightened then his face changed again he smiled his charming smile and said so my darling lets forget about it all until i get back ok lets finish the champagne they drained their glasses then he took her in his arms and led her back upstairs the clock showed half past four they made love again she felt so relaxed that she immediately fell asleep in his arms soon she was sleeping deeply she must have thought she was having another nightmare when he put the pillow on her face and held it there until she stopped struggling cas took a shower and dressed before leaving the bedroom he checked one last time that she was dead then he went downstairs let himself out of the house and drove away into the darkness chapter fifteen at the kings head the kings head pub was only a kilometre from my motel it too was in the forest a traditional country pub it felt warm and welcoming as i stepped through the door there were a couple of men at the bar drinking beer otherwise no one i saw bert at a corner table he had a glass of beer in front of him a glass of wine stood opposite him pinot grigio he said i seem to remember you rather liked that thanks bert its good to see you thanks for coming my pleasure dan i owe it to you i cant stay too long we might attract attention bert paused and drank some of his beer so whats going on dan heid and nina came after me in france i had to kill heid but ive no idea where nina is now i dont know who sent them but im sure strang is involved somehow and maybe someone higher up maybe someone in the government i was hoping you might have some information any ideas about why strang or whoever wants to kill you so badly thats what ive been asking myself ever since heid shot at me i cant think of an answer well bert said my guess is that you know something but perhaps you dont consciously know that you know it and what you know makes life dangerous for them you mean ive seen something or know something that puts them all in danger something i may not know about perhaps its a connection that i havent made yet between them and someone or something else if i were you id think back very carefully anything to do with strang maybe something to do with an earlier operation the ghost of an idea flashed through my mind something to do with berlin two men arguing in a dark office but it was gone before i could catch it perhaps its something related to san cristobal dan bert offered san cristobal you know something bert tell me berts face suddenly became tense and serious im in this too you know dan when peter was murdered i found out it was strang who called off the exchange ive been waiting dan waiting for the right moment but now i think the time has come to get even with strang i dont care what happens to me any more i want strang fixed once and for all so you do your bit dan and ill do mine thanks bert im listening heres what ive found out bert began i knew there was something going on as i told you i keep a very close watch on what strang does and hes been acting strangely for the last few days very nervous and worried so i did some more checking it took me a while to get into their computer files but when i did i found plenty of interest first cas is still alive his death at bambacocha was obviously just a trick to make everyone think he was dead hes been living in the usa in a small town in vermont second strang is right in the middle of all this he recently contacted cas in america and cas is flying back lastly strang used the other two nina and heid to get rid of you he told them that you were going to sell the story of the san cristobal thing to a sunday newspaper apparently you were going make a lot of money strang contacted the other two and brought them to london nina was in crete and heid in germany they didnt have much choice he must have threatened them if they didnt agree to get rid of you they would lose their income from mi their protection everything but strangs plan went wrong now youve told me i know what happened im also sure there is someone higher up whos involved he must be feeling even more frightened than strang and i dont think its sir george do you have any ideas my mind was racing cas still alive but i had seen him die in bambacocha someone higher up but who could that be and why were they worried about me what did i know that could possibly be a threat to them lets have one more shall we then i must get away bert went through to the bar with the empty glasses he returned a few minutes later with two more drinks thanks for all of this bert i always felt strang and cas were up to something but its a shock to find that cas is still alive where do i go from here well one other bit of information i picked up is that theres some sort of secret highlevel meeting planned between our people and the americans its this weekend and itll be at burstead house in oxfordshire i think you know the place of course i do bert its where they took us for the debriefing after san cristobal it looks just like a traditional old english country house all very innocentlooking it certainly doesnt have an advertisement on the gate saying top secret mi briefing centre but the security is tight there are electronic alarms and dogs everywhere thats right they only use it for really secret stuff strang will be there among others maybe you should pay them a visit a nice quiet weekend in oxfordshire thanks bert sounds good ill need a gun though i thought you might need some equipment when i go ill leave my briefcase on the floor i think youll find the contents will come in useful bert you think of everything thank you i must get home now doris will wonder where i am take care these people are dangerous he stood up to leave oh and by the way nina is staying in the safe house in wimbledon do you remember it theres a key in my briefcase my guess is shes waiting for further instructions she must be feeling pretty scared i would be maybe youd better get to her before cas does she might just be scared enough to tell you something useful berts voice softened goodnight dan stay in touch bert made his way slowly through the empty bar and out into the autumn night i finished my drink the two men at the bar were still deep in conversation i picked up the briefcase and left chapter sixteen death in wimbledon when i got back to the motel i suddenly felt exhausted i thought about driving down to wimbledon immediately but quickly decided against the idea i needed some rest first the next morning i left early i decided it would be quicker to take the central line train into london and the district line out to wimbledon after over an hour spent with commuters making their way to work i arrived at wimbledon station the house was within walking distance i remembered it from before it was in a quiet side street a square dark depressing victorian house with a high brick wall which surrounded a large garden with tall dark trees there was no sign of life from the house so i walked quickly up the drive and went round to the back door keeping out of sight among the trees i looked in through the kitchen windows on the table i could see two wine glasses and an empty bottle of champagne i decided to take a chance and rang the doorbell i could hear it echoing through the house no answer i rang again still no one came i returned to the back door and let myself in with the key slowly and carefully i made my way to the front of the house and up the stairs the main bedroom door was wide open my heart sank as i saw the body on the bed i had come too late nina would not be able to answer my questions i was angry with myself if only i had come the night before i might have been able to save her life i went over to the bed she was naked and even in death beautiful the blue colour in her skin showed how she had died the killer had left nothing in the bedroom as a clue her clothes were left neatly on a chair everything looked normal except the dead body i covered nina with the sheet and went back downstairs i looked around the kitchen the two glasses on the table suggested that she had known her killer it was then that i noticed the cigarette end in the ashtray nina did not smoke and there was no mistaking the unusual turkish brand of cigarettes that cas had always smoked so cas was back and he had not wasted any time i felt a great wave of anger run through me cas would have to pay for this with his own life i left the house and was locking the back door when i heard the sound of a car pulling into the drive i crouched down and slowly and carefully looked around the corner it was a white unmarked van with no windows two men got out and one took a stretcher from the back of the van they entered the house through the front door and two minutes later they came out with ninas body on the stretcher covered with a blanket as soon as the van had gone i walked quickly away towards the station before taking the train back i again went to an internet cafe to check my email there was a message from annie dear dad it was great to see you i got back ok im afraid i cant do anything for you at the moment lucien and i have split up it happened when i got back i told him i was pregnant all he said was get rid of it then he was horrible to me i want this baby dad i cant believe this is happening to me im sorry to worry you with this but i dont know what to do i wish i could talk to you i feel very lost at the moment please get back to me when you can love annie i was knocked over by annies news why hadnt she told me about the baby when we were in barcelona i decided i had to buy a mobile phone i had to be able to speak to annie at any time i found a shop and within half an hour i had a new phone one that no one could know was mine but when i called annies number there was only a recorded message where was she chapter seventeen burstead hall oxfordshire on saturday morning i was on the m and heading towards oxford i was glad i had hired a small car it would be ideal for driving through the narrow winding country roads of north oxfordshire and it would not attract attention two hours later i was deep in the countryside northwest of oxford i stopped for lunch at a pub in burstead i was wearing casual walking clothes so it was easy to mix with the lunchtime crowd of local people hikers and tourists i didnt think it was very likely that anyone from the hall would be at the pub at lunchtime they would all be busy preparing for the meeting the village was like a picture postcard it was the sort of place tourists imagine when they think of england the cottages and houses faced the village green their gardens were full of late summer flowers giving the place a perfume like honey there was a small stream below the village it ran on through thick woods burstead hall was about a kilometre farther up the valley the same stream ran through the gardens surrounding the house that gave me an idea this would be my way in to burstead hall after lunch i parked the car outside the village and set off on foot through the woods towards the hall i recalled my commando training as i moved swiftly and silently to a point where i could look down on the hall the house was familiar to me we had all spent two weeks there after getting out of san cristobal it was a seventeenth century house with an elegant central building and two equally elegant wings forming a u shape i remembered that the central building was one large high hall used for meetings and dinners the wings contained offices and kitchens on the ground floor and bedrooms on the first floor looking down i could just see half a dozen large black cars parked in front of the house the guests had arrived now would be the time for a few short meetings there would probably be some kind of formal dinner that evening the main meeting would probably be on the sunday i walked carefully around the fence surrounding the house it was almost three metres high and impossible to climb if i cut the fence in any way the alarm would go off if that happened the guards and their dogs would come running i continued around the fence until i found what i was looking for at the place where the stream ran under the fence there was a small space it had been a hot dry summer and the stream was very low there was hardly any water under the fence i would be able to make the space big enough to creep under the fence and into the gardens without setting off the alarm it was dangerous but i didnt have any other choice i went back to the car i checked on places i could park i needed a place out of sight of the guards at the main gates then i drove into the nearby town to do some shopping i bought some rope some petrol and some small hand towels then i collected some empty bottles from the bottle bank in the supermarket car park i was almost ready by seven oclock i was back at burstead hall i left the car under the trees in the place i had identified earlier i reversed the car into the space i thought i might need to get away fast it was only metres to the gates but the car was hidden by a bend in the road i took the petrol the bottles and the towels with me to a place farther into the woods where no one could see me from the road then i made ten petrol bombs carefully filling each bottle with petrol and finishing by pushing pieces of towels into each one as a fuse i hid them under some dry leaves i carefully climbed down the steep slope to the stream bed within a few minutes i had removed enough sand and stones to widen the space under the fence flat on my stomach i crept under the fence so far so good it was beginning to get dark the security lights would go on soon so i ran quickly across the open area of grass and hid myself in some bushes near the back entrance to the south wing of the hall i was only just in time the whole of the grounds were suddenly bathed in bright light i knew that one of the guards would normally make an inspection of the grounds soon after the lights went on i watched from my hiding place sure enough a few minutes later a toughlooking guard appeared at the fence luckily he did not have a dog with him he jumped over the stream bed without noticing my entry point and continued out of sight up the slope behind the hall dinner would be at eight oclock in the main hall i timed my move for a quarter past eight by then there would be no one in the south wing i settled down in the bushes to wait chapter eighteen big fish deep waters the lights had gone on in the main hall and i could see figures moving about inside i used the side door which led into a long corridor at one end there was a door into the hall itself next to it some small stairs led to a balcony i ran quickly and silently up the stairs and crouched down in the semidarkness below me i could hear the guests talking over predinner drinks and i could just see the figures through the bars surrounding the balcony what i saw made me draw a sharp breath of surprise there were only six of them strang was easily identifiable in his elegant evening dress he was offering a glass of champagne to a bald middleaged man who i recognised as henry minelli a top presidential adviser this man was very close to the us president and spoke to him daily next to him was the tall figure of sir clive horley private secretary to the minister for defence in the british government suddenly i recognised him as the man arguing with strang in his darkened office in berlin all those years ago why hadnt i made the connection before in a corner talking to another man who had his back turned to me i could see bob nash head of the cia but who was the other man cas was also there standing on the edge of the group that was surprising what was he doing here among these big fish one person i might have expected to see was sir george however he wasnt there maybe he was not part of this thing at all that would make sense in a way i felt more confident when i realised this he at least was clean a waiter appeared at the other door and announced that dinner was served the group moved towards the central table set with elegant silverware and crystal glasses and bowls of pink and yellow roses it was then that i got my first sight of the man who had had his back turned i could hardly believe my eyes it was holzmann holzmann the master spy holzmann the man who had been offered in exchange for peter suddenly my memory began to stir again i remembered my last conversation with kurt klassens in that dark bar in tegel something he had said about holzmann something to do with the mafia drugs the new silk road if it was drugs then it might explain why the cia was there what was the connection between that and the attempt to kill me san cristobal of course drugs from the east through germany and the old soviet empire drugs from the west through us support of dishonest and corrupt governments in latin america and where did the drugs go mainly to the usa but to europe too heroin going from east to west cocaine going in the opposite direction and top officials were fully involved in both businesses people at the top who were making a lot of money behind their respectable positions people like sir clive perhaps and they would feel terribly threatened by anyone who might have made the connection by anyone who might make their secrets public i had been in berlin at a time of opportunities and strang and his boss sir clive probably had been all too ready to take them and i had been in san cristobal too seeing the other end of things it was obvious to me now that san cristobal had been a suicidal operation we were supposed to die none of us except cas should have survived we all knew too much and now these people obviously saw me as a threat my mind was now racing i had to find bert get hold of kurt klassens again check my suspicions but first i had to try to overhear as much of their conversation as possible it wasnt easy several of them were talking at once there was a noise of plates and knives and forks all i could hear were bits and pieces of what they said what are we going to do now then how come you didnt take care of this back in bambacocha where is he now what do you mean you dont know we have to know maybe he hasnt made the connection maybe were worrying about nothing what happened to the girl we cant afford any more mistakes strang your head is on the block and so is mine if this gets out a strong voice came through the noise lets calm down gentlemen we have until tomorrow morning to work out a plan of action dont lets spoil a good dinner it was sir clive the conversation turned to other matters and i decided to leave quietly i had work to do before sunday morning chapter nineteen settling accounts i checked in to a small hotel in north oxford i badly wanted to talk to bert but i dared not risk a phone call i would have to make do with email again i went into town to find an internet cafe dear bert i need some information what do you have on sir clive horley and is kurt klassens still around how do i contact him any information on drugs traffic in berlin around the time of the wall coming down more later dan while i was waiting i tried to call annie again she was still not there i was desperate to hear from her so i sent her a long email instead i tried to offer her some comfort but it wasnt easy to do at a distance i knew that she needed more than just words on a computer screen she needed me maybe it was the first time since she was a child that she really needed me i had let her down then i could not let her down again somehow i had to get to her but first i had to deal with cas and strang i went out for a drink and a snack then i went back to the internet place again there was no message from bert i couldnt wait any longer so i returned to the hotel it was a sleepless night scenes from the past flashed through my mind voices echoed in my ear my mind boiled and bubbled with fantasies and facts i relived each of the events that might help me solve the puzzle the visit to berlin my conversation with klassens in that bar the briefing with strang the san cristobal operation cas death the murder attempt at the river in france the dinner party at the hall everything went round and round in my mind as i tossed and turned through the night and mixed up with these scenes pictures of annie as a little girl crying annie as a young woman reaching out to me from the whiteness of a hospital room i left early the next morning it was eight oclock when i reversed the car quietly into the place under the trees near the hall i packed the petrol bombs in a rucksack checked the pistol bert had found for me and set off for the stream again the place under the fence by the stream was still as i had left it it had not been discovered i crept under it quickly and crossed to my hiding place in the bushes there was no one around i entered the hall through the door to the south wing again and went up to the first floor there was no sign of life this was where the guest bedrooms were but i had no idea who was in which room then i heard footsteps coming up the stairs i hurriedly hid the rucksack behind some curtains at the top of the stairs and stood in the shadows one of the servants came up the stairs carrying a tray with breakfast on it he went along the corridor and knocked on a door a voice called out coming just a minute i recognised cas voice the door opened and the tray was taken the servant made his way back down the corridor towards my hiding place i acted without thinking when the man reached the top of the stairs i tapped him lightly on the shoulder from behind as he turned his head i hit him hard on the side of the neck he fell to the floor instantly i pulled him behind the curtains and took off the jacket of his uniform i put it on then i fitted the silencer on to my pistol and walked slowly along the corridor to the door of cas room i felt the anger in me rising like a dark tide cas had tried to have me killed strang and cas were still planning to kill me i thought of peter and how his death had destroyed the lives of bert and doris i thought of cas murder of nina she and i had only been lovers for a short time and she and heid had tried to kill me but i still felt for her she had suffered too i was furious at the deliberate evil of these two men my mind was full of one thing only revenge i wanted them to pay for what they had done to me to peter to bert to nina i knocked on the door who is it this time it was strangs voice room service we forgot your newspaper i said you get it said strangs voice cas opened the door he was wearing just a towel and his hair was still wet from the shower surprised i said i didnt give him a chance to reply i shot him in the stomach his face was frozen in shock this was not part of his plan he fell back into the room holding his stomach blood already visible through his fingers strang was sitting at the table eating his breakfast when he heard the phut of the bullet and saw cas falling backwards he jumped up upsetting his breakfast tray all over the floor i shot him in the stomach too he fell back on the bed his blood bright red against the white of the bed sheets neither man made any attempt to call out they lay crying with pain ive been waiting a long while for this i said your games are over cas made a weak attempt to get up and i shot him again in the chest then once more in the head he did not move again strang began to shake with the shock dont kill me dont kill me i can explain everything it isnt what you think i was trying to save you you know how cruel cas is i tried my best to stop him but there was another phut sound as i shot him this time in the shoulder dont bother lying to me i said but as i raised the gun to fire one last shot the telephone rang at the same time i heard a voice from the next room you ok in there fine i called but i lost my concentration for a moment and strang managed to move behind the bed my shot hit him in the knee strang would not walk without pain again but he was not dead the phone stopped ringing there was a noise from the next room again it was time to go as i reached the landing another door opened and i heard someone call out hey there whats going on you guys ok i didnt wait to reply i grabbed the rucksack took out one of the petrol bombs lit it with my lighter and threw it down the corridor towards the voice there was a blinding flash then flames quickly spread along the corridor i ran quickly down the stairs and opened the door into the main hall it was set out for the meeting i threw another petrol bomb into the room flames licked up the long curtains and the wooden walls there was confused shouting as guests tried to leave their rooms there was smoke everywhere people ran about bumping into each other looking for fire extinguishers in the confusion no one noticed me in my servants uniform jacket i threw the last petrol bomb into an office on the ground floor instantly it burst into flames i opened the back door and looked around there were no guards in sight probably they were all at the front of the hall flames were now licking all along the back of the building and black smoke was coming from the first floor windows i ran quickly across the grass and back to the stream looking back i could see the guards running towards the hall when i reached the place where i had parked the car i stopped suddenly there was another car parked right next to it an old ford i dropped to my knees and began to creep in a circle towards the car as i reached the car bert stepped out from behind a tree i think you need some help he said get in we reached the top of the road just in time three fire engines came racing along from the direction of oxford and turned into the narrow road their lights flashing and alarm bells ringing just behind them came the blue flashing lights of two police cars chapter twenty talking it over i got your email said bert i thought perhaps id better come in person because i dont think we have much time left it looks as if you needed some help anyway tell me what happened back there did someone drop a match or was someone smoking in bed he grinned i told him briefly what had happened i lost control bert i know i should have stayed cool but id bottled up all the tension and the anger it got the better of me im afraid ive made a mess of things bert nodded its a pity you didnt kill strang though he could give us a lot of trouble once they get over the confusion of the fire and when they find strang if they do theres going to be big trouble theyll be looking for you everywhere in fact i think wed better get off the m right now just in case he turned off and took minor roads towards london where are we heading bert well i think id better get you out of the country before they catch up with you were lucky its sunday so a lot of people are off work and the confusion back there will delay them for a few hours but ill feel happier if youre on the other side of the channel before tomorrow my brotherinlaw jeff has got a small sailing boat down at whitstable on the coast he often sails across to france im going to ask him to take you over with him he pulled in at a petrol station filled up with petrol and then went to a pay phone five minutes later he was back good jeff will take you to france hes retired you know so hes got lots of time on his hands ive told him youre running away from your wife he likes that idea jeff ran away from his own wife a long time ago hes a bit odd but hell get you there thanks bert by the way you asked for information on kurt klassens funny you should mention him again when i checked on him i discovered that he was dead he died just after your last meeting with him the petrol tank of his car exploded on the way back into berlin from tegel nasty accident wasnt it what do you make of that i guess it all adds up that conversation was more important than i thought at the time someone must have known about my meeting with klassens they obviously thought that he told me something in that bar something that he shouldnt have something dangerous for them thats why they killed him now i think i know what it was something you said to me in the pub the other night stuck in my mind you said i might know something i didnt know that i knew something crossed my mind about berlin then when i saw holzmann there in burstead hall all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fell into place listen and tell me if it makes sense when i spoke to klassens he mentioned holzmanns connections with the soviet union now holzmann knew just like we all knew that the east german government was nearly finished he wanted to get back to berlin to take advantage of the situation to make sure that the drugs business stayed in the right hands to use his connections all of that but he couldnt do that because we were holding him now supposing someone on our side wanted to use holzmann and his connections to get a share of the drugs business something klassens said made me think of this he mentioned that holzmann might have contacts in the west but he didnt say who they were did he asked bert no he didnt anyway suppose holzmann wouldnt agree and suppose this someone a senior someone in london worked out a plan to force holzmann to agree what do you mean asked bert again well first they pretend that theyre going to exchange him so they set peter up and he is offered in exchange for holzmann holzmann is delighted that hell soon be back home but then they suddenly cancel all the arrangements holzmann is told that the exchange is off unless you mean unless he agrees to give the man in london a share said bert right after a week of this he agrees to cooperate a week after that they free him and he flies back to east berlin by then its too late for peter the east germans have shot him but they dont care peter wasnt important i cant believe it i cant believe it said bert i know im sorry bert its hard to believe that one human being could just throw away another human life just like that anyway the next month the berlin wall comes down and our friends strang and the shadowy someone with holzmann are in business very profitable business the drugs business so it was all about money and peter had to die so that they could get their hands on more dirty money i know it seems so im so sorry bert after this i think our shadowy friend in london starts to get really greedy he has connections with some of the washington people who are involved with the latin ameritan drug scene just as strang is in with the former soviet mafia why not get together one of the key links is san cristobal they need to get rid of el jefe and replace him with someone who wont be an embarrassment but who will continue to play the game and so the four of us were all sent to san cristobal and by then strang was in charge of the latin american department wasnt he i wonder if the shadowy highup arranged for him to get that job it was very convenient for their plan said bert youre probably right of course our friends didnt intend that we should ever come back we were supposed to disappear all of us except cas of course because cas knew everything and strang couldnt do without him but unfortunately for our friend strang we didnt die after all we were a serious embarrassment he couldnt get rid of us because sir george knew we were back and i dont think sir george had anything to do with this so they sent us all away instead we didnt know enough to threaten our friend strang or so he thought so we were safe enough as long as we played by the rules what puzzles me is why they suddenly changed their minds why send nina and heid to kill me i hadnt made a move in five years i hadnt said or done anything to threaten them bert said nothing for a while he was biting his lip and his eyes were shining with tears my son he said my son died because of all this bert turned to dan youve done your bit tomorrow ill start to do mine ill tell everyone about the lot of them including that sir clive horley i checked on him and i think i may have the answer to your question a few weeks back there was a very difficult question in parliament during question time a member of parliament wanted to know about stories that the government had been involved in sending special forces and weapons to support revolutionary groups in san cristobal he asked if these stories were true if so who was responsible i dont know where he got his information but it sent shock waves through the government later on a government spokesman denied any involvement the name of the spokesman sir clive horley they were lucky the press didnt follow it up but this must have made our friends very nervous indeed ill bet it did i said i bet thats when they decided there were too many people alive who had information on the san cristobal operation and thats why they tried to have you killed if heid and nina had managed to kill you they would have no doubt had accidents too chapter twenty one crossing the channel whitstable is a little town on the north kent coast its still famous for its seafood especially oysters not much happens in whitstable there are a few fishing boats still and lots of sailing boats most of the people who live there are retired jeff berts brotherinlaw was one of them but he was far from ordinary unlike bert he was a big man with long dark hair tied at the back he also had a long beard and a loud cheerful voice he lived in a little cottage near the harbour where he kept his boat come on in bert nice to see you hello there you must be berts friend sorry to hear about your trouble with the wife who needs women anyway he delivered his last comment with a broad grin lets have a drink i havent seen you for ages bert hows life he pulled open a large cupboard lined with rows of bottles of all shapes and sizes whatll you have several hours later bert got up to leave youve had too much to drink you cant drive now said jeff youd better stay the night i cant leave until the early morning tide anyway well get going at five thirty with a bit of luck well be over the other side by lunchtime so lets all get a bit of sleep shall we bert you can have the spare room dan you can sleep on the sofa ill give you a call when its time to go i must just go down to the harbour and make sure everythings ok for the trip im going to enjoy this while he was out bert made a call to doris on jeffs phone he spoke little but something she told him obviously worried him she says there have been several phone calls asking for me they wouldnt say who they were i dont like the sound of it i hope all this wont get you into trouble bert dont you worry about me he said in a determined voice i know how to take care of myself the main thing is you just make sure you get clear it will be better if we dont communicate again at least for quite a long time you must have plans about where youre going but its better you dont tell me ill do what i can over here ill be visiting some newspapers as soon as i can theyll love this story and that will be the end of strang and horley ok ill say goodbye now then bert thanks for everything and take care we shook hands before sleep i tried once again to call annie still there was only the recorded message what was going on i fell asleep worrying about her all alone with her problems and about how i would get my cds back it was still dark when we left in the morning bert had set off home even earlier jeffs old boat moved out of the harbour using the engine when we were well clear of the coast we put up the sails and set off eastwards for france im going to head for dunkirk said jeff its not the nearest port but its the most convenient from here and i have a young lady friend who lives there so if you dont mind there was a good fresh wind and we were quickly sailing out of the thames estuary and into the channel soon we were crossing some of the busiest shipping lanes in the world huge container ships and oil tankers passed their engines loud above the sound of the sea in the distance i could see the ferry boats leaving dover on their way to calais it was like being on a great watery motorway it took us five hours to reach dunkirk jeff knew his way around and steered his boat into a vacant place in the marina the marina was half empty winter was approaching and a lot of boats had already been pulled out of the water for repainting and repairs you just stay here out of sight for a bit ok said jeff he went off towards the harbour buildings to pay the harbour fees he came back twenty minutes later i think maybe ill say goodbye now he said with a grin ive got some business to attend to if you see what i mean i mustnt keep the lady waiting i thanked him and quickly made my way out of the marina gates i hurried into town and found a quiet restaurant where i could stay off the streets for a time chapter twenty two driving south after lunch i rented a car and drove off towards the south east bert had said that i must have plans but in fact i had no real idea of what to do next i knew that somehow i had to get the cds back from sauvelagarde once i had them i would feel safer if necessary i could use them as an insurance policy to threaten the people who were after me they would do almost anything to stop berts accusations from being supported by evidence but where would i go where would i hide and now there was the added complication of annie i knew that any plans i made must include her i couldnt just leave her again i needed somewhere quiet to work things out properly before i made my move to get back the cds i thought about what to do as i drove across flanders flanders is flat flanders is dull the sky seems to weigh down on the earth like a big grey blanket flanders is history millions of young men died here and there are many first world war graves all over the countryside flanders itself is also dying its factories are closed down its workers unemployed it is a depressed and depressing region as i drove across it i became more and more worried about the future my future and annies future but as i got farther south the countryside slowly started to develop into small hills and valleys and there were no more dead industries just farms and fields green fields full of fat happylooking cows and great forests my mood began to improve when evening came i stopped in a small town and took a room in a hotel overlooking a river i suddenly felt tired after dinner i went straight to my room and fell into a deep sleep late the next morning i called annies number again this time she answered it was a tired lifeless voice hello dad thanks for your emails where have you been annie i was worried about you ive been phoning you but all i got was the recorded message whats going on i was so upset i didnt notice the phone was off i could hear her crying quietly annie im so sorry how are you managing what can i do dont worry dad oh dad why does it have to be like this i cant stand it theres no one here i can talk to now luciens gone listen annie i have to see you you cant stay there alone we have to meet where are you dad never mind about that ill call you again tonight ok i need to make some arrangements please dont worry everything is going to be all right again ill take care of you from now on i spent most of the day on the outside terrace of the hotel looking at the river and thinking about what to do next this was perhaps the only time i had really sat down to think about my life since i was a teenager i realised that everything i had done was a lie i had spent my life pretending to be someone i was not pretending to have feelings i did not have pretending to believe things i did not really believe my whole life had been built around pretending around lying people i had created a web of lies around myself so that no one could see who i really was but worse that web was now so thick and tight that i could not get out of it i realised that lying to yourself is much worse than lying to other people but why i thought back as far as i could it probably all began with my parents death in that terrible car accident i was only seven years old i had pretended to myself that they were still alive for months i would talk to them in bed at night pretending they were downstairs in my aunts house pretending that i would see them the next morning that i only had to call them and they would come and in the daytime i would pretend to be brave pretend that i could live without my parents that i did not need them pretend that i wasnt crying and i pretended to like living with my aunt and her stupid husband uncle len i pretended to like playing cricket with him and going on those long boring sunday afternoon walks and so it went on through my years at school and university i was always pretending to be someone else it was hardly surprising that i had become a spy it was the perfect job for a professional pretender i was paid for something which came naturally to me it was never any effort for me to pretend to be a diplomat a businessman even a university professor after i met francoise my wife it was easy to pretend to love her to give her all the things that were expected of a husband and with a daughter annie it was easy to play the role of the loving father i would sometimes stand outside myself and think how well i was playing the part and all the time that i was lying to them i was also lying to myself was i still pretending now was my concern for annie a pretence too i hoped it was not i had to untangle the web of lies my life had become it would not be easy annie was my last chance to change the pattern of my life to discover who i really was i called annie that evening we arranged to meet at the railway station in marseille in three days time chapter twenty three a new life i had plenty of time to reach marseille so i drove slowly taking minor roads all the way it was also safer like that in case someone was following me but i did not notice anyone in the small hotels where i stopped there was never anyone acting strangely or asking too many questions i began to feel more relaxed at lunchtime on the third day i stood at st charles station in marseille waiting for the toulouse train to arrive i felt happy and optimistic everything would be all right things would work out i would take annie away to a place where we would both be safe a new life was possible yes it was as annie walked towards me i could see that she was tired her face was pale and had a lifeless expression i took her case and we walked slowly to the car park she had very little to say she seemed locked inside herself i tried to comfort her but it was no good when we got into the car she began to cry tears running down her cheeks she still said nothing my optimistic feelings started to disappear i decided to drive to aixenprovence and spend the night there in the morning we would start our journey back to sauvelagarde we had a quiet supper annie still said very little and ate less i was beginning to feel seriously worried about her we went to bed early the next day she seemed better she even managed a smile at breakfast we went for a walk in the town and i talked to her about my plans i told her that i would have to return to sauvelagarde to get the cds after that we would decide on a safe place for us to live a place where she could have her baby where a new life could begin the next day we left and headed west we drove slowly and stopped to walk or visit places every day i wanted to give her time to get used to me again and every day i felt closer to my daughter it was as if i had never really known her before i told her about my earlier life about my adventures as a spy about my failures my mistakes all the things i wished id done differently i even told her about ninas murder in london and about the fire and shootings at burstead hall i told her about bert and about peter and the whole berlin story i told her about the crimes of strang and sir clive she told me about her life after i had disappeared in san cristobal though i had seen her a few times shed always kept her life to herself she had met lucien at the university in toulouse he was planning to be an engineer they had lived together for six months she told me about their final argument and her anger when he left her i could hardly believe that my little girl had been through all this pain and suffering she was now a grown woman certainly no longer a little girl there were times when she went completely silent and others where she would suddenly burst into tears i had never been much good at giving comfort to people i never knew what to say i tried to tell her about how i had felt when her mother and i had split up i told her that things would get better as time passed but i knew even as i spoke the words that some things never get better sometimes she would explode in anger at what lucien had done to her why me its so unfair i loved him more than anyone why has he done this to me i wanted his child i wanted us to be together now what do i do for the rest of my life without him dont you understand i tried again to calm her down but it was no use her anger would eventually die down when she was calmer i would try to reason with her annie im sorry about lucien maybe its better like this better that you should see him for what he is now not in ten years time we talked about what to do next i had definitely decided that after i had got the cds we would leave france for good i would leave first to find a safe place to live she would leave later to join me she seemed to accept this idea a week after we left aixenprovence we were only about twenty kilometres from sauvelagarde almost back where i had started just a few weeks earlier we stopped at a small restaurant on the river it was a sunny late autumn day and we ate lunch on the terrace overlooking the bridge across the river the leaves on the trees were starting to turn yellow autumn was coming we were the only customers we started to talk about the cds i knew i had to get them soon wont they be watching the house said annie not necessarily i dont think weve been followed and no one will expect me to go back there its the last place id go if i had any sense after all they dont know i left the cds there but ill be careful so how do you plan to get into the house without being seen asked annie ill drive to a place above the village its a ruined farmhouse called le puech i can hide the car there theres a steep path down through the woods no one uses it especially at this time of the year ill go down and look around to see if there are any signs of unusual activity or any strangers about most of the holiday people have gone home there are only three houses that are occupied all year round so its easy to notice anything unusual going on ill drive up there tomorrow afternoon ill wait till its dark then ill go down to the house if im careful no one will see me i want to say goodbye to the house too ill never be able to come back but what about me cant i help you asked annie no annie its better if you stay here i shant stay there long ill be back the same evening i dont want to be here on my own she said id feel better if i was with you you might need me sorry annie i said no and i mean it we went for a walk in the woods that afternoon i felt closer to annie than ever my optimism had come back i felt sure things were going to be all right that evening we were again the only guests for dinner its so nice to be eating together again i said yes dad but it could be the last time i suppose what do you mean the last this is the start annie our new start maybe she replied but what if something goes wrong tomorrow nothing will go wrong dont be silly i told her but apart from that ive been thinking dad what about look dad its difficult for me to explain youve been great to me these last few days i feel as if ive got to know you properly for the first time but but but what well i dont think that i can go along with your plan youve made up your mind to go off and find somewhere safe for us both to live its what youve decided is best for both of us but i dont want to go anywhere else i live here im french now i love toulouse i dont want to go and live on an island or wherever i want to go on living here and i havent got over lucien yet either i need time to get used to living without him and i know that the best place to do that is toulouse thats where i live where i feel at home im sorry dad but i cant do what you want we are two different people now im not your little girl any more i love you and i know you love me too but that doesnt mean we have to live together i need my own space dad but youll be in danger annie i dont think so dad i dont know anything worth knowing theyll soon find that out and i wont know where you are because you mustnt tell me but annie this was our chance everything will work out believe me its the only way we can be together dad im sorry you mean that it was your last chance its not mine you mustnt try to live my life for me and you can be sure that things will change for you too what you have been planning in your mind is just a dream i know it hurts you now but believe me it wouldnt work and what about my child do you think i want to have to move every time you think we are being followed and you know they will never stop looking for you dont you but how will you manage annie i mean dad i managed before remember before you decided to become the worlds greatest father dont worry about me worry about yourself find yourself a safe place to live then maybe we can think about how to meet again we argued backwards and forwards for the whole evening nothing i said could make her change her mind it was late when we went to bed i slept badly i got up at four oclock and decided to go to the house straight away before it got light i dressed quickly and left the hotel quietly it was five oclock when i drove into the farmyard at le puech the windows of the farmhouse were broken and the farmyard was overgrown with weeds and tall grass it was still dark the path from the farm ran down steeply through the trees and bushes towards the village it was a rocky path formerly used by shepherds to bring the sheep down from the high fields to the village now it was unused and overgrown with bushes i slowly made my way down the path taking care not to make a noise every few minutes i stopped to listen there was nothing just the wind in the leaves and the sound of the river far below just before the village i stopped at a place overlooking the square the village was in darkness no one was around i went down the path to the edge of the village and took one of the old roads towards my own house there was still no sign of anything unusual from the cover of some bushes i could now see the dark shape of my own house i made my way to the door of the tunnel under the road opened it and went in the house was just as i had left it i went up into the kitchen and opened the table drawer the brown envelope with the cds was there i put it carefully away in my rucksack and went back down to the tunnel and out of the house my mind was still upsidedown from the argument with annie i wanted to think clearly to find a solution that she could accept to find the right words to make her change her mind i decided to take a quick walk down to the river it would help to clear my head there was no danger now i had seen no one it would be my last chance to see the river i love so much i would never come back here i walked quickly down the path towards the river it was beginning to get light the grey light that comes just before dawn an underground station in london it is the evening rush hour at a busy london underground station the name of the station on the wall is liverpool street on the central line the platform is very crowded people push against each other as they prepare to get on the overcrowded tube halfway down the platform a man in a grey suit is looking nervously about him he is holding an old black briefcase and a newspaper a train comes into the station suddenly there is a lot of shouting and a woman screams something has happened someone has fallen in front of the train the man in the grey suit is dead he must have lost his balance on the crowded platform it seems to be an awful accident the valley it is early morning in october the scene is a valley in southwestern france the river runs slowly between steep wooded slopes a man is sitting on a flat rock by a river mist is rising from the river and fills the valley autumn leaves float on the surface of the river it is quiet there is only the noise of the water running by the mill lower down the man is deep in thought he sits absolutely still like a stone statue another man dressed in black is watching him from the woods above the river he raises a rifle and takes careful aim he pulls the trigger slowly deliberately the man on the rock suddenly falls forward into the river he floats face down in the water the slow current of the river carries away a steady flow of blood from a wound in his head another man appears he walks forward and watches the body slowly float away the man with the rifle joins him then they both walk away into the mist a few minutes later the sound of a powerful motorbike echoes along the valley a drug overdose at headquarters an elegantlydressed man is sitting at a large desk in an office overlooking the river thames it is late afternoon outside the november rain is falling on his desk there is an evening newspaper with large headlines the man picks up a pen and writes a short note when he has finished he gets up with great difficulty he uses two walking sticks to help him walk to the window he stands for a moment taking a last look at the river below then he closes the blinds he goes back to sit at the desk opens a bottle of pills pours them into his hand and swallows them all with a glass of water within minutes his head drops forward on to the desk he does not move his head partly covers the newspaper headline mi chief accused the end
