jack du brul the medusa stone cape kennedy florida october seated on his back for the last three hours and strapped to four and a half million pounds of explosives air force captain len cullins listened impatiently to the monotonous drone of the launch director he assumed the lack of emotion was meant to reassure the flight crew but he found the voice irritating beyond reason with his first launch only two minutes away cullins still had time to fantasize about reaching through the radio link and strangling the director in his airconditioned control center several miles away the thought made him smile behind the dome of his helmets face shield atlantis this is control htwo tank pressurization okay you are go for launch over roger ground we are go for launch out cullins intoned by rote the seconds dripped by ground control and cullins speaking in a prescripted speech devoid of any of the drama for what was about to take place outside the orbiters heatresistant windows the deep black of the night shrouded eastern florida the stars beckoned and cullins knew in a few minutes he would reach them light this candle for christs sake he muttered atlantis you are on your onboard computers over roger when ground finally reached the critical final seconds of the countdown cullins could no longer hear the throb of the auxiliary power units or the fans and motors that hummed in the cabin to him all was silent in those last moments five four we have main engine start within a third of a second the orbiters main engines were pouring out a million pounds of thrust whitehot exhaust searing the metal launch platform of pad a however all of this power did nothing except sway the atlantis slightly forward on its mounts what astronauts called twang from the pilots seat cullins could not yet see the light from the controlled detonation of the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel but the noise generated by the combustion shook atlantis violently for a brief instant he wondered just what the hell he had gotten himself into three two one just as the spacecraft righted itself from its expected wobble the solid rocket boosters ignited each of them putting out more than double the power of the orbiters internal motors it was as if len cullins and the other three men of the shuttles crew had been collectively slammed against a wall at the moment of ignition thousands of gallons of water were dumped under the multiple exhaust nozzles in an effort to reduce the deadly vibrations caused by the roar of her throaty power plants the water turned to billowing clouds of steam that reflected the fiery yellow exhaust and we have liftoff no shit in five seconds the shuttle cleared the tower and it was as if dawn had come to the florida coast long before sunrise the shuttle rose up and out of the mangrove swamps on a flaming trail of plasma that slashed the night like a knife stroke chemical energy becoming kinetic so quickly that forty seconds after liftoff the sound barrier was broken and then broken again only a few moments later in two minutes as the solid rocket boosters belched the last of their fuel the orbiter was traveling four and a half times the speed of sound and was already twentyeight miles above the earth while the onboard computers manipulated fuel flow into the atlantis internal engines to keep gforces below three times normal len cullins felt as if his body was being smeared into the contoured seat training had prepared him for this but he still couldnt believe the feeling so simple a matter as lifting a gloved hand from the armrest took nearly all of his strength atlantis we have srb separation roger what a sight cullins exclaimed the twin boosters attached to the bulbous external tank blew away from the orbiter like catherine wheels the last of their fuel spinning them in blazing arcs of fire and hot gas and still the orbiter climbed accelerating the entire time past mach ten like a mile marker on an empty interstate at an altitude of sixtytwo miles the crew was treated to the sun rising over the diminishing horizon even as they gasped like primitives at the reassuring sight the atlantis powered out of the atmosphere to the realm where the earth was little more than a painted backdrop stripped of its warmth and beauty by the frigid vacuum of space atlantis ground you are negative return do you copy negative return meant that the orbiter was too high and too far downrange to land at their emergency fields in north africa or europe either atlantis made it into space or died trying roger ground cullins replied to houston control which had taken over the flight from cape kennedy as soon as the craft had cleared the launch tower ground control for americas space program was located in texas because of lyndon johnsons machinations during the programs infancy a legacy that had since cost the agency millions in redundancies eight minutes after the first rumble of the orbiters main engines they sucked the last of the fuel from the external tank and suddenly a profound silence rushed in on the crew it was at that exact moment when the thrust of the engines died and his arms lifted off his chair to float like swaying kelp in a tidal pool that cullins realized he had slipped earths bounds hed also done something every person in the world envied hed obtained a childhood dream atlantis ground go for et separation roger external tank separation now explosive bolts shoved the huge tank from the orbiter and it began its long tumble back into the atmosphere where it would harmlessly burn up gravity may be a law dale markham the payload specialist seated behind cullins joked but newtonian mechanics is one hell of a get out of jail free card two hours after reaching orbit with the payload bay doors open to vent excess heat the crew got down to their primary mission task they were already feeling the debilitating effects of zero gravity and by tomorrow the crew would be about worthless therefore nasa had scheduled a payload launch as soon as the shuttle had reached a stable orbit miles above the planet len cullins and the other three men were still running on the adrenaline from the launch yet nausea was becoming more than a nuisance and would soon impair them all videos and practice aboard nasas converted boeing vomit comet could not prepare them for what it truly felt like to be in perpetual free fall sitting grimfaced in the pilots chair cullins promised himself that he would not be the first to throw up the steak and egg breakfast prepared for them in florida atlantis ground prepare for transfer to vandenberg for payload deployment vandenberg airforce base in california was in charge of the satellite in the shuttles cargo bay and its safe deployment was the principal mission for the shuttles launch despite nasas official press release about a communications satellite roger cullins said and swallowed quickly his stomach roiling just a few inches below his throat his salivary glands on overdrive vandenberg go ahead this is atlantis atlantis this is vandenberg we show green across the board for payload deployment roger vandenberg we are go for payload deployment deployment is eighteen minutes cullins knew the window for launching the satellite from the cargo bay was very narrow due to the birds particular mission he switched to the internal radio net dale youve got eighteen minutes how you doing back there breakfast wasnt nearly as good coming up as it was going down but im about ready markham replied markham and the other payload specialist nick fielding were standing at the aft crew station and until the satellite was safely away from the orbiter total control of the shuttle had been turned over to them fielding would work the orbiter rotational controller that affected atlantis pitch yaw and roll while markhams specialty was the canadianbuilt manipulator arm theirs was an exacting task due to the delicacy of the orbiter and payload and the effects of microgravity both men had heard the rumor that the defense department satellite codenamed medusa had cost two and a quarter billion dollars and now its safety was their responsibility screw up this one dale and well never see a tax refund check again fielding quipped as he used the joystick controller to lift the manipulator arm out of its storage rack atlantis this is vandenberg ground track has you nearing position payload release in eleven minutes roger that ground eleven minutes markham replied he felt as though he was about to be sick again you okay dale never better markham belched wetly whats our attitude were on the marks nose down at degrees fielding said i still dont like this the original mission planned for a full day of systems checks and practice with the manipulator arm before deploying the payload we would have had it if the launch had gone off as planned yesterday blame mother nature for a windstorm not the air force for bending their rules markham replied besides i dont mind saying ill be relieved when this thing is out of the cargo bay have you heard what it can do stow it gentlemen and get on with the task at hand a gruff voice came from behind them colonel mike duke wayne was the shuttle commander and had the ultimate responsibility for this flight unlike the rest of the crew the bristlehaired colonel had been in space before on an early mission aboard challenger also run by the air force in coordination with the national security agency watching a video monitor and occasionally peering through the window markham twisted the manipulator arm until it had grasped the medusa satellites grapple all the while aware of waynes steady gaze looking out over the cargo bay the shuttles vertical stabilizer was just a thin white line against the blackness of deep space four minutes lieutenant markham wayne said roger markham replied without taking his eyes off the video feed from the manipulators elbow camera showing the satellites orientation within the sixtyfoot cargo bay until the medusa was deployed and its solar panels and transceiver dish extended it resembled a large dark ice cream cone even with the cargo bay floodlights at full power the satellites skin appeared to be a darker shade of black than the space beyond its radarabsorbing material seeming to consume light like a manmade black hole the tip of the one visible sensor looked like the barrel of a largecaliber cannon but was composed of intricately woven wires of what appeared to be gold working the joystick like a surgeon markham lifted the medusa out of its cradle on land the manipulator arm had less strength than an average man but in the void it could easily handle the eleventon satellite like the appendage of some monstrous insect the fiftyfoot arm eased the satellite upward so it hung suspended over the floor of the cargo bay markham sucked in a breath in an effort to calm his churning stomach a slight twitch on the controller could slam the medusa against the side of the shuttle or launch it on an unstable orbit and he was about to be sick he safed the arm by locking it into position reached for a motion sickness bag and vomited ive got the medusa launch nick fielding said quickly taking over markham smiled a weak thanks his deep florida tan faded to a sickly shade of green as soon as he floated away from the aft crew station colonel wayne stepped onto the variableheight work platform situated before the manipulator arm controls vandenberg control this is atlantis we are prepared for payload separation on your mark attitude match confirmed waynes brusque competence was like a steadying hand to fielding who didnt particularly want the responsibility of the launch atlantis this is general kolwicki is that you duke affirmative sir atlantis standing by for countdown were all ready for our vacation normally nasas tight budget called for orbiter crews to carry out scientific experiments after completing their primary mission objectives in order to maximize time in space and justify the staggering cost of launching a shuttle into orbit however the launching of the medusa was deemed so critical that for the four days the shuttle was to remain in orbit the crewmen were nothing more than sightseers free to use their time as they saw fit nasa had insisted that the crew remain in orbit for the extra days in order to perpetuate the deception about this military flight atlantis this is vandenberg control one minute from my mark for payload release mark markham fielding and cullins might have heard rumors about the medusa but only wayne knew its true capabilities medusa wasnt just the single satellite in the cargo bay it was an entire system five platforms in total four of them already in orbit and bearing down on the atlantis the final component the satellite they were about to launch was the crux of the system and had cost almost half of the billion budget designed to be the eyes of president reagans strategic defense initiative the medusa was unlike any spy satellite ever built military planners knew that soviet doctrine called for several silos and hardened bunkers for each of their nucleartipped intercontinental ballistic missiles they could use these sites at random secretly moving the missiles on trucks in an attempt to foil american targeting thus a russian launch could come from any number of places many of them unknown or untargeted it was a horrifying version of a card shuffle even with an unlimited budget the pentagon could not build enough laser defenses to cover all possible soviet and eastern european targets in order for star wars to be successful the us needed to pinpoint the actual silos and bunkers where the rockets were housed at the time of launch this way if a launch ever occurred the spacebased lasers would already be locked on at the moment of liftoff and not waste precious seconds trying to acquire their target to accomplish this the pentagon needed a new type of spy satellite that could look down from space and see through the rock and concrete and steel shelters and reveal russias most closely guarded secrets medusa worked like a groundpenetrating sonar but employed charged subatomic particles rather than sound waves the four receiver satellites that were currently orbiting in a diamond formation were poised to receive bounceback information from the principle positron gun mounted on the abouttobereleased medusa much of the science behind medusa was beyond waynes understanding he did know the medusa mounted a plutonium reactor to create and fire the positrons and utilized the theorem of electromagnetic repulsion to receive the rebounded particles for collection by the other satellites in computer modeling medusa could accurately detect a hardened missile silo tell if it was currently storing an icbm pinpoint its command bunker and support tunnels and even discover the underground piping conduits for power cables and dedicated communications lines medusa could see through the oceans as if they were glass and find nuclear submarines no matter how deeply or silently they were running it was so precise that a detailed map of a mine field could be produced after just a few sweeps beamed to a command post in real time and give the exact position of every buried enemy explosive atlantis this is vandenberg targets now four miles distant closing at eight miles per minute they are two thousand feet above your orbit roger ground fifteen seconds colonel waynes eyes locked on the digital counter his finger poised on the release trigger because of the shuttles attitude the four receiver satellites were approaching atlantis belly sliding by at a slightly quicker relative speed the crew would not be able to see them until they had passed appearing above the shuttles tail on their silent journey atlantis stand by for payload separation in three two one mark wayne jerked the trigger on the control stick at the same time nick fielding activated the maneuvering thrusters to ease the shuttle lower in orbit to avoid colliding with the satellite even as wayne was stowing the manipulator arm the computers on board the medusa woke to the commands of ground control like an umbrella the satellite began to open solarcollection panels extending that would charge the crafts internal systems and help in its attitude and orbital changes the energy output of the plutonium reactor only powered the positron wave gun moving the satellite around the planet was accomplished with a solarchemical rocket that would need fuel replenishment every one to three years watching through a video screen wayne and fielding stared in awe as the medusa grew in size panels built to exacting tolerances telescoping and unfolding like japanese origami in moments the ice cream cone shape had transformed into a cruel phantom that was stooped over the earth like vengeful gargoyle medusa looked like death if armageddons messenger had been fashioned by man here come the four horsemen fielding muttered the four receiver satellites appeared over the shuttles tail faint glimmers against the star field just as they came into view the medusa received a command from vandenberg and a thin wisp of expended fuel pulsed from one of its jets it accelerated away to join the others len cullins had come to the aft flight deck and looked over fieldings shoulder makes you wonder what we could accomplish if we spent our time creating rather than destroying huh wayne looked at him sharply you even think that way again ill have you courtmartialed what the hell was that alarm piqued nick fieldings voice he was staring out the window angling his body so he could track the hurtling satellites what wayne asked turning away from cullins i saw a flash right behind the receiver birds like the sun reflecting off something metallic you sure yes sir it was only for a second and theyre getting too far away to see clearly but i definitely saw something wayne opened a channel to vandenberg ground control this is atlantis we have a visual of debris behind medusa can you confirm it appeared to be in dangerous proximity roger that atlantis the ground controller could not mask the anxiety in his voice we just got a flash warning from us space command at colorado springs theyre bumping up the power to their radar station at cavalier air station in north dakota but preliminary telemetry puts it on a collision course stand by what was it nick cullins asked i dont know it didnt look big but theres no way to really tell atlantis standing by wayne said to vandenberg control several seconds ticked by only the sound of the shuttles machinery and the low moans from dale markham punctuated the silence vandenberg control to atlantis duke this is general kolwicki we want you to change attitude and increase the speed of your orbit to give us a visual assessment of whats happening whatevers behind the medusa is so small we cant get an accurate fix yes general changing attitude now wayne nodded to fielding who had moved back to his station at the reaction control system using small bursts of gas the shuttle swung degrees until it was in a headdown position facing the fleeing medusa atlantis ground track shows you gaining on medusa at fifty feet per minute please increase orbital speed distance to medusa one thousand yards roger ground while wayne and fielding remained at the aft crew station len cullins ducked back to the cockpit to look through the main view windows as they hunted down the unidentified object dogging their five birds he slid into his molded seat and stared into the emptiness trying to catch a glimpse of whatever fielding had seen he could hear wayne speaking with general kolwicki the head of americas space command through the communications net range five hundred yards whatevers chasing our birds will overtake in fifteen seconds cullins began counting backward in his mind at eight seconds he could see the five satellites glimmering just above earths hazy blue horizon they looked like golden fireflies at this distance their details lost in the planets reflective glow at four seconds he could see them more clearly the central bodies of the receiver platforms with their spiderweb collection dishes spread wide at two seconds he saw a dull silver flash behind one of the receiver satellites so brief that had he not anticipated it he would have thought it a chimera ground control called out now and a magnetic torque wrench lost during a gemini space walk twentyfive years earlier one of a hundred thousand pieces of space junk passed through the collection dish of one of the satellites latched on to a steel casing panel and unbalanced the entire unit the violence of the impact was lost in the void because there was no sound but it hit with the force of a bullet and the receiver satellite began to tumble as a horrified cullins watched it flipped three times before slamming into the main satellite oh shit were going to lose it cullins heard the unperterbable general kolwicki shout thats affirmative general cullins said as he watched medusa start falling toward earth two hundred and sixty miles below the atlantis general reginald kolwicki watched americas most expensive military accident unfold in just three and a half minutes medusa went from crowning achievement to unrecoverable debacle telemetry from the positron gun platform confirmed that the satellite was in a degrading orbit and that it would not respond to ground commands to fire its maneuvering rockets it was falling and there was nothing the forty assembled men and women in the control room could do to prevent it try the autonomous flight program kolwicki said to a computer technician whod been typing furiously trying to regain control of medusa no response sir the central processor is offline are you getting anything from the damned thing positron gun is on standby and all encryption routines are nominal great medusa is about to burn up in the atmosphere but it wants to still take pictures and keep the data a secret kolwicki growled at the irony how much longer medusa will enter the atmosphere in twentyfive seconds total loss in thirty seconds at the most shit a career military man who saw his career burning up in outer space kolwicki had no options whats the birds position over north africa tracking southeast itll burn up above the indian ocean might as well turn on the positron gun as she goes down maybe well gain something from this snafu kolwicki felt like a ships captain knowing his command was going under and still ordering full steam ahead sir just do it he snapped fingers flying in a blur the tech snapped off several commands the plutonium reactor keyed up beaming supercharged positrons back to earth in a swath that cut across northern africa from chad across sudan and ethiopia and finally to djibouti and somalia in all it took pictures of two thousand square miles but its data was incomplete several passes over the same area would be necessary to gather enough information to allow analysis of the subsurface topography it was only after the satellite began entering the atmosphere and the frictioninduced heat climbed dangerously that medusa shut down in an automatic safety mode to prevent a radioactive accident in greek mythology medusa was a witch whose stare could turn men into stone as medusa fell from space and was enveloped in a white hot fireball of its own immolation the satellite studied the barren african wasteland buried under tons of rock and stone it saw something that man had hidden more than two thousand years ago in the hope that it would never be allowed to escape like its ancient namesake medusas glance would bring death northern eritrea january of this year jakob steiner was beyond caring that he was about to die death would be a welcome release from the torture of the past hour his body was so racked with pain and the effects of dehydration that his will to live had evaporated as quickly as the sweat that had once poured freely from his skin he had stopped sweating soon after his tormentors took up the chase pushing him hard across the arid landscape his khaki bush shirt and pants had once been wet with perspiration but now showed only white circles of dried salt under his arms and at his groin at first hed thought he was outpacing the shifta bandits as they dogged him across the rocky desert but quickly he realized that his initial burst of speed could not compete with the machinelike endurance of the terrorists theyd managed to catch him easily and now lagged only a few paces behind he could hear their boots on the loose soil smell their unwashed bodies over his own stench they were toying with him they could have killed him earlier with a shot from the aks all four carried yet like a pack of hunting dogs they chased him hounding him with occasional shouts pushing him beyond his own level of endurance so he ran on pure instinct fight or flight an hour had passed an hour of unrelenting fear and steiner was reaching the point where he could not continue when fight became a better option than flight steiner hadnt had a drink of water since just before returning to his camp following another unsuccessful foray into one of the hundreds of box canyons in this part of the country zarai his native guide had remained in the spartan camp as ordered whenever the scientist went exploring steiner gave no reason to the eritrean and custom demanded that zarai not ask this morning marked the eighth day the two men had spent in the desolate region a barren section of eritreas lowlands consisting of jagged ridges and mountains too steep and dry to be inhabited because there was nothing in these formidable canyons and plateaus to attract the agrarian eritreans the duo were almost certain to be the first explorers in the region since the italian occupation prior to the second world war steiner had come into the camp shortly before eleven a shrieking wind had picked up throwing grit in his eyes and clogging his nose and mouth so hed walked the last few miles with a bandanna tied around his face and his expedition hat pulled low he could hear the nylon of his and zarais two tents snapping like the sails of a racing yacht for the first time since jakob had begun his explorations zarai was not waiting for him in his usual position hunkered over the low smokeless fire he used to brew endless cups of tea in fact the fire had been kicked out the circle of stones ringing the pit was scattered across the space between the two tents and zarais treasured teakettle lay haphazardly on the smooth sand steiner was too tired to sense any danger until he was pulling off his boots on the camp stool in front of his tent it was the smell that drew his attention first the fine hairs on the back of his hands rose he could feel the premonition of danger like a thousand centipedes marching up his arms to his chest jakob stood his filthy sweatsmeared socks whispering on the sand as he spun in place sensing that he was being watched without warning zarai came flying through jakobs tent propelled by some unseen force steiner staggered back tripping over his own feet so that he fell heavily his eyes unable to tear away from the sight of his guide dying just a pace away zarais face was covered with blood that had leaked from the sockets where his eyes had been fat black flies buzzed quickly back to their sanguinous meal blanketing his head only seconds after his body came to rest zarai moaned weakly brushing his curled hand along the sand in an effort to reach his mutilated face jakob screamed a highpitched keen not unlike a young girls his stomach turning to oil he crabbed across the ground in an effort to distance himself from his companions pitiable figure zarai clawed weakly at the ground again and went still his last gasp no more than a whisper in the wind then four greyhoundthin men came into the camp they were dressed in stained and dusty uniforms the camouflage pattern all but washed out the cuffs collars and countless pockets showing frayed edges while the clothing they wore was tattered all four were in the prime of their lives which for this part of africa meant early twenties their matching soviet assault rifles looked well cared for and greased the young men stood arrogantly flat dark eyes regarding the cowering steiner with contempt unlike zarai who had lighter skin and arab features a reminder of eritreas long association with the middle east these men were so black their skin had almost a blue tinge their features were classical negroid high foreheads thickened lips and wide handsome noses while steiners field of expertise was archaeology he recognized that these men were from sudan born in the ancient lands of kush steiner knew enough of modern politics to know his life could not be measured in minutes a civil war had been raging in sudan for decades fought between the northern majority of muslims against the christians from the south sudans small but appreciable animist population was caught in the middle relief agencies had been granted only sporadic entrance into the country to minister aid so estimates of those killed were unreliable but they ranged into the millions in the past few years driven by disease and malnutrition many of those fighting in the south had turned to more mercenary activitiesraiding aid shipments plundering the camps of the quartermillion eritrean refugees living in the country and staging crossborder sorties for food or medicine and more commonly now to kidnap victims to be held for ransom jakob steiner lay on the ground his socks stained the same dun color as his khaki clothes his eyes were wide and fearful as he looked at the four men towering over him four men who doubtlessly had perpetrated some of the despicable things zarai had spoken of during their nights in the camp what do you want from me he asked in german his voice made raw by thirst and fear he got no reaction from the four terrorists but noticed that one was carrying a large machete that hung from a hook on his belt zarais blood was a redblack stain on the weapons blade he repeated the question in english again the men looked at him blankly ignoring the flies that had descended on the camp like a plague two jaggedwing vultures circled high above gliding on the thermal updrafts produced by the sun hammering the desert i have nothing jakob stammered even if the men didnt understand the words they could certainly hear the pleading tone in his voice just a little food enough for another day or two and just a small amount of money i have more money in the capital asmara i could send it to you but you must let me go silence save the wind blowing across the camp i am a scientist i study ancient bones i have no powerful friends i am worth nothing to you as a hostage please let me go jakob was crying now tears running into the dust caked on his face please take anything you want but let me go do not hurt me the four sudanese did not react as his voice rose to a shrill whine then the terrorist with the machete who was a little older than the others kicked steiners boots across the few feet of open ground separating them from the austrian scientist you are a spy from america here to enslave our people the cadre leader said in english as if he had memorized the words no jakob shouted hopeful for the first time because one of the men understood him i am not from america i am austrian i come from europe i am not a spy i study old bones the bones of our ancient ancestors i am not here to steal from you you are from america you are going to die put on your boots and go we will give you a quarter of the clock dial to run and then we will hunt you down the young sudanese showed off a cheap watch slung loosely around his wrist steiner had fifteen minutes to get into his boots and run but im not from run steiner didnt even bother lacing his boots he merely slipped them on ignoring the small piles of sand that had already accumulated in the toes and began sprinting it took the terrorists only a half hour to catch their quarry but they did not move in for the kill they ran behind steiner taunting him goading him it went on like this for another hour an hour of steiner hearing his own painful breathing tearing through his chest and his sore and swollen feet tripping over the jagged ground jakob hadnt run like this in his entire life his legs were rubbery beneath him his feet slapping ineffectually against the hardpan his pudgy arms were pumping slower and slower like a machine grinding down for want of fuel the sudanese slowed to a walking pace behind the shambling austrian their breath came slow and even and only a little sweat gleaned against their skin sensing that the chase was at an end the leader came forward and smashed down on the scientists knee with the butt of his ak the joint crumbled and jakob fell to the ground rolling in a thin cloud of chalky dust settled comfortably on their haunches the sudanese ringed steiner their assault rifles held between their knees the leader lit a turkish cigarette and passed it to his men each taking a long draw before giving it to the next the cigarette made three complete circles before the leader took one last drag pinched off the burning tip to shred the remaining leaf and tucked the filter in the pocket of his uniform blouse the hunt had ended in another of the countless dry riverbeds that snaked through the lowlands the banks were not steep but still radiated the heat like mirrors blisters of sweat appeared on the mens faces and exposed arms for the first time they shuffled their feet in the flaky stones at the bottom of the wash waiting for their leader to give them the order to dispatch the interloper jakobs chest rose and fell in a rapid cadence his heart felt like it was breaking his ribs with each beat somewhere beyond his pelvis in the sea of pain that had once been his legs his shattered knee throbbed with an unholy pounding already the joint had swollen to twice its normal size each time his heart beat the sharp bone fragments ground against each other further mincing the tendons and ligaments through cracked and bleeding lips he muttered long forgotten pieces of scripture freely quoting the talmud and the old and new testaments mangling faiths in an attempt to supplicate a god any god lo i walk through the valley of the shadow of death it sounded more like poetry than prayer thou shall not kill he screamed but the sound was little more than a dry croak you are a spy for america the young terrorist leader accused again sliding closer to jakob only your death has worth to us its not true jakob steiner cried you were sent here to steal from us and we were sent to stop you oh god please i only study the past i dont care about the cadre leader a man who called himself mahdi crashed the butt of his rifle against steiners head just at the hair line the blow was not enough to kill and jakob screamed loudly curling into a ball in a purely reflexive gesture mahdi stood and swung his weapon down again missing steiners head but breaking his collarbone with the blow like jackals the others sprang on him raining blows on the defenseless scientist steiner screamed for only a few seconds before being beaten into unconsciousness soon steiner was dead but mahdi allowed his men to continue for another minute before calling an end to the assault enough he said and his men backed away from the bloody corpse strip the body and then well return to his camp to erase all evidence of his presence mahdi tossed aside his old and worn boots and replaced them with steiners before joining his troops for the run back to the base camp there were a number of items that would fetch good money on the black market in sudan and he wanted to make sure his undisciplined men did not ruin them in their frenzy of destruction arlington virginia four months later philip mercer was in the habit of waking just before dawn so he could watch the pearly light seep through the skylight above his bed these earlymorning minutes were an important time for him it was when he did his best thinking oftentimes coalescing thoughts that had come to him in his sleep the night before hed helped his friend harry white celebrate his eightieth birthday the octogenarian was sleeping off the nights excesses on a downstairs couch mercer hadnt indulged nearly as much as harry so his head felt reasonably clear but this morning his mind was troubled he wanted to stay relaxed but the muscles in his legs and back began to tense his fists tightening with unreleased energy he grunted and rolled out of bed mercer was a mining engineer and consultant who had reached the pinnacle of his profession within the hardrock mining industry his capabilities were almost legendary a recent article in a trade publication credited him with saving more than four hundred lives following mining disasters and in the next paragraph detailed the more than three billion dollars in mineral finds hed made for various mining concerns all over the globe his fees had made him a wealthy man and maybe that was part of his problem hed become too comfortable the thrill of making a new find or the adrenaline rush of delving into the earth to pull out trapped men had begun to pale since his struggle against ivan kerikov and his ecoterrorist allies in alaska last october mercer was having a hard time returning to his normal life he felt a hollowness that just wouldnt go away he wanted to believe he hadnt become addicted to that kind of mortal danger but it was difficult to convince himself pitting his reputation against the normal hazards of his career didnt seem to be enough anymore his street was lined with identical threestory townhouses close enough to the city center to be convenient but far enough away to remain quiet unlike the others mercer lived in his alone and had done extensive remodeling to turn it into his home the lions share of his income went into its mortgage the front quarter of the building was open from floor to roof with his bedroom overlooking the atrium an antique spiral staircase connected the levels he dressed quickly and spun down to retrieve the morning paper from the front step the second floor had two small guest rooms and a balconied library with a view of the tiled mezzanine it also contained what had become mercers living room a reproduction of an english gentlemans club that he and his friends affectionately called the bar it had two sectional leather couches several matching chairs a television and a large ornate mahogany bar fronted by six dark cane stools the lump under a blanket on one of the couches was harry behind the bar was a circa s locklever refrigerator and shelving for enough liquor to shame most commercial drinking establishments the automatic coffee maker on the back bar had already brewed a barely potable sludge seated with his coffee and paper mercer tried to read through the days fare the post led with another story about the fatal bombing at jerusalems western wall six weeks ago defense minister chaim levine a hardline candidate for the upcoming elections said that if he were leading the country such attacks would never happen and if they did the investigation would take days not weeks he was calling for a draconian crackdown on all palestinians and a suspension of the latest peace talks mercer read that another victim had died in the hospital bringing the death toll to one hundred and sixtyseven the destabilized middle east held his attention for only a couple of paragraphs and he slid the rest of the paper out of reach harry still snored from the couch his rattling breathing sounded like the explosive grunts of some large animal he gave a startled snort and then he was awake yawning broadly mercer smiled good morning how do you feel on the first day of the rest of your life jesus christ harry rasped what time is it mercer looked at his watch sixthirty i liked it better when you and aggie were together you never came downstairs until after nine harry immediately recognized his gaffe oh shit im sorry that was a rotten thing to say aggie johnston had been gone for four months and mercer still felt the ache of her absence she had been in alaska with him and had gone through even more than he had the relationship that followed had been rocky even at its best though she came from a wealthy family who controlled a multinational oil company she was an ardent environmentalist and the attraction she and mercer shared was not strong enough to overcome their different views of his profession he had not wanted it to end but he couldnt stand the arguments either all he remembered of the day of their breakup was walking around washington for nearly ten hours in a total fog his mind unable to accept what had happened even if the decision had been his for the first time in over a decade since the death of his fiancee tory wilkes mercer had let someone into his life only to lose her again now whenever he looked at a woman he wouldnt allow himself to feel anything he lived like a monk and the pain made it easy to ignore the sexual side of his nature on the rare occasion an attractive woman entered tinys the neighborhood bar he and harry frequented his conflicting emotions would leave him sullen and withdrawn dont worry about it mercer tried to smile harry levered himself up from the couch and took a moment to roll up his pant leg to strap on his prosthetic limb hed lost his leg so long ago his walk to the bar was natural and without any trace of a limp mercer had met harry the night he moved into the renovated townhouse he had gone to tinys as a distraction from the monotony of unpacking while harry seemed to live in the seedy establishment harry was more than twice mercers age but both enjoyed a recluses solitude and a bachelors aversion to sobriety they never analyzed the deep friendship that had grown since then but others who knew them realized that in each other they sought the family neither had childless harry needed to know that there would be someone who remembered him after he was gone mercer wanted the stabilizing force that his friend represented a responsibility and loyalty to someone other than himself in many ways one was an older version of the other yet they complemented as well harry acted as a temper to mercer and mercers vitality reminded the octogenarian what his life had once been and along the way they had learned to rely on each other an act alien to both men what had started casually had solidified into a bond stronger than any father and sons for this was an association of choice mercer made a fresh pot of coffee one not brewed to his masochistic tastes while harry smoked through his first of forty daily cigarettes harry was quieter than normal and mercer sensed something was bothering him you okay ah its nothing while time may have thinned his frame so that his hands and feet seemed oversized and folds of skin hung from his face harrys voice still grated like a rusty machine tool how long have we known each other going on seven years now why i made the mistake of watching this news show a couple days ago they had a segment about aging oh shit oh shit is right harry replied do you know that statistically ive been dead for nearly fifteen years according to the experts i have a more dangerous lifestyle than an la gang member i smoke two packs a day down a couple bottles of booze a week and the last time i got any exercise was world war two mercer grinned dont worry about it youre the other end of the spectrum thats all you make up for the healthnut wall street types who drop dead at forty when was the last time you were sick this morning hangovers dont count christ i dont know its been years so whats the problem i dont know death i guess you afraid of dying whos not i guess thats it im more afraid of living nowadays harry said through the cloud of a fresh cigarette death is starting to sound good to me mercer looked at him sharply dont you talk like that old man mercer had lost both his parents when he was still a child and while his grandparents had been wonderful surrogates they too had died while he was a freshmen at penn state death was not unknown to him hed seen it in a hundred forms but to hear harry talking about it sounding like he embraced it was chilling for mercer death was the enemy to be fought at all costs relax im not dead yet it just doesnt sound so bad anymore harry pulled himself from the sullen mood besides if i go tiny will lose his best customer if you paid your bar tab maybe i guess its just postbirthday blues harry dismissed easily so what are you up to today probably start working on my final report to yukon coal mercer replied you dont sound thrilled by the prospect you have no idea mercer breathed this is my second contract since alaska and i just cant make myself interested anymore ive changed and i dont know why yes you do you just dont want to admit it harry eyed mercer judging how much honesty his friend needed and guessed correctly that mercer wanted it all youre lonely you miss aggie but you cant go back to her i chose bachelorhood and its a lifestyle that suits me but youre different it isnt for you i stayed single because i just dont want to be bothered with the whole thing but youre single because youre scared of women mercer was surprised by harrys statement it wasnt at all what hed expected i wasnt talking about that but what in the hell do you mean im scared of women you are ever since torys death youre afraid of losing someone again so you keep people especially women at a distance when you let aggie in and your relationship ended in disaster you stopped letting yourself feel youve shut yourself off because youre afraid of being hurt again hell right now id say you are more afraid of living than i am bullshit mercer said angrily hit a nerve didnt i mercer said nothing the pain of torys death was right under the surface he could feel it now but deeper than that he felt anger anger at himself for not preventing it he had been there when she was murdered by an ira gunman and still blamed himself for not stopping it even if there had been no chance he could hey listen im sorry maybe that was out of line no it really wasnt i dont think im afraid of living but youre right i am scared of being hurt who isnt thats what it means to be human every time you let someone in you run the risk of pain i think for a long time you were willing to accept the loneliness but aggie reminded you of the actual price youve been paying you havent been yourself since you two split mercer considered harrys words ive been thinking it has to do with the danger we went through it was the excitement i was missing im sure thats part of it i never felt more alive than during the war theres nothing like being chased by a japanese sub or surviving a kamikaze attack to tell you what it means to feel do you think surviving the oil rig collapse and the tanker fire and all the other stuff in alaska opened you a little bit and aggie stepped through your armor so she caught me at a vulnerable moment no she caught you at a time when you were actually feeling for a change you arent the hardened recluse you thought you were mercer couldnt deny the charge but he wasnt ready to admit it was true either so what should i do how the hell should i know harry laughed i am the hardened recluse i think i am bastard mercer smirked for whatever its worth i think just talking like this is good for you its the first time youve ever brought it up which means youre probably ready to start dealing with it i dont have much in the way of experience to help but im here to listen harry struggled into his windbreaker why dont you work on your report and meet me at tinys around four mercer considered for a second yeah i think i need that mercer was just toweling off when the phone rang it was twenty minutes until four and thinking it was harry telling him to hurry he answered keep your dentures in ill be there in a minute dr philip mercer an unfamiliar female voice asked oops yes this is philip mercer please hold the line for undersecretary of state hyde the woman put him on hold before he could ask if hed heard right hyde came on the line an instant later dr mercer this is prescott hyde undersecretary of state for african affairs i hope im not disturbing you no sir not at all mercer replied naked and still dripping on the carpet next to his bed good good there was an element of the teddy roosevelt bluff in hydes voice a collegiate jocularity that might not have been forced but was certainly polished im surprised to find you home on a monday afternoon but sam becker said you worked strange hours while mercer did not know prescott hyde he was familiar with sam becker the head of the national security agency the two had worked together on the vulcans forge affair in hawaii mercer knew the use of beckers name was more than just namedropping in just that single sentence hyde told mercer that hed done some checking into his background and knew of his reputation mercer wanted to be incensed but he found he was more intrigued than anything else what can i do for you mr undersecretary please call me bill sam tells me people just call you mercer is that right among other things excellent good to know the boys at the nsa have their information correct hyde laughed listen mercer ill come to the point were both busy men after all it had taken only twenty seconds for mercer to dislike hyde most public officials took at least a full minute you called me he said cautiously feeling he was walking into a trap what can i do for you right to business i like that hyde said as if it was mercer who had instigated the call all right then i may have a job for you something right up your alley so to speak i didnt know the state department was into mining these days mercer tried to keep the disdain from his voice its nothing like that but it is a little hard to explain over the phone if you know what i mean hydes bonhomie was wearing on mercer fast somethings come across my desk that is tailormade for your unique talents ive asked around town and youve got yourself quite a reputation for getting tough jobs done i know all about what you did in hawaii a few years back and what happened in alaska last year while not nearly as exciting what i have represents a similar challenge just hearing the word sent a jolt through mercer what sort of challenge lets just say that you alone are qualified to possibly help millions of people if that doesnt whet your appetite nothing i say will id like to get together with you is tomorrow okay shall we say one oclock at my office i think not mercer was going to meet with hyde but in any opening negotiations with someone who wanted something it was best to quickly establish control shall we say noon at the willard hotel you can buy me lunch while we talk hyde chuckled very good sir i knew your price would be high however itll be worth it for both of us tomorrow at noon tomorrow at noon mercer agreed and hung up now what in the hell was that all about he finished dressing and left to meet harry realizing that the tension hed felt this morning was gone across town the listener waited a few seconds for both parties to clear the line then began tapping at the computer in front of him behind him his superior waited watching the screen as the listener attempted to track the signal from their bug while the living room of the college park apartment had traditional furniture the two bedrooms were unlike any other in the highrise complex a few blocks from the university of maryland the first contained desks computers and all manner of communications gear with one wall dominated by a large map of the city the other was furnished with three sets of bunk beds jammed together so closely that only a narrow walkway separated them the permanent staff who used the suite slept in shifts to minimize their conspicuousness its an unlisted number in the washington area give me a second to track it down the eavesdropper said the computer whirled frantically narrowing down through the unlisted numbers until it found the one it wanted the algorithms used for the search were the most sophisticated in the communications encryptiondecryption arena and halved the time normally needed to trace calls philip mercer the listener said to his boss ive got an address in arlington the computers about to print out a hard copy of their conversation do you have anything on him in archive the listener cleared his screen and brought up their massive database a moment later a slim dossier of philip mercer appeared the overseer a mediumbuilt man in his late thirties with black curling hair and strong dark eyes read the file as his aide scrolled through it memorizing nearly everything with just a glimpse it was a skill he had been taught not born with i have no doubt why hydes calling in this geologist the leader said then called to a man in the front room of the apartment come in here please the man wore a plain gray suit and his skin and features were so ordinary that he almost blended with the walls of the bedroom if one wasnt actually looking at him he seemed to have the ability to hide in plain sight a talent necessary for a field operative sir hyde is making another call the listener said pressing the earphones tighter to his skull the group leader led the other agent to the kitchen to give the communications officer privacy to do his job i want roundtheclock surveillance on a man named philip mercer hyde may be bringing him in and we need to know everything about him im going to get a full background check as soon as possible but i want teams in place immediately the man nodded i have a feeling that this may be the one weve been waiting for the team leader continued use as many men as necessary and for now assume mercer knows countersurveillance techniques understood anything else sir no as soon as i get anything from the background check ill let you know washington dc the willard hotel has been around for generations and has gone through numerous transformations since the time it was the home away from home for senators and representatives a time when politics wasnt a fulltime profession merely a yearly calling renowned as one of the finest establishments in the city the hotels round robin bar exuded an aura of wealth and power and privilege with subdued lighting heavy woodwork and a skilled but unobtrusive staff sipping his first vodka gimlet of the day mercer debated with himself whether he should have done a nexis background check on prescott hyde certainly the powerful news search system would contain general information on the undersecretary however he hadnt bothered he had a sneaking suspicion that this meeting was a fools errand the round robin was surprisingly busy for a tuesday he overheard two men arguing a pending house bill a few stools down on the bar and clusters of men and women were conferencing around the numerous low tables blacktied waitresses laden with trays of drinks and snacks danced around the furniture their movements appearing choreographed mercer liked to see anyone no matter who do a job well he suspected that these women were better waitresses than the people they served were public officials dr mercer the maitre d was at mercers shoulder your party is here thank you mercer glanced at his aged tag heuer watch to his surprise hyde was right on time walking behind the maitre d mercer felt his stomach suddenly knot up it was an old feeling the sixth sense that had kept him alive countless times it had saved him while working underground when millions of tons of earth were about to collapse and aboveground as well when the danger was from men not nature it was telling him that something wasnt right he spun quickly scanning the patrons in the bar nothing was out of the ordinary but there was a tingle at the base of his neck and he didnt know why he swung back and followed the retreating maitre d into the dining room the watcher was not certain if she had been seen but her orders were clear while mercers glance had passed right by her as she sat unassumingly in a corner thumbing a washington guide book she felt it wasnt worth the chance she reached into the pocket of her skirt making sure her motions were masked by the folds of her sweater and doubleclicked the microburst transmitter all of the team carried seconds later another member of their detail walked in alerted by a similar transmission from their cell leader the woman did not acknowledge her teammate she simply finished what little remained of her diet soda and signaled the waitress for her bill while no surveillance is immune from detection usually no more than ten people are needed to maintain a twentyfourhour watch on even the most paranoid target such was their interest in mercer that all twelve operatives stationed in maryland were assigned to shadow him and report on his every movement as the woman walked out of the hotel to catch a taxi she realized she hadnt been told who philip mercer was or what the interest in him could be dr mercer i presume prescott hyde laughed at his tired joke as he proffered a hand hyde was in his early fifties almost completely bald with a fleshiness that showed selfindulgence his face was dominated by a large chiseled nose that on someone else would have been distinctive but on him simply looked big his chin was soft and his cheeks were rounded giving him an open comforting quality but as mercer shook his hand he noticed that hydes eyes were hard behind goldrimmed glasses a pleasure to meet you mr undersecretary i thought we dispensed with that yesterday please its bill my middle name is william thank god i cant imagine going through life being called prescott hyde flashed another smile his teeth were perfect capped until they ordered the conversation was dominated by hyde who turned out to be a gracious host talking about the latest scandals within the halls of power with an insiders knowledge and a gossips love of speculation mercer ordered another gimlet while they waited for their food hyde drank sparkling water i wanted to make this a leisurely gettogether hyde said as their drinks were brought a sort of familiarization session because i have a feeling we will be working with each other for a while however i have a pressing appointment a little later on so i am afraid our time is short hyde seemed to talk as if his words were thought out in advance written down and practiced i understand im afraid my afternoon is rather full too paul gordon the former jockey who owned tinys ran a horseracing book in arlington with the kentucky derby only two weeks away he and mercer had some serious strategizing to do all the better then hyde leaned back in his chair tell me what you know about africa mercer chuckled to begin with i was born there in the congo my father was a mine manager and my mother was a belgian national ive been back probably twentyfive times and while i dont speak any native languages other than a bit of swahili my french is good enough to get me by where english fails if you want me to describe africas history the current political situation and economic outlook were going to be here for a while i wasnt aware that you were born there but sam becker told me that youre somewhat of an expert not really im a miner and africa happens to be where most of the action is mercer didnt tell hyde that he loved the continent despite all the cruelty pain and suffering hed witnessed there and had experienced himself he truly loved the land and its people his parents had been killed by africans in one of the many rampages but he never once blamed the people for what happened he smiled remembering the tutsi woman who had hidden him in her village for nearly six months after her parents murder when he recalled how shed died during the ethnic cleansings in rwanda in the midnineties his smile faded what do you know about eritrea hyde asked the question surprised him eritrea was a backwater even by african standards and mercer couldnt guess hydes interest located just north of the horn of africa on the red sea coast bordered by sudan ethiopia and djibouti theyve been independent from ethiopia since their struggle was a cold war battleground between the us and the soviets in terms of arms and aid currently eritrea has nothing in terms of raw materials industries or hope ive heard the people live on little more than the pride of being independent for the first time in modern history very true very true hyde nodded at mercers assessment theres a chance you can change all of that if youre interested a waiter took their lunch orders before hyde continued while most eritreans are agrarian cattle mostly there is one major urban center asmara the capital it was the only city left standing after the war the countrys in shambles per capita income hovers around one hundred and forty dollars a year still the land can support the three million people living there so starvation has yet to become a problem but there are a quarter of a million eritreans living in the sudan refugees deliberately not allowed to return because the influx of that many people would shatter the struggling economy its a sore spot for the government because they want to bring the displaced home however they refuse aid not wanting to become a debtor nation and unless some miracle economic boom takes place those people are going to rot in some of the worst refugee camps on the continent from his briefcase hyde withdrew a thick manila file folder bound with rubber bands you have to understand that what i am about to tell you is strictly confidential in fact some of this information has only recently been declassified from top secret down to eyes only hyde slid some photographs from the folder across the table pulling his hand back quickly as if the images could somehow contaminate him mercer had been to africa knew the people and was not immune to their suffering he had seen some of the worst hellholes on earth while in rwanda during their civil war he could still feel the bony limbs of children hed carried to aide stations where the struggle for food and medicine was a losing battle he had seen the ravages of diseasecholera malaria and aids he had watched human skeletons shuffle in mileslong lines escaping one war and walking into the teeth of another while these images haunted the darkest nightmares his sleep could generate they could not prepare him for the six photographs before him one showed an old man lying against a rusted drum his legs looking like gnarled twigs a feral dog chewed on one of his feet as the last of the mans blood soaked into the ground another was of a young girl her face peaceful in death while in the background uniformed men waited in line to rape her corpse another showed a childmercer couldnt tell the sexwaving at the camera with its body covered in suppurating wounds dark leaking holes in its flesh that were eating away what little starvation had left behind he didnt want to look at the other three here were images of the worst humans could do to each other and he felt the impotency hed experienced in rwanda the tides of misery were endless and no matter how much hed thrown himself at the problem it never went away he was also enraged that the photographer had stayed behind the anonymity of his camera and not stepped in to help im sorry that you had to see those before we ate hyde said but there was no apology in his voice the pictures were designed to provoke a deliberate response and mercer knew it he steeled himself for what was to come i believe we have the ability to help these people to give eritrea hope for the first time in hyde continued nasa and the us air force launched a spy satellite codenamed medusa it was meant to be the eyes of the star wars defense program but there was an accident and it crashed before completing a single orbit as it came down its cameras exposed a series of pictures because the area photographed was not deemed strategically important and because the air force hadnt been able to calibrate the satellite the photos lay forgotten for over a decade even after they were declassified no one paid any attention to them much of what they show is gibberish even to those who developed the system the clearest medusa pictures show what is now northern eritrea and eastern sudan hyde pulled more photos out of the file and placed them before mercer though familiar with satellite photography mercer had never seen pictures like these before these shots twenty in total resembled x rays it was as if he was looking inside the earth rock strata showing up in various shades of gray what he assumed to be underground water appearing as bright white rings and whorls cutting across each shot all beneath a ghost image of the surface topography these shots are of northern eritrea each one representing a deeper level below the surface as medusa went down its onboard computer followed preprogrammed instructions increasing the power to its photographic element between each picture hyde explained as mercer shuffled through the stack noting similarities between them it was like looking at a cutaway model peeling back successive layers with each photograph mercer was awed by the satellites capabilities what in the hell was this medusa it had abilities that go far beyond what you see here when i first became aware of these pictures i asked the same question the air force liaison who showed them to me equated medusa to a medical cat scanner or an mri which make oldstyle x rays seem like a throwback to the nineteenth century were talking about one of the most sophisticated machines man has ever built if it hadnt crashed medusa would have forever put the united states on the forefront of orbital surveillance and intelligence gathering fascinating mercer had no idea where hyde was heading with all of this but he couldnt help being intrigued but i dont see what this has to do with me let me show you this and see what you think hyde pulled another picture from the file mercer glanced at it quickly it looked no different from the other medusa pictures one of the scientists who built the satellite was a geology buff a rock hound is what he called himself anyway while modeling for the system he was tasked with developing computer simulations of what medusas potential would be because so much of south africas underground makeup its geology has been studied by mining companies its one of the bestcatalogued regions for what lies under the earths surface what you are seeing there is what they believed the area around kimberley south africa would look like if medusa were to use its positron camera on it mercer understood and then he saw it first known as colesberg kopje because of the small hillock on the african veldt that was nothing more than a blister on the open savanna kimberley had grown into a boom town before the turn of the twentieth century when diamonds were discovered there within a few years a city had grown up on the plain and germinated the fortunes of such notables as cecil rhodes and the debeers corporation the diamonds had long since run out at kimberley but in their wake the miners had left a milewide miledeep hole in the earth it was the mouth of what was known as a kimberlite pipe kimberlite was the name given to a diamond mines lodestone in fact mercer had a large chunk of it in his home office that acted as his good luck piece the two minerals went hand in hand much like gold and quartz the kimberlite pipes are channels to the earths heart openings where molten material including diamonds are thrust up toward the surface under tremendous pressure born in the planets liquid interior diamonds are nothing more than elemental carbon no different from coal or the graphite found in pencils except that nature spent a little more time cooking the atoms and compressing them into perfect crystals from their first discovery on the indian subcontinent mercer knew diamonds have had the power to captivate men and drive nations to war their dazzling beauty is the mirror reflection of our own greed and their purity is the foil to humanitys ugliness placing the kimberley computer projection next to one of the actual medusa pictures mercer quickly traced nearly a dozen similar features between the two rather than let his imagination run wild he studied them more closely but the truth was right there his heart raced and his fingers and palms began to sweat as excitement tore into him such a discovery was made once in a lifetime and hyde was setting it right in front of him buried in the wasteland of northern eritrea was a kimberlite pipe very much like the one discovered accidentally a century and a half ago in south africa he looked up at hyde his amazed expression verifying hydes suspicion some of our people think so too if there is a diamondbearing pipe in eritrea it could mean economic prosperity for a nation that has absolutely no other prospects mercer reined in his excitement forcing neutrality into his voice intriguing but from what i know of the region there has never been any indication of diamonds or their marker minerals in the area i cant say for certain that eritrea has been gone over with a finetoothed comb but its pretty unlikely that a find like this has gone unnoticed for the past hundred years especially since eritrea fell under british protection after world war two the brits rarely miss things like this but they didnt have medusa hyde said because medusa was destroyed before it was calibrated we have no way of knowing the depth of the pipe or exactly where it is on the map it could be anywhere between the surface and ten thousand feet underground its impossible to tell until we get a man on site stake the area out so to speak and assay it for what treasures lie hidden despite himself mercer felt drawn to the possibilities the pragmatic side of him knew the chances that what was on the picture was actually a kimberlite pipe were remote and even if it were it was likely it didnt contain diamonds many pipes had been found to be barren or its glittering cache had been washed away by erosion over the eons since the vent first reached the surface if in fact it ever had a team could spend a lifetime scouring the wilderness and never find even a trace of the pipe on the other hand you can guess why i wanted to talk with you now hyde said ive got to warn you that the best we can give you from the pictures is a twohundredsquaremile area for your search in some of the most inhospitable terrain on the planet but ive every confidence you can find the kimberlite pipe and prove whether or not there are diamonds present hyde paused while a waiter cleared their plates i also have to tell you that until independence that part of eritrea saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war and is littered with a quartermillion land mines courtesy of ethiopias soviet backers and bandits from sudan prey on the region regularly just a few months ago i got word about an austrian archaeologist who was killed butchered really very close to the epicenter of the search area is this part of your sales pitch he should have been turned away by those two admissions but mercers interest increased hed talked with harry about his need for a challenge that went beyond his normal job and hyde was laying a big one on him no hyde smiled disarmingly but i want to tell you everything i know i dont want there to be any secrets between us this mission is not without its risks and i want you to be fully apprised before you make a decision why dont you just turn this over to the eritreans mercer asked circling a finger at the waiter he didnt know if hyde was still thirsty but he wanted another gimlet good question and i can answer it very simply medusa does not nor has it ever existed mercer looked at him puzzled hyde continued while the air force may have given me these pictures theyre still considered secret it took a lot of persuasion for them to allow me to bring you into this but there was no way they would allow us to show them to a foreign power my armed forces liaison could neither verify nor deny that other satellites with similar capabilities havent been launched since medusa was lost for purposes of national security these pictures do not exist mercer waited for hyde to continue for he knew there was another motive he had lived in and around official washington long enough to know that ulterior motives were as common as tourists on the mall the other reason is strictly a policy decision from my office hyde leaned forward conspiratorially what i want to do is present the government of eritrea a fait accompli not just a suspicion of fabulous wealth but the exact location of the diamonds potential worth and proper means of extraction i understand this kind of work is your stock and trade i want you to go to eritrea find the kimberlite pipe then figure out the value of the vent and just how to get the diamonds out of the earth mercer said nothing but he was certain prescott hyde was lying to him maybe not directly but lying through omission he hadnt liked the undersecretary on the phone yesterday and he liked him even less now the man from state continued playing his final hand if youre concerned about security i can tell you that while not really sanctioned i did bring in someone from eritreas embassy here in washington i didnt go into many details merely hinting at the possibility of a tremendous mineral find testing the waters for possible opposition if we took the initiative ourselves as you can guess our plan was literally jumped on while not getting full sanction from their government ive managed to get you the next best thing hyde paused and smiled if youre willing to go that is finding the pipe if its even possible would take months thats a big chunk of time and my time doesnt come cheap im going to need to think about this awhile how about i give you an answer in a week or two something was up here hyde still wasnt telling him everything and no matter how interesting the project mercer was getting a bad feeling he saw his tablemates stricken expression is that a problem no no hyde covered its just that i led my eritrean associate to believe that this could be done quickly already plans are in motion you see suddenly the restaurant became very uncomfortable that prickly feeling was back with a vengeance mercer knew when he was about to be railroaded and rather than wait to blow hyde off later he made his decision he stood abruptly then i guess im the wrong person for the job sorry im familiar with how to handle national secrets i know a few myself so rest assured what was discussed here will go no further please dont try to contact me again he wasnt particularly angry about being lied to from a government employee he almost expected it but that didnt mean he was going to waste any more time listening either there was another agenda in place here some shadowy plan that either hyde wouldnt discuss or couldnt not that the reason really mattered to mercer he might be in a professional rut but he knew hydes proposal wasnt the way out of it he didnt pay any attention to the businessman at a table in the bar working from an open briefcase the case hid a sophisticated unidirectional microphone the entire conversation had been recorded college park maryland the tape deck had been placed in the center of the small fauxwood dining table the four chairs clustered around it occupied by the station chief and the three senior members of his team all of them had listened to the recording just fortyfive minutes after mercers exit from the willard hotel comments the team leader ibriham invited at last sounds like a bust the only woman present stated hes not going to jump at the bait i agree said another i was surprised by the level of detail hyde went into with this one the teams most experienced operative noted the last two he approached got far less from him than this philip mercer true the leader said however neither of those engineers had mercers reputation i read through his dossier from archive his academic and field qualifications are impeccable and he has a substantial resume with american covert activities first during the gulf war and later during the hawaii crisis and last year when the alaska pipeline was threatened im willing to bet that hyde wanted mercer all along but had to try the other two first because he was unavailable what should we do the woman asked its obvious dr mercer isnt interested do we wait and see who is next on hydes list i dont think so ibriham replied we need to take the initiative now weve burned nearly a quarter of our budget already and the operation hasnt really started yet we need to get more actively involved without results we may soon be recalled and this missions too important to let that happen already he had a plan in his mind i believe philip mercers the man we want hyde failed to recruit him through normal means so its up to us to get him with other harsher tactics we need to get leverage on this man something to force him to eritrea not only as hydes agent but ours as well from the dossier i know he has no living family but we have to find a weakness we can exploit some vulnerability there is nothing and i mean nothing that is offlimits this takes our highest priority mercer must be in eritrea within two weeks so youre saying our operational perimeters are wide open yes use any means necessary to compel him into accepting hydes offer we know that bribery wont workhe is too wealthybut theres something out there that will coerce him i need you to find it and use it any more questions ibriham received nothing but accepting looks good get to work ill stay on archive but i doubt ill turn up anything more ibriham dismissed the others and headed into their command room closing the door behind him he booted up the main computer terminal and logged on to the internet using the world wide web as a conduit to the secure archive database while his eyes were on the monitor his mind was elsewhere born into a family who had resided just outside the walls of jerusalem for the past nine hundred years he was no stranger to either tradition or sacrifice in his youth many of ibrihams friends had been christians and muslims but his family was part of a small handful of palestinian jews whod lived for generations in the holy land for centuries that distinction made little difference but then strife came since israels creation first ibrihams neighborhood and later his family had been shattered by divided loyalties torn between clan and god he too faced the personal dilemma on one side was the fiery palestinian in him raging to see his people free from outsiders for the first time since saladins conquest five hundred years earlier on the other was the desire for a homeland for his displaced fellow jews a place where once and for all they would no longer fear pogroms and antisemitism much like americans during their civil war his family was ripped asunder one of ibrihams uncles had been shot and killed by another during the infitata the palestinian uprising that swept the west bank and gaza during the s ibriham had tried to stay out of it but he too was swept into the violence it happened after the murder of a favorite cousin a young woman of promise who was slain by israeli security forces for being at the wrong place at the wrong time following a plo demonstration in ibriham changed that day he took up arms and began a new life of violence putting aside the morals that had shaped his youth ibriham deliberately became that which all abhorred he became a terrorist one driven by the perverse belief that no matter what the ends always justified the means ibriham yosef stood at the door of the office he was the most experienced member of their team a veteran who had seen more action than any other team member including ibriham come in uncle ibriham said and save me from thinking too much yosef sat so close to his nephew that their knees almost touched what were you thinking about violence and its meaning it has no meaning its a tool like the plow or the tractor or the ak i know but i wonder about its nature yosef smiled indulgently hed trained ibriham since the day after his nieces death and yet the boy continued to ask questions he was proud that ibriham wasnt one of the mindless drones that blindly followed orders it has no nature only people have that and while the tenets of humanity call for peace if we are threatened violence becomes an option its nature then becomes ours we use it for defense and it is virtuous but if we use it to kill without thought then our nature is reflected in its wastefulness and using violence against this mercer justified yosef didnt even pause to consider the question especially when you hear what i have to tell you i didnt want to mention this in front of the others until i told you first while mercer was meeting with hyde i searched his house yosef took ibrihams silence as acceptance of the unauthorized breakin i didnt have enough time for a thorough job but i learned enough to make me a bit leery go on mercers security system is good not perfect but it provides more than enough protection from all but the best trained yosef smiled thick wrinkles enveloping the corners of his dark deepset eyes i have to admit im getting too old to scale staircases using the handrails alone and what did you find a cache of weapons in an office closet a heckler and koch machine pistol a beretta autoloader ammunition smoke and fragmentation grenades nightvision gear and several blocks of plastique the stuff looks like its been in the bottom of a trunk for a while but its presence is disturbing souvenirs from some earlier mission for the us government i assume but if he kept the stuff it means he would probably use it again a worried scowl crossed yosefs face these weapons and mercers doubtless familiarity with them raises the stakes considerably when we consider what type of action is necessary to force him to eritrea but it doesnt stop us from doing it ibriham agreed i think we should proceed with a bit more caution than originally thought warranted my instinct tells me that there is more to philip mercer than can be learned from a computer dossier ibriham sat silently absorbing this and one more thing mercers rolodex contains the direct office and home phone numbers of richard henna the head of the fbi i think their relationship has a personal element stemming from some past mission this revelation rocked ibriham there is nothing i can do about that now we must proceed cautiously yes but this mission must go on his voice intensified as the image of their goal flashed in his mind its there uncle waiting in the african desert buried for thousands of years and we will get it a symbol for our people all over the world a link to god that will make believers out of everyone even if he is friends with henna do you really think mercer will stand in our way yosef was pleased to see the passion in his nephews eyes this would be his last mission hed only agreed to come in order to help ibriham on his first command none of the others even knew they were related no he wont arlington virginia despite what hed said to hyde mercer couldnt leave this one alone no sooner had he gotten home than he found himself at his desk poring through reference books and the volumes of information available on the internet darkness settled heavily leaving the city washed by the pink glow of streetlamps but the passage of day to night had gone unnoticed while many would find such research work tedious mercer enjoyed it searching for one fact invariably led to countless other avenues of research and a tug at any of these steered him to even more it was easy to become lost in such a deluge of information but mercer was able to distill what he wanted his mind sifting through mountains of useless data for the few elements he found important it was a gift that he exploited to its fullest his final report to yukon coal lay forgotten on his word processor as he tore through the material searching for a trace of validity in what prescott hyde described existed in northern eritrea he turned up nothing the geology of the region was all wrong for a kimberlite pipe eritrea stood at an edge of the great rift valley and while there had been active volcanism in the region millions of years ago there was no indication that diamonds were present none of a diamonds tracer elements had been found nor had there been any recorded discoveries of alluvial stones those washed away from a vent by rivers or streams nothing he could find pointed to even a hint that eritrea was the home of a potential strike but those satellite pictures suggested otherwise mercer could not deny that the medusa pictures of eritrea looked remarkably like the computer projections of the environs around kimberley there might be hundreds of reasons for this similarity most notably an error in the modeling but he could not let go the possibility that hyde was right that an unknown kimberlite pipe lay out there waiting to be discovered he was shocked by how much he wanted it to be true hed never been to eritrea knew no eritreans but he wanted this for them badly he wanted it for himself too there hadnt been a kimberlite pipe discovered in more than a decade and he wanted to be the one who found the next he admitted that his reasons might be more selfish than charitable but if he could find diamonds everyone would win mercer spent the rest of the day running down possible leads but all the evidence pointed to a mistake on hydes part yet against all of his scientific training he found himself searching for evidence to fit hydes theory rather than allowing a hypothesis to develop out of the accumulated facts he couldnt shake the feeling that hyde was somehow right earlier in the afternoon he found he was correct to turn down hydes offer he had telephoned dick henna at the fbi but the director was in new york so hed spoken with marge doyle the deputy director and the real handson head of the organization mercer didnt know her well but she knew of him and went out of her way to provide mercer with an outline of hyde his past and his future which did not look that bright prescott hyde came from a family whose service to the american government stretched back to the drafting of the constitution the hydes had played significant roles during every major watershed in our history from the revolution through the civil war and reconstruction to the development of the united states as a superpower during the forties and fifties hydes father had served with eisenhower when he was supreme allied commander during world war two and later as president working closely with allen dulles during the early years of the cia and with adelai stevenson at the united nations prescott hyde had turned out to be the only disappointment the family had ever produced he was barely holding on to his current position as an undersecretary of state a job given to him more out of nepotism than individual achievement hed already shown a great deal of ineptitude during his brief tenure heading the state departments africa section missing the clues of a coup in zambia last year and so insulting south africas ambassador that the man returned to his homeland for two weeks in protest mercer suspected that if prescott had not been one of the hydes he would have been fired months ago as it stood mercer wondered just how much time the man had left the current president was more interested in foreign relations than domestic issues and he liked to have the best people leading the charge for him mercer guessed that one more screwup on hydes part and he would be out on his ass hence eritrea if hyde could pull it off not only would he save his floundering career but could also add himself to the anointed pantheon of his ancestors thus hydes motivation was more personal than professional and mercer was glad he had flatly refused the contract offer to get involved with someone gambling to save a sinking career would be foolish at best at eight mercer logged off his system his eyes gritty with fatigue and his stomach making not so subtle noises maybe when he had the time to delve into it again he would but for now he put eritrea out of his mind tomorrow he would work on his report to yukon coal he went into the kitchen and pulled a frozen entree from the packed freezer set his oven to the prescribed temperature and slid the stiff meal onto the center rack confidently ignoring the directions about peeling the film from certain portions while his meal was transformed from a frozen mass to a gelatinous one he spiraled up the circular stairs to the master suite and took a long shower precise to the minute he was back in the groundfloor kitchen when the oven timer beeped he ate standing just a few steps from a polished birch table long enough to seat eight using a plastic fork while one of the countless drawers contained matched silverware for a dozen finally he tossed the pressform tray into the garbage and left his house for the short walk to tinys paul tiny gordon was behind the bar as usual and the diminutive former jockey had a vodka gimlet poured by the time mercer crossed the barroom to sit next to a slouched harry white already mercer felt the tension in his shoulders ease there were only a handful of other people in the bar i read somewhere that people who drink on a tuesday are either drunks or alcoholics harry said looking at mercer whats the difference alcoholics have to go to meetings harry deadpanned and this from the guy who thinks booze is the missing link on the food chain mercer smiled old joke harry what do you want im an old man in his large hand harrys highball glass looked like a thimble are you still on that no not really harry sparked a match for a cigarette that had materialized between his lips i did a little soul searching and realized that if im still alive despite myself i should just accept it most of the people ive known who made it to eighty never took what time they had left to enjoy themselves they just sat around nursing homes and griped about how much better they used to feel well i still feel pretty good and goddamn it im going to make the best of it he rapped on the bar top tiny fetch my friend another drink and put it on my tab oh jesus paul gordon threw up his hands theatrically you are really dying arent you the only reason youd ever buy mercer a drink is if you planned on checking out before you paid your bill by the third round tiny was drinking with them and mercer related the story of his meeting with prescott hyde and his own subsequent findings he summed up by saying the facts indicated that there was no kimberlite pipe buried in northern eritrea didnt all the facts once point toward divine creation until darwin came up with the theory of evolution tiny asked yes mercer replied cautiously knowing not to underestimate pauls intellect now creationists are left with faith which is strong enough if you believe you have to ask yourself if your faith in the facts on this pipe thing are strong enough to discount evidence you havent found yet its not the same thing paul and you know it youre right of course but isnt the word atom greek for indivisible and havent we proved that the atom can be split into protons and neutrons and electrons and each of these particles split into countless more indivisible pieces so youre saying i dont know everything yet what hes saying harry interjected is that you wouldnt have brought this up if you didnt believe there are diamonds where this guy said there are and you want us to talk you out of looking for them i dont want to look for them at least not for prescott hyde but somethingcall it faith paulis telling me that eritrea sits on a major find then what are you going to do about it harry asked drink until i can get a very stupid idea out of my head well said harry agreed and knocked back the rest of his bourbon about a half hour later a spellbound look suddenly glowed on paul gordons face as he looked toward the bars front door mercer snapped around to see who had come in a woman stood poised in the doorway she was nearly six feet tall reed thin in loose white slacks and a light gray blouse a white sweater was knotted around her slender throat to ward off the slight chill in the air she was neither black nor white but combined the best features of both races her skin was like milky coffee creamy smooth and her thick hair flowed freely mercer saw it was tinted reddish purple with henna her features were thin and sharp and very dramatic with nilotic cheekbones and a high forehead soft brown eyes dominated her face oh tinys mouth had gone slack my mercer too was enraptured god that was good harry finished his drink and settled the empty glass on the bar paying no heed to the direction of his friends stares tiny pour me another and put it on mercers tab it was only then that harry noticed tiny was looking past his shoulder he turned holy shit the woman smiled at the attention though mercer was sure she was selfconscious maybe it was because harry had mentioned aggie yesterday or maybe because hyde had mercer thinking about africa but he couldnt tear his eyes from her she was beautiful with an africans poise and allure studying her mercer didnt experience the usual gut clench hed had for the past months rather in its place was a new feeling something a bit lower than his stomach and eminently more enjoyable she strode to the bar gliding over the scuffed linoleum with a dancers grace her narrow hips swiveling to the delight of the three men good evening her accent was untraceable but her voice matched her face melodious and provocative im looking for dr philip mercer he wasnt at his home and i was told that he sometimes comes here have any of you gentlemen seen him harry was the first to find his voice yes im philip mercer what can i do for you beautiful lady she thrust out one slim hand to shake harrys dr mercer im selome nagast from the eritrean embassy i was supposed to be at your meeting today with prescott hyde your presence would have graced a rather fruitless luncheon im sure harry leered coming to his feet and pouring on the charm mercer debated with himself about how long to allow the charade to continue im sorry i couldnt make it bill told me what happened and if you dont mind id like this opportunity to state our case once more this time from the side of the people you can help miss nagast mercer broke in sensing that she was becoming uncomfortable with harrys lustful looks im mercer this is a friend of mine harry he suffers terribly from a multiple personality disorder just before you came in he thought he was rita hayworth selome nagast barely missed a beat its a pleasure to meet you ms hayworth ive been a fan ever since seeing gilda on television harry looked as if he could have killed mercer as he shook the womans hand once more just a little joke he chuckled one that mercer ended too quickly and will surely pay for can he buy you a drink miss a white wine i think in a place like this tiny said from behind the bar you must be adventurous a moment later he set an eightyearold french chardonnay from his private stock in front of her mercer gathered her drink and a fresh one for himself why dont we take a booth she followed him to a leatherette bench seat just below a smokegrimed plateglass window rather than analyze selome nagasts presence at tinys and how hydes dossier mentioned he frequented the establishment mercer started speaking as soon as they were comfortable i spent most of the afternoon going over hydes proposal and what i said earlier at the willard still stands im sorry miss nagast but i must decline your offer i can neither refute nor prove what those photographs show but i dont believe theres a diamondbearing kimberlite pipe in northern eritrea how can you be so certain she arched one narrow eyebrow i cant be certain but you and hyde wouldnt have come to me if you didnt value my opinion ive been in this business for a lot of years and the little bit of research i did today says there are no diamonds in your country im intrigued by the prospect but the kind of search hyde was talking about at lunch just isnt worth it either to me or to you is it the money selome accused sharply i know that your expertise is expensive but we are able to pay for at least six weeks of your field time mercer shrugged if youre planning on a sixweek search ill save you the money and disappointment now and tell you that even if there was a pipe with a great big x to mark it and a sign saying dig here youre not giving yourselves nearly enough time to find it the search area is a couple hundred square miles and it must be gone over inch by inch no matter who you get to lead the expedition even with all the luck in the world dont expect results for months our timeline may be a bit short i grant you but it is our money to spend and we feel this project is worth the expense while he was listening to her words mercer found his attention drawn to the movement of her mouth the way her lips formed each syllable perfectly she was truly captivating and he also sensed she may be a lure what the russians used to call the honey trap he then discounted the idea a woman as beautiful as selome nagast made such a ploy too obvious why six weeks the photographs show the pipe to be close to our border with sudan even with the best security six weeks is all we feel we can keep a team safe from marauders the search area is one of the most dangerous in africa you must have heard about the archaeologist and his guide who were killed there several months back hyde mentioned it mercer replied listen you and he have enough information without revealing the medusa pictures to contact one of the big mining outfits in canada or europe why not give them a shot at finding your pipe it was considered but at this stage any deal we struck would be disastrous mining companies are notorious for making contracts that benefit only themselves and leave little to the countries in which they work to get one involved at this stage would mean giving away too much look at what happened in south africa and namibia for decades the money from their mines lined the pockets of europeans rather than the locals we will be in a better bargaining position if we can find the pipe ourselves i cant agree with you more if there are diamonds there youre in a unique position to learn from the mistakes of other african nations countries that all but gave away their wealth or saw it plundered by corrupt officials i have to say again though if you are serious about searching for the pipe give it at least a year and triple whatever budget youve set yourself that way you can be assured one way or another she took his assessment sullenly that is just not possible then abandon the whole idea use the money you were going to pay me and help your people directly bring some of the refugees home from the camps in sudan use it to court some industry to locate in eritrea hell give it to the united nations as a way of getting favors later on whatever you decide it will be better spent than outfitting a poorly conceived geologic expedition almost certain to fail mercer didnt like being so harsh but he knew he should end this as quickly as possible he was impressed by selome and her determination but he also knew she was fooling herself in fact hed fooled himself too hed wasted a day looking for the pipe because he too wanted it to be there he saw a trace of defeat in her eyes and wanted to take her hand as a physical reassurance we are going to pursue this selome said surprising steel in her voice i wish you luck i really do im sorry i cant help you she got up to go but mercer could not let her leave on such a sour note he reached out and touched her wrist listen i could be wrong you could be sitting on the biggest diamond strike in history but you must prepare yourself to be disappointed no matter what its going to take a long time dr mercer none of us are as naive as you think of course this is going to be difficult we all expect that but it does not mean we shouldnt try mercer got up from the booth after she had gone and slumped back at the bar next to harry you heard yeah harry replied dont you think you were a little tough before she came in you thought there might still be a chance that the diamonds are in eritrea i know but i was wrong talking to selome i realized i was merely hoping just like she and hyde unless they can get one of the big mining concerns to foot the bill its best they forget the whole idea mercer demurred tinys offer of another drink they live in one of the poorest places on earth and they want to blow possibly millions of dollars on a project with a thousand to one odds its wrong and i think even our miss nagast recognizes it why do you say that this six weeks she mentioned i dont believe her reason for the rush any more than she does eritreas been an independent country for a couple of years and the diamonds have been there for a couple hundred million so why the big push now i dont think they have the money for anything more extensive and i think there is something more going on here prescott hyde and the lovely selome nagast are keeping something from me i dont know what it is and i dont really care im done with this whole thing mercer had seen it dozens of times especially in africa money that could really help the people squandered on some glamorous project that usually never gets completed or if it is gets abandoned shortly he hated that type of epidemic waste and wouldnt let himself become part of it he considered calling some of his contacts in the mining industry to try to blackball the whole thing it was the best he could do to save eritrea its money are you going to continue your research tomorrow anyway no ill finish my report to yukon coal like i promised and look for another project if the diamonds are there they werent meant for me to find the next morning mercer had already gotten his newspaper and a cup of tarthick coffee before he noticed a package resting on the polished bar top it was a plain buff envelope that hadnt been there last night a sudden adrenaline burst shot through his system his home had been violated beforeindeed he had killed a potential assassin in the bar less than a year agobut knowing someone had secretly broken in while he slept was even more disturbing he ruthlessly crushed down a rising sense of panic after checking his entire house to make sure he was alone he returned to the bar he approached the package with trepidation he quickly discounted his first thought that it was a bomb if someone had wanted to kill him they could have done it as he lay in his bed a silenced bullet was much more efficient than an explosive device he considered calling the police but if it wasnt a bomb then it was a message one meant for him alone ignoring the fact he might be destroying crucial evidence he picked up the packet recognizing the squishy feel of bubble wrap he tore it open and a standard videocassette slid into his hand his stomach turned to knotted ice he had a chilling premonition of its contents he walked over to the entertainment center and slipped the cassette into his vcr turning on the television in the same motion the image that sprang up drained the blood from his face harry white sat naked on a wooden chair with heavy silver tape binding his wrists to the chairs arms and more of it wound around his thin white chest just below his sagging pectoral muscles electric wires were clipped to his nipples and deep bruises surrounded his mouth and blackened both eyes there was a look of terror on harrys face the mornings washington post lay in his lap jesus the paper meant that theyd been in his house at most a half hour ago when he finally spoke harrys usual rasping voice sounded more like a childs plea his speech sounded scripted mercer i was grabbed last night after leaving the bar i dont know who is holding me but they are serious in their intentions as if to prove this statement a hand appeared from off camera and backhanded harry viciously it took him a few moments to recover his chest heaving in fright and pain they demand that you go to eritrea and find the diamond mine or they will kill me you have no choice if they find that you are not planning to go parts of my body will be dumped on your doorstep culminating in my head in two weeks time harry stopped speaking his rheumy eyes focusing beyond the cameras range for a second as if listening to someone then mercer heard another voice one masked by an electronic synthesizing device dr mercer listen to your friend we do not wish to kill him but the discovery of the mine is too important to us to worry about the death of one old man you have six weeks to accomplish the task if you are not successful harry white will be killed if you attempt to find us harry white will be killed if you tell anyone what has happened harry white will die his life or his death are your responsibility two men entered the frame though mercer could not see their faces one wrapped his arms around harrys torso while the other positioned himself next to the old mans hand we will be in contact with you periodically when you get to eritrea the voice droned when you find the diamonds you must tell no one but us or your friend will be brutally tortured before his execution mercer listen to me harry shouted at the camera im not a hero i dont want to die i havent had a cigarette in hours and im already starting to get the shakes from the dts for christs sake do whatever they want kill the fucking president if thats what itll take just get me out of this without warning the one man grasped harrys pinkie finger and snapped it so quickly that a look of surprise hung on harrys face for a few seconds before the waves of pain contorted his features he screamed bubbles of saliva dripping from his mouth the video ended abruptly fear welled up in mercer and he staggered back against the bar he saw tory again on the platform and himself in a train car and he saw her head explode the instant before the gunman ended his own life hed done nothing it didnt matter to him that hed been forty yards away and the gunman had one arm wrapped around torys throat the pistol screwed into her ear hed been paralyzed with fear then and it slammed into him again now it pinned him to the bar and he struggled against it he had been powerless that one time and vowed never again but in all the times since then it was he who was in danger not someone he loved not harry he felt trapped out of control which for him was the worst of all he couldnt tear his eyes from the dark television his mind shrinking away from what hed just seen and then came a spark of rage and he grabbed on to it feeling it grow so he could think again rage was something he could control and channel and use his fists balled at his sides so his knuckles strained against the skin harry was in trouble harry who had saved his life and who had been a friend for so long a father in every way that really counted seeds of guilt crept on him because had they not been friends harry would have awakened this morning in his own bed blearyeyed from last nights drinks but none the worse for wear mercer could use the guilt too because it focused his anger and if his guilt and his rage were strong enough they would crush the fear five minutes passed before the rational side of mercer could finally take over from his emotions and allow him to think of some plan of action first and foremost was finding who had kidnapped harry his first thought was prescott hyde mercer knew the state department maintained a covert arm for just such activities grabbing an old man from his bed and bypassing mercers home security system would be childs play for them but they didnt need mercer that badly not like this there were dozens of men equally qualified to conduct the search in eritrea selome nagast he thought no she was on hydes side that left who mercer didnt know but he was sure he was in over his head he had options namely going to dick henna but he also knew if he was going to get harry back safely he would have to go to africa there was someone out there with access to expert home breakers capable of kidnap and possibly murder harry was his responsibility and he would do whatever it took to bring him home he couldnt let himself consider the consequences if the kimberlite pipe didnt exist arlington virginia because mercer had no way of knowing if phone lines had been tapped or his home bugged at the same time the tape was delivered he spent the day in tinys cluttered back office a room just bigger than a phone booth and plastered with horseracing pictures while he worked paul kept him supplied with coffee and sandwiches mercer told paul everything and the former jockey agreed that in a situation like harrys kidnapping involving the police wasnt the right move mercer did place a call to dick henna and they agreed to meet later that night mercer suspected he would be tailed but had a plan for shaking them while not drawing attention to the fact much of what he did during the afternoon could have been accomplished at his place but mercer hated the idea of working under a microscope and as he made his preparations for going to africa there were a few details he wanted to keep to himself it was a little past four when he was ready to tell selome nagast and hyde that he would go to eritrea after all embassy of eritrea how may i direct your call the receptionists accent was thick selome nagast please mercer waited fifteen seconds as the woman checked her directory i am sorry sir but there is no one here with that name are you sure mercer realized it was a stupid question yes sir is it possible she works at the embassy but doesnt have a phone listing mercer asked hopefully but a niggling doubt was forming in the back of his head we have a new voicemail system the receptionist explained even temporary employees can receive messages thank you mercer kept the suspicion out of his voice and dialed prescott hyde he wondered if his dismissal of selome nagast as harrys kidnapper had been premature im surprised to hear back from you dr mercer you made it clear yesterday that you arent interested in our venture lets just say ive had a change of heart im on board now one hundred percent and wanted you to be the first to know mercer said nothing about selome at this point any information he had was a weapon and now wasnt the time to use it ive already started working on the project ive got heavy equipment en route from south africa three d dozers a couple of big front loaders six terex dump trucks and a caterpillar hydraulic shovel all of the iron is leased for six months except the which eritrea is going to have to buy hold on there im with selome right now and youre on a speaker phone shes shaking her head something fierce dr mercer i cant authorize any of that its just too much money selomes voice sounded distant over the speaker connection somehow hed expected her there it only deepened his suspicions listen you two wanted this project in the first place if im going to get results its got to be done my way or not at all mercer said sharply i didnt set this sixweek rule you did if im expected to find anything im going to need to move a lot of dirt ive got a pretty good lease package for us and if need be i can get a sales contract on the excavator for when were finished with it thatll save you a couple million bucks youre luckymy first idea was to bring in a walking dragline with a fortymilliondollar price tag but wed lose too much time with its onsite assembly as it is the will take two weeks to put together once its shipped in you dont understand we just cant do it this way selome protested i cant guarantee your safety if you present that kind of target by the time the equipment rolls in ill have pinpointed the best site and youll only have to protect a single camp from what i understand nearly every eritrean over the age of thirty has a military background so surely you can muster a protective force when im doing the actual prospecting ill basically be on my own so you wont have to worry about me we wanted something much more lowkey selome said you know what she means hyde broke in a small team minimal equipment and maximum secrecy youre talking about bringing in an army thats what its going to take mercer snapped i tried telling both of you that earlier selome you said your government doesnt want to get involved in a mining operation you just wanted oversight right well consider this a trial run but this is going to be my show ill bring in the equipment i need and any people i want if you dont like it if it isnt what you expected well tough shit this is what you got hyde finally broke the silence i guess we caught a tiger by the tail here youve taken us both a little by surprise we need some time to digest all of this youve got until friday thats when i catch my flight to eritrea i plan to be in asmara on saturday morning and in the area of the search no later than monday i have a lot to go over with both of you before i leave but that can wait until tomorrow for now you need to start working on getting me local support once im in country and if we take your earlier advice and abandon the project there was no malice in mercers voice when he responded then i call a few friends and within a month eritrea will be dug up from one end to the other ive got the contacts to guarantee your nation will be stripped clean with total impunity and there is nothing either of you can do about it ill talk to you again tomorrow mercer was panting when he hung up he was gambling with harry whites life when he just bluffed hyde and selome and it made him tremble his nerves were fraying he dialed the phone again the knight medical group a receptionist chirped is terry there dr knight is with a patient may i have him call you back hes playing video games in his office mercer said why dont you give him a buzz and see if hell talk to me this is philip mercer a minute later terrance knight came on the line great timing mercer i was on the final level of doom and i still have two men left im getting better the last time i called it was coitus interuptus with one of your nurses yeah she sued me for sexual harassment a week after she discovered my sperm count is too low to knock her up thats what i love about you terry your lurid attention to detail mercer chuckled for the first time today terry knight had been his personal physician ever since he moved to washington im going to africa again i need a gamma globulin a cholera booster and i think im ready for another tetanus and ill also need antimalarial pills for a couple of months god i love patients who know what they want im going to give you an oral polio booster as well the cdc in atlanta posted warning for most of the continent since youre headed to africa ill throw in a box of condoms while im at it i doubt youll get lucky so give them to a doctor before you come back anything else mercer laughed again yeah put together a med kit for me nothing more elaborate than a couple of aspirin and a suture set write me a prescription for morphine and antibiotics you sure you dont want a defibrillater and a portable cat scanner terry joked no not this time but maybe later ill be in sometime tomorrow for my shots hey im the doctor i tell you when you come in remember go back to doom terry knowing you is doom mercer sat back as far as possible in the cramped office rubbing his eyes there were a million details to be considered yet his thoughts kept returning to harry white he was a tough old bird a war veteran but he was eighty now mercer focused on what his friend must be going through and used that anger to shove aside the exhaustion and refocus tiny ducked his head into the room how you doing ive been better i know what you mean do you realize today is the first day in twelve years that harry hasnt come in god i never realized how much i loved the bastard until hed gone mercer straightened quickly hes not gone paul ill get him back no matter what it takes ill get him back his bravado sounded empty even in his own ears after mercer had hung up on them prescott hyde and selome nagast looked at each other both having similar thoughts hydes office in foggy bottom was well appointed more new york executive than government official with oil paintings gracing the walls and an antique desk that had been in his family for generations the carpet was a thicker pile than standard issue and the matching wingback chairs had been given to hydes father by president kennedy selome was sitting in one of the chairs dressed in a simple business suit well what do you think she asked breaking the silence i just dont think we can afford it hes talking about millions of dollars and the best weve been able to come up with is three hundred thousand and a lot of that is for mercers consulting fee i never thought about all the equipment we would need hydes voice was dull with defeat we should call the whole thing off it was a long shot at best anyway you call it off and ill have a congressional committee knocking down your door within twelve hours they would love to hear how you really obtained the medusa pictures from the national reconnaissance office selome hissed we can come up with the money somehow buying those pictures from donald rosen cost me nearly everything i have if my wife finds out i took a second mortgage on our house shell kill me i dont care about your domestic problems we are going to need more money very soon if this is going to work ive had expenses on my end too do you hear me complaining about them mercer is the best shot weve got we need to support him and that means cash we both have our sources if need be we can cut in a few more people were talking about a billiondollar payoff when this is done thats worth a little more risk this is getting out of control hyde complained no it isnt were still in control we just cant allow ourselves to forget it thats all i dont know hydes voice trailed off you dont know what she accused were about to make a major discovery one that will lift my country into the twentyfirst century and provide jobs for thousands both of us will get what we want if we dont lose perspective well get the money bill we have to youre right hyde nodded slowly i just dont like the fact that philip mercer has suddenly decided that he is in charge but thats why we wanted him in the first place like he saidwhat he wants he gets its up to us to make sure it goes smoothly you scare me selome hyde said suddenly looking her directly in the eye seeing beyond the beautiful shell to the person who lay beyond good she had hyde caught between his greed and his fear of exposure to her he was inconsequential a means to an end but it was reassuring to know how easily he could be dominated she knew it wouldnt be possible but she wanted to see what happened when hydes wife discovered how her husband had lost their house the greedy pig would get what he deserved paul gordon drove the headlights of his aging plymouth lancing into the night mercer sat next to him sweating heavily in two bulky sweaters and a leather jacket a pair of skateboarders knee pads over his jeans he fingered the motorcycle helmet on his lap both the helmet and the pads had been borrowed from his neighbors son about another mile paul glanced at mercer in the intimate confines of the car you sure you want to do this on this deserted stretch of road deep in the heart of virginia horse country it was easy to spot the headlights of the car that had been following them since arlington yeah tiny im sure its the only way ill say some good words at your funeral the little man said his eyes barely above the arc of the steering wheel were coming up on it now mercer put on the helmet cinching it tight beneath his chin ahead the road curved sharply the turn traced on its outside by a white picket fence belonging to one of the numerous farquar county farms just out of view mercer knew there was a thick copse of pines within feet of the uncoiling road easing into the corner tiny used the emergency brake to avoid telltale brake lights mercer didnt even take the time for a breath he threw open the cars door and allowed himself to be sucked out by the vehicles centrifugal force landing hard on the macadam and tucking into a tight ball as his body began to roll the darkness swallowed him as tiny accelerated away his car vanishing even before mercer came to a stop new scuffs marked his battered bomber jacket and his shoulder ached from the first contact with the road he scrambled into the woods ducking into the underbrush as another car passed by he caught a glimpse of two darkcomplected men as the car continued in pursuit of tinys plymouth mercer checked the luminous dial of his stainless watch and found that he only had a few minutes to wait standing at the side of the road he massaged his sore shoulder with his free hand the helmet dangling negligently from his other there was a low moon a pale glow hidden behind tumbling clouds and the night insects made a steady soothing rhythm five minutes later mercer saw the approach of another set of headlights he eased back into the woods watching the car stopped no more than twenty paces from where he was crouched come on i havent got all night fay is pissed enough that im out here at all dick henna was behind the wheel of his wifes car a light blue ford taurus that had been brutalized by too many washington rush hours ive been in new york for the past few days and im leaving tomorrow for los angeles i promised her that id be home for tonight at least mercer broke away from the shadows and hopped into the passenger seat henna backed the car around and started toward the nations capital youre lucky she likes you or i wouldnt be out in the middle of nowhere playing cloak and dagger she wanted to talk about buying another dog a corgi of all things and shes not too pleased you called this is worth it right harrys been kidnapped mercer said flatly jesus mercer why didnt you tell me on the phone henna had swerved the car dangerously what happened dick henna wasnt an imposing man just below average height with a rounded stomach and a heavily jowled face while henna had achieved the highest position in the fbi he hadnt forgotten what it was like to be a field agent hed been on the streets for thirty years before being tapped to head the bureau his mind was sharp and he had instincts better than nearly anyone mercer had ever met it had been hennas recommendation during the hawaii crisis that allowed mercer to stop a secret operation codenamed vulcans forge the two had been friends ever since mercer related the whole story his narrative coming in a rush for it was the first time he was able to speak about the horror he felt hed told tiny the dry facts but with dick he talked about his own feelings of responsibility marge doyle mentioned youd been in touch about prescott hyde henna remarked when mercer was done i can tell you right now his days are numbered justice has a file on him about four inches thick nothing to indict him on but certainly enough to get him out of state pursue that but i dont think hyde is behind harrys kidnapping christ mercer of course hes not henna was startled that mercer would so nonchalantly suspect an undersecretary of state the guy may be shady but hes not a violent criminal mercers voice was hardedged his emotions barely contained im talking about the abduction of my best friend a total innocent and right now i suspect everything and everyone for now ive got to believe it has a connection to a woman named selome nagast shes lied to me at least once claiming to be affiliated with the eritrean embassy when shes not yet she and hyde are working together is she eritrean either eritrean or ethiopian almost six feet tall great body and a face that should be on the cover of fashion magazines id like you to check her out if she isnt with the eritreans then who does she belong to and if thats a blind alley i dont know mercer admitted i dont have a suspect b ill get a team into harrys place first thing in the morning in case whoever grabbed him left physical evidence dont the video made it clear that if i went to the authorities theyd kill harry immediately im sure his place is being watched for just that reason there was something else on the tape that bothered mercer something either harry or the kidnappers had said that didnt make sense but the answer wouldnt come i think we know what were doing mercer handed the videotape to henna hed made a copy for himself but felt the fbi could do more with the original this is the tape im sure i destroyed crucial evidence by handling it dont sweat it todays technology can do wonders listen dick im responsible for what happened to harry hes just a tool to get to me and im afraid im using you to get him back ive never tried to presume on our friendship until now but every day harrys being held is a day i feel like ive failed can you understand that yeah i can as a field agent a lot of my cases became more personal than was healthy and i know harry too dont forget ill get our ateam into action for his sake henna clasped a hand on mercers forearm what are you going to do i called chuck lowry do you remember him he used to be the computer archivist at the us geological survey henna nodded ive got him hacking airline reservations if the group that took harry are foreign theyll want out of the country but wont have had the time to make an earlier booking chucks checking on reservations made since yesterday for a flight out of washington in the next day or two long shot at best but its something mercer had seen dick bend the laws a few times and didnt worry about his disapproving frown and im going to eritrea to find the pipe in these situations we tell people not to give in to demands henna said quietly expecting an explosion from mercer these situations mercer emphasized the words dont usually include eightyyearold victims and they never include me henna pulled into a gas station just moments before tinys plymouth arrived from the opposite direction the fbi director promised mercer that he would call the next evening at tinys with any information mercer dodged unobserved from hennas car to paul gordons before the sedan trailing tiny came into view tiny put a couple of gallons into his tank paid at the pump with a debit card and the two were on their way quickly any problems mercer asked as they sped back to arlington they never got close enough to see i was alone great mercer said with relief thanks paul i owe you big for this if it was for anyone other than harry id agree but for him its a wash tiny kept his eyes on the road as he spoke is henna going to help yeah hes in theyre going over harrys place tomorrow hes going to call me at your bar and tell me if they turned up anything youre still going to go to africa arent you im covering my bets so yeah im going monastery of debre amlak northern eritrea morning prayers were long over but the sun was still an hour from rising the moon hung shining and fat threequarters full and bright enough to wash away the glow from venus the morning star april was rainy season yet the downpours had not come to the lowlands the desert stretching into the interior of africa had not seen a drop however the air was chilled with humidity forcing the twelve monks and their abbot inhabiting the ancient monastery to wear heavy woolen mantles with their legs bare and their feet in leather sandals they shivered in the predawn light as they prepared to break evening fast at the long table in the dining hall situated along a razor crest of mountains that cleaved across the desert floor and afforded the monastery some reprieve from the worst of the summer heat the retreat had a commanding view of the surrounding flats as if its original builders had an eye for defensive positions rather than the sequestration of its inhabitants constructed in the twelfth century as an outpost of christianity and expanded once during the s the abbey had enjoyed continuous occupancy until the latter part of the twentieth century when the intense fighting between eritrean freedom fighters and the occupying ethiopian army forced the brothers to evacuate to another monastery in ethiopia contrary to the scorched earth policy practiced by the ethiopians at the close of the conflict when they returned they discovered that their abbey had not been molested save for a few stray bullet holes that marred its stone facade the monks sat at a wide plank table built five hundred years earlier by another nameless brother the chairs added over the centuries by different hands both skilled and unskilled it was a point of pride among those assembled to sit at the most uncomfortable and poorly constructed chair as possiblethat bit of added discomfort testified in a small way to their fealty their meal was simple a spongy unleavened bread which they tore into small pieces to dip into the graygreen stew of peas lentils and peppers they all drank black coffee brewed from beans from their own bushes breakfast was the only time the monks allowed themselves full discourse all other conversation was restricted to prayers and singing while not exactly informal the breakfast meetings contained an air of relaxation not normally associated with men who made their devotion by the selfless sacrifice of monastic life the ages of the men ran from the midteens of the three novice boys to nearly a hundred the abbot however was not the eldest of the group as was normal practice when the monastery was abandoned in the head abbot at the time had vowed he would never return feeling shame in breaking the chain of occupation stretching far into the past he died while they were still in exile and many of the elder monks refused to return home in honor of their friend those that did come back made it clear that they would not take the reins of leadership in order to show deference to their fallen leader thus it fell to a younger man an ethiopian by birth who had been part of the monastery since he was a novice not knowing his own age but guessing it to be around sixty brother ephraim he had used the name for so long he scarcely remembered the one given to him by his parents sat at the head of the table in the oldest most dilapidated chair the pewter plate before him mopped clean with the last of the bread small bits of food clung to his mostly silver beard he spoke latin conversationally did our little friend return last night to harass the chickens i heard a disturbance about an hour after midnight services i thought maybe our jackal was back alas no brother he has not returned and i fear he may not one of the monks responded sadly for in this dead land the return of even a single scavenger was seen as a renewing of life i saw his body across the valley yesterday he had been shot god works to return what man has plundered from the earth by the war and yet we continue to defy him i fear the day when he no longer replenishes that which we use up brother ephraim shook his large head with disappointment that day is closer than you think the eldest of the monastic family muttered a monk who had lived here for almost nine decades judgment is coming yes brother dawit his day of atonement is never far away ephraim agreed patiently for the elder monk had lost much of his mind as well as his eyesight dawits body was paper thin his skin so parched that even candlelight could silhouette the delicate bones in his hands in recent weeks his health had deteriorated alarmingly and his thoughts had become scattered and disjointed not his day brother but anothers dawit cawed before we face gods judgment we will be questioned by men and our answers will offend them most grievously they will take up arms against us and all others who defy them they know of a secret meant to be kept forever the sins of our fathers are about to be revealed there was a silence for a moment and ephraim was about to reassure the aged monk when dawit sat straighter in his chair his milky white eyes glaring sightlessly my brothers the time has come for us to accept the shame of the distant past the deaths of the children will be exposed the evil brought to earth from hell itself will kill again many will die in order that many more will be saved you know nothing of this brother ephraim for our chain was broken and secrets were not passed to you by your predecessor but there are truths within these walls that will pit nation against nation if they are divulged judge wisely brother the fate of the lords battle with satan rests upon your shoulders why do you think none of us wanted your chair when we returned dawit craned his fleshless neck around the room his blind eyes falling unerringly on those older members of the brotherhood who like himself had refused to take the leadership of the house we did not do it to honor the former abbot we all despised him though none would make that admission what he knew made him a hatefilled bitter man one concerned more with the decisions of this world than contemplation of mans place in the next such was the nature of his position of yours young brother ephraim had gone a little pale under his natural dusky complexion he was stunned by the coherence of dawits speech even if he didnt understand the content and what were these truths brother who will question us dawits body shook with the effort of his outburst his narrow chest heaving under the dark cloak in the eyes of the other clerics the strain of speaking seemed to age him further i do not know i do not wish to know and if you had a choice neither would you but gods will be done and it is up to him to reveal what that is later that day as the sun slid silently past its zenith brother ephraim went out walking the heat was ferocious but he still wore his woolen vestments it was dangerous where he wandered after the war a team sponsored by the united nations had painstakingly cleared the hundreds of land mines planted in the area around the monastery and the fields the monks used for pasturing their goats nearly twelve square miles had been decontaminated but beyond the little red markers the land was fouled with cansized bombs ephraim knew hed stepped over the boundary but his thoughts were too deep to pay that fact particular attention he had spent his life devoted to the church and unlike many others who had taken up the calling his faith had never wavered but as he walked across the desert he felt a superstitious dread tingling his spine he wanted to discount dawits ramblings but he could not dawits tirade had rattled him not to the core of his faith but at least to the core of his manhood for what the old brother said sounded more of the work of man than of god the role of monks and the monastic system was not the spread of the gospel nor the recruitment of new members to the fold a monks single occupation was prayer and contemplation for the salvation of others it was the most difficult of callings for one never knew like a parish priest watching his congregation flourish if their devotion had been successful if they had really touched the lives of others through their work thus ephraim had had very little contact with the world outside of this valley dawits words had unsettled him he was well armed to attack questions of faith but ill equipped to deal with issues between men it was a world as alien to him as the monastery was to those who lived beyond its cloistered walls there were two things he needed to do two deeds that that would help him put into context what dawit had said he had little doubt that the old brother knew something he was unwilling to divulge so ephraim felt he had to prepare the first deed a guilty pleasure learned at the other retreat in ethiopia he looked forward to more than he cared to admit the other was a mortal sinthe breaking of a confessional trust suddenly he whirled around so that his long robe danced against his exposed legs and he started back the way he had come his stride more determined his path more direct in the cliff below the monastery was a deep cave its mouth hidden from easy view by a foldback of the valley wall a natural sandstone screen the cave had been used long ago as a resting place for shepherds lost deep in the desert and by primeval men who had painted the walls with frescoes of their hunts before making it his personal sanctuary ephraim had watched it for many months to make certain he was not intruding on the solitude of one of the others he did not know how many of his brothers in the past centuries had used the cave as their own retreat from the house because he had planned for a long walk he carried a flask of water and a modest meal of dried vegetables and a little salted mutton now inside the cave he removed these items from the pocket of his robe and set them on the carefully swept sand floor he placed the food against one wall next to the other flasks brought from previous visits and left for those times he came unprepared he was surprised to realize he had built up quite a cache and wondered if it wasnt time to spread it out into the desert for the small nocturnal creatures and the keeneyed vultures the light in the cave was dim and ill suited for his purposes and he had forgotten to bring a candle again as he settled against a smooth wall the coolness of the stone leaching through his cloak he knew that part of his pleasure was the suffering afterward as if the eyestrain was in some small way a penance his heart pounded with anticipation and he felt a tightness in his stomach as he did every time he reached for one of the books the volumes were old their leather worn by countless hands and the harshness of their african home they were meant for a fine library in europe because ethiopia and eritreaabyssinia as the region was known thenwere italian colonies up until ephraim had learned to speak the language as a young boy and while he was sorely out of practice he could read it well enough for the books to bring him tremendous pleasure and insight into the workings of the outside world he had found the five volume set at their temporary home in ethiopia selecting a book at random ephraim began to read laboriously it was prophetic that the passage was from othello the scene in which the moor realizes hes been betrayed by his lifelong friend casio brother ephraims love for shakespeares plays and sonnets was his most guarded secret and also his only real tool for understanding the outside world only after a few hours with the bard would he tackle his second task one that would make the monk realize that life today had become much more complex than even shakespeare could have imagined arlington virginia in the best of circumstances mercer needed a minimum of two months to mount the type of expedition he was planning but hed given himself only another three days even with full cooperation from eritrea which he suspected selome nagast could not provide he would land in africa poorly equipped underfunded and lacking vital information mercer had committed himself unsure whether his vague hunches were right and with little equipment and even less data to back him up it was daunting even for him but every time he felt his commitment wane he thought about his responsibility to harry and he could temporarily slough off the exhaustion already harry had been gone for more than twentyfour hours mercers frustration was mounting he worked as fast as he could but still felt he wasnt doing enough since early morning his fax machine had been buzzing continuously as had the ink jet printer attached to his computer both machines were producing reams of text about the geology of africas horn gathered for him from both local and international contacts between phone calls hed managed to skim just a tiny portion of the accumulated material though his knowledge of africas geologic composition was voluminous he didnt know enough of eritreas specific makeup its formations and history for what he was about to attempt he had yet to find even a vague hint as to the whereabouts of the kimberlite pipe the top of his desk was buried under two inches of paper some organized in piles others spread haphazardly somewhere under the clutter lay the plates hed used for both breakfast and lunch he hadnt slept since returning from his latenight meeting with dick henna and while the pots of coffee he had consumed kept him awake a raging headache had formed behind his eyes and spread so that his entire skull throbbed there was a break in the incoming faxes so he reached for the phone prescott hydes number was permanently imprinted on his brain yes dr mercer what is it now hyde was as tired of receiving the calls as mercer was of making them bill im probably going to need a blasting license once im in eritrea im faxing over copies of my masters licenses from the us canada south africa namibia and australia whatever functionary issues them in asmara should be suitably impressed so i wont need to be tested once im there shouldnt selome be handling stuff like that you have her cell phone number she hasnt answered the damn thing all day so the job is falling on your lap mercer explained because selome didnt have a connection to the eritrean embassy and mercer didnt know if she was involved with the kidnappers he didnt want to reveal his misgivings about her he felt that selome and hydes collusion ran deep while were at it the explosives ive ordered need an end users certificate before they can be shipped youll need to arrange that i also want to get some collapsible fuel bladders for filling the equipment at the site i can order them from a civilian supplier but the military versions are stronger why not just use tanker trucks to refuel the equipment once we get geared up i cant afford to have tank trailers laying idle theyll be making roundtheclock runs to bring in more diesel you cant imagine how many gallons per hour some of those trucks drink okay anything else yes ive got a bill on my desk for two million seven hundred thousand dollars payment due in thirty days for the heavy equipment leases my word was enough to get the equipment in transit but my reputation is on the line here and i need to know that this is going to get paid dont worry about the money hyde said selome and i have that all taken care of fax the bill to my office and dont give it another thought mercer didnt like hydes snakeoilsalesmans tone but he let it pass all right how are you two coming with the rest of my requests excellent i spoke with selome earlier this morning and she said that the small equipment you wanted is waiting for you in asmara its being loaded onto trucks for shipment closer to the target area shes found a local who has experience in miningwell quarry work actually named habte makkonen hell be your guide once youre in eritrea do you have a number where i can reach him hyde chuckled if you had any idea how horrible the phone service is over there you wouldnt have asked that question fine well talk later mercer cut the connection adding two iridium satellite phones to his long list of necessary equipment he had to get to tinys office for hennas call and he gathered a bundle of papers for the wait he hated to use the time this way but he couldnt chanced his phone being tapped or his office bugged nor could he afford to miss the call he was almost out the front door when his phone rang again he raced back into the kitchen and grabbed the extension hanging from the wall its coiled cord nearly brushing the floor where are you chuck lowry asked he knew more about computers than any of mercers other friends much of lowrys business was legitimate erecting data protection systems and investigating electronic fraud but he kept his hand in the illegal side of the internet and computer networks mercer suspected the vietnam veteran still loved the underworld of the electronic age that he had helped create he was a bit of a flake who purposely cultivated a computer geeks eccentricity and had made a fortune debugging computers for yk compliance at home where the hell do you think i am mercer snapped too tired to care that lowry was responding to an appeal for help hey i didnt know if i dialed your home number or your cell doesnt matter head to dulles airport ill call you on your car phone in two minutes there was an urgency in lowrys twangy voice i found harry for you mercer slammed the phone in its cradle dropped the papers to the floor and sprinted out of his house his jag was parked on the street as he usually left it the keyless entry system chirping even as he swung open the long door the perelli tires left two long greasy marks on the asphalt as he smoked them away from the curb he was on the beltway doing eighty weaving though traffic like a stock car driver when the car phone rang needing both hands on the wheel he activated the speaker mode what have you got chuck it may already be too late lowrys strident voice filled the jaguar tell me mercer jinxed his car around a minivan occupied by a startled mother and four equally wideeyed children he was pushing ninety miles per hour now the tension in lowrys voice transferring to the gas pedal i went through all the major airline reservation databases last night and this morning looking for new bookings out of reagan national dulles and bwi the kidnappers more than likely would have drugged him to keep him quiet cant have some old man screaming and yelling on an international flight can they so i figured they might have requested special assistance had to crack into a government computer system to use their juice for the search engine but thats neither here nor there come on chuck get on with it mercers frustration was finding an outlet the search turned up bupkis but then i got thinking what about a charter jet service i started that search just a few minutes ago and got a hit first try a gulfstream iv out of dulles was chartered yesterday morning for a departure in lowry paused eighteen minutes according to the flight plan why suspect this particular charter even as he asked mercer felt his excitement swell ticketing code had a wchc flag which is a request for wheelchair assistance to the plane if they drugged an eightyyearold man chances are harry wont be tap dancing up the boarding stairs general aviation at dulles told me the five passengers are there right now waiting to board and the old man in the wheelchair hasnt made a peep since they arrived bingo mercer floored the jag the speedometer needle arcing past a hundred just as smoothly as the engine builder could make it the felinesleek car knifed through the steady afternoon traffic with elegant ease mercer deftly passing cars on both the left and the right dodging dangerously into the breakdown lane when necessary there it was the shot of adrenaline his drug of choice harry had said that the hollow in mercers life was loneliness and he agreed that there was a lot of truth in that statement but mercer also missed the danger hed become addicted to it in alaska and craved the feeling of life it gave the narrow gaps between cars seemed like open chasms as he bulled the jag toward dulles he scarcely noticed a fender bender in his wake caused by an overagressive move the honks of protest as he accelerated past commuters sounded like a chorus thanks i owe you a big one ill call you later ive been in new york for the past couple of days and im leaving for los angeles tomorrow mercer could only pray that henna hadnt left yet he dialed the directors cell phone number hello dick its mercer ive found harry white hes at the general aviation building at dulles holy shit henna shouted im already on the road heading to dulles right now where exactly are you mercer prayed that he wasnt just leaving his downtown office we passed the first toll booth on the airports access road about ten seconds ago thank christ how many agents with you mercer decelerated slightly for the dulles exit me and marge doyle and two agents henna understood what mercer really wanted to know the two agents are armed wait sos marge fortunately for mercer traffic heading to dulles international was light and he was able to steer his car into an open slot at the first booth there was a mechanical arm blocking the lane while every commuter had dreamed of a moment like this it gave mercer no pleasure he shot into the lane hitting the barrier with the center of the hood snapping it off cleanly it flew away like a crippled bird mercer paid no attention to the chaos behind him knowing it would take time for a patrol car if one was stationed there to take up the pursuit by then he would be two miles down the road and pulling away by the second he saw a white sedan ahead of him with government plates dick are you in a white crown victoria howd you know look out the left side window mercers black jaguar streaked by the crown victoria as thought it were parked hennas driver was doing seventy christ on the cross are you out of your mind henna screamed over the cellular phone mercers hard gray eyes flicked to the rearview mirror noting with satisfaction that the fbi driver was gamely trying to keep pace another toll booth was coming up fast the jag eating the distance so quickly that mercers vision felt like a camera lens on fast zoom warned by the workers at the first booth all the mechanical barriers were down and men stood in the lanes trying to block the speeding jag mercer had only seconds to commit himself but he couldnt chance hitting one of the men he cursed bitterly and was about to slow far left henna shouted seeing an opening at the same instant mercer did mercer spun the wheel the rear end of the car twitching dangerously as he eased the brakes with his left foot and applied more power with his right his feet dancing nimbly he executed a perfect controlled slide across the tarmac the jag lining up with the narrow lane just as its rear tires regained firm traction he had a clear route all the way to the airport dulless main terminal with its arcing columns of brick and concrete and its long slabs of glass reminded mercer of some giant animals rib cage left out in a field to bleach he fishtailed the jag through the grounds past the terminal and followed the overhead signs to the newly built general aviation building mercer took his jag through the maze of parked luxury vehicles before throwing it into a fourwheel drift rubber smearing from the tires with a protesting scream the car stopped just a few feet from the automatic glass entry doors the crown victoria was only a few seconds behind mercer dodged into the terminal just as henna leapt from his car with the two agents marge doyles snubnosed revolver in his hand the agents carried mattefinished automatics that matched their deadly expressions though his size and ample stomach made henna look out of shape he was almost as quick as mercer and was on his heels in an instant the terminal was well appointed more like a comfortable hotel lobby than an airport waiting room it catered to the ultrarich who could afford their own aircraft or had the money to charter one its far side was dominated by plateglass windows that looked over ranks of lears gulfstreams citations and other corporate aircraft at the tarmac exit a group of men were just leaving to board their plane mercer immediately recognized the back of harry whites head as he lolled in a stainless steel wheelchair a woman waiting for her plane screamed when she saw henna and the others burst into the terminal with their guns drawn the four men hovering over harry whirled at the sound and when they saw the weapons they drew guns of their own mercer shoved henna aside then dove to the carpet as if he were sliding into home to win the world series the kidnappers all carried the akms an updated version of the soviets venerable ak built with folding stocks for easier concealment the guns had been under long coats the aks chattered and hennas driver caught half a clip in the chest his torso nearly ripped apart by the onslaught the other agent took two slugs in the shoulder and thigh three civilians fell in the opening fusillade their corpses landing close enough to mercer for him to see the horror frozen on their faces the terrorists lost track of henna and mercer in the exploding panic and turned to bundle harry out of the building to where their jet waited without thinking mercer leapt from the carpet snatched the drivers fallen beretta and took up the chase from outside the kidnappers fired back into the building bullets slammed into the plateglass window sending shards cascading like a waterfall mercer lunged for the floor again raised the beretta over the mangled windowsill and started firing hoping to scatter the kidnappers he gave no thought to the jets on the apron that were all fully fueled and cost millions of dollars apiece either one round hit a terrorist or the return fire had made them duck because the aks fell silent mercer chanced looking out the ruined window his knees grinding into the shattered glass the fleeing men were at the steps of a gulfstream bodily lifting harry through the open door while one of them kept an eye on the terminal the gunman spotted mercer and raised his assault rifle but mercer ducked before he could fire his chest pounding in the brief respite mercer felt the fear giving way to immeasurable fury he mentally counted the rounds hed fired and figured he had only one shot remaining before the beretta locked back empty the range to the aircraft was too far for an accurate shot and even if he was closer mercer couldnt risk hitting harry on the tarmac the engine noise of the terrorists chartered plane increased to an earsplitting shriek mercer doubted the pilot was part of the terrorist gang and he could imagine the gun held to his head compelling him to take off he looked out again and saw the plane pulling away the door still open and one terrorist hanging out with his ak pointed at the terminal mercer vaulted through the destroyed window and raced across the open expanse of concrete poorly aimed bullets from the fleeing gulfstream raking the tarmac he could hear distant sirens approaching the airport and dick hennas booming voice calling him back but he ignored the distractions he dodged several planes and a towing truck left abandoned by a frightened ground worker the gulfstream was accelerating but its pace was little more than a slow trot and mercer raced to the gunmans blind side when he came even with the tail reeking fumes from the engines engulfed him in a dark cloud he veered and got the terrorist in his sights mercer triggered off his final round at a range of only eight yards the gunman tumbled from the doorway his ak clattering behind him the shot must have alerted the terrorists because suddenly the gulfstream leaned back on its rear landing gear as the pilot increased power leaving mercer in its wake the gulfstream turned on to the main taxiway leading to the center of the airport complex and the runways mercer sprinted back toward the terminal and the apron of executive jets rushing to a gates learjet with its tail mounted turbofans already whining on idle mercer closed the berettas action and used its butt to wrap on the closed hatch police open up a second later the door sprang upward mercer recognized the welldressed africanamerican as the anchorman for a cnn news program mercer grabbed a fistful of his shirt jacket and handpainted tie and with one graceful move he tossed him effortlessly to the ground mercer was aboard with the door closed in an instant the lears cabin was small barely four and a half feet tall and just a bit wider had there been other passengers on the plane mercer wouldnt have continued but the ten seats were empty he could hear the pilots talking from the cockpit you okay back there mr jackson the copilot called mercer shuffled forward until his body was between the pilots seats and both men could see the gun in his hand he used it to point at the gulfstream now a quarter mile away follow that plane he said unable to ignore the absurdity of his order the pilots realized mercers seriousness and the damage the mm could do at such a close range the copilot sat back in his seat distancing himself from the controls as the pilot applied power to the turbojets just stay cool the pilot pleaded his voice tight dont worry about me mercer sounded distant even in his own head just dont lose that gulfstream the lear closed quickly its tires strained by the aircrafts excess speed the gulfstreams hatch was still open and when one of the gunmen went to close it he caught sight of the small jet stalking them mercer could see the surprised expression on his dusky face and his eyes go wide before the terrorist ducked out of view brace yourselves mercer shouted just as the gunman reappeared holding the ak out the hatch and firing onehanded the weapon jerking in his fist lead streaked from the weapon like water from a hose chunks of concrete exploding from the taxiway several rounds pierced the lears thin skin though the engines continued to pour out thrust thats it pal the pilot screamed chase is off keep after them were hit man theres no way im flying without assessing the damage you can ram them mercer said more coolly than he felt not hard enough to destroy their plane but enough to prevent them leaving youre out of your fucking mind they just killed four people in the airport and theyre kidnapping a fifth were the only ones who can stop them the pilots exchanged glances and came to a mutual agreement the lear increased speed careening onto the runway dipping so hard into the turn that the wingmounted fuel tank scraped the ground in a shower of sparks the kidnappers gulfstream came to an abrupt halt fifty yards ahead of the lear to allow a united to loop in for its landing its shadow racing along the ground to catch the hurtling jumbo jet the lears pilot saw his opportunity and further increased power the plane ate the distance to the gulfstream with the grace of a cheetah on the hunt from the gulfstream a face appeared in the hatch again realizing what was about to happen the terrorist leaped to the tarmac just as his aircraft started rolling again building up to rotation speed oh shit the lear pilot shouted the gunman raised his ak as he charged but either the magazine had been emptied earlier or the weapon had jammed it did not fire he tried for a frantic half second to clear the chamber then realized the gun wouldnt work in the moments before the lear reached him he tossed it aside what the hell is he doing the copilot asked mercer understood the dead look in the terrorists eyes told him exactly what was going to happen the kidnapper kept running at the lowslung aircraft judging distances and at the critical second he leaped one foot landed on the lears left wing momentum making him tumble but he had enough coordination to twist as he rebounded aligning himself with his intended target his arm went in first the titanium blades of the garrett tfe turbofan having little trouble liquefying both muscle and bone but when his shoulder and head hit the whirling turbine the engine came apart blades exploding off the rollerbearing shaft and blowing through the aluminum nacelle the lears pilot shut down both engines when he realized the gunmans suicide mission and prevented a spontaneous detonation the gulfstream lifted off the macadam a mile down the runaway trails of exhaust marring the air like angry brush strokes mercer gave little thought to the pilots or the man whod allowed himself to be sucked into the jet engine and watched as harrys kidnappers flew off into the distance because he hadnt done enough his friend was gone hed been so close but then again hed been only forty yards away when tory was murdered his hands began to tremble with rage and frustration and guilt he could have done more he could have driven faster or run harder or shot out a tire rather than allow himself the grim satisfaction of using his last bullet to kill one of them he wanted to believe hed given it his best effort but with these high stakes it was obvious that his best wasnt good enough he was sitting on a grassy verge bordering the runway when an airport security car whooped its way to the stationary lear there were knotted muscles at the base of his jaw as he tried to keep his mouth firm dick henna jumped from the car and approached slowly mercer was as close to breaking down as he had ever seen him and the sight sent a chill through hennas guts are you okay mercer took a long time to answer his face blank but beneath his eyes rage boiled yeah im fine he whispered you i lost a man in there and another is already on his way to the hospital listen mercer ive got to get you the hell out of here marge has already called for an fbi forensics unit and theyll be here shortly i can explain away this thing as an arrest gone bad but as a civilian you cant be involved he held out a hand mercer used it to hoist himself to his feet what about the gulfstream i dont know i guess someone has it on radar but im not sure what a fuckup dick mercer said i am so sorry they got into the car its not your fault neither of us had any idea the men who took harry are terrorists lugging machine guns we had no way of knowing hennas voice was calm and soothing chances are that planes heading outside the country and that makes this an international incident im going to call paul barnes at the cia and if we can figure out where theyre headed ill have him get some agents there to meet it do you think the cia can get him back frankly i doubt well have the time to learn where theyre going to land a jet with extended tanks can be in europe africa or south america in just a few hours but hey theres a ton of evidence lying around here and a paper trail for the jet lease so there is hope of finding them mercer didnt speak until the sedans driver circled around the terminal and parked next to his jaguar marge doyle stood next to mercers car making sure the airport police didnt look at it too carefully henna forestalled any questions with a sharp look so marge gave mercers shoulder a pat and went into the building her commiseration shook mercer back to the present harry was beyond his reach and for the time being there wasnt a thing he could do about it youre right he said maybe you can find these bastards through the abandoned weapons or the guy i capped on the runway i have to get to eritrea and help harry that way have you found anything on that front anything on selome nagast youre not going to believe this one when i was following your lead about her not working at the eritrean embassy i got a call from the ambassador himself he said that she was in the country under his authority and that she was working without the support of his staff they know nothing of her or her mission here which is according to the ambassador securing private funding for humanitarian programs within eritrea he didnt get more specific than that and before i could press hed hung up on me henna paused i dug a little deeper and things got real interesting i crossreferenced her name through the cia database and within minutes i got an angry call eritreas ambassador again no are you ready for this paul barnes what you heard me the director of the cia typing her name into the computer sent up all sorts of red flags part of our system is indexed with the mossads and when her name came up alarms must have screamed all over tel aviv barness opposite number in israel called and read him the riot act about interagency cooperation and a bunch of other shit the upshot is israel did not like me poking into the background of miss nagast why in the hell would the israelis care if youre researching an eritrean national this was one turn mercer hadnt expected because shes not henna said selome nagast holds duel citizenship eritrea and israel and she has an officers commission in the israeli defense force as well as a position in their government i dont get it if selome was israeli that could mean harry was being held by one of the jewish states legions of enemies neither do i but ten minutes after getting off the phone with barnes lloyd easton called the secretary of state this was going far outside mercers realm and the implications were beginning to scare him no other he told me that hed just received a call too this one from israels foreign minister we are to back off selome nagast or face serious consequences shes one of theirs operating in the united states on a missionget thisnot detrimental to america and therefore none of our concern the guy told us to piss off in our own backyard he said by investigating her mission we are jeopardizing our close alliance with his nation what the hell is going on here dick you tell me henna shot back i thought this would be a routine inquiry and the next thing i know ive got shit coming down on me faster than i can shovel what do you think mercer thought for a moment paying little attention to the ambulances and police vehicles around them i didnt trust her from the beginning i thought there was something dirty about herprescott hyde too for that matterbut this is unbelievable why cant you be like the rest of my friends henna wasnt upset but he was serious when they call up for a favor its usually to help paint their garage or put together a gas grill with you it always has to be something else doesnt it and it gets worse every time harrys kidnapping has turned into a bloodbath what is it about you lucky i guess whatd you find at harrys too early to tell the team went to his place just as i was heading for the airport what can you tell me about the night harry was grabbed itll help sift through the evidence the forensic team picks up theres nothing i can tell you that would help it was a night like any other we were drinking at tinys until selome arrived we had a couple more after she left then harry took off and i headed home too i guess theres nothing we can do unless we can track that plane henna rested an arm on the jags open door as mercer finally swung into his car except wait for the forensics reports when do you think youll have something from harrys apartment a couple hours for a preliminary id think henna replied watching his friend critically after this mess i wont be going to california so why dont you come over to my place tonight and well go over it well have a couple of drinks i know what youre trying to do and i appreciate the gesture but dont bother ive got too much work i know my limitations better than anyone mercer fired up the jags throaty v when i reach the end of my rope ill stop i just hope the end of your rope isnt a noose you crazy son of a bitch henna muttered at the receding car venice italy giancarlo gianelli brooded with his back to the windows in the spacious drawing room of his ancestral home located on the grand canal the windowshuge floortoceiling affairs of leaded glass and wrought ironwere over three hundred years old made at a time when the glassmakers art was still being perfected there was a blister in each of the eight hundred individual panes where the blowers pipe had once been inserted into the molten glass the sunlight streaming through them cast a grid shadow on the floor that matched its checker pattern of beige and rose carrera marble the rooms furniture were all antiques each piece exceptional in its own right but coming alive when blended with the rest of the surroundings it was a room of extraordinary wealth and was only one of fortythree in the home gianelli too looked as if he were a furnishing for the house an elegant addition placed just so his sports coat had been custom made in milan his shirt of egyptian cotton and his tie had been given to him personally by the late gianni versace he was the epitome of an italian merchant prince comparable with the renaissance medicis today the planet was a small place anyone had global accessibility in just a few hours with jet aircraft or instantly with the telephone and the internet thus the days when men with vision could generate wealth in direct accordance to the risk were all but gone only a few still retained the kind of independence to function without the constraints of obfuscating lawyers and miserly bankers giancarlo gianelli was just such a person as the last male heir in a dynasty that stretched back more than six centuries gianelli stood at the apex of all his clan had struggled to achieve in two months the last of his six daughters would be married and all that would remain to give him succor as he eased into the second half of his fifties was the fabled history of his family while he had two sons by two separate mistresses neither of them could ever assume the gianelli mantle it was possible that this lack of an heir gave him the recklessness to draw himself away from the legitimate portions of his businesses and delve deeper into the shadows of what his family had created the twentieth century had been good to his family his grandfather had added not one but two new fortunes first at the turn of the century when the manufacturing revolution reached the italian peninsula and again during the fascist reign of benito mussolini when he switched the gianelli companies to wartime production under the direct patronage of il duce during the s and early s the gianellis rivaled the fiat corporation in size and scope manufacturing everything from submarines to infantrymens mess kits giancarlos father had taken the reins in and shepherded gianelli spa the principle holding company through the turbulent but profitable s the downturn of the s and into the meteoric s he turned over stewardship to his son giancarlo just weeks before the american stock market crash of october though giancarlos first years as ceo were trying the company remained one of italys largest and most profitable looking out the windows giancarlo could see a few gondolas on the grand canal mostly empty for the boats were used mainly by the tourists and it was still too early for them there were several vaporetti plying the wide waterway the lumbering old boats acting much like public buses would in any other city around them dodged sleek polished water taxis many of them occupied by businessmen again like any other city in the world in the distance the sixteenthcentury rialto bridge arced gracefully across the canal it was april in venice a magic time of year the suns rays were warm enough to make strolls along the narrow streets comfortable yet the heat wasnt enough to turn fetid the sewage that tended to choke the canals later in the summer the shop owners were happy and expectant eagerly awaiting the tourists imminent arrival by july their smiles would be forced their bonhomie worn a little thin and by august they would be downright surly because they had made a years income and were ready to be rid of the droves the phone chimed hes leaving in two days time mr gianelli the caller said without preamble what do you think of his chances giancarlo asked hes good some say the best but i dont believe he can find it why do you say that gianelli wasnt paying the informer enough to trust his deductions raw information was one thing but giancarlo would do the interpretations himself time mr gianelli the response was immediate as if the question had been expected hyde gave mercer a sixweek window for his exploration and mercer himself wants to be in eritrea by this weekend hes really lit some fires here to get things moving he may be the best mineral prospector in the business but with only a week to get organized he wont be able to find his asshole with his hemorrhoid creme gianelli grunted with distaste hes made a lot of progress securing equipment and material but he cant get started for at least another week once hes in africa itll take him that long to sort out the logistics of it all and then well eritrea may be a small country when you look at it on a world map but when youre exploring it on foot or from a vehicle its a big rugged place are you any closer to getting a copy of the medusa photographs gianelli asked those pictures are a sure way of narrowing our own search no the caller replied i explained to you before hyde never lets them out of his sight ive already checked the national reconnaissance offices archives and there was only that one set created something to do with the material they are made from being impossible to photocopy or scan he paused im sorry will hyde give them to mercer i believe so yes but he doesnt have them now hyde wont turn them over until mercer is ready to leave hydes reason being security or paranoia we should be able to get those photos from mercer once hes in eritrea gianelli was speaking more for his benefit than his listeners and realized that this discussion went beyond the callers need to know he changed tack when is selome nagast going back to asmara will she be with mercer i dont know yet id guess shell be flying with mercer when i find out her travel plans ill let you know anything on your suspicions about her nothing but my intuition tells me that there is more to her than shes saying your intuition also made you sell those pictures to hyde for a fraction of what i would have paid giancarlo said acidly shell be out of washington in a few days if theres anything to discover about her i will handle it from this end more than likely your instincts are picking up the fact shes sleeping with hyde its possible but i doubt it hes a pig and shes a living goddess major donald rosen of the national reconnaissance office said it doesnt matter just keep me informed you may be able to atone for your earlier mistake gianelli hung up the phone so he mused hyde has found his expert to dig in the desert for him while it was a complication that gianelli didnt particularly relish it wasnt totally unexpected and he might be able to make it work for his own needs he would have preferred getting the medusa pictures from major rosen but hyde had beat him to them now he had to try and steal them from mercer in asmara he thought about taking both mercer and the pictures and using the american as his own prospector giancarlo currently had people scouring the eritrean wastelands but his teams certainly didnt have mercers expertise taking mercer alive however wasnt the priority the pictures were he reached for the phone again to put into motion just such a plan recalling how it had all started eritrea had been an italian colony starting at the end of the nineteenth century and had been the major staging point for their conquest of ethiopia in that war had been particularly brutal fought between a modern mechanized army on one side and horse soldiers on the other the outcome was almost inevitable especially after the league of nations imposed an arms embargo on the region that italy with her own weapons manufacturers including the gianellis totally ignored soon after taking power and long before the war that preluded world war two mussolini had set about creating a modern nation in the hardscrabble desert for decades there were fortunes made in eritrea and it happened that gianellis family made most of them such was their interest in eritrea that giancarlos greatuncle enrico had lived in a villa outside asmara and ran much of the country as a virtual slave state enrico was not as shrewd as his older brother who ran the entire corporation but he was a gianelli and knew how to wring profits from every venture plantations of fruit trees and coffee timber salt production and the importation of amenities for eritreas growing italian population however enrico did have one interest outside the familys traditional spheres that he pursued vigorously he was an amateur geologist and spent countless months casting about the countryside in search of raw minerals hed convinced himself and to a much lesser extent his older brother that there was gold in the mountains near the border with sudan enrico spent a fortune digging into nearly every mountain that looked interesting he kept poor records of his work and most mines were abandoned and forgotten the day they proved barren frustrated his elder brother finally ordered enrico to stop wasting money and resources on his foolish hobby but this just made enrico redouble his efforts there was one particular mining venture that he was certain would prove valuable he believed he had found not gold but diamonds giancarlo had all of the family papers concerning enricos folly as it was called and had studied them as a child captivated by the legend but none of them ever told where this particular shaft had been sunk enrico dutifully recorded legitimate aspects of his business affairs but withheld information about the mine just after new years of it was found that enrico had been falsifying the account ledgers to cover up the fact that his fabled diamond mine had cost more than all his other ventures combined and put a severe dent in the gianellis profits from the colony he was recalled to italy immediately the family patron even sent a private plane with fighter escort to ensure that enrico returned this happened the same time as the british under general platt were sweeping into eritrea enrico had cabled saying he was looking forward to returning to venice not only to get away from the fighting but also to talk with his brother about the mine giancarlo had read that particular cable many many times because it was the last anyone ever heard from enrico the plane to take him home was shot down over the mediterranean by british hurricane fighters and all knowledge of the mine was lost with it as a boy giancarlo had promised himself that someday he would return to eritrea and find enricos diamond mine the dream never left him but it would be years before he could fulfill it by the time he was in a position to pursue the legend he was occupied with the rest of the company and his family at times during his career hed been tempted to mount a search but eritreas war for independence was raging and the likeliest areas for the exploration were some of the most hotly contested and oftbombed regions in the country also even decades after italys brutal occupation the name gianelli was still cursed in eritrea and he doubted they would welcome his investigation but with the independence struggle over and his obligations to his family coming to a close with his daughters wedding he knew that now was the time expense on this venture meant nothinga billion lira ten billion what did it matter all of his life he had done what was expected of him but this once like enrico he wanted something for himself if he was successful he had a plan to make this a very lucrative venture though timing would be critical the diamond syndicate in london had a major meeting in two months and gianelli needed to be able to show them a lot of stones several thousand carats at least if he was to force them to accept his demands he had already divested himself of all south african stocks because if he pulled this off that country would become a financial sinkhole if he did not succeed gianelli shrugged a few accountants would scratch their heads and wonder where the money went but that was it giancarlo really couldnt lose but he knew he would pull this off for surely what hydes satellite pictures had seen and what enrico gianelli had found were one and the same monastery of debre amlak northern eritrea the monasterys closest source of electricity was more than a hundred miles due east in the city of nacfa so any illumination after sundown came from either candles or oil lamps and both were expensive and hard to obtain with the exception of midnight mass they were used sparingly and thus life in the monastery was dictated by the rising and setting of the sun other than the latenight service it was rare to find a monk up and about in the darkness of night on the day following dawits outburst another monk only a few years younger than dawit had spoken privately with ephraim verifying what the older brother had said there were secrets here in the monastery and maybe now the time was at hand for them to be revealed since returning from his private retreat brother ephraim spent his nights praying and meditating deep into the dead hours a single candle burning in his room he had taken no food since returning from his desert walk and precious little water his eyes were glazed with exhaustion and his beard had become wild and unkempt he did not notice the stale smell of sweat on his body nor the pebbled layer of grime on his normally wellcleaned teeth a milkywhite shaft of moonlight shone through the single window of ephraims cell and fell unerringly on the ancient book set on his rough wooden desk ephraims hands rested next to the book just out of the circle of light a string of rosaries twined between his long fingers almost binding them together the book was leatherbound its two covers locked together with a tarnished brass clasp the pages were so old that they had swollen giving the book a tattered appearance even though it had been lovingly protected for eight hundred years ephraim had been given the book during the final confession of his predecessor just hours before the man had died during their exile from eritrea ephraim had sworn to the dying abbot on the sacred vows of the confessional that he would guard the book and turn it over to the next head brother when his time came under no circumstances he promised would he ever open it never would his eyes rest on the handwritten parchment within its covers even as ephraim agreed to these last requests he read the books title it was written in geez one of ethiopias ancient languages he translated the arabesquelooking script easily the shame of kings his hands had begun to tremble and the text had almost slipped from his grasp he felt like adam in the garden holding the illgotten apple the luscious fruit poised at his lips ephraim knew immediately that the book contained an evil as deadly as original sin at that moment he began to finally understand the man dying before him he turned his gaze to the frail figure lying on the simple cot so far away from their home knowing the answer but unable to prevent his eyes from asking the question yes came the breathless answer i read it and god damned me for it he damned us all i could not help myself at the time i felt as if it was gods will that i read the words and break the silence it was only when i finished on the night of november that i realized it was satan himself who seduced me into reading the book ephraim stared at him dont you recognize the date the day after i finished the shame of kings ethiopia officially annexed eritrea it was the beginning of the end for our country ephraim the ethiopian occupation the pogroms the immeasurable suffering under the dergue and it was i who caused the war my hubris brought about gods wrath he punished me for reading this book by destroying our homes laying waste to our lands and killing hundreds of thousands of our people all because i could not refuse to read what is written in that accursed book the dark companion to our greatest religious texts within the faith there were two ancient books kebra nagast the glory of kings and fetha nagast the justice of kings while largely unknown in the western world these two books predated most notable christian writings by many hundreds of years coming first from egyptian copts at least a thousand years ago the works chronicled the visit of makeda the queen of the south to the land of israel and the life of her son menyelek who was fathered by the king of israel they told of menyelek spiriting the tabernacle of the law of god from jerusalem transferring his terrestrial seat to aksum in what is now northern ethiopia the books attested that the rightful kings of ethiopia from those faroff days until the reign of haile selassie were thus the direct descendants of noah and abraham and moses the chosen children of god being a christian ephraim possessed a faith grounded in the teachings of jesus and his apostles and disciples yet his beliefs were based on a much older faith that of the jews the first believers in the one true god blessed even if they did not see christ as his son while unfamiliar with later jewish works like the talmud ephraim knew well the earlier teachings believing strongly in the old testament and the kebra nagast and the fetha nagast the validity of what was written in the kebra nagast had been a point of contention among religious scholars soon after its discovery but in the nineteenth century western missionaries returned from africa with tales of blackskinned jews living in ethiopia who practiced a much older and some said purer version of the faith the question of whether these people called falashasoutsiderswere really jewish was answered in when israel executed operation moses a secret program run by the mossad to bring as many falashas as possible to israel at a time when the ethiopian famine was at its worst how it came to pass that this unknown third book the shame of kings fell into the hands of the christian monastery ephraim could not say yet he sat at the bedside of the dying abbot holding the volume in one hand his other resting on the withered shoulder of the priest swear to me ephraim that you will not read it there are things within those pages that were never meant for mans eyes the old abbots voice had the strength of a guttering candle i lost my faith that night it was too much for me to believe that a god our god could allow such an outrage such an abomination i swear it to you ephraim readily agreed wishing he had not even touched the unclean work on the sanctity of your confession in the eyes of god i will never again look at this book it now lay just inches from his hands bathed in eerie moonlight ephraim knew he had to read it a cold wind rattled the fragile windowpane and flickered the nearly spent candle sitting in a pool of its own wax the weak flame cast bizarre shadows on the raw stone walls familiar shapes in the room taking on ominous dimensions he felt a chill run the length of his spine why do you test me so lord am i to be like job forced to endure hardships so you can prove to lucifer that mans love for you can not be corrupted i fear that i am not strong enough is my test not to read this book is it your will that these words are never again seen by the eyes of man or is your mission for me to read it and bring its truths to light the night wore on ephraim lighting another candle from the embers of the last filling his room with fresh light the moon tracked across the sky so that it no longer beamed onto the table but instead rested on the simple crucifix hanging over ephraims bed he stared at the image intently feeling his suffering on the cross and for the first time in days ephraim felt a lightness in his chest the answer to his dilemma was before him christ had died for our failures and to knowingly fail him was sinful but it was still to be forgiven the deed condemned not the man at almost the same instant he turned back to his desk and undid the books clasp brother dawit cried out in his sleep and died in his own room but by the time ephraim learned of this the following morning he had read the book and the death of the aged monk was no longer such a tremendous concern somewhere over the atlantic mercer sprawled across two firstclass seats his mouth agape and his jaw covered by a thin shadow of beard his flight to rome europes only major hub with connecting flights to asmara had left early so hed shaved and showered the night before he desperately needed to review his work and correlate his findings with the medusa photographs prescott hyde had finally sent him but his eyes had refused to stay open he had purchased two adjoining seats planning on using the extra space to spread the material but best intentions are just that intentions he fell asleep even before the jetliner took off mercers sleep was troubled and every once in a while a flight attendant would check on him as he muttered aloud in his dark dreams there was a sheen of clammy sweat on his forehead when he woke his eyes were redrimmed and gummy and his mouth tasted awful he looked around the quietly humming cabin momentarily dazed trying to clear the cobwebs of sleep from his brain he was thankful to be released from his nightmares but a thought had come to him in his sleep something buried deep in his mind that vanished when he came awake once again he thought there was an inconsistency somewhere something either hyde or selome or the kidnappers had said that didnt make sense something but he didnt know what damn he caught the attention of a stewardess and ordered two black coffees and a glass of orange juice they were waiting for him when he returned from the rest room where hed cleaned himself up selome nagast was waiting for him as well an enigmatic smile on her face i hope you dont mind she batted her eyes playfully i dont have your expense account to enjoy myself with im sitting in the back with the rest of the sardines and i knew from bill that you have two firstclass seats mercer looked at her in shock why didnt you tell me you were taking this flight apart from that one meeting at tinys hed only spoken with her on the phone my expense account could have paid for another seat after all its your money im spending selome quickly grasped that mercer was making a joke and not being boorish and she smiled again i have to confess that its been a fantasy of mine to pay for a coach seat and sneak into the firstclass area and i thought diplomats always enjoy the finer amenities selome seemed to take his comment to heart they do if they represent a wealthy country im lucky when my government can afford to send me abroad i pay for many of my missions myself mercer wondered which master she was serving now was she on a diplomatic mission for eritrea the land of her birth or a covert assignment for her adopted state of israel it was easy to figure out prescott hydes interest in this affair under the guise of his undersecretary position and spouting humanitarian platitudes he would certainly manage to reap personal financial gain as well as political cachet if mercer found diamonds but selome nagast was her motivation the betterment of some of africas poorest people those who dwelled in what is referred to as the fourth world or was she currently working for the israeli defense force or the mossad was there something darker behind her willingness to help his search they had another five hours together on the flight and maybe mercer thought he could find out never let it be said that philip mercer came between a woman and her secret fantasies he quipped but you must allow me a fantasy of my own if they ask tell the attendants that i picked you up on the plane and that youre going to have a romantic tryst with me when we land deal she shook his hand he was surprised again by the strength of her grip and the warm feel of her skin its nice to see you again mercer slid back into his seat making sure to bundle his papers into his two briefcases the last time we spoke face to face wasnt one of my most productive meetings i dont blame you for turning down bills offer its daunting to say the least i was more surprised that you changed your mind she looked into his eyes as if searching for an answer why did you agree what made you join us mercer deflected the question quickly why did you pick me in the first place thats easy youre reputed to be one of the best in the world at finding valuable minerals keep talking like that and well need another seat for my ego you didnt answer my question why did you change your mind mercer gave her his most honest look i guess you could say that going after the impossible has become one of my trademarks god does that sound pretentious but it is sort of true after i refused hyde i spent that afternoon and most of the night looking for any indication that what he was saying was true he said mixing fact with fiction while i couldnt find any proof i walked away with a gut feeling ive learned to trust them before and i just couldnt refuse this time does that mean you believe that the diamonds exist there was a breathless quality in her question no it means i dont mind spending six weeks and a lot of your money searching mercer meant to sound harsh he was not about to get trapped into giving her any false hopes the sun coming through the porthole caught the claret highlights in her hair you may convince yourself with talk like that dr mercer but you dont convince me well maybe i believe a little bit but not much he grinned tell me about yourself before responding selome ordered tea for herself and a croissant mercer downed the last of his coffee and ordered a third cup my mother is eritrean and fell hopelessly in love with an american serviceman stationed at kagnew base a us military installation on the outskirts of asmara that was used to monitor soviet communications during the cold war when my family learned of the affair my mother was forbidden from ever seeing him again but they were one night too late im glad to say or i wouldnt be here now when he learned of her pregnancy my grandfather sent my mother to italy where we have other family but she snuck back soon after i was born as i understand the story when my grandfather saw me for the first time he took me in his arms and laughed aloud when i peed on him after that i became his favorite grandchild my mother was forgiven selome nagast smiled again for the first time mercer felt she was showing her true self i went to school in italy and spent two years in london studying economics afterward i worked for the eritrean peoples liberation front in europe raising awareness of what was happening in our country i did some research on your war for independence mercer cut in and found the parties involved more than a little confusing while they may be fierce fighters my people are not known for originality selome agreed at various times during our war with ethiopia we were represented by the elf the plf and eventually the elfplf none of whom agreed with each other we wasted years with factional fighting believe me its confusing for an eritrean too there was little pride in her voice the war would have ended much earlier if we had left the political squabbling until after victory and after the war ended how did you get involved in the government asked mercer dont be offended but i know its shall i say difficult for an african woman to be as highly placed as you difficult isnt the word selome concurred her tone bitter in most african nations the only prerequisite for leadership is a penis it really isnt important if theres a brain attached to it someday africans will learn not to allow dictators and despots to rule their lives and until then well blame european colonialism and western bigotry and continue to slaughter each other wholesale harsh mercer replied but true selome rejoined quickly youve been to africa i know youve seen it she went silent for a long time he had seen her expression a hundred times it was on the local news nearly every night in dc it was the look of a mother whose child lay dead in the streets from drugrelated violence she was powerless to stop its not hopeless he said softly seeing tears at the corners of her eyes that will be up to you selome replied at least for us weve known peace for only a short time and already factionalism is starting to pull us apart religion will be the curse of eritrea not the tribalism that has torn apart a lot of other african nations but the outcome will be the same devastation muslims and christians are already rattling their sabers from church and mosque alike calling for the elimination of the other sudans muslim government isnt helping exporting their version of fanaticism bandits raid us constantly killing those who dont believe in allah have you ever been to the sudan no pray you never go ive been to the refugee camps a number of times in fact i was on the trip where those photographs bill hyde showed you were taken mercer winced remembering when we finally ousted the ethiopians they practiced a scorchedearth policy during their retreat selome explained they burned villages destroyed roads and bridges and irrigation dams they even cut down nearly every tree in the country in an effort to demoralize us the trees lining the streets in asmara are the tallest in eritrea because all others were hauled back to ethiopia no matter how bad off we were when the ethiopians withdrew it is nothing compared to the ruin found in the sudan there are roving bands of guerrillas terrorizing everyone some allied to the government others to the sudan peoples liberation army and still others that are just mercenaries looking to capitalize on the bloodshed slavery is rampant and some say government sanctioned whats the reason for their war religion the government in khartoum is islamic and has made life unbearable for those in the south who are mostly christian and animists if this war is allowed to spread we will see the same thing in eritrea and you are the key for preventing this from happening its an old axiom that hatred is the fuel of the hopeless and peace the progeny of the satisfied watching her face mercer felt confident that selome nagasts loyalties lay in her native eritrea he didnt doubt that she also worked for the israeli secret police but for this mission her only goal was the welfare of her people in africa knowing this peeled away only one layer of complication however he felt there were still depths here that he didnt know before leaving home mercer had spoken extensively with dick henna about the preliminary findings of harrys abduction the private jet that had spirited him out of washington had been chartered by a corporation in delaware but the company was just a post office box a front they had been unable to track the fleeing gulfstream except for a report that it was seen flying over marylands eastern shore low enough to burn leaves off trees they also had a sighting in liberia where it landed to refuel before continuing east the planes final destination was lebanon a cia agent arrived at the airport in beruit just in time to see an older man bundled into a van and taken away hed lost the vehicle in traffic near the citys christian quarter a mideastern connection was further confirmed by harrys few neighbors who had heard the abduction the language they described spoken by the kidnappers sounded like arabic the only neighbor to see anything reported that the four men all wore black coats and jeans and had dark complexions and dark hair all this matched with what mercer and henna had seen at the airport henna still didnt have any identification of the one kidnappers body but he assured it was only a matter of time he did however have better luck tracing the weapons the us army maintains the largest database in the world of the ballistic characteristics of various individual weapons henna explained each weapon has microscopic differences from its massproduced counterparts small flaws that affect the shape of the rounds they fired identifying these traits is painstaking but its possible to trace a single weapon from just the smallest fragments of expended bullets or shell casing the army ballistics laboratory henna said has been looking for these weapons for a while the kalishnikovs were traced back to our peacekeeping mission in lebanon in the late eighties both recovered weapons had been used against our marine garrison one gun carried by the man who jumped into the jet engine has claimed an american life before an army sergeant sitting in a cafe in near the harbor in old beruit there was that beruit connection again how the hell did they get here mercer asked good question but whats got me wondering is where have they been for the past fifteen years mercer and henna had talked about the weapons significance and that harrys kidnappers were apparently islamic fanaticswho but a fanatic would allow himself to be sucked into a jet enginebut neither man could explain how these facts meshed with a potential diamond mine in africa selomes affiliation with israel only deepened the mess but having talked with her as the boeing hurtled across the atlantic he felt certain that her interest was with eritrea not israel are you okay selome placed her hand on his wrist a reassuring touch you faded away for a moment and it looked like you were in pain im all right mercer lied he so wanted to talk with her with anyone really bottling up his concern for harry was tearing him apart he noticed selomes hand on his arm her fingernails were as long as stilettos bloodred from multiple coats of varnish she saw mercer staring at her hand and let it lie there a moment longer before withdrawing it he looked at her with a kind of longing not of desire but of the need to express himself he wanted to trust her so he could release some of what he held inside he wanted to tell her about harry and about how it was his fault that hed been kidnapped and beaten he needed to talk but he just looked at her mutely his pain must have been obvious because she reached over and caressed his cheek it was an intimate gesture that surprised them both im all right mercer said again feeling something new sparked by that touch he found he couldnt look her in the eye this could be a real complication he thought southern lebanon harry white woke with a raging thirst not for water but for bourbon hed consumed at least two bottles of tennessee whiskey a week for years though he rarely got drunkhis tolerance having been built up over the yearshis body needed liquor as surely as it needed oxygen his hands trembled adding a new agony to his broken but splintered finger for the first few days after his abduction hed been sufficiently drugged so he didnt know how long it had been since alcohol had passed his lips but after a couple of conscious hours in the cell he knew down to the second every waking moment was a torture crueler than anything hed ever conceived of he shivered in the twelvebytwelve room despite the heat that soaked through the stone walls and beaded his body with perspiration he kept the ragged blanket hed been given clutched around his bony shoulders his need for a drink was an overpowering craving that was driving his mind beyond the realm of sanity he used the blanket not only to ward off the chills but also to protect him from the flying monkeys that circled the room with the maddening persistence of hornets he knew they were a dtcreated hallucination but they were terrifying nevertheless hed seen the first one only an hour after waking and had called out in horror the rational part of his mind told him it wasnt real but he was too weak to prevent its wheeling attack a guard had come to check on him a red and white kefflaya headdress covering his features as harry cowered the man determined that nothing was wrong and left the monkey clung to the wall near where it joined the ceiling and winked two more appeared to terrorize him they flew at him without mercy breaking off their aerial charges just inches from his face he could feel the air move from their swift passage and their unearthly screeches were like nails drawn across a chalkboard they would swoop by briefly and then land on the walls their sharp little claws digging into the stone none of the monkeys had touched him yet but it was only a matter of time theres no place like tinys he moaned aloud praying the invocation would transport him away from here after three long hours his hallucinations ended and harry fell into a nightmarish sleep more haunting than his periods of wakefulness demons more cunning than the monkeys were after him chasing him down an endless hallway they carried bottles of jack daniels which they tried to pass to him like relay runners but the bottles slipped out of harrys hands when he woke his mind had cleared some a breakfast tray lay on the floor near the bed the coffee still steaming his stomach was too knotted to eat the fruit or the jamsmeared bread but he drank the coffee quickly and then his lungs reminded him that hed smoked a couple packs a day for the past six decades and he wanted a cigarette needed one for the love of god you sadistic sons of bitches give me a smoke he yelled the guard appeared again and harry repeated his request with a little more civility shouting just a few decibels quieter the guard didnt seem to understand the words so the octogenarian pantomimed smoking a cigarette with a sympathy known by smokers the world over the guard pulled a halfempty pack from his pocket and tossed them on the floor with a book of matches how about some booze you bastard harry said halfheartedly as he scooped up the rumpled pack the splint made it difficult to light one of the cigarettes and it took him several tries as the nicotine coursed through his system he looked at the monkey that had appeared on the wall again its teeth bared in an aggressive display screw you too harry said to the apparition a filterless cigarette hanging from his lips he knew from experience that the dts would pass quickly and the monkeys wouldnt bother him much longer he sat back on the bed keeping one eye on the monkey just in case and massaged his injured hand he didnt know where he was or who had grabbed him or even why he hadnt seen the guards face but the colorful headdress made him pretty sure they were arabs and that his abduction involved mercer and his search for the diamond vent harry chuckled darkly hed seen what mercer was capable of when he was riled and knew that his kidnappers were going to pay still harry wasnt the type to sit back and wait to be rescued hed gotten himself out of a few tough scrapes before former senator john glenn was only three years younger when he went into space he thought if glenn could pull that one off surely he could escape this bunch the guard had given him cigarettes and it was only a matter of time before harry figured a way to get the man to give him his freedom too washington dc dick henna was at his desk when his secretary buzzed his intercom and told him he had a call that should not be ignored who is it susan the investigation into the dulles attack had more than eaten up the time hed saved by not going to california the day was just starting and already he felt behind admiral morrison i know you dont want to be disturbed but i thought youd want to take this one i guess maybe i do henna knew c thomas morrison the charismatic chairman of the joint chiefs both professionally and in washingtons social scene and had always liked and respected him knowing that morrison was going to be a strong presidential contender in the next elections and possibly his boss if he won henna adopted a respectful tone admiral dick henna here what can i do for you hello dick how you doing if informality was what the africanamerican naval officer wanted henna was more than happy to comply fine tom fine how are you i was doing great until a couple of hours ago morrison replied somberly a problems come up thats going to involve your office sooner or later and i thought it best to bring you in on the ground floor shoot henna invited im sitting here with colonel john baines from the air forces criminal investigations division and hes much better suited to speak legalese with you than i am id like to get the three of us together henna felt the beginnings of political strongarming like the military the fbi had chains of command and henna felt that morrison was using his clout to go straight to the top listen tom i appreciate that you want to bring this to me directly but is this something that should be going to marge doyles office or another assistant directors i know what youre thinking morrisons voice took on a brittle edge lets just say even this little chat falls into the ultra top secret category henna whistled softly the government had no higher classification in fact several presidents had been denied access to uts documents most recently former president clintons request to read the real file on the roswell new mexico incident dick you dont know me well enough to know that i dont make idle calls and that i never go outside the military unless absolutely necessary henna looked up at the seth thomas clock against the far wall of his office all right i can give you an hour at about eleven this cant wait im calling from my car phone well be at the hoover building in ten minutes morrison hung up before henna could protest eleven minutes later hennas secretary showed the two officers into his office admiral morrisons black uniform only a shade darker than his skin was covered with gold braid decorations and a chestful of combat medals he cut the perfect image of a sailor hard and straight with an imperious bearing that cracked into a smile when he strode across the room to shake hennas hand colonel baines in his air force blues looked lusterless next to the admiral his uniform nearly bereft of commendations where morrison was tall and goodlooking baines was shrunken his voice barely above an apologetic whisper only his eyes betrayed the shrewd mind beneath the unassuming exterior wont you both sit down henna decided his irritation of this intrusion wasnt important and tell me whats so secret and urgent colonel morrison said indicating that baines should take point in this conversation mr henna i ah baines stammered then paused for a moment as if to collect his thoughts well it started nearly three years ago when my office was tasked with stemming the flow of classified material streaming out of the national reconnaissance office the nro is one of the most secret organizations in the government and was allowed to use their own internal security for the protection of sensitive material they did an exemplary job for years however after the collapse of the soviet union secrets began leaking the air force has more personnel seconded to the nro than any other branch and we were instructed to put an end to the leaks are we talking about another aldrich ames case here like what happened at the cia henna interrupted in a way though there didnt seem to be any political motivation behind the thefts our threat came from opportunistic employees using information for profit what kind of secrets are we talking about let me give you an example of an arrest we made two years ago a secretary for one of the nros satellite photograph analysts had a husband who traded futures on the chicago mercantile exchange using information from our keyhole spy bird she was able to tell him that argentina was about to suffer a severe loss of their winter wheat crop due to an insect infestation using that information he made something like twentyseven million dollars selling wheat futures short before the knowledge was made generally available so were talking stock fraud henna settled back in his seat hed been thinking that this had to do with mercer and harry white and was relieved that apparently it didnt in that case yes we brought in the securities and exchange commission to handle the public side of the investigation they made the arrest keeping nros involvement a secret both husband and wife will be out of prison sometime at the end of the next century baines spoke more confidently now anyway thats just one example other cases we found were perpetrated by military personnel and arrests were handled through the judge advocate generals office baines paused again and the fbi director knew that the colonel was getting to the heart of the matter six weeks ago a case came across our desk one that took us until the day before yesterday to crack we made an arrest and learned the case has much wider implications than any previous i felt it prudent to include civilian authorities notably your office as soon as possible my commanding officer agreed and subsequently briefed admiral morrison it was the admirals idea that you and i meet before i continue with my investigations morrison interrupted the younger man some material was stolen from an archive at the nro the air force major who perpetrated the theft donald rosen was arrested last night and is looking at about five hundred years in prison for his crime the materials were photographs that had been sent to his office by mistake he recognized their ultra top secret classification and stole them heads have already rolled for the screwup that put the pictures on his desk in the first place but thats an internal matter baines took up the story again he held on to the pictures for only a week before finding a buyer selling them for a mere five hundred thousand dollars you have to realize were talking about military secrets that could compromise a very delicate ongoing program their potential value is incalculable henna suddenly knew precisely where the conversation was headed let me guess you want us to handle the investigation into undersecretary of state prescott hyde and determine exactly what he did with the medusa photographs he could have thrown a live cobra on the floor and gotten a more relaxed reaction from the two men how much more do you know morrison was the first to find his voice though he could not hide his astonishment he had jumped to his feet tom sit down for christs sake henna said your secret is still safe as far as i know only a handful of people are aware of the medusa pictures you dont understand there are three medusas orbiting the earth as we speak do you think a nation like china would sit idle knowing the capabilities of our newestgeneration spy satellite shit the pictures hyde bought were from the first prototype and that thing was a dinosaur compared to the latest ones theres a lot more at stake than a handful of photographs of the sahara desert yeah there is henna saw that the conspiracy around harrys kidnapping was taking another turn for the worse stolen pictures from the nro jesus well get to that in a minute tell me what happened next rosen must have realized his asking price was too low after selling them to hyde baines continued between the sale and his apprehension he contacted someone in europe we have no way of knowing exactly who because the calls went to an encryption exchange but we narrowed the field to italy greece yugoslavia or albania ill be damned henna interrupted thinking about the religious wars raging in albania and the former yugoslav states was this another connection to islamic terrorists like the charter flight to beruit what finish your story and ill tell you mine there were a dozen calls of various durations the final one only hours before rosen was arrested morrison said that is one side of the investigation that well handle ourselves possibly using the cia and interpol if anything shows promise but we wanted to come to you with prescott hyde he works for the government but hes a civilian so were going to need your office to spearhead the investigation the investigation is already underway henna snorted in fact i think weve got enough to bring the son of a bitch in for formal questioning do you remember philip mercer the guy who handled the crisis in hawaii and the one in alaska too he has the pictures and is on his way to africa with them eritrea specifically he left early this morning henna spent the next half hour detailing mercers involvement with prescott hyde from the initial approach to search for the diamonds through harry whites kidnapping and the subsequent shootout at dulles did anyone from nro do a hard analysis of the pictures he asked in conclusion no not really morrison admitted the bird hadnt been calibrated when we lost her the pics looked like a bunch of junk to our people well theyre not junk to the group who perpetrated that attack at dulles we need to get that material back not only is it highly classified but its also evidence baines said no what we need to do is haul in prescott hyde i mean today right now and then let mercer figure out just what the hell is going on dick we can help eritrea later dig up the diamonds in a few months or something we have to get those pictures back morrisons voice was backed with every ounce of command in his body but henna didnt even blink tom if you want to pick up hyde on your own authority and have this make the six oclock news tonight be my guest but if you want the help of this office then we do it my way a tense minute passed the gleaming pendulum of the wall clock knifing through the time carving the seconds away all right morrison relented if we do it your way what happens now i get an arrest warrant from justice and we all go over to pay hyde the worst visit of his life morrison looked over at the still quiet baines what do you think counselor once we have hyde we can send someone to africa to get the photographs from the man mercer ass covering tom mines on the line goddamn right im going to cover it lets get it over with henna rode with morrison in the back of a bureau car baines sitting in the front with the driver three other dark sedans followed them in convoy as they headed toward fairfax virginia before leaving fbi headquarters henna phoned hydes office and determined the undersecretary wasnt at work and hadnt shown up all morning he then called hydes home but the line was disconnected fearing that hyde had already fled henna fasttracked a warrant through the justice department and put together a small team to make the arrest as they drove he sorted details in his head mentally writing items on note cards and shuffling them randomly searching for patterns it was an old trick that served him well on the first card was rosen with the stolen medusa photographs followed by their purchase by hyde after that everything could fit together any number of ways he wondered if after rosen sold them he was approached by a group in europe who also wanted them someone from the balkans for example it was possible that harrys neighbors heard one of those languages and not arabic when mercer refused hydes offer the terrorists had kidnapped harry to force him to go to africa to find the diamonds for them from security briefings henna knew that iran supported muslim groups in albania and serbia and also had ties to the factions in beruit the tiein was circumstantial at best but it was a good lead that still left hyde and his motivation money was the most obvious answer he was using his position at the state department to deal himself in on any potential wealth henna thought he bought the pictures himself then hired mercer for the expedition but where henna wondered would he get that kind of money and then he realized israel through selome nagast was footing the bill hyde paid for the photographs and they were paying for everything else the reasons were obvious when he considered the iranian connection israel was trying to prevent some terrorist group from securing a new font of untraceable wealth an unknown diamond mine he was thinking about his upcoming interview with hyde and knew he could use any information he got from the undersecretary to get the mossad to open up about their operation hed always felt that americas security arrangement with the jewish state was too onesided this was a perfect opportunity to level the playing field hennas first inkling of a disaster in the making came in the form of a police sirens rising doppler screaming behind the convoy an instant later a cruiser rocketed passed the fbi vehicles in a bejeweled blur its bubble lights flashing sapphire and ruby they were on the little river turnpike just beyond the beltway and the police car raced through traffic lights with little more than a tap on its brakes another siren was approaching fast because of traffic it took them a further twenty minutes to get to the residential neighborhood where hyde had his home it was an affluent subdivision each four and fivebedroom house built on more than an acre of land with plenty of old trees to shield neighbor from neighbor the newly macadamed streets were spotlessly clean and the telephone poles had yet to darken with the patina of age the closer they got to hydes street the darker the sky became and the thicker became the awful stench of burned wood and melted plastic beginning ten houses from hydes the street looked like a riot scene the police had established a cordon behind which the curious gathered anxiously hennas credentials got him through with only a moments delay and they drove on the car weaving around police cruisers fire engines and idling ambulances in a slow slalom when the breeze tugged at the clouds of smoke they could see the bright inferno that had been prescott hydes slice of the good life hennas selfsatisfaction disappeared he was no arson specialist but he knew enough to realize that an accelerant no doubt gasoline had been used to start the fire and was still burning hydes house would have been soaked through to create a conflagration of this size given the number of emergency vehicles on the scene the fire must have been called in half an hour ago or earlier the driver eased the sedan to a stop two hundred feet from the fire close enough for them to feel the heat from the blaze as they stepped from the vehicle even as henna watched a section of roof collapsed into the churning guts of the building sending up a fireworks display of popping sparks and burning bits of paper and fabric the air was laced with the petrochemical stench of melting roof shingles making henna close his eyes when the wind shifted into his face two pumper trucks siphoned water from separate hydrants and showered the house with ballooning arcs but still the place burned heat washed off the building in visible waves the structure was a total loss the siding had burned through in places to reveal the skeletal fingers of the houses framing on the far side of the house had stood a chimney but all that remained was a sevenfoot stump the rest of it lay across the charred lawn in an elongated pile of debris henna saw his theories burning in the fire without hyde there was no case and all the theorizing in the world wouldnt change that fact he had no doubt that when the house cooled they would discover the undersecretarys body amid the ruins youre henna the question came from a fireman much older than those fighting the blaze his face was weathered like tree bark and when he pulled off his helmet his hair was pure white the cop at the barricade radioed me you were here mind telling me why the director of the federal bureau of investigation is here with the chairman of the joint chiefs henna figured the man was the commander of fairfaxs fire department he put out his hand i cant tell you the particulars right now im sorry the fireman had a tight grip his hands deeply callused anyone in there not alive if thats what youre asking the fireman turned to look at the fire over his broad shoulder judging by the two cars smoldering in the driveway id say the house was occupied the forensic teams may be able to scrape a few bits of bone and some goo into a bag but dont expect much whats your read henna asked some squirrel killed the occupants then torched the house to cover his tracks or delay the investigation itll take a while but well find its a case of murder henna nodded his eyes naturally drawn to the walls of fire that erupted from the house hed known it at the first police siren but hadnt wanted it to be true whoever was responsible middle eastern terrorists or balkan extremists it was clear they were one step ahead and with hyde out of the way their tracks were well covered until he could contact mercer he could only hope his friend knew what he was doing because right now henna certainly didnt when do you think you can get some men in there to verify colonel baines asked the chief looked back at the fire just in time to see a wall fall outward to the lawn an explosion of flame and wood that drove his men back half a dozen yards we may not get a team in there until after midnight anything we can do to help yeah make it rain the chief turned away to rejoin his men leaving henna and morrison and baines alone with their questions leonardo da vinci airport rome italy mercer and selome walked side by side toward the ethiopian airline gate for their flight to asmara mercer carried his two matching briefcases while selome sported a slender leather valise hanging from a shoulder strap her long legs matched mercers pace both of them striding through the crowds in an effort to stretch their cramped muscles they joked easily regaling each other with horror stories from past flights at the ethiopian airlines counter selome switched from english to amharic when she addressed the willowy ticket agent mercer listened in for several seconds before realizing he couldnt understand a word she turned to him asking for his ticket which he quickly produced selome and the agent spoke again their voices rising before selome seemed satisfied selome was scowling when she led him away from the counter over half of the two hundred waiting room seats were occupied all the passengers either eritrean or ethiopian looking at their faces mercer realized that selomes exquisite beauty and her thick hair were more the norm that the exception there were a number of older women wrinkled and bowed by life but the younger ones were all attractive on the other hand the men were slight too delicate to be considered handsome be thankful i was here selome said as she and mercer took seats they had you as a standby passenger for coach you might have been bumped from the flight if i hadnt checked you in i doubt that witch at the counter she tossed her headwas going to tell you until you tried to board the plane you sound like youre not coming with me selome nodded her hair cascading over her face she tamed it with a flick of her wrist ive got a meeting in london tomorrow ill meet up with you in asmara the day after i never askedwhere are you staying mercer took this news in stride the hotel ambassoira good choice one of our countrys finest but dont expect too much she cautioned the ambasoira was built during the occupation ethiopias no italys the hotel dates back to the twenties she grinned and unless youre a masochist avoid their coffee and never take the plumbing for granted i believe that habte makkonen is going to meet you at the airport i dont know him but im sure youll be fine she slung her bag over her shoulder and stood extending her hand to mercer he felt he was being dismissed the rapport they had built during the transatlantic flight was gone replaced by a brusque professionalism he hadnt seen from her before well then mercer stood formally i guess ill see you in a couple of days unexpectedly selome stepped close to him and kissed him on the cheek dont think this was my idea ill see you at the ambasoira the day after next she was gone in a flash not if i dont see you first mercer said under his breath his gray eyes hardening as he watched her cut a swath through the terminal he returned to the same agent at the ticket counter im terribly sorry about all that his smile was disarming as he laid his ticket on the counter im afraid there was a slight language problem i called the airline this morning to say that i wanted to take a later flight and im afraid my traveling partner didnt understand i want to be on tonights flight which i believe arrives at pm local time in fact mercer had been booked on this flight but had changed his reservations with a call from the air italia plane when selome had gone to the rest room hed had a lingering suspicion that she might ditch him once they got to rome and he needed the time to track her movements he had an idea where she was really going just because he believed her motivation didnt necessarily mean he believed her i understand the agent pouted enjoying a singular female delight in the discredit of another these sorts of things happen all the time her nails clicked on the computer keys for a moment before handing mercer a new ticket there you are tonights flight departing at and arriving at pm i even managed to get you a firstclass upgrade at no additional cost our night flight isnt nearly as booked as this afternoons thank you so much mercer said one more question where does el al have their waiting area at the end of this concourse to your right i believe mercer thanked her again and took off down the hallway his stride purposeful there was no need for him to hurry he was certain selome would be in the israeli national airlines waiting room but he felt an anger building that needed an outlet nearing his destination he slowed blending in with the crowd so that he walked past the el al waiting room shielded by a halfdozen people he scanned the room once and then looked again selome wasnt there a flight was boarding and mercer cursed himself for being too late but then saw the flights destination was lisbon he was sure she wasnt going to portugal he continued down the corridor until he came to a cluster of television monitors directing his attention at the ones displaying departures he saw that el al had a flight to tel avivs ben gurion airport in ninety minutes he spent the time in a crowded smoky bar at the other end of the terminal as far from the el al departure lounge as possible in case selome was waiting in a similar fashion the two gimlets he drank cost twelve dollars each and he was thankful that european bartenders didnt expect tips because he wasnt in the mood to show his gratitude he wasnt really in the mood for the drinks either but he needed something to dilute the bitterness that scalded the back of his throat hed been lied to by some of the best but selome nagast was worldclass he had fallen for her story from the moment she sat next to him on the plane and all along he should have known it was a setup bitch he muttered more angry at himself than at her he grabbed his two cases and started back down the concourse if he couldnt trust selome or prescott call me bill hyde he was totally alone for all he knew the man sent to meet him in africa habte makkonen was being paid to put a knife between his ribs at the arrival gate nearing the departure area again mercer studied the crowd selome sat with her back to him her face in a onequarter profile looking out the windows at the white and blue jetliner waiting to take her to israel and her shadowy masters knowing that his earliest suspicions were correct deepened his black mood he took up a position where he could watch her while shielded from her view he considered the connection between harrys abduction by beruitlinked terrorists with an israeli agent trying to gain his trust mercer knew the israelis were interested in all aspects of terrorism that might affect their country but how did harryand for that matter himselffit into the mix whatever the relation he knew the consequences were potentially deadly in the middle east being caught between arab and israeli could be a death sentence when threatened both sides tended to shoot first and apologize for the innocents caught in the cross fire later if ever how did a generationslong war between muslim and jew affect what he was trying to accomplish in eritrea he wondered there was the possibility of billions of dollars if he could find a diamondbearing pipe but how could israel or a muslim extremist group benefit from such wealth when it was located a thousand miles away from the mideast his answer slipped away with selome as she walked down the embarkation tunnel mercer jerked his head upward at a ceilingmounted speaker when he thought he heard his name the message was repeated translated from italian to english in the same female monotone passenger dr philip mercer please pick up a white phone for a message there was a bank of phones a few paces away this is philip mercer uno momento per favore a male voice came on the line one that mercer didnt recognize we have some things to discuss dr mercer some items that if not addressed now will mean an increased level of discomfort for a friend of yours oh jesus his stomach tightened and an adrenal surge made his limbs tingle is harry okay what happened at dulles will not go unpunished but you will not suffer the consequences harry white will pay consider that im not going to kill him outright as your final warning if you make any attempt to find him or assault us he will die more horribly than you can imagine th call had come just seconds after selome had left the waiting area mercer realized and that couldnt be a coincidence two ideas sprang to his mind harrys kidnappers didnt want selome to know that mercer was still in the airport following her and mercer started looking around the concourse searching for someone on one of the countless pay phones or speaking into a cellular model well done dr mercer you are being watched i am nearby and if you continue to look for me i promise that harry white wont live to see the sun set tonight mercer froze the kidnapper was only a few paces away he could almost feel eyes on the back of his neck and unconsciously he slouched trying to present as small a target as possible he knew they werent after his lifeit was an instinctive gesture since i didnt want her around when i contacted you youve probably guessed that i also have a warning about the nubile miss nagast all i have to say is that if she is harmed in any way if you confront her with your discovery about her israeli connection or if you try to back out on your deal with her and prescott hyde harry white will die you may not believe this but she is the only person you can trust right now you and she share the same goal dr mercer and that is my goal as well we can all work together to find that diamond mine or i can work alone and you and selome nagast and harry white will be cast aside like so much garbage the choice is yours nod your head if you understand mercer did as ordered though he really didnt understand at all you will be contacted again at the ambasoira hotel in two days a protocol will be established at that time for us to receive updates on your progress and remember miss nagast is your strongest ally after i hang up you are to remain where you are do not turn around another member of my team is watching you as well if he sees you twitch you will not leave this airport alive the phone went dead and mercer stood unmoving for a few moments waiting for the caller to get out of visual range he didnt believe that there was another watcher but he wasnt about to test it ibriham was fifty yards away watching mercer through a cameras zoom lens the cellular phone already in his jacket pocket mercer waited as ordered the leader of the college park operation grunted with satisfaction and casually turned away merging with the ebb and flow of the crowds he had remained in america following the disastrous extraction of harry white to sever any possible connections between his team and the airport shootout still it was only a matter of time before their presence and their identifications were made by the fbi the men who lost their lives and the weapons theyd left behind would certainly betray them ibriham could only hope the carefully laid false clues the guns and the languages theyd intentionally used when taking white would lead the federal bureau down a long tangent ibriham had stayed at a washington area hotel keeping a rough watch on mercer following the dulles fiasco it took a little work to catch the same flight to rome on such short notice but he had a crack staff backing him at home like any experienced field operative he knew that even the best plans fell apart soon after the opening gambit one can anticipate the initial moves of an opponent plan contingencies a dozen moves in advance but when the counter finally comes and from an unexpected quarter the game must be rethought immediately an entirely new strategy developed and executed without delay when he had started he was an entire game ahead of philip mercer but the american was catching up fast ibriham still had the advantage but he no longer knew how long he could keep it extending his protection to selome nagast was a calculated risk one that could backfire all too easily ibriham and his team were walking a fine linehed known that since accepting this missionand every day and with every new development it got more perilous yet if mercer found the mine ibriham couldnt calculate how much it would mean to his people certainly it would redouble their commitment to their god not just in the middle east but all over the worldto actually possess a relic from the past lost for thousands of years a piece of history that had been fabled for eons the prophet of the one true god had heard his words and took them to his people and it was just possible that ibriham could get the exact text handed to man through divine locution he heard a disturbance behind him and turned to see the source as he did a scream tore across the general hum of conversation on the concourse behind him a man had pulled a shortnosed machine pistol from under his jacket ibriham had no time to react before the man pulled the trigger firing indiscriminately unknown to him the watcher of philip mercer had himself been watched the ferocity and surprise of the attack startled him for less than a second his training took over as his brain went on automatic the first few rounds went wild tearing into the floor and the wall to ibrihams right a television monitor exploding in a shower of glass and sparks ibriham dove to his left hitting the carpet and rolling away from the spray of bullets but he was too exposed to make it to cover alive and without a weapon of his own he had no defense he saw the gunman adjust his aim zeroing in one woman took two slugs in the chest that punched her backward as though shed been a puppet on a string two more people went down slick blood splashing the floor in obscene stains ibriham rolled again catching a moments respite behind the fallen body of an overweight man in a tan trench coat four quick rounds pounded the corpse another shot caught him in the calf and despite his years of combat experience ibriham shifted himself slightly to take pressure off the wounded leg his movement forced his torso off the floor for a just an instant and the next burst from the automatic caught him high in the chest lead penetrating deep into his body searing what little tissue remained intact it was a race between shock and blood loss to see what would kill him first his heart stopped when there was no fluid left in his body to pump the gunman a tall african dressed as a worker for an airline catering service twisted toward the window facing the apron and fired the last of his clip the machine pistol buzzing like a chain saw until the bolt crashed against an empty chamber the huge slab of doubleplated glass exploded blasted onto the taxiway below in an avalanche four and a half seconds had elapsed from the moment the gunman revealed his weapon until the glass wall disintegrated amid the pandemonium the gunman leapt through the shattered window dropping twenty feet to the asphalt below no one had the courage to look out and see him running before he dodged out of sight under the low belly of a boeing moments after the attack he stripped out of the food service uniform underneath he wore the coveralls of a janitor he became anonymous and melted away another immigrant performing the menial labor that few europeans were willing to do mercer reached the bloody scene only a few seconds after the gunman had made his escape his heart was pumping at first hed thought the gunfire had been directed at him he hardened himself to the death around him and examined each of the victims closely of the five dead his gaze concentrated on one in particularthe body of the only man who fit the description of those who had kidnapped harry he found a cell phone in the dead mans jacket he looked at the phone and then at the mans bloodsmeared face committing it to memory well meet in hell mercer said under his breath and then youll really wish youd never died he was gone before airport security and the carabinieri arrived asmara eritrea if asked habte makkonen said he was a carpenter by trade if pressed he acknowledged that he had done some work in the openpit copper mine the japanese had run in southern eritrea during the ethiopian occupation it wasnt in his nature to conceal the truth from people but it was his practice to maintain his privacy it was a survivors mentality and habte was a survivor it was a skill learned in his youth and a trait that continued to shape him into adulthood there was a quiet reserve about him that kept him permanently and intentionally separated from everyone he met few people knew his record during the war of liberation and they were all on the eritrean side of the ethiopian cuban and russian soldiers hed faced during his fifteen years under arms few were alive to talk about him one of the greatest soldiers to come out of the war that he had survived the war unscathed physically was a miracle habte had devoted himself to securing a life of freedom for his people but it seemed he himself had no place in the world he had helped create he kept himself aloof purposely believing that one day the fragile peace would come crashing back down around him he would not allow himself to share in the postwar calm for he knew too well its price and also its frailty at five foot eight inches thin under his black leather coat he did not look like one of the most dangerous men in africa though he had a confirmed record of seventyfive kills he smoked nervously his fingers in constant motion bringing cigarette after cigarette to his thin lips his hands were too long for his body alien appendages probing outward from the sleeves of his coat under his sharp nose was a thin wisp of mustache little more than a carefully groomed five oclock shadow habte was not handsome in the traditional western sense but there was something compelling about him which caught the attention of those waiting for the flight from rome with him he held himself apart from the crowd even while he was in the thick of it hed been told once by a comrade that his eyes possessed a gaze that made a thousandyard stare seem shortsighted hed scoffed at the notion but anyone paying him attention would have agreed the crowd perceived that he was someone of importance and left him alone an island amid the press of humanity waiting for the ethiopian airlines flight asmaras airport was an ambitious building constructed several years before with an optimism for eritreas future that had yet to come to pass it could handle four times the volume of traffic that currently used the facility the onestory terminal was built with cement yet still it shook as the rome flight powered over the runway a cheer went up among the waiting crowd because the flight had been delayed in europe some instinct made habte tense as people surged toward the windows in anticipation of rejoining loved ones a group of sudanese refugees waited at the back of the crowd it wasnt unusual that they were all men in their society women were rarely allowed in public what caught habtes attention was their grim expressions and the fact they were all well dressed slacks and opencollared shirts their appearance was incongruous enough to alert him and as he looked carefully he realized they were shifta sudanese bandits habte had spent enough time as a soldier to recognize them as combatants he casually drifted back into the crowd until he stood behind and just to the left of the four sudanese at this range he could see that one of them held a piece of paper in his hand a fax sheet imprinted with a photograph of a caucasian male he recognized the face from selome nagasts description of philip mercer he could also see the bulge of a weapon under the untucked tail of the mans shirt as passengers began streaming into the terminal the sudanese guerrilla scanned each face eyes darting from the travelers to the picture a single white man entered from the tarmac the last passenger to deplane the sudanese and habte recognized the face at the same instant of the two hundred and fifty people packed into the crowed room only he felt the tension that fouled the air habte felt powerless he was not armed for guns were outlawed in eritrea and he did not have enough faith in the two bored soldiers watching the debarkation to help him when mercer came within the reach of the shifta the war had been over for too long habte had become soft just a few years ago he could have come up with a tactical plan instantly now he found himself standing idly as mercer came closer to the head of the customs line briefcases hanging from both hands the leader of the sudanese terrorists bunched the picture in one fist his other hand rested on the pistol tucked into his belt thinking that he could reach mercer before the shifta made their move habte launched himself across the terminal floor shouldering aside families still in the rapture of reunion no sooner had he made his move than the leader of the bandits also started forward not quite as moderate in thrusting away those who stood in his way he did not appear to notice that habte shared his interest in the white passenger his three comrades followed suit unknowingly vectoring to cut off habtes advance mercer stood at the customs deck his cases at his feet and his passport spread before him the distinctive pale pink eritrean visa sticker prominently displayed on the page awaiting an official stamp habte increased his pace to get ahead of the bandits and stole a quick glance behind him to see that the shiftas pistol was still out of view so these men did not want to see the american killed he thought that gave him latitude he hadnt realized he possessed habte turned sharply but the crowd slowed his momentum he raised one fist and punched with all the force of his spin it was enough to send the nearest sudanese to the floor his jaw either broken or severely dislocated several women screamed habte took advantage of the confusion twisting so he was in range of another of the shifta still keeping himself away from the armed leader he let his wristwatch slide down to his hand so its face stretched across his knuckles then pounded it into the sudaneses face three rapid blows dropped the man his mouth and cheeks bloodied and deeply scarred by the watchs sharp bezel the two eritrean soldiers guarding the arrivals lounge came alive shouting over the din and racing across the room weapons held low to better push aside the people who were in their way mercer came through the gate oblivious to the tumult before the shifta leader could react habte grabbed mercer by the wrist a shot rang out a concussive explosion that echoed painfully towing his charge habte ducked and dashed out the doors of the terminal he owned a fiat sedan and mercer was just barely in the rear passenger seat when habte gunned the engine kicking up twin spirals of dust from the unpaved road welcome to eritrea dr mercer my name is habte makkonen habte said relieved and amazed to be away from the airport it would take hours for the authorities to sort out what had just happened if they even bothered to try je ne comprend pas je mappelle claude quesnel habtes passenger was near hysterics as he spoke in rapidfire french questce que se passe maintenant et qui est docteur mercier rome italy the dark rain came in winddriven sheets that shrouded a set of warehouses near the airport it pelted the metal roofs and sides of the huge buildings like hail so loudly that even the shriek of distant jets was reduced to a background whine the air was cold too cold for april the storm had come in from the north an unusual phenomenon ripping the icy layer of air off the alps like a katabatic wind so that sleet mixed with the rain the weather made the hour around midnight particularly black and ominous the warehouses were owned by one of giancarlo gianellis many companies as was the limousine that glided to one of them they were bonded buildings meaning the warehouses contents had already passed customs and were thus to be kept secure customs officials guarded the warehouses as they did similar transshipment points all over europe and abroad but the right amount of lire in the right pockets ensured laxity in tonights vigil diesel trucks were lined up outside the building many with trailers ready for loading in the darkness they looked like prehistoric beasts slumbering through the night the multiple warehouse doors were designed to admit the behemoths gaping holes that could be opened with a signal from a transmitter the guard riding in the mercedes front seat held such a device and one door clattered upward only when the door was closed again did the driver step from the vehicle and open the rear door for his important charge as if choreographed the instant gianellis feet touched the floor a hundred lights snapped on they buzzed for a moment before coming to full illumination bathing the warehouse in harsh white light gianelli straightened the drape of his floorlength overcoat making certain that the fourthousanddollar garment did not touch the oily stains on the concrete his suit underneath cost an equal amount despite his rough surroundings gianelli looked as elegant as usualnot a hair out of place or a wrinkle on his clothing rows of boxes and crates were stacked twenty feet high lining the walls of the warehouse and creating parallel aisles just wide enough to maneuver one of the yellow forklifts parked near the loading doors the packing crates ran all the way to the back of the warehouse in one section special containers designed to maximize cargo space aboard commercial air freighters waited to be loaded or unloaded the building smelled of the storm raging outside of machinery and of the hundreds of men who usually worked here gianelli idly scanned the pallet of boxes nearest him reading the listed manifest in its protective plastic sheath within one crate were twenty million doses of antimalaria medication destined for the congo gianelli smiled tightly as he looked at the stack of identical boxes hed not known this particular pallet would be nearest him and took its presence as a good omen there actually were pills within the cases hermetically sealed in white plastic containers ready for distribution by the medical authorities of one of africas most populous nations he recalled that there were even some active ingredients in the tablets but just enough to pass an inspection if the africans ever bothered to check however most of the medication was composed of inert material the pills were worthless gianelli was selling twenty thousand dollars worth of placebos for an even million and he knew there were twenty identical loads ready for shipment twenty million dollars of profit and the only victims of his swindle were a bunch of ignorant blacks who if given the real medicine would die of something else anyway gianelli was new to the counterfeit medication trade but he was quickly working his way to its forefront an area beyond the first rows of shipping containers had been specifically cleared of crates for the night in the open space two of the powerful forklifts were parked so closely their steel tines overlapped like meshed fingers several men were standing near them obviously waiting for gianellis arrival between the forklifts was the sundanese terrorist who had fired the murderous volley in the terminal earlier in the day he had been stripped naked his bare chest glistening with sweat despite the frigid air it was the sweat of mortal fear heavy cables secured his feet to one set of forks while more wire under his arms tied him to the other gianelli moved into the circle of men with a bored expression loath to be bothered with such a trivial task without preamble he gestured to one of his henchmen and the man hoisted a camcorder to his eye and began videoing first the sudanese guerrilla and then giancarlo with the camera on him gianelli began speaking his tone as uninterested as his demeanor over the past years we have had a very successful business association and you have been well paid for your services enough so that your revolutionary movement is beginning to enjoy success in overthrowing the government of sudan he was speaking to the man standing before him but the words were meant for whoever listened to the tape until today you have done well by me this afternoons disaster though forces me to remind you who is in charge of this operation this fool in front of me was supposed to keep philip mercer under observation and determine if he was being followed or contacted firing an automatic weapon in a crowded airport was not part of my instructions well never know who contacted mercer because of you not to mention that your actions could have cost mercer his life gianellis voice suddenly exploded you stupid fucking monkey we may miss mercer in asmara because he was delayed here by your action security has been tightened in eritrea making a snatch when he lands impossible i wont ask what you were thinking because i know you are incapable of thought he stared at the cameras cyclops eye let this be a lesson to the rest of you godless cattle fuckers he gestured to the forklift operators and the machines rumbled to life the cameraman swung to the sudanese shackled between the two vehicles his eyes were huge and his mouth worked silently it was impossible to determine if he was praying or begging for forgiveness with a nod from gianelli the two sets of forks lifted simultaneously hoisting the terrorist off the ground his voice became audible then a piercing scream that carried over the noise of the diesels one operator halted the upward motion of the lifting carriage while the other continued to rise in seconds the african was stretched in a modern version of the medieval rack there was just enough pressure on his body to drain the blood from his face and raise the volume of his screams but he was not yet in any pain the camera turned back to gianelli watch well mahdi he said to his intended audience you have failed me once by sending this idiot on such a delicate job if you fail me again a worse fate awaits you one operator pumped his machines throttle and the forks began to draw apart one raising and the other lowering back to the ground caught in the relentless mechanical pull the sudaneses screams worsened as the pressure on his body increased stretched to the very limit his skin turned an unnatural gray and his body looked like some carnival oddity and still the forks drew apart the cords wrapped under his arms and around his legs turned crimson and blood began to course down his body as the steel sliced into him the small give offered by his flesh was quickly exhausted as the wires dug even deeper drawing taut against bone then they began to pull his skeleton apart gianelli was in a distracted conversation with one of his lieutenants when the torture came to its inevitable conclusion the mans screams were choked off by a wet tearing sound and the contents of his chest cavity splashed unevenly to the concrete the dismemberment happened so quickly that giancarlo didnt have time to step away from the blood that erupted from the corpse startled and angry he stripped off his soiled overcoat and threw it into the puddle of gore under the dangling remains turn that camera off and lets get out of here he snarled at his driver call my pilot well be staying in rome tonight after what happened this afternoon im sure it will be a while before airport operations resume tell him to refile the flight plan for tomorrow he sat back into the padded seat of his limousine while not bothered by the actual murder he was disturbed that it had been necessary in the first place his sudanese mercenaries had been incredibly loyal fulfilling his orders without question or fault he thought back to the archaeologist a couple months ago as an example of their efficiency but he couldnt allow laxity now as the operation got into full swing he would be relying on them more and more tonights grisly demonstration was a just reminder more disturbing than the blunders in rome and asmara was the fact that gianelli had no idea who had contacted mercer at da vinci there were other forces at work another group that he had no knowledge of or control over speculating over their identity was a fools task yet he could not help pondering their existence or how they knew about the lost mine his lost mine unknown location in the middle east news of ibrihams death in rome reached yosef a full day after the machinegun attack because the team had been on the move during the night traveling with their prisoner from their previous location in lebanon to a more secure site they were now ensconced in an urban safe house near the bustling city center but cut off from it by the houses ancient stone walls the house was attached to its neighbors in the timehonored way of middle eastern cities yet it had been vacant for several years the neighborhood was full of those sympathetic to their cause and would not report that the previously unoccupied house suddenly had ten people inhabiting it eleven if one knew about harry white held captive in the windowless cellar this location did afford more amenities but it was still much too dangerous to use for the remainder of their mission discovery by the police or special investigative services would mean either a shootout or execution after a quick onesided military trial apart from everything else yosef also had to consider the teams next relocation no more than a week away if he wanted to maintain the hardandfast rule about safe houses yosef betrayed no reaction when hed learned of the death of his nephew but the few team members whod worked with him before knew he was taking the killing very badly he had a new hardness a new layer of armor that shielded him from the loss and continuing pain of his lifes work several of the team sat at the dining room table with pitchers of water and carafes of rich coffee it was morning the first minutes they had been able to relax the remainder of the group were either on sleep rotation or out purchasing supplies the dining room was heavy with both quiet grief and the coolness of the morning that soaked through the plastered walls yosef had never used this particular safe house but it was like so many others he had slept in worked in and killed in before he had willingly given up his life to live like this and while he felt no regrets for that decision its toll was becoming too heavy losing ibriham could very well be the last blow he would take no one at the table had spoken each was waiting for yosef the teams new leader to take up his mantle of command he remained silent inhaling cigarettes until the small astray before his chair brimmed this morning had aged him a further ten years what is the state of our prisoner yosef finally asked avoiding the real issue by addressing other details first settled as well as can be expected one of the team replied hes much quieter and more cooperative since we started giving him cigarettes his injuries for an old man he heals remarkably well his hands doing fine this from a nurse who had been with the organization for a year yosef lit another cigarette watching the bluegray smoke coil to the wood beams that trussed the high ceiling he didnt bother to blink away the smoke that scalded his eyes the inquiring stares of his people galled to the point where he wanted to escape the room the house the entire organization but not before philip mercer paid for his nephews death he forced himself from his reverie there is no point in going over what has happened we all know that ibriham is dead and this places me in command its a job i dont want but that doesnt matter if they wanted a moraleboosting speech they could get it elsewhere he thought we will continue as before the only significant change of plans is that i will be heading to eritrea to keep track of mercer with those already scheduled to go also when this operations done i want our prisoner executed and i personally will deal with the american the most junior member of the group spoke i am not questioning you yosef but aggravating the situation with two more deaths wont help our cause according to our information mercer had nothing to do with ibrihams murder killing him will only draw more attention to our presence again nothing showed on yosefs face but his voice was deadly killing mercer has nothing to do with our cause its a personal matter and no one will be aware of it eritreas a big country full of danger one more corpse buried in the desert will make no difference he looked around the table to see if anyone else would question his decision but none would meet his gaze he had to keep the team focused for just a few more weeks until the election after that he no longer cared what happened to them or himself or god forbid israel yosef thought back to the murder of his niece ibrihams cousin so many years ago shed been shot by an israeli soldier who was so shaken by the accident that hed been unable to return to active service ibriham had taken her death particularly hard and yosef had feared that he would join a palestinian splinter group to reap his revenge but days later a bomb at a bus stop in tel aviv had killed eleven israelis television reports showed cheering crowds of students in gaza celebrating the martyrdom of the suicide bomber that evening ibriham approached his uncle and asked to join him in the mossad ibriham had been so impressed by the compassion the soldier had shown following the fatal shooting and so sickened by the crowds that the internal conflict that had torn him since childhood had cleared he had said he was a jew first and foremost and wanted to be like his uncle dedicated to the preservation of the jewish homeland from that time ibrihams uncertainty gave way to a zeal that forced him to work tirelessly within the ranks of the mossad in just a couple of years hed topped the list of field operatives this brought him to the attention of israels current defense minister chaim levine who was forming a secret team from within the ranks of israels military and intelligence community for a shadowy program of his own ibriham quickly accepted levines offer to join and eventually lead his cadre in pursuit of the ministers dream it had been levine who drew ibriham in but now the responsibility fell on yosefs shoulders the team watched him quietly i know what youre thinking the old man has gone mad you think i might jeopardize the mission with a vendetta against a man whos actually helping us i assure you nothing will happen to mercer until after he discovers the mine and we retrieve what we lost so long ago yosef paused to fill a glass with water ibrihams death has been a devastating blow not only to me personally but also to you but it doesnt mean that were going to stop in just a few weeks if we are successful well rejuvenate our nation and will lay the foundation to ensure that never again will jews feel that we do not have a rightful place on this planet its true we have our land bought with blood and defended with yet more but since the founding of our state we have lacked a soul weve existed lived and died but never have we truly felt our place many thought taking jerusalem in would give us that soulthe western wall for generations known as the wailing wall because it stood inside jordans borders it was the wall built by king david himself when he erected the temple its a tangible piece of what we once had we have it now yosef scowled a towering wall of sandstone blocks that sits in the shadow of a mosque i have been to the wall just once back in as a soldier i had killed to take those slabs of rock killed joyfully since then i find the area an abomination there are more tourists there gawking than jews praying it sickens me i fought and killed and nearly got killed for a symbol the western wall was a first step but it was never meant to be the end of what we wanted to achieve in our promised land it wasnt until the scud missiles slammed into jerusalem and tel aviv during the gulf war that a select group remembered that there was more work before israel was complete in a few weeks defense minister chaim levine will be prime minister hes going to nullify the peace accords and outlaw the plo again hell close our borders to the west bank and gaza keeping the hordes in the slums they themselves have created there will be no more suicide bombers because when hes finished with the palestinians any of them willing to die for their cause will already be dead in a short time the third temple will rise on the foundation of its predecessors and it will be the sacred heart of jewry its our mission to see that when the temple is complete gods words will reside within its walls that is our covenant with him ibriham gave his life to this belief and his death has not weakened my resolve nor should it yours we are closer than any have come in two thousand years because i want the geologist mercer dead does not mean that i have abandoned our cause yosef finished what was the longest speech of his life feeling bitter and empty inside he cared nothing for the cause nor chaim levine hed only come out of retirement to help ibriham but his death gave yosef a mission a crusade more important to him than anything in the world he wanted philip mercer to die ill be leaving tonight with the rest of the eritrea team before i go ill speak with minister levine about finding a more suitable safe house we cant stay here for very long both mossad and shin bet are looking for us and levine cant risk our capture hell have to find a more secure place than this preferably on a military base perhaps the secret weapons research facility in the negev i know he wants to distance himself from us in case were captured plausible deniability but we need his protection now that ibriham is gone yosef knew that levine would sacrifice everyone in the room if he felt it threatened his chances to become prime minister israeli politics was becoming as dangerous as those in some third world autocracy before i call levine moshe check on mr white and see if theres anything we need when we move him again yosef lit another cigarette blowing a mushrooming jet of smoke across the table remember this will be the last time hes transferred so if he makes any special requests grant them in case we need him for another video for mercer we want him in good humor yes sir the young sabra said getting up from the table to descend into the cellar the cellar walls were undressed stone and the floor was heavily packed dirt hardened to an almost cement shine the air was cool and damp smelling of mold and neglect off a central hallway a door led to harry whites cell there was no window in the wooden door so moshe had his pistol in hand when he threw back the dead bolts and kicked it open by the murky light of the two dim bulbs strung along the ceiling he could see the prisoner lying quietly on an army surplus cot they had given him his clothes back for the move and allowed him this one measure of decency harry looked at the teenager with the gun in his hand and if he felt intimidated by the weapon his attitude didnt show it he recognized him from the earlier cell and took the fact that the guards face was now uncovered as a very bad sign how about some food you bastard i havent eaten in days in fact it had been less than twelve hours but without natural light harry whites circadian clock was fouled moshe looked at harry blankly oh for christs sake harry nearly shouted you know food breakfast lunch dinner i dont give a shit he pantomimed eating you want to eat having been born in israel english for moshe was a second language and a particularly difficult one at that fucking camel jockey yes i want to eat harry sat up he had taken off his prosthetic leg and moshe stared morbidly at the empty trouser cuff that dangled off the bed and how about some hooch while youre at it my hand is killing me again moshe stared without comprehension you know booze swill liquor alcohol nectar of the gods man bourbon gin vodka scotch hell id give anything for a pink lady right now harry was getting nowhere and knew it he lay back onto the bed cradling his head in the cup of his hands for there was no pillow ah forget it i may not know much but i know allah forbids you bastards from enjoying lifes last pleasure so just piss off moshe turned to go but harry stopped him with a shout but dont forget some food you stupid son of a bitch once again harry was alone there was a finality to the bolt slamming home that echoed he heaved himself back up again recovering his fake leg from under the bed and strapping it back into place under his pants they had drugged him late that nightthat he did remember three men held him down while a woman slid a hypodermic needle into his arm of the trip to this new place he recalled nothing the room wasnt any better or worse than his last cell except for the blessed relief that the dts had not followed him he had wakened slowly fearfully but after twenty minutes realized that the flying monkeys werent going to bother him again what a nightmare that had been as far as harry was concerned they could take detox and shove it up their collective camelriding asses he had spent the best part of forty years avoiding sobriety and he wasnt appreciative when it was forced down his throat apart from getting over the dts he was thankful they had left him his clothes even to him the sight of a naked eightyyearold man with one leg was pretty depressing especially trying to piss into the little pot they had given him his hands shook more than he ever realized throwing off an already notoriously bad aim god will tiny get a kick out of this story when i tell him for ten minutes he lay still thinking he had an advantage two really that his kidnapers didnt know one was that he didnt fear death he was too old for that if they expected him to remain submissive theyd made a big mistake thirty years ago he knew hed be blubbering like a baby but not now that he thought was the one great thing about age no one could hold death over you any longer the fear just wasnt there his second advantage was his unshakable faith that if he couldnt escape he was sure that mercer would come for him someway somehow it was only a matter of time the locks barring his cell slid open again and the door slammed back with a crash the guard had his pistol in its holster his hands occupied with a huge hunk of dark bread and a wedge of cheese twice the size of a pizza slice and blessings of all possible blessings he held a bottle nearly filled with a clear liquid even at the sight of it harrys mouth flooded with saliva and his hands steadied he looked longingly at the bottle he wanted a drink so badly that moshe was startled when harry crossed the room with the speed of a man one quarter his age ill give you a hand there he said plucking the bottle from moshes arms he ignored the food the young israeli had brought him harry didnt recognize the bottles blue label with or without his glasses the writing was an illegible scrawl but he knew the smell as soon as he twisted off the cap and held its open neck beneath his alcoholattuned nose i have to say im not much of a gin man myself but under the present circumstances he tilted the bottle skyward his throat bobbing rhythmically gulping down three heavy swallows as if the harsh liquor had been mothers milk that first sip was the most pleasurable moment in harrys life and that included returning home after world war ii he sighed as the alcohol burned his throat and brought tears to his eyes i dont suppose youd want a snort he offered the bottle to moshe harry was shocked and more than a little intrigued when the darkhaired guard no more than a boy with wide clear eyes and a face that had only recently seen a razor took the bottle and took a long pull from it i havent slept in two days moshe said proffering the bottle back to harry thank you dont thank me harry was all charm its your booze take another pull lad you look like you could use it no that is not permitted moshe shook his head and left harry sat back on the bed the gin cradled in his lap damn hed hoped to get the kid drunk and escape but the little prick wasnt going to fall for it okay harry old boy he said to himself what the hell is plan b eritrea africa lolled tiredly below europe looking like the bowed head of some exhausted horse curled against itself as if struggling to draw lifes last breaths even its very shape was sorrowful as bereft as the place itself the red and white ethiopian airlines boeing jet arced in off the red sea taking an indirect route to avoid flying over sudan even at twentynine thousand feet the boeing was not safe from an errant missile from one of the worlds longest and bloodiest civil wars the eastern escarpment of the great rift valley rose nearly vertically from the coast in a solid wall of rock that stretched over a thousand miles a buttress that had protected africas interior for millennia mercer was looking out the ovoid window of the plane when it crossed this threshold one moment the aircraft was a mile above the dry scrubby desert that meandered along the coast and the next they were barely a hundred feet above the ground the jetliner bucking in the thermal updrafts created by the hot winds lofting up the sheer cliffs though hammerheads of black clouds had gathered at the coast lashing the shore with torrential rains inland the air was clear the sky was a particular shade of clear blue found only in nature mans pallet lacked the subtlety of light needed to create the effect the african sky mercer felt had an intimacy found nowhere else on earth the last minutes of the flight seemed to be a battle between gravity and the pilots desire to see his plane land where he intended even as the boeing recovered from a last whimsical twist of wind the aircraft lined up for its approach the plane landed rightside heavy stripping rubber from the starboard tires in a rancid puff of smoke before it settled onto an even keel slamming the remaining tires to the earth with enough force to ensure they stayed knowing he wouldnt be able to enjoy ice until leaving africa because it carried the same microbes as the water tourists were invariably told to avoid mercer swallowed the last cubes from his drink he tucked the empty glass in the expandable magazine pouch on the seat in front of him and stood with the rest of the passengers to await his turn to deplane because of the gunfire in rome the day before da vinci airport had been temporarily closed canceling last nights flight good to her word the ticket agent had secured him a firstclass seat on this mornings which was the next available he carried only the two matching briefcases the remainder of his clothes and nearly four hundred pounds of essential equipment had been expressshipped to asmara and was waiting for him at his hotel he was through customs in a few minutes mercer noticed security in the terminal was high no less than ten soldiers watched those stepping through customs and the people waiting to greet them he hadnt expected habte makkonen to meet him because of the delay but a dusky youth leaning against one of the few cars outside the building approached as soon as mercer exited dr mercer yes there was a wary edge to his voice are you habte the boy grinned habtes cousin habte wait for you at hotel much trouble yesterday he tell you on guard but with little option mercer shrugged lets go then habtes cousin three miles separated the airport from downtown and the road was lined with a sprawling illkept housing project built by the chinese during the ethiopian occupation the air blowing into the cars open windows was dry and pleasantly cool spiced with the desert scent and the cleanliness of a city without industry asmara itself a city of half a million was not what mercer had expected it was spotless old women meandered the hilly streets with brooms and rickety wheelbarrows cleaning any rubbish from the gutters the architecture was mostly italianesque and because the capital had been spared during the war the buildings were in excellent repair few were over four stories the tallest structure was the brick bell tower of the catholic church if he could ignore the distinctive dome of a mosque nearby and the darker skin of the people mercer felt as if he had been transported to a tuscan village rather than the capital of one of africas poorest nations because there was little vehicular traffic the roads had been turned over to a great many donkey carts mercer kept one eye out for possible tails but they made it to his hotel without incident mercer had images of a classical colonial structure with columns and gardens much like the british had left dotted all over the globe the ambasoira however was only four stories tall and located in a residential neighborhood the best hotel in asmara was boxy and uninspiring and the lobbys furnishings were hardused and tired habtes cousin chatted with the hotels manager while mercer checked in making certain that the crates hed shipped from home had arrived then the young man led mercer to the small bar in a back of the lobby tucked behind the curving stairs leading up to the rooms the alcove could seat no more than a dozen people and mercer counted only eight different types of liquor behind the bartender a couple of european businessmen conferred at one table and a lone eritrean was seated at another the local watched mercer critically as if weighing a decision before he stood dr mercer i am habte makkonen habtes handshake was brief but firm welcome to eritrea i am sorry i could not meet you at the airport but there was trouble yesterday and i could not risk being recognized your cousin mentioned something mercer noticed the young man had vanished do you mind telling me what happened mercer had already decided to trust habte if the eritrean wanted him dead he could have easily been killed on his way to town and left for the wild dogs the fact that they were having a conversation lent credibility to habtes intentions and on a deeper level mercer recognized a worldweary competence in the slim african that seemed to elevate him above the political machinations and dangers that mercer had faced in washington and rome habte makkonen smoked through several cigarettes while recounting the fight at the airport he had already learned that claude quesnel a medical supply salesman from paris had left asmara taking the first flight out of the country early this morning when habte had finished mercer told him about the gunman in rome and the kidnapping of harry white i think if they wanted you dead in rome you would not be here today habte deduced you did not see who shot the man in italy but i am sure that he was part of the same group responsible for the attempted kidnapping here in asmara they apparently are opposed to the people who captured your friend i agree mercer rubbed the rough beard he hadnt had the chance to shave who are they and what do they want they were no ordinary sudanese rebels they were too well dressed too far out of their element even for asmara and to operate like they did in rome they must have outside contacts and help perhaps they have been bought to act as mercenaries then whos paying them that is something we will have to find out for ourselves we dont have the time to play detective there was an urgency to mercers voice if im to get harry back i need to be in the bush no later than monday that gives us only five weeks to find the kimberlite pipe there is nothing i can add to what you know of the region in terms of its geology i know of no diamonds ever found there but i do know the area i have buried many friends in those desert mountains during the war a dark shadow passed behind habtes eyes well get to that in a minute mercer changed the subject do you know selome nagast i know of her family but i do not know her habte admitted they are wealthy by eritrean standards an old and honored family from here in asmara i only spoke with her on the phone when she hired me to be your guide shes not who she appears to be you should watch her carefully why is that mercer told the former freedom fighter about selomes connection to israel and prescott hyde and how shed lied to him from the beginning is she coming with us when we head north im not going to let her out of my sight until this is over mercer and habte spent the rest of the day at the bar discussing the upcoming expedition habte had secured a newer toyota land cruiser for their transportation and had hired two locals as laborers from mercers earlier request to selome he had also rented an old caterpillar tracked excavator and transporter that were waiting in nacfa the closest town to their target area the other heavy equipment mercer had leased was still en route and wouldnt arrive in eritrea for weeks after a meal of overcooked pasta with a watery sauce and an unidentifiable slab of meat mercer retrieved some of his luggage from storage made arrangements to meet habte the next morning and retired to his room the shower produced only a thin trickle of cool water and mercer had wisely brought his own soap he was on the small balcony admiring the dark city below when the satellite phone still in his luggage chirped quietly mercer cursed himself hed accidentally left the phone on receive mode and when he snapped it open the low battery light glared back at him shit expecting dick henna he didnt recognize the voice on the other end though the accent matched that of the man killed in rome harry white has suffered terribly because of what happened to our comrade in italy the voice said that is the second time you have tried to foil us if you attempt a third white will be executed and his body buried forever mercer absorbed the news like a body blow harry was tough but he didnt know how much his friend could take his sense of failure deepened i had nothing to do with that he protested quickly i never saw who shot him but it wasnt me that doesnt matter the caller said with menace your friend has paid for the murder we will be calling you on this phone every three days at midnight for an update on your search for the mine save yourself the trouble mercer couldnt contain his anger itll take at least a week just to get started and i dont need you sonsofbitches breathing down my neck every couple of days he didnt want to consider how they had gotten the number to the satellite phone contact me two weeks from monday at midnight and every monday after that i may have something for you by then it was a small point of negotiation mercer knew but he hoped it would open the way for more when the time came that sounds reasonable the kidnapper conceded remember that you will be under observation at all times mercer knew there was no way they could watch him once he was in the mountains i understand i dont want anything to happen to harry i guarantee that i will uphold my end of the bargain he nearly choked on the last words two weeks dr mercer the phone went dead three rooms down the hallway from mercers yosef snapped off his own satphone and turned to the other european businessman whod been with him in the bar recording mercers conversation with habte makkonen the other israeli younger than yosef by thirty years was cleaning a pair of desert eaglecaliber action express automatic pistols the heavy weapons were perhaps the most powerful handguns in the world a bullet anywhere in the body would take a man down permanently a head shot would decapitate their other weapons and the remainder of their equipment was with the rest of the team at another hotel im still concerned about ibrihams true assassin yosef said with hatred white hadnt been harmed but he liked to hear the pain in mercers voice thinking that he had well find him the other man replied filled with the confidence of youth thats not my concern the gunman wasnt acting alone and we dont know who was behind the murder we also dont know their connection to mercer and our own plans yosef sat back on his bed his eyes focusing into middle distance its inconceivable that anyone knows about us our security is too tight yet ibriham is dead and we have a threat weve yet to identify is it possible weve been betrayed by our own people yosef knew what the younger man was intimating but he shook his head quickly no its too soon for shin bet or mossad to learn that much of our operation informants have reported on selome nagasts meeting with her control in israel she hasnt made any move that leads me to believe she knows who we are his companion said nothing shell be here tomorrow anyway totally cut off from her superiors on her own she cant pose a serious threat to us shell be with mercer as long as we hold harry white hes not a threat either yosef accepted one of the desert eagles from his partner slipping it under his pillow for the night it was well past midnight when mercer awoke the room was cool and dark but his body was bathed in sweat his blankets and sheets twisted around him as if hed been in the throes of a nightmare in fact for the first time since harry had been taken his sleep had been dreamfree and in the depths of unconsciousness an inconsistency that had been nagging him for days came clear the realization jerked his mind so sharply he swung himself out of bed his chest heaving since the time he had been first approached by prescott hyde mercer had felt there were diamonds in eritrea hyde had spoken of and indeed the medusa photographs showed a kimberlite pipe in the northern wastelands naturally formed millions of yeas ago selome too had talked about what the pipes discovery would mean to her people but not the kidnappers the men whod taken harry talked about mercers search for a mine something built by human hands not the earths fiery heart on three separate occasionsthe original tape of harry left in his house the call in romes airport and tonights callthey spoke as if they knew the pipe had once been discovered opened and actively worked they werent after an unknown kimberlite pipe they wanted a longforgotten mine they knew the diamonds were there and now so did mercer the game had changed once again he thought he was still at a severe disadvantage but knowing he was looking for an old excavation gave him his first spark of something hed lost the moment he saw harrys image on his vcr hope he pushed aside his selfdoubt buried his selfrecriminations he was ready to face whatever might come khartoum sudan in arabic the name sudan means black but those in control of the country were not black africans but people of more arabian descent millions had been slaughtered through warfare disease and famine to maintain the subjugation of sudans more ethnically african citizens in the south by their northern government all in all africas largest nation was a hatefilled sewer that claimed a thousand more victims every day sudan was thus a perfect arena for giancarlo gianelli to add to his wealth by preying on the misfortunes of others people with the kind of money gianelli had existed in a supranational elite class who travelled on private jets stayed in opulent villas or exclusive hotels and rarely bothered with the formality of customs when abroad only moments after landing in khartoum he was whisked to a house he owned in the hills overlooking the city an enclave reserved for sudans few wealthy citizens and the rulers of the military government though it was his least favorite city in the world gianelli did enough business in khartoum to warrant the expense of a twentyroom house and a fulltime staff of eighteen gianellis majordomo in venice had alerted his african counterpart to prepare for the visit the staff was lined up when the limo eased through the gate and up the long drive the headlights flashed into their faces as the car swept under the covered portico stopping so that the head butler could simply bend at the waist to open gianellis door grazie ali gianelli said to the majordomo how have you been very well sir the elderly sudanese replied gravely in italian i was not told how long you would be here sir should we prepare for an extended stay no ali i wont be here long at all gianelli eyed his staff not recognizing two girls dressed neatly as maids he asked ali about them i bought them about a month ago from a slaver selling off the last of his stock they were expensive but they have already been well trained ali said proudly sudan was one of a handful of countries that maintained a slave trade the practice was illegal but more than tolerated by the government slaves usually young girls were routinely captured during raids in the south by either the army or regular slavers and brought to khartoum for the pleasures of the citys elite or sold off to arab countries across the red sea ever open to possible business opportunities gianelli had considered entering the trade but the big markets had already been exploited and he found it wouldnt be worth his time or effort to open up a new conduit to move girls from sudan to the middle east he turned his gaze away from the girls and addressed ali again has he arrived yet your guest arrived an hour ago ali couldnt keep the contempt out of his voice he is in your study there is a guard waiting with him to make sure he does not move giancarlo chuckled at his mans foresight he himself wouldnt leave mahdi alone for a second gianelli entered the house enjoying the sweet coolness provided by the air conditioners the house was stucco on the outside but much of the interior was marble built in the mediterranean style with a large open foyer he hadnt dared to bring any of his european artwork to khartoum so the decorations were all native pieces bought for him from all over the continent by a professional collector ashante masks and ndebele shields mixed with woven dinka wall hangings and displays of ancient gold jewelry from every corner of africa the study was at the end of one wing of the great house gianelli strode in ignoring the shelves of books and the tall elephant tusks that flanked the native stone fireplace their butter patina glowing in the rooms subdued lighting instead he kept his eyes on the young sudanese lying on one of the leather couches his feet indolently resting on the glass top of a coffee table the guard standing next to a stinkwood desk came to attention leave us gianelli barked at the guard then stared at his guest make yourself at home he sneered switching to fluent arabic mahdi wore western clothes black jeans and a baggy tshirt under a loosefitting leather jacket his head was covered with a brightly colored keffleye like a palestinian freedom fighter though he was a christian and a member of sudans rebel movement have i offended you in some way effendi yes gianelli lowered himself into his chair and slid the video cassette from the outside pocket of his suit coat that fool you sent to rome nearly got philip mercer killed he was ordered to tell me if anyone approached mercer not open fire with an automatic weapon in the international departure area youd better pray the carabinieri never learn of my involvement with this why did he start shooting how should i know gianellis face darkened with anger he killed four people he must have had a good reason abdulas my cousin i trust him completely mahdi said he was with me when we tracked and killed that european scientist a few months ago remember he was exploring near where you thought your mine might be you questioned abdula afterward yes giancarlo laughed i wouldnt call it questioning exactly he slid the tape into the vcr sitting on a credenza behind him and turned on the attached television he watched mahdis expression change when he recognized his cousin pinioned between the forklifts the sudanese couldnt tear his eyes from the gruesome scene as it played out gianelli shut off the machine when the recording ended that is the price of disobeying me he said mildly your cousin made a mistake that you can learn from mahdi and i think now you see how serious i am he stood and went to the small bar near the fireplace filling two crystal goblets with a fortified wine he had no way of knowing how mahdi would react so one hand didnt stray from the small beretta automatic in his coat pocket mahdi took the offered glass and knocked it back with a quick swallow gianelli took a seat opposite the killer his drink dangling from his long fingers he filled mahdis shocked silence with words our association has been very profitable in the past there is no need for this unfortunate incidenthe waved his free hand at the darkened televisionto interfere with that ive given your cause billions of lire over the years and ive asked for very little in return i simply want your continued friendship when you eventually succeed in splitting the sudan into two separate countries ive supported your cause for years still i believe i am entitled to a simple favor for my efforts a goodwill token to prove that my money hasnt been wasted on a lost cause headed by a group of fools mahdi wasnt a diplomat or a politician which was exactly why gianelli chose him as his liaison with the rebel movement mahdi was a soldier experienced in the field of warfare not words it was this fact that made him easy to manipulate giancarlo suspected mahdis superiors knew this too but allowed it to continue as long as the money poured in if they had any opposition to giancarlo gianelli using some of their people as a mercenary army for his own personal reasons they never voiced it mahdi stood slowly and giancarlo tensed his finger tightening around the berettas trigger but the young rebel went to fix himself another heavier drink before you tell me what you require of me i must admit that the team sent to meet mercer in asmara lost him after a disturbance at the terminal giancarlo hid his satisfaction at being able to read the other man so well mahdi was sociopathic enough to see his cousins death as another casualty in their longstanding revolt and harbored little in the way of anger at who had actually killed him mercer missed yesterdays flight from rome gianelli said without rancor he didnt arrive until this morning well take him in asmara its a small city and theres only so many places he can hide i want a team of your best men dispatched at once well get those satellite pictures and leave him in an unmarked grave hes meddled in my affairs enough and i wont tolerate it i will lead the team myself no gianelli said sharply we are going to the eritrean border near where i think the mine must be well be in position to use the photographs as soon as your men have them isnt that a risk mahdis tone was respectful it is but we dont have the luxury of time he noted the confusion on the killers face theres something you must know about one of the men your cousin killed in rome i learned through my contacts in the carabinieri early this morning that one of them was carrying a forged passport his being near philip mercer was hardly a coincidence there is someone else out there shadowing him someone else who wants my diamonds who it doesnt matter gianelli dismissed this threat well get the photos and whoever it was will give up the chase how many men can you assemble on the eritrean border within the next week or two that will depend on the revolutionary council but i estimate at least fifty that should be enough well need to round up at least another hundred men as laborers i have south african mining specialists ready to go but they need workers how long do you think we will be able to hold the mine once we find it its remained hidden for seventy years which means its in an extremely remote location the country in the far north of eritrea is deserted once you get off the refugee routes your men will take care of any nomads or shepherds who might stumble on our camp i suspect we wont be detected for a couple of months which is all the time i need gianelli had heard last night from an agent in london that the diamond syndicate was already hearing rumors about a previously unknown mine in africa the rumors had been planted by gianelli himself to subvert the powerful group and it was working perfectly his agent told him the syndicate was nervous about a possible source of diamonds not in their control gianelli knew they would pay him billions if he could prove he had the mine either for its location or for his assurance that he would never work it five thousand carats gianelli estimated was all the proof he would need to get them to pay him off you can count on me effendi mahdi boasted gianelli looked pointedly at the mute television i know i can asmara eritrea selome arrived at the hotel while mercer and habte were having breakfast her dark skin and thick hair marked her as a native her clothes however were fifth avenue elegant and she wore them with the comfortable neglect of a fashion model again there was the enigmatic confidence about her that mercer found interesting and more than a little dangerous hed thought that her going to israel would have extinguished that delicate spark hed felt on the flight from washington but looking at her he knew it hadnt whether it was mercers earlier warning or some sexist cultural attitude habte makkonen greeted her coolly mercer noticed the slight but if selome had too she didnt show it she gave mercer a dry kiss on his cheek and sat i see youre heeding my warning about the coffee here she nodded to the halfempty cups of cappuccino on the table i tried their regular stuff mercer grinned crude oil she gave him an itoldyouso smile the meals here are safe enough if a little uninspired like most hotels in town they only serve italian food a holdover from the occupation if we have time ill take you to a traditional eritrean restaurant if you think our coffee curls your toes wait until you try our stew called zigini the peppers in it are tiny but pack the fire of a volcano thank you for your offer but itll have to wait until after we return here mercer said gravely habtes cousin is getting our land cruiser right now this morning i want to load it up get some fresh provisions here in asmara and be on the road north by this afternoon well sleep in keren tonight and continue on to nacfa and the open country at sunup tomorrow why the rush because were not safe here mercer wondered how much to tell her about what had happened since seeing her off in rome discretion was still his best ally he thought harrys kidnapper said she was the only person he could trust but what kind of assurance was that he wanted to trust her but until he knew more he would keep her at arms length sad he mused the first woman to attract him in a long time turned out to be a secretive liar with an agenda of her own like his optimism about the pipe having been discovered before he kept what happened in rome to himself he did tell her about the incident at asmaras airport when habte was awaiting his arrival it was my good luck that i missed the afternoon flight he lied and had to take one the next morning otherwise i wouldve been captured by the sudanese he watched her reaction carefully her surprise and concern were genuine nothings happened to you since my god i cant believe it its only a matter of time before sudans war destroys us as well selome youre missing the point they were waiting for me specifically that means someone else knows about our mission her eyes went wide with the realization mercer continued were vulnerable in the city thats why i want to be as far from asmara as soon as possible that means all of us you included i wanted to come with you anyway selome admitted but this is certainly a good motivation our police forces and military leave a lot to be desired after the war it seemed few of our people wanted to remain under arms wed seen enough fighting the authorities will be powerless against guerrillas shes right habte added our best chance is to get into the northern lowlands quickly then its settled mercer finished the last of his cappuccino habte when your cousin gets back with the land cruiser load up the gear ive got in storage and pack anything youll need selome how much time do you need to get ready i can be back here in an hour with my luggage my apartments close by i dont need to warn you to pack light mercer reminded gently this wont be a luxury tour less than an hour later selome met mercer back at the hotel and they walked to the market square to buy water and fresh food for their trek habtes cousin whose name mercer learned was gebre but who preferred to be called gibby would come with the toyota to carry their purchases to the hotel when he finished loading the fourwheel drive mercer had selome lead them first to the post office where he spent twenty frustrating minutes trying to contact dick henna so he could tell the fbi director what had happened in rome and at asmaras airport however eritreas notorious communications problems made any overseas call impossible he didnt want to use a satphone having discovered last night that both of them had been left on receive mode and had only a finite amount of battery time remaining his spares were all uncharged and the charger he recalled was sitting on his kitchen counter next to the antimalaria pills terry knight had given him there was no discernible pattern to asmaras paved streets they followed the terrain haphazardly once being footpaths when the city was four separate villages the citys name comes from the word united and stems from the time when the small towns were joined into one to protect the people from the hyenas that once populated the highlands beyond palmlined liberty street asmaras main boulevard lay a jumble of meandering lanes some paved but most just narrow sandy tracks flanked by onestory buildings the streets were bustling while saturday was the traditional market day in asmara the proximity to the easter holiday meant everyone was doing a brisk business on sunday as well the citys principal market was a long opensided warehouse roofed with sheets of corrugated steel the aroma of the spices was palpable more than a block away old american and russian trucks sat quietly on the streets nearby as their owners hawked their goods the roads were mined with the dung of countless donkeys from behind the market came the strong smell of an openair cattle stockade the lowing of the herds punctuated the sounds of the busy shopping district despite eritreas poverty there was a vitality that surprised mercer selome had changed into more traditional clothing a flowing cotton wrap over a gaily colored dress unlike the sandaled feet of the other women in the market hers sported westernstyle boots and beneath the dress he could see a pair of jeans her hair was pulled back accentuating her broad forehead and her dark liquid eyes she blended well with the crowd and while mercers clothes werent incongruent his white skin certainly was in the minutes it took to walk to the market he didnt see one other caucasian yet he knew africa well enough to be comfortable with the racial differences how often do you get back here mercer asked as selome finished the negotiations for a fivekilo bag of tomatoes to eritrea yes not very often im sorry to say selome linked her arm into his as they continued shopping during the war i was in europe when i came back i felt some animosity from the people who put their lives in danger for our independence perhaps you noticed it from your friend habte she gestured to a man guiding a camel he had only one arm and part of his face had been shot away these people suffered cruelly while i was abroad and they can tell i didnt fight only a few know that we in europe were doing an important job making our plight known to the rest of the world mercer scanned the street as selome continued he was stunned by the number of cripples more than half the people you see are freedom fighters men and women alike they are bonded by that shared experience it is the cult of the warrior and no matter what i did for them i will never really be part of them is that why finding the diamonds is so important to you are you trying to make up to them yes selome replied without hesitation she stopped and turned to him their faces were only inches apart your country has been independent for so long youve forgotten the sacrifice you take your freedom for granted while we are just discovering ours i dont feel i did enough mercer i dont feel that ive given anything near what the rest of my people have i want to give something back so badly i want to be accepted by them again can you understand that as on the first night hed met her mercer was mesmerized by her mouth the way it moved its sensuality she was an accomplished woman and he cursed himself for the weakness of noticing her physical charms more than her intellectual strengths it was chauvinistic he admitted but he couldnt help it he knew too she was the type of woman who attracted him someone who was willing to risk herself for what she believed it was a trait more rare than it should be i think i can understand he said finally i just hope i dont disappoint you you havent yet selome gave his arm a squeeze behind the freshfood market was a ramshackle collection of shacks with feeble metal walls that leaned against their neighbors so they all wouldnt topple they were stalls erected to sell merchandise in an african version of a permanent flea market in the meandering warren everything conceivable was on sale from antique furniture left over from the italian occupation to brass piping made from reconditioned artillery shell casings as in much of the third world items in eritrea were used and reused until they were all used up mercer and selome quickly became lost in the maze selome chatted with the stall owners and answered questions about mercers presence a flock of children followed in their wake shouting out words in english when selome told them mercer was an american they should never know war selome said fondly watching the children watching them we fought so they wont have to and now we must fight again to provide for them fully one sixth of our population are refugees in sudan because we cant afford to bring them home caught in the infectious curiosity of the eritrean children surrounding them mercer hunched down to shake hands with a little boy no more than four who regarded him through solemn eyes and a mouth full of his own thumb the whine of the ricochet and the tumbling crash of a body falling against a pile of metal pots came at the same instant still on his haunches mercer twisted had he been standing the shot would have taken his head off he rolled to the ground kicking out one leg to sweep selome so she crashed against him one of the children began screaming another shot passed over mercers head hitting the bottom of a large cooking pot and blowing through it like a cannon shot the market area erupted men and women running for cover sweeping up children and clogging the main alleyways between the stalls in an attempt to flee mercer shook off his shock grabbed selome and tossed her under a trestle table groaning with the weight of disassembled machine parts he took a second to calculate the angle of fire before heaving against the table it crashed to the ground forming a barrier between them and the unseen gunman just as half a dozen shots pounded into it several exploding through the wood in a shower of shards the rest harmlessly absorbed by the metal scrap mercer kicked in the back of the flimsy stall forcing an opening that he dragged selome through the adjoining alley was filled with the panicked crowd a woman went down and was nearly trampled before mercer bulled his way to her side and hoisted her to her feet forcing selome ahead of him so his body shielded hers they knifed through the throng though they couldnt hear the silenced shots both could feel their supersonic passage as they ducked into the gap between two stalls the next lane had already emptied of people making it too exposed to risk a dash to freedom mercer needed to create a diversion he told selome to remain tucked in the crawl space and dashed across the narrow tract entering a lowceilinged stall that was as dark and forbidding as all the others and as equally loaded with merchandise the vendor had disappeared but left a small brazier burning next to his overturned chair a traditional coffeepot set to boil on its grill the shop sold all types of lighting fixtures mostly electric and mostly in various stages of disrepair there was also a selection of oil lamps and on a shelf were several metal cans of what mercer fervently hoped was lamp oil he punctured two cans with a screwdriver lying on the cluttered work bench mercer selome screamed from across the alley he spun as a figure turned the corner into the shop preceded by the barrel of a silenced pistol even before the assassin had fully revealed himself mercer threw one of the cans at him clear streams of volatile fuel sprinkled out as it flew into the mans chest in the same motion mercer hooked his left foot under the smoldering brazier and lofted it into the air sparks and cinders cascaded from it like a fireworks bomb mercer dropped to the ground and rolled to the back corner of the stall just as the flaming grill hit the gunman drenched in fuel the sudanese erupted in flame his immolation sucked the air from the stall while fire twisted into the air above him as he burned alive his screams were the worst sounds mercer could imagine the air filled with the smell of his roasting flesh mercer hefted the other can of fuel selome come on she leaped from her hiding place to join him as he tipped fuel from the one gallon jerry can onto the fire an errant tongue of flame ignited the lamp oil and it began burning like a fuse toward the can still in his hand a bullet passed close to mercers head and he saw two men boldly running down the alley toward them he screamed for selome to duck and spun in place burning fuel spraying behind him just inches from reaching the container like an olympic hammer thrower he released the can at the gunmen it sailed at them like a comet its tail blooming in a billow of flame he and selome were running in the opposite direction when the container hit the ground just in front of the two assassins it split open an instant before the flame reached it and the narrow street caught fire blocking the sudanese from their intended targets fighting for breath mercer and selome reached the end of the alley and burst into the snarl of streets that fronted the cattle enclosure the dirt roads were sprinkled with fallen hay from piles mounded against the stockades high brick walls usually the crowds moved with purpose leading cows sheep and goats to and from the pen but everyone was standing still watching the flames already rising above the market trucks and buses clogged the side streets making it impossible for mercer to lead selome out of the area knowing the fire would slow the sudanese for just a few moments and with only one avenue of escape opened to them they raced into the cattle stockade it was only after they were a quarter way across the circular plaza that selome stopped bending double to catch her breath cows and men had cleared a path for their mad charge both equally upset by the intrusion mercer she panted and pointed over her shoulder thats the only way out of here oh shit he wheezed realizing they were trapped if they turned back now they would run straight into the assassins the cows werent like those mercer had seen in the united states these were bovus indicus called brahmans in america a heartier breed better suited to hotter climates because of eritreas sour grazing they were not prime specimens but all weighed over a ton with heavily humped backs sweeping dewlaps and wickedly curved horns that could pull a man apart with one toss of the head to mercers left a female had just dropped a calf the young heifer was still wet and stood on shaky legs as it tried to get under its dam to suckle the mother was more interested in protecting the calf than feeding it she had formed a clearing around them both jealously charging man and animal alike when she felt they got too close mercer grabbed a wooden staff from a farmer standing close by and dodged through the lowing herd toward the new mother she watched his movement with tired angry eyes keeping her body between her baby and this new threat he ignored her first halfhearted charges angling the brahman with the finesse of a matador forcing her around so her calf was behind her she came forward again her horns like scythes as she lowered them to mercers waist he timed his lunge perfectly and rushed to meet her charge dropping to the ground he rolled as one great horn slit the air just above him regaining his feet as the brahman turned to follow the calf was in front of himunprotected for a fraction of a second he gave the tottering animal a sharp crack on its rump with the staff it squealed more out of fright than pain and began running in a weaving gait that took it in the direction of the exit mercer could feel its mother right behind him and dove to the side missing a fatal goring by inches he landed on a small flock of sheep cushioning his fall in the woolly bleating mass the new mother ignored him and chased after its child but the young cow was too panicked to be calmed quickly the alarm spread to the other nervous members of the herd and suddenly they were stampeding the peasants were powerless to stop it and wisely concentrated on staying out of the way of the maddened rush the two sudanese had just passed through the entrance when the leading edge of the charge reached them their reactions were lightning fast and cows went down under scathing fire from their weapons yet the herd paid no attention to their fallen brethren when a huge bull was felled by a double tap from one of the silenced pistols two more filled the gap in the solid wall of fleeing animals the gates to the stockade were roughly ten feet wide and three hundred and fifty tons of terrified cattle raced through their hooves kicking up gouts of dust the two gunmen never stood a chance their screams were lost in the thunderous din even their guns were so damaged by the herd they would never fire again of the men themselves two purplered stains in the churned dirt marked their graves mercer used the flank of a sheep to wipe the worst of the filth from his clothes and hands and went to selomes side weve got to get out of here after these farmers retrieve their cattle theyre coming back for a little retribution selome peeled off her wrap placing it over mercers head and tucking it around his shoulders so it formed a cowl around his face apart from his superior height the cloak made it difficult to discern him from the angry men milling about the pen they made their way to the exit and gained the street a moment later no sooner had they begun back to the hotel than a white truck turned the corner behind them its wheels kicking up a spray of gravel and its driver leaning heavily on the horn trouble at hotel we leave now habte shouted out the open window his cousin was in the backseat throwing open the door even before habte slid the toyota suv to a stop selome reacted even quicker than mercer and jumped into the truck ahead of him mercer had just got the door closed when habte stomped on the accelerator using the horn again to scatter a group of men trying to calm a dappled bull a donkey was almost caught by the fender forcing habte to crank the wheel to avoid it despite the danger surrounding them his cousin laughed delightedly habte hit a donkey habte hit a donkey i did not habte replied sharply taking a second to glare at the young man because of their plodding predictability it was an insult to say an eritrean driver hit a donkey habte wasnt going to allow his cousin to get away with even a suggestion of such a gaff mercer extracted himself from the tangle of limbs in the backseat and crawled over to the front of the toyota cinching his seat belt as they accelerated over the rough roads his heart was just now slowing what happened gunfight in the hotel a maid caught two sudanese in your room when she screamed two westerners who were in the bar went up to investigate i heard shots and the body of one of the europeans fell from the secondfloor balcony i didnt wait to see if any more followed i had to leave much of your clothes and equipment behind mercer pulled the folded medusa photographs from the map pocket sown into the back of his khaki photographers vest doesnt matter they didnt get what they wanted you had them with you the whole time selome asked cant imagine a safer place he chuckled coming down from the adrenaline high that was one hell of a risk she admonished the bigger risk is the europeans what do you mean habte just said he heard the shots mercer received a nod from the former soldier if the men who broke into my room were connected to the sudanese who just tried for us they would have had silencers on their weapons yet habte heard unsilenced shots return fire by the europeans not the sudanese who are these europeans i dont know mercer hid his suspicions do you selome looked right at him when she replied in the negative though he could see the shadow of a lie behind her eyes no one followed them out of the city and traffic was light only a few lumbering trucks loaded with cotton grinding across the arid landscape there were signs of the war along the roads verges the rusted hulks of military equipment slowly disintegrating back into the soil soviet trucks and t tanks badly damaged by mines or missiles littered the highway like the decomposing bodies of mechanical dinosaurs mercer had read that the highlands were eritreas most fertile region yet the land was rocky and nearly barren wiped clean by scouring winds and left to bake in the unrelenting sun the little vegetation was predominantly low scrubs sage and cactus he spotted a farmer working behind two draft oxen his plow not much more advanced than those developed in egypt at the time of the pharaohs the plow dug deep runnels in his field turning back the soil that was as parched as the surface it seemed futile but with a peasants patience he continued on they passed through small villages rough clutches of adobe and brick roofed with thatch or metal many of the buildings were round conetopped structures called agdos the few people on the dusty streets were thin and drawn dressed in long plain shifts similar to egyptian galabia two hours later they reached keren a city smaller than asmara but possessing the same colonial charm with low bungalows and palmlined streets the majority of the population was muslim so many of the women were draped in long black chadors that absorbed the heat brutally habte parked the toyota behind the keren hotel a rambling building with a covered verandah screened by bougainvillea we need to get food and fuel here before continuing north okay but i dont want to be here long mercer unlimbered himself from the truck agreed habte nodded gibby and i will get what we need in the market i have a lot of friends here it shouldnt take too long selome turned to mercer no offense but wed better keep you out of sight whites dont make it to keren very often and its best if no one sees you the cargo rack atop the land cruiser was loaded with boxes and jerry cans by the time selome led mercer back to the steps of the hotel theyd waited in a nearby alley gibby was sitting in the backseat but there was no sign of habte mercer leapt into the vehicle and asked gibby to duck into the keren hotels bar to make a few purchases habte was in the drivers seat when the lad returned i spoke to some people habte cranked the engine if any sudanese come through here from asmara in the next few days theyre going to find it difficult to continue there was a smirk on his face mercer pulled a map from the glove compartment that takes care of one interested party and now its time to throw off the other according to this theres an airport in nacfa and i bet the europeans may try to leapfrog us and meet us there why dont we swing west mercer pointed to the map for habte to see this road here bypasses nacfa and meets up with the main tract again at itaro the rains havent come yet so it should be passable habte agreed but what about the excavator waiting in nacfa we wont need it for a while once were in open country no one will be able to find us if i can pinpoint the pipes location in the next few weeks selome can use her contacts in the government to get us some proper protection and then well call for the excavator habtes military experience made him leery of an enemy who still posed a danger it would be wiser to eliminate the europeans first wiser yes but not possible we dont have any weapons were going to have to trust that the desert that hid your armies during the war can hide us for a few weeks still unconvinced habte agreed and when the road forked ten miles north of keren he steered them westward nacfa eritrea for three days they waited in nacfa roughly sixty miles south of the sudanese border before accepting that mercer had slipped by them when the refugee buses stopped passing through following sudans border closure activity in the town came to a halt there was little to do except drink endless cups of coffee and watch work crews repairing the roads for yosefs team boredom was the most difficult problem they faced while waiting for mercer and selome yosef had the added distraction of thinking about what had happened in asmara he remembered the maids scream while he and one of his men were sitting in the lobby reading a weekold issue of the profile asmaras only englishlanguage newspaper both of them threw aside the meager papers and charged up the stairs yosef caught a glimpse of a tall african in mercers room holding a silenced automatic while his partner tore apart one of mercers suitcases instinct and training took control and yosef jumped aside a fraction of a second before the sudanese fired the younger israeli caught two rounds high in the chest propelling his lifeless body over the secondfloor balcony to the lobby below yosef unholstered the big desert eagle from under his coat paused for half a heartbeat and rolled across the threshold of mercers room the gun booming three times in a continuous thundering crash both sudanese went down their bodies leeching blood from massive wounds yosef had scooped up his partners weapon before fleeing meeting up with the rest of his team where they waited in a different hotel by the time they got reorganized and scouted the ambasoira again mercers toyota land cruiser was gone yosef had lost him in an effort to get ahead of the geologist the israelis had chartered a plane in asmara and flown to the rough strip just outside of nacfa he had one of his men drive northward on the off chance he could spot mercer and his party but now three days had passed and still nothing mercer had taken a different route than yosef had suspected the israelis had little choice but to return to asmara and cultivate some contacts to gather information yosef didnt like relying on secondparty information but their failure to follow mercer made it necessary he felt control of the operation slipping his men were still loyal and eager the failure was with him only he cursed and turned to the two men with him the other agent was outside watching the southern approach to the town were getting out of this shithole he said angrily get avi and bring the car around i want to be out of here in ten minutes he had underestimated mercer for the last time the next chance he got yosef would torture the mines location from the american and dump his body far in the wasteland as for the sudanese who he realized must be responsible for ibrihams murder in rome that would be another battle for another time northern eritrea south of the hajer plateau for ten long days and equally long nights they slowly roamed across the desert with nothing to show for their efforts except a dangerously low fuel gauge the attitude of the team was going sour with frustration and tedium they were feeling the effects of the land cruisers bonejarring suspension the molten air that beat down with the intensity of a blast furnace and the swarms of stinging insects that found them the moment they stopped habte and selome rarely spoke to each other and since gibby idolized his older cousin he too had gone quiet around her the silences in the stifling truck were draining only mercer seemed not to notice any of this he was in his element and had managed to put everything out of his mind except the geology and geography of the area using the medusa photographs habtes recollections and his own sense of the earth he guided them almost randomly never losing his good spirits even after ten days of fruitless searching his dedication hadnt faltered in fact he seemed to move with ever greater assurance as the days passed but the task was still daunting he felt like a grizzled fortyniner who had opened californias gold rush with little more than a pick and high hopes used to being part of a wellfinanced expedition he had only his years of experience and his innate intuition to rely on at least twenty times a day since reaching the barka province mercer ordered habte to stop the truck so he could race across the hardpan a pointed geologists hammer in his fist he would scramble up some nameless hill chip away at the stone examine it for up to half an hour using his tongue to moisten some samples to change their reflective properties sometimes he asked gibby to join him with two shovels and for an hour or more they dug trenches in the scaly soil wordlessly they returned to the landcruiser mercer would point in a new direction and off they would go again they established primitive camps at night habte had managed to pack only two tents before their flight from asmara he and gibby shared one mercer had the other to himself and selome slept on the toyotas rear bench seat their meals were equally crude millet cakes turnips or potatoes and canned meat the highlight of every day was the seemingly endless bottles of brandy mercer produced from his luggage some brought from the united states and a couple purchased for him by gibby at the keren hotel the three eritreans usually fell into a deathlike sleep soon after their meal but mercer worked deep into the night a hurricane lantern hissed in his tent as he scribbled in a thick notebook the satellite pictures spread on his knees mercer had intended to use the truck for about a week of exploratory sorties and then return to asmara to charter a plane and study the terrain from the air crossreferencing the aerial view with his ground observations and the medusa pictures that was now of course impossible it would be suicide for any of them to return to the capital he was limited to what he could see from the ground and forced to match it to the surface topography from the photos at dawn on the eleventh day the sun was diffused by banks of clouds far to the east the rains had come the sunrise cast a rose hue on the desert rouging the sand and casting bizarre shadows on the western mountains mercer emerged from his tent before the others awoke enjoying the solitude of the early morning they were camped on the bank of one of the rare streams for the first time in days water was readily available mercer took a few minutes to strip and wash the sweat and grit from his body dressing again in the same clothes but changing into a fresh pair of socks and boxer shorts his skin cooled quickly in the dawn chill and goose flesh rose along his arms and chest the sensation was wonderful habte emerged from his shared tent with a cigarette already smoldering between his thin lips he kicked life back into the embers of their fire and heated a pot of water for coffee mercer accepted a mug gratefully cupping his hands around the warm container they drank in contented silence gibby and selome awoke a short time later she going off to perform her morning ablutions and gibby and habte falling into a conversation in tigrinyan leaving mercer to watch the grotesque shapes of distant outcrops materialize from the gloom we must return to badn today habte said when gibby went off into the desert to relieve himself they had negotiated with a group of nomads staying around the village of badn to travel to nacfa and purchase gasoline their camel caravan would have returned by now and even with extended tanks the toyota would just make it to town i know mercer replied absently watching selomes sinuous return to the camp despite the harsh conditions each morning she managed to look fresh and beautiful she wore ballooning jodhpurs and a mans large overshirt her hair formed a dense halo from under the wide brim of a straw hat its fuchsia band adding a touch of feminine color to the ensemble her lightweight clothes were better suited to the desert than the jeans she had started out wearing she curled into a crosslegged position on the ground across the fire from mercer there was a trace of blush on her cheeks shed been aware of his gaze were heading back to badn this morning mercer announced and he could see relief in her eyes the pace he had set for the past days had been brutal and they all anticipated at least a small break in the tiny hamlet i want to hire those nomads again to return to nacfa and have them guide the excavator here both habte and selome gaped at him it was selome who found her voice first you found the mine mercer looked at her sharply then dashed her hopes with a quick shake of his head no not yet but the rains are coming soon and if we dont get the excavator across the adohba river now we may never be able to there arent any bridges across it strong enough to take the weight of the tractor trailer and crawler disappointment made her face collapse however i do have good news he went to his tent and returned with his notebook and the now dogeared photographs he spread the material on the ground anchoring the corners of a rolledup map with fistsize rocks habte and selome clustered over his shoulder while gibby made himself busy breaking down their camp since my global positioning satellite receiver was left in asmara all the reference marks on the map are just estimates they could be off as much as a mile or two and a margin of error that big doesnt help our cause he pointed at a spot twenty miles north of badn were roughly here now the asterisks on the map represent sites where ive taken samples there were dozens of such notations despite the seemingly random route mercer had taken the marks were laid out in perfect symmetry each about half a mile from its neighbor in every direction habte and selome were impressed by his orienteering skills the marks in red show where i discovered traces of garnet and ilmenites that may or may not mean the presence of diamonds the problem is their quantity there doesnt seem to be enough for me to believe the kimberlite pipe ever reached the surface to be eroded down and its contents spread by these ancient water courses he pointed at several twisting lines hed drawn on the map certain the others hadnt been aware that theyd traveled in any streambeds such were the changes wrought in the millions of years since theyd been carved if the pipes still buried under the surface we may never find it so what is our next move habte asked mercer thumbed through his notebook until he came to a pencil sketch of a buttress of rock bisected by a deep valley through the valleys sheer aperture an open plain beyond was revealed in detail the drawing was harsh in its economy of line but there was a depth of skill and just a bit of evocative emotion in its composition this is the best i can deduce from the surface details revealed by the medusa pictures they werent calibrated when the shots were taken and the aboveground features suffered the most from this but this is what the area around the kimberlite pipe should look like from ground level i wanted to have this drawing finished a while ago but it wasnt until last night that i was finally satisfied with the results if the pipe exists its going to be behind these ramparts in the valley habte do you recognize any features like this habte would have easily remembered because the drawings detail made it very recognizable but he had never seen the sheer mountain wall with such a narrow axstroke cut in its face no but we can show it to the nomads in badn they may know of it im guessing this is farther north near the hajer plateau do you know the region bad country up there shifta control much of the area the government doesnt even bother to patrol that far north during the war the whole area was heavily mined by the ethiopians to prevent us from using sudan as a safe haven it is not safe to leave the road that passes through itaro to the east the nomads and shepherds avoid the area but still a few are killed or maimed by mines every year mercer cursed because of the added danger military planners called them perfect soldiers once planted landmines sat silently effective for decades waiting long after the wars were over it took only a few pounds of pressure to set one off detonating a measure of high explosive that caught its victim unaware children usually found and triggered the devices as they played far from their villages is there anything else up there theres a monastery it was abandoned during the war but i think the monks have come back the mines would never be deactivated mercer knew for the cost was astronomical northern eritrea would be contaminated for decades as lifeless and unsafe as the environs around chernobyl we dont have a choice if any of you want to abandon the search ill understand but i am going on were with you selome said quickly and habte and gibby nodded thank you the two men were risking their lives for him and mercer was deeply touched by their dedication they barely knew him yet were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice selome on the other hand was on her own mission and her willingness to continue gave him a glimpse of her commitment im going to take a chance and ignore the desert between us and the hajer plateau to get the excavator up here we can use the main road as far north as itaro and the nomads can guide it to this point here he used his pencil to circle the village of ila babu on the adobha river now lets get going the toyota was sputtering when they entered badn its body so dusty it looked as if it had been painted with a desert camouflage pattern there were only a couple of permanent structures in the village the rest of badn was mostly mounded tents of coarse fabric stretched over wooden frames on the open plain they resembled loaves of bread with the sun setting behind them the towns natu rally fed well was its only raison detre nomads from all over the barka province used the waters for their camels and goats habte recognized the tent of the family he had hired to fetch gasoline from nacfa and steered the land cruiser to the rude compound bundles of firewood stood a little way off from the central tent and in the shimmering distance a caravan of camels was returning from a foray with more from this range their misshapen bodies appeared to float in the chimera of rising heat several of the bawling beasts were pegged near the camp their soft eyes regarding the truck with illdisguised contempt behind the faggots of desiccated wood sat a pile of plastic jerry cans filled with their gasoline their return was seen as an opportunity for the nomad headman to throw a party he was in his sixties with a booming voice and a backslapping greeting that had mercer not been prepared would have driven him to the ground fuck fuck he smiled demonstrating his command of english fuck and fuck to you too mercer grinned the chieftain turned to habte and spoke in rapid fire motioning for a translation for mercers benefit he says you are welcome back to his humble home and hopes that our travels have been profitable he also hopes you have brought him his money to cement his friendship mercer reached into one of his vest pockets for a sheath of tendollar bills and handed the entire roll across the money represented more cash than the family saw in a year the nomad smiled again slapping mercer soundly on the shoulder the few teeth remaining in his smile were jagged yellow stumps that had been filed to points so their sharpness made up for their diminished numbers fuck fuck fuck mercer rejoined habte translated when the headman spoke we must spend the night as his guests he says he will not allow us to leave until he has shown us his hospitality tell him we would be honored if its permitted i have a bottle of brandy to bring to his table the old headmans eyes lit up with delight fuck yes two hours later having bathed mercer ducked into the headmans tent with habte selome and gibby in tow he was stopped by the rank odor of the tent and the smoke coiling up through the chimney slit from the small fire oil lamps lit the center of the tent revealing an expanse of beautifully woven rugs on the bare floor the headman sat amid a circular ring of men a space opened at his right for mercer and his party inside the circle was a huge hammered brass plate with several matching pots surrounding it next to each man was a platter of injera the unleavened bread that was the staple of most eritreans diets there were at least fifteen children in the tent laughing and squealing with some noisy game their play adding to the din of the twenty adults incongruously a michael jackson tape played on a portable radio the king of pop sounded like a baritone because the tape decks batteries were nearly dead selome took mercers hand giving it a reassuring squeeze looks like youre going to get that traditional meal after all from around the cooking fire the heady aroma of their meal wafted across the room and even at this distance the spiciness made mercers eyes swim the headman indicated that mercer was to sit beside him and selome slid into a place on mercers other side the eritrean thrust a brass cup into mercers hand and toasted him with a drink of his own mercer recognized the smell of tej a delightful honey wine made only in ethiopia and eritrea and he drank down the tumbler in one quick toss unlike the polished sweet wine hed enjoyed in washingtons ethiopian restaurants this fiery brew was as smooth as sandpaper with the subtlety of a stick of dynamite and twice the kick it took all of his will not to cry out as the liquor exploded in his stomach he finally caught his breath oh fuck it took four more shots of tej for mercer to get into the spirit of the party he took the bottle of brandy gibby had been holding for him and handed it ceremoniously to the chieftain the nomad prince opened it gleefully and tossed the cap over his shoulder where it landed unerringly in one of the cooking pots disdaining his cup in his desire to drink such a delicacy he tilted the bottle to his lips his throat pumping he handed the bottle to mercer hoping the brandy would kill whatever swam in the eritreans mouth he too took a long gulp oh fuck he muttered again it was going to be a long night the women finished preparing the meal and tipped the cooking pots directly into the three brass bowls around the giant platter the assembled tribesmen went at the food like a pack of wild dogs they tore off slabs of injera dunking them into the bowls so their hands came away smeared to the wrist with stew clots of meat and vegetables dripping onto the huge plate as they bent forward to cram the mass down their throats habte and gibby ate with equal gusto though selome showed a bit more decorum with the size of the bites she took the wat in the bowl closest to mercer was made of lentils chickpeas and oily mutton the bread helped absorb some of the grease but he could feel his arteries hardening with every bite the only thing that cut through the foods spicy edge was the tej that the women encouragingly refilled every time his cup was only half emptied unbelievably the huge amount of food was eaten in just a few minutes and no sooner had the last of the three bowls been emptied than the women approached and poured fresh wat for the men and replenished their stacks of injera how are you doing selome asked wiping her hands on her pant leg her eyes were bright and glassy with wine and the food had brought a flush to her perfect skin mercer could see she was enjoying herself as much as he he wondered what this was like for her to sit with her people after so many years of isolation and enjoy the simple pleasure of a communal meal a few more cups of tej and ill forget that my stomach lining has been burned away selome suddenly leaned across and kissed him full on the mouth catching mercer by surprise he could feel the spicy heat from the wat on her lips and felt a deeper warmth that had nothing to do with the food the uncharacteristic intimacy shocked her as much as it did him and she turned away flustered again the three huge bowls were emptied and again they were refilled fresh steam rising up in dangerous tendrils that burned like acid the headman dipped a piece of injera into the fresh stew and palmed a chunk of meat the size of his fist he handed it to mercer with another grin fuck oh no problem mercer emptied his tej and jammed the fatty hunk into his mouth with the relish of a native four more times the pots were emptied and recharged the communal eating platter was mounded with the food the men hadnt been quick enough to get to their mouths before it dropped the few diehards still eating were making a significant dent in these leavings the eritreans were doused with grease from their mouths to the tips of their ubiquitous beards and from their fingernails to their forearms the meal was finally winding down and mercer thought it a good time to ask his host a favor he had kept his notebook with him sitting on it during the banquet to keep it from either being ruined by grease or accidentally eaten by one of the clansmen he opened the book to his sketch of the valley and mountain around the kimberlite pipe and asked selome to translate do you recognize this place yes of course the headman tried to draw himself straight but the prodigious amount of alcohol made his spine rebel and he slumped against his neighbor my fathers mother was born near that place it is on the western flank of hajer we call it the valley of dead children why is that because that is its name the old man pointed out logically but why that name mercer persisted who knows thats what its been called since long before time was recorded he was starting to fade away from the conversation his eyes rolling back into his skull and his lips going rubbery around the last few words even before the war no one went to this place evil spirits live in the hills my father told me that even animals refuse to enter the valley they could feel the ghosts now the area around the valley of dead children is full of mines a cousin lost his eldest son there two rains ago when the boy went looking for a young goat that wandered away from his herd have you been to this valley no and the headman started to snore years of friendship with harry white should have prepared mercer for the next mornings hangover but his previous experiences couldnt have possibly readied him for the pounding in his skull or the maelstrom that churned his gut everyone was still in the tent most snoring loudly where theyd passed out the night before one clansmen lying in the platter was dangerously close to drowning in the grease pooled at its bottom mercer came awake in slow painful stages dimly aware that it was still dark outside and the tent was lit with only a single guttering oil lamp selome was curled up in the crook of his arm her head resting lightly on the pads of muscle her face was toward him her mouth parted and her lips shining in the murky light mercer recalled the surprising kiss she had given him the night before and passed it off as alcoholinduced affection he kissed her forehead and carefully disentangled her limbs from his by the luminous dial of his watch dawn was half an hour away the moon hung near the horizon in its own bright corona mercer shuffled unsteadily to the toyota he retrieved a bundle from under the truck and returned to the low stools placed just outside the tents entrance mercer recalled that the headmans name was negga and he was already sitting his head hanging limply between his hands mercer tapped him on the shoulder and offered one of the milotti beers he had left overnight in a sodden towel the beer was refreshingly cold little hair of the hyena for you if mercer was going to make it through the day hed need a beer to push back the effects of the tej harry called it the deferred hangover plan party now and pay later habte and gibby joined them after mercer had passed a second beer to negga habte ask our host if he would give us a man to guide us to the valley of dead children i am taking my family farther east to catch the rains habte translated for the nomad leader my herds and flocks have been months without good pasturage i want to help you but i cant delay but heed my words you dont want to go up there not only do you have to worry about the mines but ive heard theres an army stationed on the sudan side of the border they arrived about six days ago who are they i dont know theyre not regular soldiers and it was said that there are at least fifty of them all well armed a force that size is too big for one of the shifta gangs the chieftain shrugged his shoulders their presence is a mystery mercer retrieved his topographical map of eritrea and spread it on the ground in front of negga can you at least show me where on the hajer plateau the valley lies negga stared at the map with incomprehension like most nomads he relied on the accumulated knowledge of generations of wanderers to know his territory even after mercer pointed to the adobha river as a reference negga still couldnt understand how the compressed lines on the flat projection represented the rugged northern mountains i dont know what this paper means the valley is on the west flank of the plateau a long days ride on a swift camel from ila babu that is all i can tell you would you at least guide my people to nacfa so they can get another truck i have waiting and then take them to ila babu there were no roads connecting the two towns we have drunk from the same bottle of course i will do this thing for you but i will not permit my people to go beyond ila babu i wont lose any of my family for your search fair enough neggas expression brightened it will cost you only two hundred american dollars in their debilitated state it took habte and gibby a half hour to transfer the fuel from the jerry cans into the toyota lashing the spares onto the cargo rack under the stores already there mercer went to talk to neggas son who spoke passable english shook hands when they came to an agreement and passed over some money it sounds like we are not going with you habte said when mercer returned to the truck youre not i dont want selome with us if i run into any trouble and i cant trust her alone with neggas guides mercer paused theres something else yesterday when we were talking about returning here selome asked if i thought i had discovered the mines location do you remember habte nodded slowly as far as i know she thinks were only looking for a kimberlite pipe not a mine its the same thing the kidnappers said unless she has outside knowledge she shouldnt know anything about the mine i havent told her habte accepted this without a change of expression ill keep my eye on her see if she tries to contact anyone in nacfa good thank you what about gibby he stays with me mercer secured the last corner of a cargo net i can use the help and ill send him to meet you in ila babu to direct you to the mine site if i find it what were you talking to neggas son about habte asked contingency plan b mercer said and handed over his spare satphone with instructions on how and when to use it at last they were ready negga assured mercer that two of his sons would take selome and habte to nacfa the following morning selome was still asleep and while mercer felt a twinge of guilt leaving her without an explanation he didnt let it show he swallowed three ibuprofin tablets drank a full liter of purified water then mounted the truck gibby was already strapped into the passenger seat his head lolling as if its weight was too great a burden for his neck selome wont be happy that you are leaving her behind habte teased mercer ignored the jibe ill call you after my next contact from the kidnappers if i havent located the mine by then plan on coming to meet us anyway and we can continue the search together when he saw selome again mercer promised himself that they would have a long talk about what she already knew the men holding harry white were playing for keeps and it was time for mercer to do likewise fairfax virginia the first break in solving the murders of prescott hyde and his wife came about through sheer persistence on the day of the fire the fairfax police had canvassed hydes neighborhood for anyone who may have seen the arsonist but they came up empty the only glimmer of hope remaining for the investigation were a certain dr and mrs grady who lived adjacent to the hydes they had left town only an hour before the fire was first noticed dr grady was an oral surgeon who donated two weeks of his time and skills every year to a charity clinic in peru despite repeated attempts to contact them at the remote clinic they had not responded dick henna himself was waiting in a government car when the gradys finally returned to the country arriving from the airport in a boxy mercury mountaineer normally the director of the fbi wouldnt have been involved with an individual case but there were two factors that demanded his personal attention one was the presidents interest in the murder of one of his appointed subcabinet level officials and the implications for the missing medusa photographs henna had briefed the chief executive soon after admiral morrison dumped the entire mess on his lap while much of the evidence was destroyed by the fire the twin bullet holes in the charred skulls of both prescott hyde and his wife jacqueline had galvanized the administration hennas other reason was his friendship with mercer soon after the story of the fire and executionstyle murders reached the press the washington post had reported the details of the justice departments investigation into hydes life including rumors of a sale of highly classified documents to unknown parties the post didnt have anything concrete on this last piece of information but they were leaning heavily on their sources and it was only a matter of time before someone disclosed the existence of the medusa satellite and the missing pictures the president wanted this solved quickly faces put on the unknown killers and names to go with the faces if the scandal broke the president had already primed his pointing finger and wanted a direction in which to aim it his administration was still reeling over last years alaska debacle and was not yet strong enough to handle another embarrassment the president told henna to sew the murders up tight deflect any inquiries away from his african affairs secretary and make certain this scandal wouldnt return to bite them all on the ass the candyapple red sport utility vehicle eased up the gradys driveway both appeared to be in their late forties or early fifties his gray hair was thinning while hers was dyed blonde they were tanned and appeared worn by their work in south america henna gave them a minute to gape at the blackened pit that had been the hydes house before approaching the couple it was arson henna said bluntly both gradys turned in unison and looked at him blankly and im sorry to tell you this but prescott and jacqueline were shot in the head before the arsonist torched their house now that he had their full attention he introduced himself im dick henna the director of the fbi and i have a couple of questions for you five minutes later they were seated in the gradys living room there were dozens of mementos on the walls from their childrens lives culminating in framed diplomas from georgetown set on a baby grand piano meredeth grady was still weeping for she and jacqueline hyde had been friends and golfing partners john grady had taken the news much more calmly certainly not immune from the horrors of death but as a doctor better able to hide it as you can understand henna said when he gauged meredith ready to handle his questions the president is very interested in solving this case he and prescott had been close as im sure undersecretary hyde had told you oh yes jackie was so excited when they were invited to the inaugural ball i remember she talked of nothing else for months before and after henna had gone to one of the inaugural balls himself he and fay had decided after only an hour that they couldnt tolerate the pretension and had gone to tinys bar on a lark still in their evening wear he remembered harry white dancing gallantly with fay to the tuneless music squawking from the jukeboxs blown speakers the fbi and the fairfax police have talked to everyone in the neighborhood except the two of you were hoping you can shed some light on what happened ballistics had come up empty on the slugs recovered with the bodies did either of you see or hear anything the morning you left for your trip meredith leaned forward i saw a woman go into the hydes house shortly before i left i had never seen her before but jackie and bill knew so many people i couldnt keep track could you describe her it was very early still dark but i remember she was young early thirties i would say and very pretty dressed casually i dont remember what kind of car she was driving she drove right up to the house knocked at the door and went in immediately she left after just a few minutes you dont think she was the one she didnt look like a killer thank god for curious neighbors would you recognize her again if i showed you some pictures meredith hesitated and henna knew why in the age of political correctness people felt obligated not to mention one thing when they described another person was she black yes she was meredith grady breathed its not all that unusual africanamericans showed up at the hydes house all the time you know with his job and all not all blacks are americans she could have been a real african henna said meredith looked as if shed never even considered a difference would you recognize her i dont know maybe meredith grady didnt have to say that most blacks looked the same to her it was evident in her uncomfortable expression dr grady did you see this woman no i was at the airport already clearing medical supplies through customs meredith met me just before our flight henna turned back to mrs grady well maybe id have to see a good picture of her the only thing i remember distinctly was her hair i saw it under the porch light before she entered the house it wasnt like most africanamerican womens it was longer and not extensions either i can tell the difference and it was tinted with henna to give it red highlights hey your name and the dye its the same word dick smiled fortunately the kids i knew growing up werent smart enough to make the connection from his briefcase he withdrew a file crammed with pictures i want you to take a look through these and tell me if you recognize anyone meredith took the thick stack and started going through them with a decisive flick snapping each one facedown on the coffee table the pictures were of female mossad agents who had worked in the united states a few were darkskinned and henna hoped for a hit she handed them back im sorry but none of these women look even close thats okay henna gave her a smaller set of photographs how about these thats her meredith grady cried holding the picture for henna to see the photos were mostly of lightskinned black fbi employees hed had taken to fill out the file but one was something else entirely are you absolutely sure henna pressed she studied the picture again positive she was the person i saw going into jackie and bills house hennas gut gave an oily slide suddenly it was imperative that he reach mercer the picture was a blowup from a state department security camera even with poor resolution it was unmistakably selome nagast eritrea after leaving badn mercer and gibby made good time on their drive north to the foot of the hajer plateau mercer drove aggressively racing across the desert like a professional rally driver after recovering from his hangover gibby enjoyed the breakneck pace as only the young can he would ululate when the heavy truck became airborne as mercer rocketed out of shallow defiles the deeply lugged tires spinning off plumes of dust when they came free of the earth despite mercers best efforts they managed to cover only sixty miles in their intended direction though the odometer showed they had traveled close to a hundred and fifteen the terrain was too difficult for a more direct route also mercer did not take neggas warning about landmines lightly and steered the vehicle over only the worst of the groundthat which would have naturally slowed an advancing army and was thus less likely to be boobytrapped even with neggas directions that the valley of dead children was on the western side of the plateau mercer and gibby still had over a hundred square miles to investigate according to mercers map the area resembled a huge maze with hundreds of tall isolated hills box canyons and meandering valleys that crisscrossed each other in complex patterns he tried to match the map features to what was actually outside the fourwheel drive and quickly discovered the cartographer had simply drawn a representation of the region no time had been taken to accurately depict every geographical landmark for all practical purposes the map was worthless instead he taped the drawing he had done of the valley entrance to the dashboard and used it to guide him the territory had been carved by wind and water over the past few million years the mountains worn down to stubs of harder rock having no idea into which mountain the valley was cut mercer and gibby drove around each of them completely checking the terrain against the drawing and coming up blank every time they spent three days doing this before mercer decided to attempt a desperate shortcut this isnt going to work mercer told gibby around noon on the third day in frustration he powered the land cruiser up the slope of one of the taller hills a sevenhundredfoot ascent in low range that loaded down the engine so badly that they reached the summit at a walking pace and the motor was on the verge of an explosive overheat he twisted the key angrily and in the sudden silence he could hear engine fluids boiling like a cauldron he snatched a pair of binoculars from the backseat and jumped onto the precarious load strapped to the toyotas roof he turned slowly in place the powerful zeiss lenses pressed to his eyes theres a valley about two miles to the east that looks like it was once the major waterway through this area if the kimberlite pipe broke through the surface erosion would have spilled some stones or at least trace elements into the streambed gibby didnt have habtes command of english so he looked at mercer blankly dont worry my friend we may be on to something it was just possible he could jumpstart their search he thought as he leapt back to the ground he felt that same stirring of hope hed experienced when the kidnappers mistakenly told him he was searching for a mine surface topography had changed so much over the eons that the ancient river now appeared as if it had flowed uphill but mercer had no trouble telling in which direction the waters had once poured he drove northward for nearly a mile and kept the toyota canted at an angle as he guided it on one of the banks suspecting that the streambed might be mined they reached a sharp bend in the stream in the shadow of yet another mountain a beige sandstone monument that offered little shade from the murderous sun gibby threw open his door as soon as mercer braked dont mercer shouted just seconds before the boy stepped onto the dusty soil jesus he thought and opened his own door his heart hammering from gibbys near fatal mistake he studied the ground intently looking for a telltale depression that might indicate the presence of a landmine seeing nothing he told gibby to break off the toyotas radio antenna and pass it over he used it as a probe pushing it firmly but gently into the friable dirt twisting and working until it sank down about eight inches nothing the temperature in the vehicle skyrocketed past a hundred degrees sweat flowed freely from mercers pores stinging his eyes and making his vision swim yet his concentration was total as he continued with the antenna probe it took twenty minutes before he felt confident enough to step out of the truck and a further two long hours to ensure that the immediate area around the land cruiser was unspoiled get the shovels its time to work he threw the antenna into the truck and stripped off his shirt his torso gleamed like bronze and the bunched muscles in his arms moved like oiled machinery they attacked the bank where the waters fury would have smashed into it forcing the ancient river to give up some of the debris it carried miners coveted spots like this when panning for gold rivers would disgorge pockets of the precious metal in similar curves when the currents eddied and could no longer support the weight of the raw nuggets alluvial diamonds were also ensnared in such natural traps their specific gravity being greater than most other suspended material caught in the flow for hours they dug in silence occasionally mercer would dump a shovelful of gravel onto a plastic tarpaulin and pour water over it from their diminishing stores apart from their legendary properties of defraction diffusion and hardness one of diamonds lesser known attributes is its inability to remain wet pour water on it spray it or douse it and its surface will bead and dry instantly he used his finger to stir the dirt wetting it all picking though it carefully examining the minute chips of stone that showed brightly in the mud satisfied he would scrape the mess off to the side and continue digging the hole was over eight feet wide and nearly six deep when it got too dark for mercer to accurately study the samples the sun was a distant red disk painting the desert in thousands of huesfrom deepest black to the rich vermilion of a rose petal he had known when they started digging that they might come up with nothing this close to the surface northern eritreas bedrock formed during the archean era was some of the oldest anywhere on the planet its depth below the surface could be a mile or more and in the millions of years since its creation thousands of types of soils had been deposited on it what mercer needed was a core driller a machine that could probe miles below the surface and return with samples bitterly he realized handdigging a few feet into the earth was a waste of time his earlier hope evaporated if there is a pipe around here and if it reached the surface and if it was worn down by erosion theres no guarantee it followed this watershed and even if it did any evidence might be buried two thousand feet or more mercer told gibby were going to have to keep driving around and find the valley the hard way mercer tossed one more shovel load of dirt onto the rim of the hole he heaved himself out of the pit extending his hand to gibby and hauling the slender eritrean to ground level he looked at the spilled dirt on the plastic sheet and hunkered down to inspect the muddy pile spreading it around crushing a hard lump of ancient clay with his fingers he began picking through it as he had fifty times that day with fifty other samples his body mechanically going through the motions while his mind was already preparing for sleep one small lump of rock had not been wetted when he dumped water on the pile he reached over and shook the canteen over it a few drops landed on the stone beaded instantly and trickled off gibby get the flashlight mercer almost choked as he spoke his mouth had gone dry he shook the canteen over the stone again but it was empty and more water the lad caught mercers urgency and scrambled to get the required items he was at mercers shoulder an instant later night had come swiftly and mercer shone the flashlight on the kidney beansized stone between his fingers the pebble was dark cracked and scarred but there was a translucency to it similar to pure quartz shaking slightly mercer tipped a liter bottle of water over his hands washing away the accumulated grit from his skin but no matter how much he poured over the stone it remained perfectly dry is it gibby breathed his eyes fever bright as he looked at the stone mercer didnt respond he strode to the toyota pressed a sharp corner of the octahedral crystal to the front windshield and drew the stone across the glass the screech set his teeth on edge there was a deep white scar on the safety glass he was grinning when he spun back to gibby tossing the stone to the startled young man its too rough to ever sit in an engagement ring but youre holding about twelve carats of industrial diamond my friend mercer whooped gibby looked at the stone understanding at last and added his own cries mercer wanted to start backtracking down the old streambed to its source right away but they had to wait until morning he lay down in the toyota knowing sleep wouldnt come this was it hed done it the men holding harry would be calling again tomorrow at midnight and he thought about what he would tell them he didnt want to disclose this find but he had to give them something just enough so they believed he was close finding diamonds this quickly was a huge advantage he had four weeks left on his deadline and wanted that time to figure some way to endrun the kidnappers if he had to he would just give them the location but hed regained enough confidence to try and stop them first they were going to pay for what theyd done he finally did sleep and when he woke the next morning his body had stiffened even the most minor movement brought a groan to his lips im getting too old for this shit he roused gibby and soon they were driving again the streambed meandered in long lazy bends forming a huge oxbow once and rising up a cliff that had been a waterfall at some point in history they needed the tow winch to clear the former falls mercer took the time to scout the area with his antenna probe losing several hours in the process the river led more or less in a direct northsouth course it appeared they were heading toward the main bulk of the hajer plateau a huge upthrust that overshadowed everything in the region mercer thought about abandoning the serpentine streambed and driving straight for the mountain but he knew caution was his only ally here and stayed with the winding path effendi gibby tore the pencil drawing from the dashboard waving it like a talisman and pointed to their immediate left mercers drawing was nearly perfect the valley of dead children was there cut into the side of a threehundredfoot mountain looking exactly as he had envisioned it right down to a tumbling rock slide that had torn away one side of the steep valley wall near its entrance partially filling the near vertical chasm the mountain with its inviting cleft was about half a mile away the land between it and the riverbed was an open expanse pocked severely by impact craters most likely from ethiopian artillery the churnedup ground near some of the scars was still blackened by explosives jesus mercer breathed the devastated area looked like the pictures he had seen of nomansland during world war i he didnt want to think about the men who had probably been caught in the open when the big guns began to rain death on them he looked around for a makeshift cemetery but recognized the gesture was pointless there wouldnt be enough left of the men caught in the barrage to bury gibby was also affected by the sight too young to have seen the worst of the fighting he could still comprehend the suffering that had made his nation free were about to make it all worthwhile mercer promised him he felt a degree of sacrilege as he drove across the killing field knowing the tires were likely disturbing the bones of brave men he wondered if the battlefield had served as a deterrent to others wanting to explore this area perhaps that was why no one had been to this region in so many years the valley of dead children was roughly two hundred feet wide at its base and only twice that width at its top a steep vshaped notch in a nameless mountain mercer had to use lowrange again to power the land cruiser over the loose scree that had tumbled into the valleys entrance racing the engine until it sounded like a turbine the valley ran almost straight into the mountain for a half mile its sides werent solid rock but layers of sedimentary sandstone that had built up over the millennia they were unstable bits of rock and dirt pelted the roof of the fourwheel drive as he eased them through no wonder the diamonds were never discovered before he said as the land cruiser broke into a huge open bowl of land at the valleys end the geology is all wrong this should be rhyolite or basalt once through the valley they broke into an open pan roughly five miles across the distant ring of mountains lost in shimmering waves of heat mercer could begin to understand why the nomads avoided this place while vegetation was always scarce in the country the bowl was devoid of even the hearty sage or cacti the land was as lifeless as the surface of the moon gibby looked stricken as they drove deeper into the dead zone his hands clutched in front of his chest as if in prayer i do not like it here he muttered me either mercer couldnt shake his own feelings of disquiet they were halfway across when mercer spotted something about a mile away near where the protective ramparts rose off the bowls floor stood a manmade structure of some sort what the hell is that he recognized it when they were a quarter mile off ill be damned its a head gear a mines hoisting derrick the structure resembled an oil well drill tower a tall spiderweb of rusted steel girders supporting a large flywheel forty feet above the ground next to the tower was a cluster of crumbling wood buildings one of which mercer knew would contain the head gears machinery the tower worked as the elevator mechanism for a mine it would lower men into the bowels of the earth and haul mineralrich material back to the surface in giant containers called skips after finding the diamond yesterday hed expected this discovery to be anticlimactic but it wasnt every step that took him closer to harry was better than the last he was grinning at the old mine when a sudden thought struck him there were diamonds here the medusa pictures were a strong indication and the stone rattling in a dashboard cup holder was the proof why then had the mine been abandoned mercer guessed the buildings were at least fifty years old and that age made him understand most likely this had been an italian operation built during their occupation of eritrea and abandoned when british forces ousted them in it was possible that the brits didnt know about the mine site its location was remote enough to ensure its secrecy and if negga was any indication the nomads avoided this valley it was quite plausible that the mine had never been rediscovered and if it had during the revolutionary war maybe the men who found it had been pounded into the earth by the longdistance artillery barrage another question tickled the back of his mind eritreas civil war had been over for a few years why hadnt the italians returned and resumed their work it was possible they hadnt struck the diamondiferous kimberlite but they had to know of its presence surely they would have come back and then he wondered if the kidnappers were italian and not middle easterna complication that he hadnt even considered this discovery was changing everything again mercer braked next to the head gear throwing open his door since this was a lost mine he felt confident that the ground had not been sown with explosives the head gear tower straddled a twentyfoot square opening in the earth an ominous black pit that dropped into the stygian underworld like the mouth of hades at its edge mercer tossed a stone into the hole his eyes glued to the second hand of his watch his wait was longer than expected finally there was a faint click from deep below he calculated the drop one hundred and sixty feet jesus effendi gibby stood in the doorway of one of the larger buildings the building looked like something out of an old western rough planking and a shallow roof covered with rusted metal mercer peered through the doorway over gibbys shoulder forcing himself to remain calm after he recognized the object on the floor a mummy sat propped against one wall the body of an eritrean soldier left here by his comrades when they made their suicidal race out of the valley and into the waiting guns the body had been so dried by the desert air that the skin on his face looked like a tight leather mask and his hands resembled claws a dark stain blotted the front of his battle jacket obviously he had been wounded in a previous engagement and had either died here or was abandoned because of his injuries the eye sockets were empty holes the ragged teeth exposed in a gruesome rictus gibby dashed off and returned with the tarp draping it reverently over the corpse crossing himself repeatedly there were other reminders of the men who had camped here empty shell casings the mangled clip spring from a broken ammunition magazine a blackened circle of stones that had been a fire pit a heap of trash in one corner well bury the body before sundown and use this building as our base mercer said its too late to explore the mine shaft it was dark by the time mercer and gibby finished their grim task gibby fashioned a cross from a tent pole hed snapped in two thrusting it into the ground praying over it silently an hour later the young man was snoring softly mercer rested with his back against the bungalows wall though he was tired it was still easy for him to stay awake the kidnappers would be calling at midnight because he had given habte the satphone with the stronger battery he would power the device moments before the appointed contact time he had plenty of thinking to do before then about the mine the kimberlite and about harry as midnight approached he felt his palms get sweaty and his heart race there was a knot in his stomach that cramped his breathing he feared for the retribution harry would suffer for the death of the european at the ambasoira hotel mercer knew it would be bad washington dc dick henna had tried unsuccessfully to contact mercer as soon as he left the gradys and when he couldnt reach the geologist he called the white house the president was in alabama consoling the victims of a recent tornado and unavailable despite his desire for continuous updates the man spent the night in huntsville returning to the white house more than twentyfour hours after henna had made his discovery he finally got the president on the phone shortly after seven in the evening yes dick what can i do for you sir im calling about prescott hyde what have you got id rather not say over the phone mr president im in my car right now heading into town i should be at the white house in another twenty minutes were throwing a party here tonight for last years super bowl champion seahawks the president was from cincinnati but he had met his wife while attending washington state hed waited half a lifetime for this occasion ill be in the main ballroom after you hear what ive got to say you wont be in the mood for a party traffic was snarled crossing the potomac delaying henna by an hour the guard at the south gate checked him through quickly and he parked in the underground garage the main ballroom was filled to capacity men in tuxedos and women attired in glittering gowns there was the usual coterie of film stars and washington elite as well as about a hundred of the biggest men henna had ever seen despite the relaxed atmosphere the largest men the teams offensive line still mustered around their handsome young quarterback protecting him as effectively as they did on the field the young superstar seemed grateful for the phalanx of teammates shielding him from the predatory advances of some of the citys more infamous maneaters the president was at the head of the room chatting with the teams coach the first lady stood stiffly at his side bored with the whole affair for administration insiders it was no longer a secret that their marriage would end as soon as his term in office was over the president was just a few years older than henna but didnt look anywhere near his age his body was trim despite a legendary appetite and his hair was thick gray just at the temples and along the edge of a boyish cowlick henna ignored the introduction to the teams coach and took the president by the arm he spoke only when they were out of earshot of the other guests prescott hyde was killed by the israeli government probably the mossad in less than a minute they were seated at the sofa cluster in the oval office the president fixed each of them a scotch and listened to hennas description of his time with the gradys and about selome nagast and her connection to israel call lloyd easton at state if you want verification of his phone call from the israeli prime minister henna concluded im doing one better the presidents outrage was contained behind a calm expression but it poisoned his voice he roused a white house operator and had an international connection a moment later in jerusalem it was after two oclock in the morning but david litvinoff the israeli prime minister was wakened by an aide as soon as it was learned that the president of the united states was calling mr president this is an unexpected surprise the russianborn jewish leader said does the name selome nagast mean anything to you david there was a weighty pause on the secure phone line yes it does the israeli admitted is she okay the question took the president off guard but he was too angry to consider why it had been asked shes going to be put in the virginia gas chamber if we get our hands on her she murdered a top state department official and his wife burning their house to cover her tracks do you know anything about this damn litvinoff muttered the president could hear him swing himself out of bed mumbling something to his wife mr president i am going to my study i will call you back in just a few minutes i can clear this up for you but itll open a whole new set of problems well henna asked when the president put down the phone hes calling me back but it sounds as though hed been expecting me to call he knows selome nagast apparently he said he would explain everything but its going to cause us trouble any idea what he means the phone rang before henna received his answer the president put the phone on speaker mode david dick henna of the fbi is with me and we both want an explanation why one of your mossad agents is going around killing members of my administration it is fitting that he is there litvinoff replied selome nagast does not work for mossad shes a member of shin bet our version of your federal bureau of investigation and she did not kill prescott hyde how do you know i was talking about hyde i doubt his death made the jerusalem newspapers mr president if youll permit i will explain litvinoff said this is going to take a few minutes so please bear with me you know that i am facing a vote of noconfidence in the knesset that will dissolve my government and call for general elections if this happens chaim levine my current defense minister will probably become our new pm i dont need to remind you of his facist views and his plans to tear up the peace accords with our arab neighbors he also has this ridiculous idea about destroying the dome of the rock and rebuilding solomons temple in its place he has tremendous support since the wailing wall massacre two months ago even our moderate majority is leaning toward his camp i dont need the political lesson david i have my own sources our prediction is that hell defeat you by a fivetothree margin we dont want to see it happen any more than you the guy is a lunatic there was a new gravity to litvinoffs voice what im about to tell you will damage relations between our two countries for many years to come i would have rather not admit this but i see no other way the greater good must be considered henna and the president exchanged glances the mossad has cultivated an asset in your national reconnaissance office a highly placed photo interpreter i would rather not reveal his name at this point to do so would put his life in danger however he has been feeding us information gathered from your spy satellites including the latestgeneration medusas henna hated the idea of allies spying in the united states enemies he could understand but israelis using the us in this way infuriated him his hands clenched he wondered if admiral morrison or colonel baines knew about this conduit and doubted they did he started with the nro two years after the first of those spy craft was launched and discovered a forgotten set of pictures taken during the illfated flight of the first medusa because of security restrictions he couldnt pass them to us through his normal channels nor could he steal them directly they could not be copied either i understand it has something to do with the type of paper used in the printing process however he devised a plan to get them out of the nro involving an air force officer as an unwitting courier our agent expected to meet up with the officer later that evening but major rosen the courier discovered that he had them realized their value and made his own plans for disposing of them as you know they ended up with prescott hyde realizing hed lost the images our agent contacted his superiors outlining what was on the pictures their contents came to the attention of chaim levine i thought the mossad was a civilian agency doesnt the military have its own intelligence arm henna spoke for the first time he recalled rosen was the guy that the cid investigator said theyd already arrested that meant the israelis still had a spy operating in the nro he made a mental note to pass this new piece of information to baines it does but levine has many supporters in the upper echelons of mossad you are aware that the pictures show the northern sections of eritrea and southwestern sudan and may or may not reveal the presence of a diamond vent in the earths crust they may also reveal something else something that i will get to in a moment but trust me when i say levine became very interested in getting the actual pictures for some time hes been building a private army from the ranks of our military intelligence services and anywhere else he could find useful people these are men and women who share his beliefs and are willing to die for levines vision of israels future shortly after learning of the medusa images levine sent one of them to eritrea posing as an austrian archaeologist his name was jakob steiner and his real job of course was to search for the kimberlite vent he had been recruited by levine from the geology department of tel aviv university he was killed by bandits before he could find the vent the prime minister paused as though considering how much more he should say go on david the president prompted his face suffused with the dark blood of fury at litvinoffs disclosure if anything he was angrier than henna levine had to get those pictures so he ordered a team to washington under the leadership of ibriham bein a brilliant field operative who is both palestinian and jewish bein had turned his back on his palestinian heritage and became a vehement zionist his orders were to get the medusa pictures at any cost are you saying that selome nagast was working for this bein the president asked no shes actually one of my people ordered to stop ibriham and his team we found out about rosens sale of the medusa pictures to prescott hyde and sent selome to washington putting her in contact with hyde her eritrean nationality convinced him that she could help discover the kimberlite pipe things were clarifying for henna that must be where mercer comes in im sorry but i dont know anyone by that name litvinoff was clearly confused hes an american mining engineer currently in eritrea looking for that vent henna explained selome nagast and prescott hyde approached him to make the search suddenly henna stiffened oh jesus its israelis holding harry white not arabs what the president asked its this bastard bein who kidnapped mercers friend harry white it took a physical effort for henna to calm himself mercer didnt want anything to do with hyde but shortly after their first meeting harry was taken from his home his ransom is mercers participation in the search harry was spirited out of washington on a private jet destined for beiruit which led mercer and i to believe the kidnappers were arab terrorists neither one of us considered there could be jewish ones i did not know about this kidnapping and apparently neither did selome but you have my word that if harry white is in israel ill do everything in my power to rescue him litvinoff promised and mr henna fanaticism and terrorism are not just the province of our muslim friends we jews also have a long history of terrorist activities less publicized but no less brutal ask any british soldier stationed here after the second world war then it was this ibriham bein who murdered hyde and his wife henna realized selome must have gone there right after bein had shot them yes he had probably tried to acquire the medusa images through nonviolent methods but when that didnt work he resorted to intimidation or torture to get what he wanted henna was putting the pieces in place mercer must have been in possession of the pictures by then hyde was killed when the israelis realized he was no longer an asset was now in fact a liability because he knew about the diamonds correct selome nagast showed up at their house after they were killed she set the fire to delay an investigation and protect us and then got out of washington she returned to israel right after that to brief me personally about what had happened im surprised she never mentioned that mining engineer you just told me about but she has an independent streak that tends to protect her friends if she feels our knowledge of them may pose a threat to their lives so where is ibriham bein now and what can we do about him henna asked hes dead which leaves us with a much bigger problem its now time to tell you why levine is so interested in that kimberlite pipe and introduce an entire new faction italian and sudanese that complicates this mess even further it took an hour both henna and the president were held spellbound by the story david litvinoff told it bordered on the unbelievable but there was so much supporting evidence in the past weeks that neither doubted what was really at stake when he had finished the president had just one question do you believe its buried in that abandoned mine david i dont know its possible were talking about an artifact my people have coveted for thousands of years and lord knows weve looked everywhere else i guess its a question of faith mr president which is a force of immeasurable power mine gave me the strength to survive labor camps in russia and build a life here in israel however it doesnt matter whether i believe it our concern is that chaim levine does and no amount of bloodshed is going to stop him from proving hes right if it is in eritrea and levine recovers it hell use it to rally jews from all over the world to his cause after that you can forget about there ever being peace in the mideast again dick henna grabbed the phone the instant the president hung up dialing quickly he looked at the president when the connection was being made ive got to warn mercer hes got no idea hes sitting in the middle of a threethousandyearold battle calm down dick the president said in a reassuring voice you know him better than i do but mercer has proven more than once that he can take care of himself yeah but not when hes facing an ambush from two different fronts by people who have a very old score to settle the phone was pressed tightly to his head his knuckles whitening with the pressure valley of dead childrennorthern eritrea mercer fell asleep a few times during his vigil jerking himself awake only seconds after nodding off his eyes were redrimmed and scratchy from the fine particles of dust that invaded the dilapidated camp building at eleven knowing that if he drifted off again he wouldnt wake until dawn he walked out onto the lonely plain taking the satphone with him the temperature dipped only slightly as night smothered africa the milky way was like a great smear across the sky wind moved silently across the landscape the loudest noise he heard was the sound of his own footfalls on the cracked desert floor with about ten minutes before his appointed contact time he activated the satellite phone and it rang almost immediately startled and wondering why the contact had come early he pressed the button for the receive mode mercer dr mercer its good to hear your voice again it was the man whod spoken to him in asmara mercer hoped hed been killed in the sudanese attack on the ambasoira hotel cant say the same he replied bitterly the caller ignored mercers quip ive tried calling several times but your phone was deactivated we have a great deal to discuss much has happened since our last conversation maybe it was that he was standing near the mines entrance and had already done what was demanded of him or maybe it was because hed been pushed too far but mercer couldnt hold back his anger couching it only slightly in sarcasm when he spoke yeah like you getting your ass kicked by a couple of amateurs trying to steal my underwear theyd tried the night before fortunately the maid scared them off with her mop looks like kidnapping defenseless old men is about the limit of your abilities maybe you ought to practice a bit more try taking candy from babies for a whilei hear its tougher than it sounds your humor is strained the voice said perhaps this will dry it up entirely listen very carefully there was a short pause and mercer heard a new voice harry he sounded distant as though he had been recorded and the tape played into the phone through the distortion mercer could still feel the terror in the old mans voice he sounded as if hed been through hell mercer youve got to find that diamond mine theyve told me that if you dont reach it in the next two weeks theyre going to start cutting me harrys voice quavered theyre keeping me in a rat hole with some shit thats worse than boodles i dont know how much of this i can take harry was cut off and the terrorist returned to the phone that should satisfy you that your friend is still alive im maintaining our end of the bargain how about you what did harry mean about two weeks i thought i still had four not anymore you will give us the mines location in two weeks or harry white will be killed im not even close yet mercer lied looking at the black silhouette of the mines head gear in the moon glow two weeks that wasnt enough time to come up with any sort of workable plan and he knew it shit that is your and mr whites problem not mine i have a lead mercer offered adding a pleading note to his voice from a nomad family i met a couple of days ago but i need more time for christs sake this is a big country youve been reasonable until now give me an additional week in three weeks ill have the mines location i swear you have two there was a finality in the reply now theres the problem of what happened in asmara that we have to discuss i didnt kill your man i know that dr mercer as we both now realize there is another party interested in our activities and it may become necessary for me to protect you and your team you will tell me where you are right now do you really think i am going to trust your sudden concern in our wellbeing our interest in your welfare is well documented hence the two dead africans i left in your hotel room the caller said placidly i consider you an employee and i want you to succeed tell me where you are no you want that mine and i want harry white thats our agreement and youre going to leave me alone until i find it mercers voice hardened and the sudanese ill worry about them myself you know i cant make you tell me the other man conceded but when we next speak i will have another tape recording and youll hear harry white losing his left hand the phone went dead shit mercer punched off and then dialed the satellite phone hed given to habte selam habte answered immediately as discussed before they separated hed been waiting for mercers call habte its me i think i just screwed up with the kidnappers theyre making some threats and i believe them mercer was replaying the conversation in his head when he considered something odd harry had said some shit worse than boodles what the hell was the old bastard talking about listen im not going to say too much but im going to need that excavator sooner than planned can you start at first light yes the vehicles owner has been working here repairing roads but he told the citys council that he would have to leave at a moments notice making a little money on the side i dont see anything wrong with that nacfa is in disrepair and excavating equipment is rare in eritrea as long as hes got full tanks when you get here mercer cautioned he will we also have the other equipment you had me pick up before you arrived in eritrea good were going to need that generator and the portable floodlights while the satphones were not secure from eavesdropping mercer felt sure that no one was listening to this particular frequency at this particular time however he wasnt going to take any unnecessary risks by broadcasting their location in clear he gave habte map coordinates roughly ten miles from the valley of dead children planning to send gibby to guide them in the last few miles whats your eta it will take us at least a day thats rough country and the adobha river may already be flooded it would be best if gibby met us at noon the day after tomorrow to be certain understood mercer said still thinking about harry white boodles was a brand name of gin what was he doing with gin if his captors were muslim and thus forbidden alcohol obviously harry was trying to tell him something but mercer was too tired to put it together mercer woke gibby as soon as it was light enough to see hed gotten just enough sleep to satisfy his bodys immediate needs but he felt slow and lethargic in the mounting heat of the dawn gibby agreed that he could stay in the valley assisting mercer until the following morning and still make the rendezvous with habte selome and the bulk of their equipment after a quick breakfast mercer inspected the head gears framework while gibby unpacked all the rope they had brought with them the rust on the steel struts was only surface accumulation the metal underneath still appeared strong there were only three fiftyfoot lengths of rope in the toyota but if they attached them to the tow cable on the land cruiser they would have enough to get mercer to the bottom of the shaft he rigged a series of pulleys using the metal frame wrapping the struts with wads of tape and smearing them with oil drained from the toyotas sump to prevent the sharp metal from fraying the rope he showed gibby how to belay the harness mercer had fashioned and devised a quick series of verbal and tugging signals for communication remember gibby youre all thats keeping me from a quick drop to hell mercer warned standing at the threshold of the old mine opening gibby had proved to be an able assistant but mercer still didnt like the idea of trusting his life to the teenager the black pit seemed to want to suck him into its depths mercer took several breaths and stepped off the crumbling edge hanging above the hundredandsixtyfoot void gibby struggled for a moment shifting his grip so mercer dropped a few quick inches you okay mercer gasped a sickly smile on his face yes effendi gibby grinned your rope tangle makes you weigh just a little bit the pulley system made it so gibby was supporting only about fifty pounds of actual weight but mercer made sure the rope was still secured to the land cruisers winch when the time came to haul him out gibby would need the power of the toyota to pull him to safety all right lower away mercer dropped into a black world the square of light over his head receding almost too fast he switched on a sixcell flashlight and made certain his mining helmet was planted securely on his head bits of debris rained around him pinging against the helmet and plunging down the vertical shaft slower he yelled bracing his feet against the irregular wall to give him just a little slack in the line he gave two quick tugs to reinforce his verbal command and his progress slowed dramatically down he went the makeshift bosuns chair digging painfully into the back of his legs the flashlight casting a white spot before his eyes he trained it below his swaying perch but the light could penetrate only a few feet there should have been a steel guide rail bolted into the rock face to stabilize the skips and cages but there wasnt and mercer could see no evidence that one had ever been installed it made him wonder just how far the earlier attempt at digging out the diamonds had progressed there had been no evidence of a crushing mill or separation facilities at the surface camp since they hadnt even installed a proper hoist system it was possible the mine hadnt been worked for very long yet a shaft this deep would have taken a year or more to dig considering its age and the quality of equipment available a half century ago he came to the first drift roughly eighty feet down this was a horizontal working passageway the miners had dug off the central shaft in order to tunnel into the mineralladen ore from this depth the shafts surface opening appeared to be no larger than a storm drain mercer twisted himself across the open shaft until his boots landed firmly on the shelf that led off into the living rock whoever had opened the mine knew enough not to bore the main shaft straight into the volcanic vent but rather sink a hole next to it and from there tunnel into the kimberlite ore mercer gave the signal for gibby to hold the line where it was and unhooked himself from his sling tying it to a wooden support beam so it wouldnt dangle back over the void the flashlight cut into the gloom revealing a long tunnel that was roughly twelve feet wide six high and god alone knew how long mercer played the light along the ceiling surprised not to see any bats in fact he hadnt noticed the guano smell so typical to abandoned mines like the valley of dead children the mine too was devoid of life a chill ran up his spine that had nothing to do with the coolness of the subterranean passage he walked fifty yards down the drift before coming to the first cross cut a rightangle passage roughly the same height as the drift by only half the width for a moment mercer considered taking this branch but thought it better to keep to the main drive another cross cut appeared on his left after only a few more yards and then a third shortly after that as he kept exploring he again played the beam of the flashlight on the hanging wallthe ceiling in mining parlanceand saw that bolts hadnt been driven into it to help its stability the rock was mostly rhyolite and probably didnt need the bolts but it deepened his concern there was something very wrong about this mine he discovered a winze after two hundred yards an open hole in the floor that dropped directly to the next level down such small vertical shafts connected two mining levels and frequently dumped into a haulage a passage used for the removal of mined material the wooden railing around the winze was dry and broken and a descending ladder bolted to one side looked so weak it wouldnt support a mouse let alone a man he continued on by the time he reached the working face of the drift fifteen hundred feet from the main shaft hed passed a total of eight cross cuts two winzes and a raise an aperture in the hanging wall over his head that meant there was another level above him one not directly joined to the principal shaft his original estimate of the size of the workings was way off the mark without exploring the cross cuts he could only guess that they at least doubled the amount of mined tunnels from just this one drift there was still a further hundredfoot drop to the bottom of the shaft and there was no telling how many more drifts there were depending on the stability of the rock and the way in which the drifts were driven there could be several more miles of tunnels shooting off the original bore mercer spent fifteen minutes at the working face minutely examining the rocks the ore from the last explosive shot hadnt been cleared when the miners were pulled from the stopes evidence that they had left in a hurry miners never ever left unprocessed ore in a mine he sifted through the debris on the foot wallthe term for the floorusing brute strength to lever aside some of the larger chunks so he could scrutinize the rock face no matter how he held his light he could see no evidence of the opaque blue ground the kimberlite that would yield the diamonds he figured about a year had been wasted here with nothing to show for it this drift had been a bust worthless back at the main shaft he tugged on the bosuns chair signaling gibby and slipped into the harness cinching it tight around his legs and across his waist he jerked twice more and stepped out into the void spinning like a dervish as the rope took up the strain and unkinked itself his descent was dizzying but mercer had done this before and felt no ill effects as gibby lowered him farther into the earth he ignored the next three drifts knowing he could explore them if necessary on his way back to the surface as he expected at the bottom of the shaft lay a twisted pile of machinery and hundreds of feet of braided steel cable when the mine had been abandoned the men working it had dumped their equipment into the hole rather than allow it to be taken by their enemies probably the advancing english army mercer landed on a coil of hoist cable the strands rusted together by eritreas seasonal rains into a solid mass of metal that looked like a modern sculpture below it his flashlight revealed the top of the cage used to haul men out of the mine and farther into the tangled gear he saw a large ore skip he played the light across the debris and saw that the equipment had not actually fallen all the way to the bottom of the shaft it had jammed together about fifteen feet from the ground shining the light around the perimeter walls of the mines sump he jumped back dangerously when the beam flashed across a twisted corpse it took several seconds for his heart to slow he picked his way across the pile of junk to get a closer look the metal scraping against itself as his weight shifted its precarious balance the body was in a similar state of decomposition as the eritrean soldier he and gibby had buried the day before and his uniform looked about the same too mercer guessed that a curious soldier had stepped too close to the open pit lost his footing and plummeted to a quick death unhooking himself from the rope again he signaled gibby to hold his positionnot that the lad would have much of a choice with mercer this deep the line was at full stretch there were gaps between some of the equipment a tangled warren of openings that mercer could possibly edge his way through gaining access to the mines deepest drift whose entrance was buried by the abandoned mining gear yet even in the best circumstances making the attempt was dangerous the scrap could shift crushing him or trapping him without any hope of rescue if he became stuck there wouldnt be any way to signal gibby and even if he could there wasnt anything one person could do to set him free but he didnt have a choice mercer took a moment to work his muscles limbering himself for the challenge he dropped to his knees peering down into the shadowed jumble picking his first moves with his eyes before committing his body like a contortionist he twisted through the equipment torquing and shifting constantly lowering himself across the scaly steel cutting his hands on the sharp edges smearing skin off his legs and back his clothes were reduced to rags it was like moving through a huge knot of barbed wire if he found a passage to the drift it would be easy to retrace the trail of blood back to the top of the debris eight feet into the pile he maneuvered himself into a headdown position flashing the light under the elevator cage where it had wedged against the wall of the shaft the beam was swallowed by the darkness of another drift the last one his position put him at the inky tunnels ceiling wriggling like a landed fish he worked his body under the cage holding his breath when a section of ruined equipment settled grinding like a huge pair of steel jaws he felt the pile was ready to collapse ignoring the pain as a piece of metal ripped across his back he forced himself those last feet tumbling into the drift as the junk gave out the tons of machinery precariously balanced for half a century collapsed deeper into the mines sump with an echoing crash kicking up a choking cloud of dust had mercer been a second slower his body would have been cut in two as the cage sheared across the entrance to the drift like the blade of a guillotine his breathing raged despite his efforts to slow it drawing in rancid dust with each inhalation he took a second to check the worst of his bloody injuries once hed recovered he cast the light toward the clogged shaft the drifts rectangular opening was completely blocked with an impassable wall of debris packed so tightly now that mercer couldnt get his arm more than a few inches into it he gripped a steel ibeam and heaved at it until stars and pinwheels flared behind his closed eyes yet the beam didnt move more than a fraction of an inch when it collapsed the cables hoists cages skips and all the other equipment thrown into the shaft had keyed into itself locking together like puzzle pieces plugging his exit it would take explosives to dislodge any of it mercer was trapped well this is an unexpected wrinkle he said aloud mercer knew panic resulted from fear of the unfamiliar and for better or worse he had been trapped in mines before he kept his fear firmly in check as calmly as a man walking to his office he turned and started down the dark passage after only a couple of yards he stopped short blood drained from his face and his gorge rose acidly in his throat the long tunnel was a crypt with hundreds of bodies laid out like cordwood ranks of them lined both walls for as far as mercers flashlight could penetrate he first thought they had been trapped down here like himself but he realized that their postures were too orderly these men would have struggled until the last possible second to get themselves out of the chamber they would have been clustered at the shaft not resting in these peaceful poses he inspected the man lying closest to him and understood in the parched skin of his forehead a neat hole had been drilled through his skull judging by their clothes these men were the miners who had excavated the tunnels they had been shot when the italians had fled their bodies abandoned here the secret of the mine kept by their eternal silence jesus mercer was reminded of the slave labor gangs used by the nazis to dig the clandestine underground factories for their rockets and jet fighters walking by the grisly ranks he judged there were more than four hundred bodies in the drift even as he fought his pity for them he considered just what this meant and had no answer delaying his search for a way out of the drift mercer took the time to walk all the way to its end it ran for more than a mile branching numerous times to both left and right the hanging wall was just inches from the top of his miners helmet this tunnel alone doubled again his estimates of the size of the mine and the time taken to create it like the first drift hed explored the working face had been abandoned shortly after a shot a mechanical scraper hulked just before the face and the cables that maneuvered the plowshaped machine ran back to a fourcylinder donkey engine the miners had even left their picks shovels and pry bars a little way off the metal kept pristine by the dry air a number of questions were answered for mercer as he studied the rock face itself and examined the ore that had broken away from the stope he turned away sadly oh you poor bastards you never had a chance did you there was a whole other set of questions mercer needed to think through but first he had to get back to the surface having spent much of his professional career in the subterranean realm he had developed the ability to map these threedimensional mazes as he walked part of his brain counting distances and angles without really being conscious of it it was a skill honed with years of practice and allowed him to move underground with relative ease he backtracked to the first raise hed come across on this level peering up the black hole he sensed that it wouldnt lead to the level above but would branch off into a subdrift he searched for a cross cut that led to another drift shorter than the main one and angled downward a short distance down this tunnel he came to another raise and inspected the ladder that ran upward the wood had grayed through the years and was so riddled with dry rot that it felt chalky to the touch mercer tested the bottom rung and his foot snapped the strut with only a tiny amount of pressure okay well do this the hard way instinct told him that at the top of this vertical raise would be a tunnel to the main shaft above the pile of ruined machinery and his rope to safety there was enough loose stone on the floor for him to build a mounded pyramid below the aperture he hummed to himself as he worked often switching off the flashlight to conserve the batteries working in a darkness more total than the deepest night after twenty minutes the pile was high enough with a ceiling height of just over six feet hed needed a platform of stones three feet tall and had built one nearly four he aimed the light up the raise but its ray vanished in the gloom the rubble was loose under his boots as he climbed to the top of the pile ducking into the opening so the rim brushed against his thighs just to be certain he tested another section of the ladder tugging it gently but the wood splintered in his hand mercer took a deep breath and jammed one foot against the side of the threefoot square vertical shaft he levered his shoulder against the rock kicked upward and swung his other foot against the stone lifting himself off the pile of gravel and bits of rock standing in the chimney with his legs akimbo he would need both hands to steady himself as he continued the ascent so he tucked the maglite into his belt shifted his weight to his left foot raised his right a few inches and rammed it against the wall again it took him fifteen minutes to shimmy twenty feet up the shaft because he could take only sixinch steps safely and had to force his palms against the rock face to help distribute his weight he thought the raise would have ended by now landing him in another drift but still it rose into the darkness to his horror mercer realized the shaft was widening his legs were now spread more than four feet and the strain on his groin muscles and upper thighs was becoming unbearable for the first time since the collapse of the machinery in the sump he was starting to have doubts about getting out he shifted positions pressing both feet against one wall and forcing his shoulders against the opposite so that his body spanned the void rolling his shoulders alternately and walking up the far wall mercer resumed his climb blood soaking his shirt and running into his khaki pants the shaft continued to widen as he climbed making it necessary to exert more pressure against the walls to maintain his perch if it opened much farther mercer knew he wouldnt have the leverage to bridge the opening and still be able to climb he shut his mind to that possibility but he was becoming desperate his body aching in areas he didnt know existed he was running out of strength his muscles cramping and knew he would never be able to control his descent if it became necessary a fall from even thirty feet against the stone floor below would break bones and in his position he knew the most likely were his neck and back mercer climbed doggedly he realized hed made it to the top of the raise when he could no longer hear stone scratching against his metal miners helmet levering himself upward another six inches he was able to kick with both legs and torque his body to the side rolling himself onto the floor of the upper drift he lay there panting his cheek pressed to the cold stone blood dripping from the cuts in his back and from the scrapes on his hands five minutes ticked by before he could move again he stood shakily brushed himself off and flipped on the flashlight ignoring the passage to his left he moved off to the right knowing he was in a main artery because of its size after two hundred yards he could see shadows in the darkness cast from light spilling down from the surface he looked at the luminous dots on his watch it was not yet noon but he felt as if hed been in the mine for a day or more the rope was dangling just out of his reach at the drift entrance and he had to use his belt to snag it and draw it to him in the gloom below he could see the abandoned machinery that had nearly trapped him forever he gave the rope a sharp tug immediately gibby started hauling when the bosuns chair reached this level mercer jerked the line again to signal gibby to stop it was only when he had stepped into the harness and secured himself that he pulled a flare from his pocket and sparked the igniter off the stone wall this was gibbys signal to start the toyota and back the vehicle away from the head gear the chair rose like a silent elevator the sun was a blessed relief after so many hours of darkness and had mercers eyes not possessed a feline quickness to adjust the brightness would have left him blinded he shucked the harness and was leaning against the head gears struts when gibby drove back mercer felt an exhaustion that had nothing to do with his mornings work gibby had the foresight to retrieve mercers last beer and hand it over mercer downed the warm gassy brew with several heavy swallows belching so loudly it brought a startled guffaw from the eritrean well effendi the boy couldnt contain his excitement show me more of the stones that will make our nation rich mercer looked up at him squinting against the blazing sun gibby looked like the image of a black jesus christ a halo of sacred light cast around his head mercer dug something out of his breast pocket a small misshapen lump he tossed it to the eager teen bowing his head gibby stared at the bit of metal for a long time his expression that of total confusion it aint riches kid its lead from a bullet fired into the head of a man at the bottom of the mine just like the four hundred other men whod worked with him mercer said hed discovered the body slumped over the controls of the scraper at the end of the lowest drift hed been murdered like all the others executed not only to preserve the mines secret location but also to hide the fact that the entire project had been a failure they had never hit the fabled blue ground the kimberlite that held the diamonds they had tunneled for years with their blood and their sweat yet turned up nothing and their reward their reward had been a summary shot to the head there were diamonds here someplace mercer was sure and with a couple of years a few thousand men and a couple hundred million dollars he would be able to find them and bring them up none of which he had none of which would save harry the men holding him had said they wanted mercer to find a mine which he had but he knew they would never accept this bustout they wanted diamonds not a big hole in the ground and they could set deadlines from now until doomsday and there was nothing mercer could do to satisfy them son of a bitch he muttered dammedup tears of frustration and grief and pain finally spilling onto his cheeks the eritreasudan border there were two rugged gravel roads that crossed the lonely border both of them traversing a deep gorge bridged with rickety wooden structures that dated back decades near both crossings roughly forty kilometers apart refugee camps had grown out of the scrub plain tens of thousands of miserable people huddling together in tents that offered little protection from the wind or the brutal sun the tent cities housed eritreans who could not return to their homeland since the intensification of sudans civil war sudanese natives too were seeking shelter here hoping for the chance of a better life in eritrea such was their desperation they saw their impoverished neighbor as a promised land situated close to the border and thus easier to reach these camps were in much better condition than the reservations in sudans interior the people here received regular visits from united nations and ec trucks carrying food medicine and clothing transshipped through eritrea at the bottom of the gorge a thin trickle of water passed the camps and each camp had a continuous chain of girls making the trip down and back heavy pots of water balanced on their heads washing and latrines were situated a short way from where they took their drinking water but by the time the stream reached the downstream camp it was fouled by its neighbor diseases such as dysentery and other bacterial infections raged a farther ten miles south from the second camp was a third one occupied by soldiers rather than refugees a compound had been carved out of a rare grove of camel thorn trees tents erected in their meager shade a generator hummed a short distance from the camp and a pump drew water from the gorge through a twoinch hose a team of three men tended the fires for boiling the water purifying it with heat before it was further chemically treated despite the efforts to maintain a sanitary encampment the fetid smell from the refugee camp wafted on the breeze carrying with it the stink of sewage that and the constant buzzing of metallic green flies were the two biggest drawbacks to the soldiers camp in giancarlo gianellis opinion he found everything else to his liking his tent was large and airconditioned and the cooking was surprisingly good one of mahdis rebel troopers had been a chef in khartoum before taking up arms and he delighted in the equipment gianelli had brought into the bush if he could ignore the armed troopers bivouacked around him with their continuous arms practice and parade formations gianelli would have likened this to one of the elegant hemingway camps run by the big safari companies in kenya or south africa gianelli sat in the shade of his tents awning his view of the world beyond made indistinct by gauzy mosquito netting his desk was mahogany but cleverly constructed so it could be folded flat and easily moved the matching chair was covered with zebra hide a glass of sparkling water blistered with condensation rested in easy reach next to a laptop computer allowing him to keep in contact with the many branches of gianelli spa through a satellite link had the country been more interesting filled with game for example he would have resented the intrusions of his business life here but the desert was dry featureless and empty of all life save the stinking humanity farther north so gianelli filled his days of waiting with the tasks of running his multinational corporation as promised mahdi had secured enough soldiers for the mission when the sudanese liberation armys revolutionary council learned that the request had come from their biggest european supporter they dispatched fifty men to the eritrean border under mahdis command but gianellis control the men were the best of the sla combattoughened veterans who all had at least ten years of experience in the bloody bush war with gianellis help they were equipped with the latest nato field gear though they refused to use the new assault rifles preferring to keep their venerable aks mr gianelli sir one of his white miners was standing outside the tent fly yes joppi come in come in the miners gianelli had hired were expatriate south africans whod fled their country after the anc took power in he had found them in australia like so many other countrymen who feared living in the new blackrun nation gianelli imagined many of them might return to their native country when his plan so destabilized south africas economy that the people would scream for the relative prosperity theyd had under the white regime the rangy boer ducked through the mosquito netting and took a camp chair opposite gianelli weve finished going over the mining gear you brought damn impressive stuff gianelli had secured the services of five white mine supervisors all of them master explosives experts and former shift bosses they were to lead the hundredstrong gang of laborers mahdi had promised he had also brought five large diesel trucks loaded with mining equipment big pneumatic drills called drifters explosives and several small utility trucks specifically designed to work in underground conditions the equipment had been shipped to africa over many months and stored at a gianelli spa facility in khartoum waiting until giancarlo found the location of the mine his uncle had started so long ago joppi hofmyer lit a cigarette leaving it between his lips so it jumped and danced as he talked smoke coiling around his head slitting his heavybrowed eyes those fookin kaffirs keep wanting to get to the stores of plastique and ive had to crack a few skulls to teach them a lesson gianelli smiled nothing too rough i trust those soldiers may save your life one day your typical kaffir has a skull like a boulder a little beating may chip it some but dont hurt it at all hofmyer grunted on the rand management never understood that a good whipping will get more work out of a black than extra meat rations or a fookin dental program joppi those men arent going to work for you gianelli said irritably they are guards in my employ ja and you expect us to work with the dregs from the camps mahdis been bringing us a couple dozen at a time to check em out you know gott if we can use one out of fifty were doing well minings tough work and half those kaffirs cant even stand and theyre about as stupid as sheep giancarlo logged off his computer to concentrate on his conversation with the south african if they were going to reopen the mine they were going to need labor mahdi had suggested and gianelli agreed that recruiting ablebodied men from the camps was their best option these men were desperate for work they would do anything asked of them grateful for the first job many of them had ever had most of them were second or thirdgeneration refugees how many have you gotten so far forty hofmyer didnt catch the edge of anxiety in his superiors voice once we get to work i bet half of them will either take off when they get a taste of real work or die in the mine the northern fuzzier kaffir is a delicate creature and can die on you without any warning youve worked with sudanese and eritreans before ja in the zambia copper mines when the country was still northern rhodesia a few hundred of em came down to work the pits but in five months they were gone again half of em dead and the others willing to starve to death in the big famines up here i hadnt realized gianelli remarked sensing a serious problem dont worry about it when its time to go into eritrea well have enough of the bastards to take up the slack of those that drop or take off any word on when were heading in nothing yet no sooner had he said this than mahdi appeared at the tent he was layered with sweat and his chest heaved in the hot air yes what is it sir mahdi panted i was just at the refugee camp about fifty men and their families crossed the border last night with a nomad who came here to recruit them the rumor is that a great mine has been opened in eritrea and men are needed to work it many other families are packing now to join them ive learned that the nomad was sent here by a white man thats it gianelli bolted to his feet mercer has found it yes sir they are talking about a white overseer who knows how to talk to rock emotion filled gianelli in waves the medusa pictures had shown that enrico had been right all along and mercer had used them to find the mine there was a kimberlite pipe in northern eritrea one of the rarest geological features on the planet and enrico had found it decades ago without any modern aids enricos folly was now within giancarlos grasp of course giancarlo had never known his greatuncle but a large part of him admired the elder gianelli for the independent streak that had driven him giancarlo had it too that ceaseless desire to prove the impossible to follow a belief to its only conclusion he thought about his plan that followed the diamonds recovery and smiled wickedly while restoring enricos name was a noble goal gianelli had also made provisions to profit handsomely from this adventure he debated making the call to london now then decided it was better to wait and see just how many diamonds they could find before the central selling systems next meeting his target was five thousand carats and getting a sense of joppi hofmyers brutality he had little doubt theyd reach that goal mahdi alert your men we must move out quickly gianellis emotions raised his voice to a shout the refugees have a head start on us that well make up in the trucks but i dont want them getting too far ahead joppi i think our friend mercer has gotten the rest of the men you needed to work the mine those eritreans will supplement the men youve already recruited is everything packed on the trucks ja the africaaner grinned he was plainly relieved to escape the boredom of the camp we repacked them after checking each load mahdi how fast can that refugee caravan walk through the desert if they left their women and children behind twenty or more miles a day but they are bringing their families that would cut their progress in half good the refugees moving so slowly tempered gianellis haste and changed his plans slightly send out scouts to track them it shouldnt be too difficult well remain in camp until they get a few days ahead of us that way we wont trip over them when we leave that also gives us more time to get another fuel truck from khartoum mr gianelli if there are that many people at the mine were going to need more water too joppi remarked giancarlo opened his laptop again and began a list water fuel what else the three of them worked for an hour refining the list by the time they had finished they had the provisions to sustain the camp for several weeks without resupply after that they would start to bring stores from sudan which wasnt a problem given gianellis influence in addition to his support to the rebels he also maintained contacts with the government in khartoum working both sides of the civil war gianelli concluded their meeting mahdi send out those scouts now have them take a hand radio to report their progress im going to order the rest of the equipment and supplies from khartoum and make the necessary security arrangements joppi you just make damned sure your men are ready to go yes sir both men said in unison in the bizarre twist of joppi hofmyers racism that made him hate the group but not the individuals he held the tent fly open for mahdi as they left the screened enclosure valley of dead children it was just before dusk when habte selome and gibby arrived in the valley of dead children on the halfloaded tractor trailer five minutes after the rig had crossed the secret bowl of land and trundled to the head gear a bright yellow excavator tracked onto the plain its hydraulic arm coiled to the boxy rotatable cab the operator had been forced to clear away part of the ancient landslide at the valleys entrance to allow the truck access to the mine site rather than reload the cumbersome machine hed driven it to the former italian installation wind whipped the dust of their progress across the landscape eddies and gyres forming and collapsing in their wake at the camp both vehicles were shut down and silence rushed in on them habte quickly followed selome out of the truck and he dodged into the main bunkhouse returning outdoors he shielded his eyes against the red sun nestled on the western rim of the bowl and scanned for mercer the toyota land cruiser was gone and there was no sign of him gibby he called and the boy scrambled off the trailer this is the right place wheres mercer i dont know gibby admitted he said he was going to wait here for us he was upset that the mine was empty and seemed eager to talk to us i cant guess where he went habte ignored a creeping sense of alarm when selome and the two hired drivers joined them whats wrong she asked mercer should have met us but i dont see him they walked over to the head gear both peering into the inky depth of the abandoned mine could he have been that upset selome put to words the fear both were thinking no habte replied sharply i just wanted to see down there for myself he turned away from the pit itll be dark soon we should make camp wheres the toyota mercer must have gone off exploring he took the camping gear from the bunk house i doubt well see him tonight will he be okay there was something deeper than friendly concern in selomes question habte recognized it even if she did not he knows africa hell be fine an hour passed while they removed their camping gear from the tractor trailer selome spent more time looking across the horizon for a telltale plume of dust than helping habte and the others they ate dinner in the old bunkhouse by the hissing light of hurricane lamps but there was little conversation the men fell sleep long before selome she lay awake her ears straining for the first hint of an engines beat but eventually she too dozed off mercer swept into the cabin after midnight waking everybody his face and clothing were filthy his hair matted with so much dust it looked like he wore a sandcolored skull cap he was exhausted his eyes closed to near slits and he slumped gratefully to the ground near the camping stove lamps were quickly lit and in their glow mecer spooned the remains of their dinner onto the plate avoiding the questioning looks they all gave him where have you been selome finally asked her voice full of emotion mercer smiled at her she was still a mystery but he could feel her concern was genuine if at first you dont succeed he grinned then turned to habte any problems getting the gear we had to use the excavator to build a temporary ford over the adohba river it was flooding and we wont get the vehicles back across until it loses its swell the good news is we saw no signs of trouble in town it is possible the europeans have given up no they just dont know where we are mercer sopped up the last of his food with a piece of injera bread damn i needed that i havent had anything since breakfast gibby tells me you went down into the mine habtes statement invited an explanation yeah its a bust they never hit the kimberlite and lord knows they dug enough tunnels mercer accepted a cup of thermos coffee from selome this is the mine everyone is interested in habte asked it was obvious to them all that mercer wasnt as upset as gibby had led them to believe mercer rested his back against the wall struggling to keep his eyes open an enigmatic smile on his face oh someones interested all right i just dont know who what do you mean there are two groups after us right and considering what habte saw in asmara and what i saw in rome they dont play well together i think one group is after this mine and the other wants something else entirely like what selome asked quickly like another mine he said enjoying the astonished looks hed figured it out yesterday and had spent today testing his theory ill explain everything in the morning he sighed its been one hell of a day and right now i need some sleep he was snoring softly before habte could extinguish the lamps mercer roused them at dawn and hustled them to get moving hed already made coffee and laid out bread and butter for breakfast weve got a full day ahead of us and sunshine is wasting he offered no explanation to his good mood the owner of the excavator was the first eritrean out of the old camp building and when he saw mercer seated in the cab of his machine he started yelling windmilling his arms to get him back off the vehicle whats he saying mercer asked habte who had come outside drawn by the angry shouts he says you are not qualified to operate his excavator he must work it at all times habte was fumbling with a pack of wooden matches to light his first cigarette ask him if i can give him a demonstration of my qualifications mercer laughed the driver agreed to the request and mercer remounted the tracked excavator the engine gauge showed the machine had been worked for several thousand hours and he doubted it had seen much maintenance in its long life but it fired at the first turn of the key he dismounted as the engine warmed and he took the matches from habte ill give them right back he promised he secured one of the wooden matches to the longest steel tooth on the excavators bucket with some tape hed found in the cab he eyed the ground for a second before asking habte to move a few feet closer to the excavator back in the cab mercer tested the vehicles hydraulics rotating the entire body extending the arm flexing its three joints and tilting the bucket through its ten degrees of play satisfied he could gauge the lag between his wrist movements on the joysticks and the machines response he glanced at his audience a devilish grin on his face damn it feels good to be on some iron again he thought selome gibby and the two drivers watched guessing at mercers intentions but none of them believing he could actually do it the owner of the rig had a particular smirk on his face when mercer accidentally overrevved the engine trust me habte and dont move mercer warned he lowered the bucket to the ground the sulfurous tip of the match almost but not quite touching the hard soil his hands were feather light on the joysticks he lowered the bucket that fraction of an inch more twisting the cab on its gimble the match flared against a rough stone and as it burned he rotated the cab extending the boom so it swung dangerously through the air the match nearly flaring out by the movement habte closed his eyes as the huge bucket swept at his head mercers feet and hands danced over the controls he had judged perfectly an instant before the wind extinguished the match he touched it to the tip of the cigarette in habtes mouth the eritrean took a nervous drag and laughed delightedly a jet of smoke blowing from his mouth and nose mercer gave a mock salute to the applause from the others how did you do that selomes question was filled with awe he grinned like a boy i grew up on machines like this my grandfather taught me when i was ten or twelve habte ask the driver if im qualified to use his machine then lets get the excavator reloaded were going for a little drive at the far end of the bowl under the looming rock face of the northern ridge mercer slowed the land cruiser he drove hunched to the windshield so he could study the cliff over their heads using its irregularities for reference finally he stopped and the tractor trailer pulled up behind them mercer was on the ground in a minute running up a long talus slope in the mountain come on he called down at fifty feet above the plain he paused to allow selome habte and the others to reach a wide sandstone plateau what do you see mercer invited pointing out over the bowl nothing selome breathed i thought the same thing when i first got up here yesterday mercer lowered himself onto his haunches okay explanation time after exploring the minewhich was dug during the italian occupation by the wayi had a hard time believing that there could be two different groups of people looking for the same defunct property they didnt seem know about each other until the gun fight in rome and yet they are playing for the same high stakes the chances that they were after the same thing without knowing about the other seemed pretty remote so i started thinking that maybe both groups are after a diamond mine but not necessarily the same one what are you suggesting as mercer suspected there was something besides curiosity in selomes tone that there are two mines here one dug before world war ii and one worked a lot longer ago im guessing those europeans in asmara must be representatives of the italian company which built that head gear out there and sank the shaft the sudanese are coming at us from a different angle they must know of the older earlier mine in this valley but arent sure of its precise location selome appeared to accept his explanation but he noticed a discomfort that hadnt been there a second ago in his scenario however he had no idea where harrys kidnappers fit in he considered that if harrys captors had given him gin and might not be from an arab terror group he couldnt begin to guess at her and the mossads interested in this whole thing go on habte prompted the older mine must have been lost long before the italians came here or they would have discovered it themselves when they surveyed the valley they sank their shaft a couple miles off the mark why do you say that they dug three miles from the kimberlite vent it was an understandable mistake their geologist must have assumed the vent was in the center of this circular depression and drove the shaft accordingly he didnt realize that erosion by wind and rain had shifted the surface topography in the past billion years distorting the rim of mountains so they no longer surrounded the vent but sat atop it instead now assuming the vent had been mined by someone else before the italians came all i had to do was find the ancient workings and did you im pretty sure mercer replied one of the keys to mining is ventilation moving air into the underground workings to blow out the dust and provide oxygen to the miners in the big mines in south africa they pump about sixteen tons of air into the shafts for every ton of ore they remove now the problems of ventilation for an older mine say one dug before modern machinery are even tougher i juryrigged an anometer yesterday out of a metal can and a shovel handle after gibby went to get you then drove around the bowl testing wind speed and direction until i found this spot the wind whips over the northern wall of the depression curls back on itself in a vortex that can gust to about twenty miles an hour mercer used his finger to draw a crude sketch in the soil the drawing showed the side of the mountain with a vshaped symbol pointing at its flank the tricky part comes when you need to channel the air into the shaft concentrating the flow exactly where you want it now look again on the desert floor right below us it was gibby with his younger sharper eyes who saw it first there he pointed i see what you drew there were two faint lines in the dirt just a shade darker than the rest of the desert they were two hundred feet long angling toward each other so they nearly met below where the party stood they were too geometrical for nature to be their creator they were the work of man what are they all that remains of the foundations of two huge walls judging by their width id guess they were at least seventy feet tall more than enough to catch the wind blowing off the mountains and channel it into a mine entrance im sure there are some vents driven into the mountain to allow an escape outlet for the wind but im not too concerned with those quite yet you mean we are standing on top of another mine thats right mercer tempered his excitement with difficulty a horizontal drift tunneled into the mountain when was this excavated asked habte i dont know we can check the foundations to get an idea but its not really important the question i want answered is who dug this in the first place selome said mercer glanced at her feeling she already knew the answer well find that when we open her up an hour later the excavator was ripping into the side of the hill clearing away the dirt that had piled against the stone face mercer stood next to where the bucket clawed into the ground using hand gestures to guide the operator he kept a shovel with him and every ten minutes or so would descend into the trench dug by the machine the temperature was again hovering around a hundred degrees and mercer worked stripped to the waist every trip into the trench was more dangerous than the last it was already fifteen feet deep and twice as long its sides loose and crumbling he used the hand shovel to dig a bit farther into the soil exposing earth that hadnt seen daylight in who knew how many years carrying samples out of the trench he examined each minutely before motioning for the excavator to continue what are you looking for selome asked when he emerged after the sixth time habte gibby and the truck driver were busy unbundling the pallets of equipment secured to the tractor trailer overburden the mines waste rock mercer wiped the sweat from his forehead with a saturated bandanna when it was first excavated they would have piled the worthless material at the entrance it should be easy to detect it from the accumulated surface material but if the mines at the point of the two walls why dont we dig into the mountain there because i want to know whats in there before we reopen the shaft its a question of safety mercer explained and im hoping to discover the mine tailings the kimberlite that has already been broken down and picked through why we know the diamonds are here mercer just grunted and watched her walk off she knew there was something here he was sure but he wasnt banking on her interest being diamonds he decided that when they found the mines entrance he would have his talk with her by noon there was a fiftyfoot scar in the hillside the side of the mountain had tumbled in small avalanches as its support was torn away and the laborious process of digging had to be repeated mercer was at the controls of the excavator and the eritrean operator named abebe was standing in the pit when the teeth of the machine bit into the first of the kimberlite tailings mercer shut down the engine bounding from his perch abebe was already on his hands and knees examining the pulverized bluish stones in the bucket the kimberlite had been crushed into a fine aggregate the biggest piece no larger than the first joint of mercers thumb the men who had originally worked the mine had been very thorough in the processing of the ore nearly powdering it to find even the smallest diamonds to warrant this kind of extra work mercer knew meant the mines assay value was high it also told him that this had been a massive operation with hundreds or perhaps thousands of workers kimberlite was notoriously tough and it would take days to handcrush even a small amount to this consistency he took the shovel from abebe and dug into the exposed vein of kimberlite waste the digging was slow for the rock had been cemented together by the weight of the mountain above it and the countless rains that had percolated through it the shovel hit a particularly tough spot and mercer tossed it aside dropping to his belly to peer into the hole hed created he thrust both arms into the earth wrestling something out of the ground it was another type of stone white and badly chipped roughly the size of his fist mercer held it to the light with reverence ill be a son of a bitch as he studied it his estimate of the mines age was pushed back several thousand years abebe didnt understand mercers fascination with the lump of worked stone and ignored him when mercer retrieved his leather kit bag from the excavator and placed the rock inside selome and the others joined them a short while later gibby had made lunch and habte had found beer in the village of ila babu they ate and drank in companionable silence selome sat close to mercer her knee almost touching his habte translated a question from the truck driver do you want us to work through the day it is going to get hotter fraid so mercer replied i dont know how long our presence here will remain a secret the mountains contain most of the noise from the excavators engine but people on the other side will be able to hear us the driver nodded at the response but it was apparent he wasnt too happy about it were just about ready to open the mine entrance mercer said to lighten their mood we hit the kimberlite tailings just before lunch and im satisfied that we can open the mine without any danger what do you think well find i have a theory mercer said then looked at the youngest member of their party gibby habte mentioned theres an old monastery near here do you know where it is i can show you habte replied its about sixty miles away no i need you here to start opening the mine but i want to go up there and talk to the priests gibby do you know it yes i think i can find it from here but it is far the teenager didnt sound sure talk to habte about it we wont be leaving for a day or two anyway why do you want to talk to the priests that monastery has been here for a thousand years and im willing to bet they already know about this mine and the people who opened it but what do you wish to learn selome pressed if i knew that i wouldnt need to talk to them now would i mercer stood and brushed off the back of his pants he was sure that selome had detected a change in his attitude toward her shed been playing him for a fool and it pissed him off she knew what this was all about had known since the beginning but still was asking questions she knew the answers to mercer had some questions of his own and it was getting time for the answers they worked for three straight days each of them settling into a routine that left them wasted when the sun finally set habte and the truck driver rigged a plow on the front of the tenwheeled rig to use it as a bulldozer they worked in unison with the excavator pushing aside the piles of debris that the big caterpillar stripped from the side of the mountain mercer and abebe took turns running the excavator while gibby stood in the excavated sections guiding the bucket to maximize the bite it took with every scoop only selome who didnt have a specific task related to the digging balked at the traditional female role of housekeeper and chef late afternoon on the third day there was still no sign of the mine entrance the team was gathered at the excavation the ground had been compressed by the movement of the excavator until it felt like concrete they had opened up a chasm nearly sixty feet wide and over twice that deep the mountain towered above them it hung precariously from the bottom of the chasm the sky was just a narrow blue band between the two sides habte and abebe were smoking cigarettes while mercer pulled from a bottle of beer they were all frustrated by the amount of work and the lack of results mercer broke the tired silence im going to have to blast the mountain weve dug so deep im afraid that lot over our heads is going to come down pretty soon we have to cause our own avalanche and thatll mean at least another full day to clear the debris before we can continue to dig for the mine entrance no other way habte agreed we did the same thing when i worked in the quarries did you get the fertilizer i requested mercer asked as he finished the last of the beer ammonium nitrite two hundred pounds worth and i got five thousand feet of detonator cord the explosives mercer had requested when still in washington had been abandoned in asmara so he was forced to improvise good well use the diesel from the trucks auxiliary tank we wont need that much punchthe mountain will collapse with just a good swift kick he looked at the hill gauging where he would place the amfo after i make the shot selome gibby and i are going to the monastery and have a chat with the good fathers why do you need me selome didnt sound like she minded the trip but she was curious no offense to gibby but his english isnt much better than my tigrinyan congratulations youve been promoted from scullery wench to interpreter selome smiled give me another week and ill be running this operation thats the spirit mercer matched her smile for the first time in days theyd have a chance to talk on the ride to the monastery asmara eritrea night was his element yosef had the ability to blend with the shadows so he was like a wraith on the nearly deserted streets easing around the puddles of light cast by an occasional street lamp his motions were deliberate his pace deceptively quick though he did not hurry himself after eleven in the evening asmara virtually shut down even the busiest streets were devoid of cars and there was little chance of running into pedestrians in all his previous nocturnal meetings the rogue mossad agent had yet to see a police patrol since their return from nacfa he and his team had holed up in a rundown hotel near the old sovietstyle parade ground the hotels owner though harboring suspicions had been paid enough not to ask questions about his guests asmaras police were on the alert for a european in connection with the shootings at the ambasoira hotel and while they did not have a good description of yosef he maintained constant vigilance according to profile the authorities were more interested in the two sudanese terrorists and the others responsible for a disturbance at the old market and cattle stockade the newspapers editorial was calling for a crackdown on all sudanese in the city many of whom were there illegally and barely mentioned the white man who had killed the two rebels this apparent lack of interest gave yosef the time he needed to cultivate a contact in the city because of his nationality he already had an established support network nearly everywhere in the world after returning to asmara he had needed only a few hours to find it asmara boasted a very small jewish community just a few families and only a couple of them had the resources he could use of course there was selome nagasts family who would certainly be able to get the information he needed but it would be impossible to go to them for obvious reasons though there were no formal synagogues in the city there was a rabbi who taught and held services in his home a man in his late thirties with a pretty wife and two children his father had been a rabbinical student in the united states during the fifties who had trained his son so he too could shepherd eritreas jews hoping for a better life for his own children the ersatz rabbi wanted his children to go to university in israel when they were old enough and yosef used the leverage to make him an accomplice aharon yadid had welcomed yosef that first night with something akin to worship not only was the secret agent from the fabled holy land but he was also a member of the mossad the agency most responsible for protecting the jewish state the young rabbi had never been to israel himself and felt disconnected by his isolation from the rest of world jewry especially since operation moses had airlifted thousands of ethiopian jews to the homeland aharon met yosef at the door of his onestory bungalow having observed the israeli agent through the curtained front window shalom shalom he greeted eagerly showing off his only word of hebrew hello rabbi i hope this night finds you and your family well yosef spoke in english the only language both men could use yes we are well come in please the children are already asleep and my wife has gone to a friends she wont be back for a while so we can be alone good aharon turned on a single lamp the interior of the house was spartan the yadids were not wealthy although the furniture was well cared for and the feminine touches of flowers and colorful prints on the scrubbed walls made it cheerful yosef demurred an offer for refreshment and both men sat quickly i know i have said this at all of our meetings aharon gushed but i want to tell you again how much it means to me to help you and to help our beloved israel yosef regarded aharons open face saw the innocence in his eyes he wondered how many years had passed since he too had believed so strongly in what he did its the duty of every jew to help our homeland and its refreshing to find a man who knows this and embraces it jews in america just give money as long as it isnt too much of a sacrifice my father spoke of that often aharon agreed so my friend what have you found out for me you were wise to come to me but not for why you think there is only one jewish family living in the north and when i reached them they knew of nothing unusual taking place near the border but the brother of my wifes closest childhood friend owns a small shop in nacfa and he said there was a truck there for many days working on the roads yes i remember seeing it an excavator of some kind i assumed it was owned by the government it wasnt this friend of a friend spoke often with the machines owner and learned that he was waiting to take his equipment up near the hajar plateau for another job a secret job aharon was gladdened by the look of interest in yosefs eyes i learned just today that the excavating machine has left nacfa and headed for hajar or more accurately a place the nomads call the valley of dead children do you know this valley ive heard it is a bad place there was a massacre there during the war several hundred eritrean soldiers were killed in a surprise artillery attack but even before that it was a place that people avoided eritrea is riddled with superstition and ive learned that the valley of dead children is one of the most feared places in the country do you know why no i dont believe in superstitions they are the providence of the ignorant and unenlightened many of the nomad clans are still animists they worship their ancestors and hold pagan rituals their petty fears are of no interest to a learned man like me yosef struggled to keep the smirk off his face even this man with secondhand knowledge of his faith was a snob how can i find this valley aharon handed a folded piece of paper to the israeli this is an old military map that shows the location of the valley it is marked with a red cross denoting a site of a battle in which eriteans were killed there are no roads leading to it that i could see and you must cross the adobha river which the friend told me is now in full flood yosef glanced at the map they still had the rented plane they had used earlier to leapfrog ahead of mercer when the engineer had fled asmara they would simply fly over the natural barrier of the river judging by what hed seen of the northern desert from their drive back from nacfa there would be no problem finding a level place on which to land the aircraft near the valley he forced a smile you have done very well and when i return to israel i promise that i will make certain your children will be sponsored to study at tel aviv university before aharon could show his gratitude his wife stepped through the front door aharon told her of yosefs offer and she rushed across the room to throw her arms around the israeli tears of happiness streaming down her cheeks she spoke to him in excited tigrinyan her emotions transcending language yosef barely acknowledged her joy his mind was planning out the next and perhaps final phase of the operation mercer must have been at the mine when he had been contacted earlier and had lied about his location the american had bluffed and yosef found his anger rising at such an insult the israeli agent had told mercer that harry white was going to lose a hand though yosef hadnt intended to carry out the threat but now yes he would order it done he would record the sounds with the microcassette he carried as he had done for whites previous message he considered that if mercer had found the mine and was working to reopen it there would be no reason for his team to return to asmara after reaching the valley and after tonight yosef could not afford to be seen anywhere in the country yosef aharon broke into his silent musings yes my wife wants to do something for you to show our thanks perhaps a meal in your honor yosef gave him a sad smile that wont be necessary tell her another hug is thanks enough he stood his right hand hidden behind his back the womans arms came around his neck her cheek pressed to his chest yekanyelay she sobbed thank you i am sorry yosef said quietly in hebrew he used his knife normal procedure dictated he kill aharon first as a man he posed more of a physical threat but yosef decided that watching his wife die would stun the rabbi enough for him to dispatch the eritrean before he recovered further a womans reactions are quicker than a mans and her scream would likely have alerted the children asleep in their beds yosef was across the room plunging the bloody blade into aharons chest before the body of his wife hit the rug covering the wooden floor the rabbi stood still as the knife came at him his eyes fixed on a horror beyond his comprehension in seconds it was over and yosef was back on the street heading toward his hotel for security reasons he had no choice but to kill them someday aharon yadid would have told a friend about the israeli agent he had helped and that was a leak yosef could not afford there was a great deal to accomplish before he and his team left for the valley of dead children he had to contact the team members in jerusalem guarding harry white and order his mutilation a task he would enjoy for the pain it would cause mercer he also had to reach defense minister levine and order the helicopter for when the mission was over the israeli defense force had ch super stallion helicopters that could make the flight with their upgraded inflight refueling capability and safely return with their precious cargo it would take some coordination to have flying tankers standing by to support one of these choppers and only levine could clandestinely order all the necessary equipment even through the churning ideas that flooded his brain yosef still found a few seconds to consider what he would find at the mine the idea was staggering not only would it ensure levines election there was something even larger at stake than a political victory out in the desert lay hidden a tangible link to the founding of judaism a talisman unlike any other religious artifact ever unearthed if they could bring it to light it would make the great dead sea scrolls pale in comparison a piece of living history was within his reach now something stolen from israel hundreds of generations ago that had become his destiny to bring home he shook himself of these feelings and refocused on his job things were coming into place first was the location of the mine and now he finally had an idea who was behind the sudanese attacks in rome and at mercers hotel yosef had learned from archive their secret tap into the mossad computer system that italian industrialist giancarlo gianelli was under investigation by the fbi and interopol in conjunction with documents stolen from the united states yosef harbored the suspicion that they were talking about the medusa pictures taking into consideration italys colonial presence in eritrea it seemed likely that gianelli was after the pictures and the mine he guessed that the italian was behind the sudanese perhaps using them as a mercenary army to thwart mercers and indirectly yosefs own efforts what he didnt know was how close the italian was and if he knew about what really lay hidden out in the northern wastelands jerusalem security all over israel was still on a heightened alert even after two incidentfree months had passed since the deadly bombing at the western wall nowhere was this more apparent than within the towering ramparts surrounding jerusalems old city armed patrols walked the narrow twisting streets in even greater numbers than during the infitata while every israeli citizen had to perform two years of active military service it appeared that the idf was using only the toughest veterans to patrol the sacred city uniforms and machine pistols were a common sight all over the country but the grim faces of these shock troops chilled even the most impassive residents the streets and meandering alleys were eerily quiet this night except for the low mutterings of the patrols and the occasional rustle of feral cats picking through garbage the shops were boarded up for the night and little light escaped from the shuttered windows of the houses the gibbous moon shone on the cobbled roads its milky otherworldly light only adding to the haunted feeling of the city beyond the crusader walls the new city of jerusalem too was quiet the presence of so many armed soldiers patrolling the streets and neighborhoods harassing both jew and arab alike in their search for terrorists had strained the patience of the inhabitants to the point where they no longer ventured out unless absolutely necessary in the safe house within the old city the strain of maintaining vigilance was also telling on the remainder of yosefs team those charged with guarding harry white these soldiers were the groups lowest ranks those with minimal combat experience the best of the organization had gone to eritrea with yosef leaving the younger lesstrained zealots to hold their prisoner without yosefs direct control discipline had started falling and was now at its lowest ebb while their belief in their cause and in defense minister levine had not wavered theyd lost interest in babysitting a cantankerous old man the younger members chafed at the forced inactivity arguments had become a problem rachel goldstein the nurse who was the ranking member in yosefs absence and now team leader found herself treating cuts and abrasions from the fights that broke out with increased regularity her authority was all but gone and she realized that if they didnt receive new orders soon they would murder the old man and leave for their homes fervency like flame needs fuel to burn brightly untended it can quickly die then finally direction had come minister levine had called earlier in the evening with word that he wanted them out of the city he promised them a new safe house at a secure military base in the negev desert adjacent to the demona nuclear research facility this was welcome news but levine had not specified how they were to get past the security patrols in jerusalem rachel had asked him about safe passage out of the city and levine had responded that he could not issue such orders without rousing suspicion he explained that the curfew in effect all over jerusalem could not be broken for any reason without direct orders from prime minister litvinoff no exception she had argued with him fiercely but the defense minister didnt budge because vehicles were not allowed in most parts of the old city rachel realized they would have to walk harry white to a van they had waiting in the new city making their task that much more difficult rachel had already sent one man to get the van and wait for them outside the zion gate on eziyyoni street he had a cellular phone and would call when he was in position she sat at the kitchen table with the rest of her people discussing ideas that would make their evacuation easier but so far they had come up with nothing inspired their lack of training and experience showed i guess we will have to go with the idea of a diversion rachel surmised after thirty minutes of wasted conversation jacob and lev will leave here when david calls from the van the two agents nodded i want you at least a half kilometer from the safe house before starting anything what you do for a diversion is at your discretiona burst of automatic fire into the side of a building should be sufficient i neednt remind you that you can not be apprehended she noted the excitement in the young mens faces they didnt understand her completely so she spelled it out for them if it appears that youll be captured by a security patrol your only option is suicide we cant take the risk of your capture exposing us there is no way you would ever be able to stand up under a physical and pharmacological interrogation yes maam moshe she looked at the youngest member of the team the man most responsible for watching harry white get our prisoner ready we should be leaving within ten minutes okay the boy said smartly harry knew something was up as soon as moshe entered his cell as the days of his captivity ran into each other their interest in him and thus their attention had slackened it was unusual for his guards to check on him unless it was meal time not being harassed gave him some comfort but it didnt offer any better chance of escape they had guns and he did not always a thin man harry had lost weight during his captivity his cheeks hung like empty pouches off his face and his bright blue eyes had sunk behind wrinkled folds of skin so they almost disappeared in his head despite his ragged appearance he felt better than he had in years hed drunk sparingly of the bottle of gin moshe had given him and still had nearly half left at first it had been difficult not to polish off the bottle in one drunken sitting but after getting over the physical craving harrys discipline surprised even him back home he drank more out of routine than any deepseated emotional problem and with the tension hed experienced in the past weeks boredom was no longer a problem once this ordeal was over however he promised himself a weeklong bender but until then he had to keep sharp knowing his life depended on his actions he allowed himself only a few small sips before falling asleep after his dinner three weeks of near sobriety had done wonders to clear his mind of fifty years of accumulated hangovers he was a bit more liberal with the cigarettes but he still smoked less than half a pack a day a few more weeks of this he joked to himself would leave him feeling like he wasnt a day over seventyfive whats going on harry greeted the young israeli when the boy nudged him gently awake we are leaving harry get dressed harry sat up swinging his foot to the floor his prosthetic leg leaned against the wall like a littleused umbrella time for another bogus call to mercer harry could only hope that his friend had understood the reference to boodles during their last communication of course the brand moshe had given him wasnt boodles but he was sure the men holding him wouldnt recognize the brand while mercer should even harry knew that if moshe drank he couldnt be a muslim as he had first guessed no harry we are leaving this house moshe replied while his prisoner strapped on his leg and began to dress excitement tickled the back of harrys brain hed thought that if they ever moved him again and they didnt drug him as theyd done the last time he might find a way to escape he kept his voice neutral where we headed moshe gave a small laugh you know i cant tell you that yeah yeah yeah he finished with his shirt and reached into the bundle of blankets to retrieve the gin still cached there can i at least bring this along nothing makes time pass quicker than a drop or two of liquor moshes expression brightened we will share it on the drive well have a few hours together but you must cooperate with us when we walk to a vehicle we have waiting come on my boy look at me harry chuckled does it look as if i have a choice moshe laughed harry was as threatening as a toothless tomcat their driver david called twenty minutes later he was waiting at the dormition abbey just outside the zion gate lev and jacob left the safe house immediately their uzis hidden under long dark coats all right people get ready they should be in position in a couple minutes as soon as we hear the gunfire i want us moving rachel ordered the wait was only seven minutes the sound of gunfire was muted by the distance still it echoed throughout the old city rachels face remained impassive as they paused at the door seconds later the night was filled with running feet and police whistles she could imagine the people in the neighborhood cowering in their beds quietly asking each other what was happening okay lets go there were only four of them including harry white moshe kept a tight grip on the old mans arm as they eased out the door rachel took the lead an automatic pistol held discreetly against her thigh they had to cover about threequarters of a mile through the jewish quarter to reach the waiting van and while she didnt like the exposure she had no choice harrys mind worked furiously he tried to recognize any landmark that might look familiar as they moved but nothing came to him he was in the middle east of that he was sure but had no idea where the one clue he hadmoshe drinking the gin with himgave him nothing and then he realized that a woman was now leading the team a woman not in an arab country in a rush everything came clear his kidnappers were jewish some israeli extremist group no doubt he should have seen it all along moshe was a jewish name the name of a former israeli leader shit he cursed himself under his breath but how to make this work to his advantage this was his best opportunity to escape and still he had no ideas muslim or jew it didnt matter as long as they were armed he did sense the groups tension and wisely decided not to delay them by intentionally slowing his pace he could tell they were all in danger rachel stiffened when she heard a group of men running toward them she hid the pistol behind her leg just as a dozen soldiers rounded a corner a half block away their equipment slapping against their uniforms as soon as the security patrol spotted the four people breaking the curfew order their weapons came up twelve fingers tightening on the triggers no please wait rachel cried in hebrew we are israeli citizens what are you doing on the street the ranking soldier called back his weapon centered on rachels head there was a shooting close to our apartment my grandfather was frightened rachel improvised pointing at harry he demanded we leave immediately he is very ill the strain is bad for his heart return to your home at once the soldier ordered you should not be out here i know but we cannot calm him she lowered her voice to draw on the soldiers natural compassion his wife my grandmother was killed in the bombing at the wall he has not been himself at that revelation the leader of the patrol lowered his weapon and his troops followed suit the soldier looked at the group critically deciding that a woman two boys barely out of their teens and a man who looked as though he would die at any moment did not pose a threat the radio on his belt squawked and he shifted his attention from rachel to it a patrol has made contact he said to his group two men armed with automatic weapons theyve split up i think one of the bastards is heading our way he looked at rachel again but already his concentration was on the hunt for the renegades clear the street as quickly as you can there are two of them out here tonight harry watched the exchange realized that the patrol was about to leave and got a sickening inspiration it was now or never god forgive me for what im about to do then as loud as he could he screamed heil hitler his shocking outburst had the desired effect the patrol swung back toward the group of kidnappers and in the split second of indecision one of the young israelis with rachel was startled and drew his weapon harry dropped to the ground as the patrols galil assault rifles chattered the street dancing with the fire of the muzzle flashes rachel dove out of the way bringing her pistol up she dropped one of the soldiers with a double tap the troopers throat exploding with the impact of the two rounds another soldier was taken out before the patrol managed to direct their aim with more accuracy moshe was dead from a dozen bullet wounds before his corpse hit the ground rolling on the cobbled street harry maneuvered himself around a corner and out of the battle as gunfire whined over his head in the gloom ahead he saw a dark figure running toward him a machine pistol at the ready he guessed that it was one of rachels diversionary troops and he slunk into a darkened store entrance to let the kidnapper pass knowing he would add to the confusion behind him levs uzi had a sharper sound than the patrols galils and a full magazine exploded into the ranks of soldiers scything down four of them and wounding three more his burst gave rachel the covering fire she needed to race from the confined street firing behind her as she managed her escape limping badly from a bullet lodged in her upper thigh harry didnt wait to listen for the patrols return fire he got to his feet and started running keeping to the shadows cutting through any alley he came to in an effort to lose himself in the ancient city the only thing that saved him from being picked up was the patrols diminished number and the fact that they tracked the fleeing kidnappers slowly fearing an ambush in ten minutes harry felt he had put enough distance between himself and the firefight to rest for a few minutes and consider his next move savoring freedom for the first time in weeks he was still cut off and alone he realized that a curfew must be in effect and he would have to wait before trying to find help he had to find americans embassy staffers or someone if he hoped to get out of the country alive that would be his best option but how where could he find countrymen in a nation he knew virtually nothing about harry looked around and saw a church across the street in the milky glow of spotlights washing up the buildings facade he saw that there was an english translation to the announcements on their bulletin board reading the list of regular services the church provided harry saw his opportunity and smiled david was waiting exactly as planned the engine of the windowless van idling quietly rachel ran up to the vehicle her face tight with the pain in her leg without a word she threw open the passenger door and eased herself into the seat drive what about the others no one else made it we were hit by a security patrol everyone else is dead her voice was weak and exhausted her cell phone chirped now what rachel its yosef we were hit yosef the team was wiped out and whites gone at the safe house we ran into a patrol while leaving the city and harry white managed to escape in the confusion levine said he couldnt compromise himself by giving us a military escort or ordering troops to let us break curfew he left us on our own and it turned into a massacre that prick yosef spat he wants the prime ministers office and now that its within his reach i think he wants to cut us loose i spoke with him about a helicopter extraction and while he agreed to it it sounded as though hes not too enthusiastic ive been reading the papers it looks like hes going to win the election in a landslide rachel said he really doesnt need us any longer the enormity of her situation crashed in on her do you think hell have us killed no he still wants whats at the mine but afterward i dont know yosef paused as he reconsidered levine is an ambitious bastard but we know enough to force him to honor his commitment if he kills us hell never be sure we havent told what weve done to others besides when were successful his position within the government will be secure forever our involvement and our actions couldnt hurt him there would be no need to kill us but white will talk he doesnt know anything and when i kill mercer there will be no witnesses that still leaves selome nagast rachel reminded i know shell have to die too i didnt want to do that the fallout from shin bet will be enormous but levine will have to handle it yosef are we right rachel asked is our job important enough for all of these killings no job is important enough to kill for but our quest is not because of levine but because of what it will mean to the rest of israel he told her about mercers discovery of the valley of dead children and his plans to reach the site the following day he also told her about giancarlo gianellis operation and how it likely overlapped with theirs yosef had a suspicion that he would find the industrialist had already beaten him to the mine which forced the israeli agent to modify his plan he decided they would approach the valley cautiously and keep it under observation before making their own play he refocused his attention on rachel and her plight you have to find someplace to hide until after the election and let us worry about what to do next dont contact levine ill handle him weve got just a few weeks left and then it will be over for all of us yosef cut the connection northern eritrea the toyota was a speck in the vastness of the desert moving just ahead of the billowing dust of its wake the twin scars of its tire prints ran off to the infinity of the horizon other than the truck nothing moved in the desertno animal or bird no lizard or crawling insect ventured out into the torturous heat while rain fell on the eastern part of the country and angry masses of clouds were visible in the distance the storms had not yet come to the hajar region the desert floor was cracked split open in a natural process that tripled its surface area and would allow a greater amount of water to be absorbed when it finally did rain it was as if the soil itself needed the precious water to survive mercer drove recklessly trusting his own reactions and the vehicles speed in case they drove over any of the antipersonnel mines sown on the open plain if they hit a larger antitank mine nothing he could do would save their lives gibby sat next to him his hand braced against the dash while selome grimly gripped a ceiling strap in the back her eyes riveted out the rear window do you see them yet mercer shouted over the engines roar no not yet selome replied hoarsely oh shit i see them now mercer shifted his gaze to the rearview mirror for a second and spied the pursuing fourwheel drive at this distance it was only a sparkling reflection a jewel pinned to the desert by dust blowing up behind it sorry guys he called darkly i dont think were going to make it they had started their drive from the camp two hours after dawn mercer and habte with the help of abebe had laid the explosive charges mercer had fashioned during the night by premixing the ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in a dozen onegallon metal cans at dawn the three of them had dug holes into the mountain according to a plan mercer had devised to maximize the shots and tumble the overhanging walls of their excavation once the holes had been dug and the charges buried they scrambled back to ground level moved the vehicles to a safe distance and waited while mercer made the final connections to the batterydriven detonator he called the countdown but gave gibby the honor of shooting the amfo the boy had practically begged the fuses burned at twelve thousand feet per second so it seemed the detonations were instantaneous but a cascade compression wave had been created in the rock that built steadily in fractions of seconds if gibby was disappointed by the small geysers of dirt thrown up by the detonation he was delighted by their final results the manmade chasm they had laboriously dug into the mountain collapsed inward at the same instant the bulk of material above let go creating a longslide avalanche that carried tons of dirt nearly four hundred yards from the slope gibby let out a whoop that echoed even as the rumble subsided abebe habte and the other driver took up the cry and even mercer gave a victorious shout the blast had been better than even he had anticipated okay boys you know what to do mercer said it would take two days to remove the rubble from the blast but when the arduous task was finished they could continue to chip away at the mountain to expose the mine entrance without fear of a cavein mercer had set the charges high enough on the hillside to ensure that the blast went outward rather than into the mountain so he was not concerned with damaging the ancient workings below selome and gibby had left the valley of dead children with mercer while habte and the others tore into the heaps of debris they had packed for a couple of days in case it took them longer to find the monastery but gibby assured mercer that he could locate it quickly it was selome who had first spotted the other vehicle she had noticed it when they were no more than half an hour away from the entrance to the valley and immediately alerted mercer this cant be good he said it could be another survey team looking for minerals that just happen to be in the same area selome suggested lamely mercer didnt waste the time to respond as soon as he saw the truck cresting a hill behind them hed started to accelerate immediately the other vehicle took up the chase once when the other truck had gained enough ground for them to recognize it as a fiat a winking light appeared in the passengerside window an instant later feathers of dust exploded in the wake of the fleeing toyota midcaliber machinegun fire no matter how hard mercer pushed their battered toyota the pursuing truck was quicker it was only mercers driving skills and his ability to read the terrain that had kept them out of weapons range again but now out in the open the fiat was rapidly closing what do you mean were not going to make it selome asked theyve got a newer faster fourwheel drive a gust of wind nearly tore the steering wheel from his grip when he was back in control he continued theres no place to lose them out here because our tire prints and the dust this pig is kicking up are going to give us away neither selome nor gibby could argue another happy fact mercer said after a minute of silence is the land mines if this region is covered with them which everyone tells me it is were going to hit one its just a matter of time even an antipersonnel variant would stop the toyota dead maybe those guys behind us will hit one first not if they drive in our tracks another blast of wind hit the toyota on a horizon that was rushing toward them the storm clouds piled into towering walls that blocked the distance like dark curtains it was frightening an awesome display of natural fury how long before it hits mercer asked quickly i dont know gibby shouted over the wind whipping through the toyotas open windows i have seen storms like that stay over one area for days and not move at all are you kidding me its true selome yelled from the backseat these storms usually hug the ground and cant get over the mountains often rain wont fall from them for days even weeks that means the air in front of them compresses against the hills and springs back creating mercers voice was choked off as the air around the truck came alive the sandstorm blew up so suddenly and violently that the trio was coughing before they could close the windows the land cruiser filled with a dark amber light that shifted constantly as the storm raged over them the sky screamed as sand was stripped off the surface of the desert and blown thousands of feet into the air mercer slowed the toyota his visibility down to zero jesus he muttered as the storm unbelievably intensified already the windshield was opaque selome gave a little cry from the backseat and gibby stared goggleeyed into the maelstrom the wind shoved the toyota so hard it felt as if they were still speeding over the broken ground selome how far behind was the other truck mercer shouted i dont remember come on he prompted he could see the terror in her eyes when he twisted around to look at her just give me your best guess half a mile maybe all right the storms going to erase our tire tracks but were still too close to the fiat when this mess blows over theyre going to spot us in a second what can we do gibby asked were going to continue on mercers jaw clenched with determination but you cant see selome cried sure i can i just cant see outside of the truck the joke felt flat to mercers ears too he replayed the last image of the desert hed seen before the dust had obscured it studied it in his mind and engaged the transmission gambling that the driver of the other truck wouldnt budge until after the storm had passed the toyota crept forward mercer driving from memory the desert floor had been relatively flat before the storm had hit so he wasnt overly worried about any sudden drops or dips but as the wind pummeled the side of the land cruiser keeping them on a straight course was next to impossible ten minutes trickled by the land cruiser crawling blindly through the twisting slashes of wind and sand mercers hand slick on the steering wheel his body attuned to any attitude shifts that would signal a hill or a valley then as suddenly as it had started the storm blew over them and they were in the clear even before his eyes could adjust to the sudden burst of sunlight mercer floored the accelerator flinging gibby and selome back in their seats they had a precious few minutes before the sand settled around their pursuers selome keep your eye out for that fiat and tell me the instant you see it there was a series of low hills a half mile ahead and mercer was hoping that they would be behind them before she saw the other vehicle if the three of them were spotted first it would all be over anything no the storm is still hanging on back there i cant see them i think the toyota catapulted in the air throwing off smoking hunks of body work and bits of its undercarriage the thunder of the explosion drowned out the screams of the passengers crashing on its three remaining tires the land cruiser flipped on its side its front fender plowing a deep furrow into the soil a perfect soldier had waited decades to strike its deadly blow designed as an antipersonnel weapon the sovietbuilt landmine did not have the power to destroy the toyota and because of the vehicles speed much of the detonative force was released under the engine rather than below the wheel that had activated its primer with most of its energy absorbed by the engine block only a tenth of the charge blasted into the cab it was more than enough the last thing mercer remembered clearly was the sound of selomes voice then he was assaulted by a jumbled whirl of images screams and pain the earth erupting under the land cruiser and the jarring crush as it slammed into the ground again his ears ringing mercer wiped his face and his trembling hand came away covered with blood his whole body ached as his senses slowly returned he couldnt feel the pain that would indicate a wound capable of producing the amount of blood splattered on his clothes his first thought was selome he tried to turn and check on her but he couldnt move from where he was wedged under the steering wheel a heavy weight pressed on him and he recognized it was gibby or what was left of him the explosion had been channeled into the passengerside foot well shredding the boys legs so badly that only a few stringy bits of flesh kept them attached to his body massive tissue trauma had killed him immediately but ropes of blood still drooled from the ragged wounds pouring onto mercer saturating him seeing the dead eritrean sharpened mercers mind and vomit flooded his mouth he choked it back painfully selome he called she was sobbing thank god slowly he eased gibbys body off him when he stood on the smashedin door a wave of nausea nearly dropped him back on top of the corpse he ignored any injuries he might have and concentrated on selome she lay curled on the driversside rear door her face cupped in her hands her shoulders heaving mercer called her name again and finally she looked up her face was filthy her hair bushed around her head but he saw no blood and while her eyes were made enormous by fear she didnt appear to be in shock give me your hand he hadnt forgotten the fiat still behind them we have to get out of here she reached for him tentatively and as soon as her fingers laced with his mercer pulled her to her feet she winced when her weight pressed against her right foot the one closest to the explosion are you okay i dont know her voice was small and frail we have to get moving that other truck will be on us in no time mercer looked beyond the shattered rear window and saw a plume of dust speeding out of the shifting sandstorm like some questing tentacle the fiat was too distant to see yet but mercer knew he only had minutes before it reached them give me your gun he demanded quickly what your gun selome give it to me what are you talking about her acting job was unconvincing we have about five minutes before they reach us and if you want to live beyond then give me your goddamned gun she stared at him her face a mixture of fear and confusion then she reached into her knapsack to retrieve a big automatic how did you know even in this situation mercer felt relief that the wall of secrecy between them was starting to come down ill tell you later you know we could have used this in the cattle pens in asmara mercer took the heckler and koch selome shrugged but couldnt meet his eye mercer levered himself out of the destroyed fourwheel drive twisted on his perch and lowered his hand back to selome climb up to me ill help you but dont look in the front seat gibby didnt make it the fiats trail of dust no longer merged with the storm dying behind it mercer jumped to the ground held up his arms and selome leaped to him stay here at the back of the toyota a fivegallon jerry can of gasoline was clamped tightly in a special bracket mercer unclipped it from its mounts grabbed a pair of knapsacks that had been tossed from the roof storage rack and returned to selomes side the crater left by the landmine looked like a tiny smoking volcano he judged that the land cruiser had been thrown nearly fifteen feet by the blast what are we going to do were in the middle of a mine field mercer didnt answer her question nor could he ignore it either the desert here was loose and sandy the surface raked smooth by the storm however there was a rocky outcrop about fifty yards away that would be free of mines the trick was to get from the stranded toyota to the rocks without blowing themselves up and doing it quickly enough so the pursuing fiat didnt discover their escape he twisted the lid off the gas can and began dumping its contents onto the land cruiser mercer i need to get he cut her off no time im sorry the fiat was about a half mile away its roof was visible as it drove in a shallow depression mercer scanned the ground as he worked hoping to see the imprints of mines but praying hed never see another one again finished dousing the vehicle he led her a few yards away using its battered hulk to cover their escape whenever he was working in the field mercer carried half a dozen cigarette lighters with him it was a safety precaution that went way beyond the boy scout motto but hed been in situations where hed needed all of them using his left hand he sparked open a zippo and tossed it underhand into the pool of gasoline beneath the toyota in a continuous motion he began shooting into the ground as a whooshing explosion engulfed the fourwheeldrive masking the sharp cracks of the h ampk a wall of heat overwhelmed them as they stood in the open selome tried to move away from the raging flames but mercer held her wrist tightly he fired off the entire magazine walking his shots toward the boulders a short way off each bullet plowing a small crater in the dirt roughly five feet beyond the previous one had a round hit a mine it would have carried the power to detonate the charge but there was no secondary explosion mercer released selomes hand and jumped into the first pock created by the mm bullets land where i step he cautioned and jumped again leaping into the next shallow depression it took every bit of his balance to land in the tiny craters teetering on one foot for breathless seconds his arms windmilling until he could center himself again then he would leap to the next selome at his heels unencumbered by the two knapsacks mercer carried selome bounded easily her long legs covering the distance with the grace of a gymnast if her foot was bothering her she didnt let it show give me another clip mercer said when he reached the last impact hole thats what i wanted to go back for selome answered the rest of my ammo was in the toyota i dont have any more mercers eyes went wide as he stared at the seventyfive feet of open space separating them from the safety of the rocks seventyfive feet of minesown nomans land with only one way across he couldnt hear the engine noise of the approaching fiat over the fiery eruption behind them but he knew only a few seconds remained before the vehicle rumbled into view mercer took the deep final breath of a man bent on suicide fighting an instinct to yell and vent some of the pentup emotion he started running it took his entire will not to stretch his gait to its fullest he had to leave footprints close enough for selome to use as stepping stones with every step mercer expected the detonation that would come like a sledgehammer at full swing a shearing pain that at best would kill him and at worst would immobilize him for the pursuers to finish the job he covered the first half of the distance without incident but took no solace from this the law of averages was working against him and with every step the ratio tipped more and more out of his favor with just ten more feet to cover he moaned aloud in frustration for not being able to leap those last few yards he could have done it in a flying dive but again he thought of selome and took a step that cut the distance in half and made it safe for her click he felt the dusty ground give just a tiny fraction of an inch the sound was like a distant finger snap muted by his own weight on the mine it was the primer and in the millimetric sliver of time before main charge blew he could only hope that selome would get clear working on instinct with his weight barely pressing on the cansized bomb he shifted his body in midstride heaving himself forward in an awkward lurch but his desperate leap wasnt necessary after lying dormant for fifteen years the mine had been fouled by dirt and corrosion the primer could not detonate the principal explosive mercer smashed into the rock with his shoulder too stunned at being alive to roll with the impact in his shock he almost slid back off the tor and into the dirt scrambling he turned and planted his heels on the stone arresting his slide selome come on he shouted like a sprinter in the blocks who reacts even as the gun fires she was in motion her face scrunched in concentration she bounded from print to print her arms pumping in perfect synch and even in his wasted emotional state mercer appreciated the shifting play of her breasts as she moved in seconds she was at his side are you okay she panted later mercer was on his feet again leading her over the hill and across a flat table of stone toward the foothills of one of the regions numerous mountains a quarter mile and five minutes after clearing the mine field they heard a muffled explosion behind them mercer turned a fiat halfton truck was parked directly behind their fourwheel drive two africans sudanese no doubt stood in its open rear bed and he could just make out the shadow of two more in the cab they were all looking at the rumpled figure lying dolllike a few dozen feet from the vehicles there was a new crater in the desert wisps of gray smoke blowing from it on the gentle breeze the body leaked blood from the stump of his left leg the severed member bleeding into the soil a few feet away mercer guessed that one of their pursuers had tried to chase on foot trying to duplicate their feat and paid the ultimate price for failure he and selome continued on without comment soon afterward they had lost themselves in the rugged terrain and mercer slowed their pace no longer concerned about being followed selome called a halt hours later her face blistered with sweat and dark patches appearing beneath her arms she lowered herself to a stone plateau lying flat and stretching her arms luxuriously over her head mercer flopped next to her his attention riveted to the cache of goods in the two knapsacks hed taken from the land cruiser one of them had been selomes and he dumped out the cosmetics and extra clothing selome ignored him and stared up into the hazy sky selome she looked at him and her eyes widened he held another full magazine for her heckler and koch oops oops is right mercer shook his head he combined and consolidated the useful items into one pack discarding stuff that had no value for the trek to come those things he did keep were pathetically few in number some rope a hammer several lengths of fuse he took the medusa pictures from his vest and stuffed them in with the rest of the gear i feel so terrible about gibby she said after a few minutes not only about his death but the disrespect we showed his body that wasnt right he deserved a christian burial gibbys death was one more on mercers conscience the fiat proved the sudanese were in the area and they would find the mine long before mercer could warn away the refugees hed asked neggas son to bring to the valley they would be arriving soon and their plight was his responsibility too please dont talk about religion for a while im not in the mood she was about to respond when mercer leaned over and reached a hand to the wedge of skin showing between the collars of her bush shirt a thin gold chain rested against her glossy skin and disappeared between her breasts mercer tugged it from its resting place keeping his eyes locked with selomes even as the necklace popped free revealing a golden star of david mossad he asked quietly no shin bet there was a defiance in her voice its like your fbi relief flooded through mercer he knew there would be no more lies ive heard of it are you going to tell me whats going on i guess i owe you thats putting it mildly she blew out a long breath a few months ago the medusa photographs came to the attention of an israeli fanatic group it was an answer mercer was unprepared for israeli i thought muslims were behind this selome shook her head those europeans habte saw in asmara are jewish extremists headed by defense minister chaim levine weve known about them for a while but we didnt realize until recently how powerful theyd become mercer realized theyd all been duped dick henna must have followed carefully placed false clues leading both of them to believe it was arabs who had masterminded harrys abduction he was both stunned and impressed by how cleverly this had been worked out so many things came clear as he studied her thats what harry had been trying to tell him when he said his captors had given him boodles gin or something harry must have known that hed been abducted to the mideast but recognized that his abductors werent muslims mercer should have made the connection and that oversight rekindled his anger at himself he wondered how many more mistakes hed made and how much others had paid for them selome continued levine and his followers want to make israel a totalitarian theocracy he recognized what the medusa photos revealed and knew such a discovery accredited to him would ensure him the prime ministership he tried to have them stolen from your national reconnaissance office but instead they were sold to prescott hyde hyde too saw something in them something that would bolster his shaky position within the state department we learned about all of this shortly after hyde bought them and i was sent to the united states to work with him shin bet paid off a member of the eritrean mission in washington to vouch for me so hyde never knew of my connection to israel my mission was to gather intelligence especially if levines people tried to contact hyde directly unfortunately for hyde he called you soon after i arrived in dc and you joined his search for the mine shutting down that option for levines agents hyde and his wife were killed the morning you and i left for africa hyde dead too jesus where was this going to end you left me in rome to report your findings about hyde to your control in israel is that how you figured out i was israeli i was told by dick henna before we left washington also the night you came to tinys bar my best friend harry was kidnapped to beruit it was obvious from her expression that this was new information the old guy who introduced himself as you the same mercer replied the abductors appeared to have middle eastern connections so i figured israel would fit in eventually he told her the whole story about harrys kidnapping and about the assassination at da vinci airport i didnt know if you were on my side or not remember you were working with hyde when we met it must be levines people holding your friend after you turned down hyde they must have grabbed him to compel you to come to africa and find the mine the man killed in rome was undoubtedly ibriham bein levines top agent mercer guessed beins warning in rome about not harming selome was because the israeli feared a problem if levines plot had caused the death of a shin bet agent they were already planning for the day they had israel in their grasp levines a fascist selome said bitterly i know that sounds strange for one jew to call another that but he is he believes in the purity of the jewish people and wants all others out of israel he wants to build concentration camps and corral the palestinians in fenced stockades hes been planning this for years i dont know if you remember the airlift of ethiopian jews to israel in the eighties but he was a major supporter of the operation he said it was for humanitarian reasons but even then he wanted to do away with the palestinians who perform many of the menial jobs in israel and replace them with african refugees so mercer thought he and harry had gotten in the middle of an internal israeli problem and not some international terrorist plot selome was trying to stop levine from using the medusa photographs to give himself unfair advantage in the elections all of his suspicions about her ebbed away for the first time he felt that he could trust her a dam was breaking inside of him hed been on his own for too long and now he had an ally he felt like hugging her so your job was to keep an eye on this group and report their activities and to stop them if i could but we came to eritrea before i got close suddenly something didnt make sense i understand levine is a maniac but i also read that his election was all but guaranteed even before we left washington why is he willing to ruin his chances by going after a worthless fiftyyearold diamond mine hes not selome laughed for the first time in a long time you already know we have no interest in the italian facility i think the sudanese and their backers are looking for that one thats how they stumbled on us our two missions come from different directions but end at the same location mercer matched her smile the horrors of the morning sloughing off at least for a few seconds before youd arrived in the valley when i was exploring for the older workings id already guessed that you were aware of another mine in the area mercers expression suddenly changed as a new thought struck him the white rock hed found in the kimberlite tailings was a stoneaged tool a hammer used thousands of years ago to crush the ore to get at the precious gems suddenly everything tied together jews ancient mines religious fanatics he finally realized why the stakes were so high and it had nothing to do with diamonds oh my god he tried to repress the wild thought but couldnt is that mine what i think it is he could barely speak were on our way to talk to some priests who will confirm it but yes it is selome smiled at his breathless wonderment itll be the greatest find of your life the stuff of legend when he said it it came out as a whisper king solomons mine the eritreasudan border gianelli felt like a conquering caesar as his trucks rumbled into eritrea he sat in the passenger seat of the lead vehicle the windows rolled down so he could smell the dry desert and hear the bellowing of the big twelvecylinder turbodiesels chuckling he realized that the heavyduty transporters loaded with mining gear and provisions weighed twice as much as the cv light battle tanks mussolini had used to invade abyssinia kitted out in de rigueur khaki with a bush hat clamped on his head and sunglasses protecting his eyes from the worst of the driving sun gianelli was at the very pinnacle of his life everything up to this moment every deal and every decision had led to this instant leading the trucks back to the mine that his uncle had opened decades before was the culmination of his existence let others wonder at his wealth and powerthey were nothing merely an extension of what had been handed to him through his family a quirk of genetics this was what he saw as his destiny soon after the eritrean refugees had left their camps in sudan under the leadership of a nomad prince mahdi had approached gianelli with his idea of searching ahead of the column so they could reach the mine more quickly the refugees were covering only a couple of miles a day and the lethargic pace rankled the italian gianelli agreed and sent out a scout truck three days later the radio call had come saying they had found the mine in a bowl of land at the end of a narrow valley after hearing an explosion gianelli ordered the main convoy to bypass the refugees and speed to where the advance scouts waited a short time after another call from them reported a toyota land cruiser driven by a white man was attempting to flee the valley gianellis first thought was the fools had given away their presence to mercer but realized that mahdis people wouldnt have made such a blunder he instructed the sudanese rebels to stop the toyota and made it clear that mercer was not to be harmed he learned a few hours later that mercer had escaped through a mine field at the cost of one of mahdis men gianelli cursed the whole team over the radio until his fist nearly crushed the microphone mahdi listened to the exchange as he sat on the back bench seat of the tenwheeled fiat truck when his turn came he took gianellis wrath without comment his employer was fully in his right mercer never should have escaped his mens failure was inexcusable and their punishment when the cargo trucks reached the valley would be more severe than gianellis verbal tirade the radio crackled again and he snatched up the handset yes we are back at the valley now and have it secured the american left only three people here eritreans they have some excavating equipment but are not working at the mine what are they doing gianelli asked the leader of the advance detachment he had sent out to leapfrog the meandering refugee column they were just digging into the side of one of the mountains they havent said yet what they were looking for they knew about my uncles mine right yes sir the soldier replied then lowered his tone knowing his next statement would not please his superior the man left in charge here said that there were no minerals in the mine he told us the american explored the shaft and said there was nothing in it of any value that cant be right gianelli stammered the buoyant mood that had carried him across the frontier evaporating quickly despite their increased speed it took eight hours before the convoy eased between the ramparts that guarded the bowl of land called the valley of dead children listening to the chatter of the men in the backseat with mahdi gianelli learned that they knew of this place and held it in superstitious dread he asked mahdi about it and the soldier couldnt give him a definitive answer he told his employer that the regions taboo went back many generations but no one knew its origins the myths surrounding it had spread as far as sudan and ethiopia rubbish giancarlo said dismissively his expression was fevered with anticipation a sense of history weighing on his shoulders the valley looked nothing like what hed thought as a child but now that he was here he could imagine it no other way across the open pan he saw the skeleton of the head gear rising out of a watery heat mirage recognized the support buildings next to it and after a few minutes saw the open fiat his advance scouts had driven his heart pounded with eagerness the trucks lumbered to the abandoned mine wheezing as their overworked engines spooled to silence air brakes hissing gianelli launched himself from the cab running across the desert to the rim of the open shaft joppi hofmyer was the first to join him this is it giancarlo gasped two lifetimes of work mine and my uncles and here it is he gave no consideration to the earlier news that the mine was empty it was a possibility he would not allow there was no way the mine could be worthless he thought enrico had been sure there were diamonds in the area had died believing it gianelli had always felt that if his uncles plane hadnt been shot down during the war he would have given the family proof mercer hadnt taken enough time to properly explore the subterranean tunnels he told himself nor did he have the proper equipment for a thorough search the diamonds were here yes sir the south african replied uneasily ah mr gianelli id like to know how you want to handle this what do you mean now that were here do you want me to take charge of the men or are you going to be issuing the orders gianellis laugh was a quick barking sound joppi my friend i am one of those people who knows how to hire others for their knowledge and abilities im paying you because you know how to extract minerals from the ground an art that i know nothing about from now on you are in complete control however you want to handle this operation whatever steps you feel necessary are fine consider me nothing more than an interested observer hofmyer turned away more disturbed by gianellis sudden bonhomie than he cared to admit okay you fookin kaffirs he bellowed at the sudanese troopers clustered near the trucks until those refugees get here you bastards are going to be miners you take orders from mahdi and as of this moment mahdi takes orders from me once i get the checklist i want ten men unloading the camp stores and setting up the tents i want the rest of you unloading the mining gear separating underground equipment from surface stuff if you dont know what something is ask either me or one of the other white miners and dont forget to call him baas the four other south africans grinned at this you boys he said to the whites i want the explosives offloaded and placed in a protective redoubtment no closer than five hundred yards from the mine or the camp now someone bring me the three kaffirs who were already here when the scouts arrived habte sat handcuffed in the shade of the scouts fiat with the two eritrean equipment operators neither of the hired workers understood what was happening their fear was palpable but ever since asmara habte had been expecting something like this he figured that these men were allied to the ones who had attacked mercer and selome in the market square as of yet the caucasians he had seen at the ambasoira hotel had not made their appearance when they did he knew that he could expect little help from them this time the enemy of his enemy was not his friend two sudanese rebels approached and gestured with their rifles for the trio to follow led back to the open mine shaft abebe began praying aloud habte had faced death many many times before and he would not let his own fear show joppi sauntered over a few moments later his gut sagging over his belt with an expert eye he looked over the three captives fixing his gaze on habte recognizing him as their leader with a casualness that belied the brutality of the act he stepped forward planted his hands on abebes shoulders and shoved him into the pit abebes scream echoed up from the shaft diminishing like a siren until it was cut off with an undeniable finality habte didnt so much as blink when joppis eyes bored into his waiting for a reaction that the eritream refused to give they were locked in this frozen tableau for several breaths oh youre an uppity nigger arent you hofmyer finally said you want me to push your other friend in as well or do you want to start answering some questions habte willed himself not to say that the south african hadnt asked any knowing such a retort would cause the murder of the other equipment operator he allowed his eyes to drop in a pose of submission that joppi interpreted as a victory like many others from his country who hadnt taken the time to understand traditional african ways joppi believed habtes silence connoted acceptance thats better now why dont you tell me what you were doing at the far end of the valley balancing his desire to defy the boer and his realization that the longer he was alive the better his chances were for escape habte told hofmyer everything an hour later the trucks rumbled away from the italian mine so they could set up their camp a short distance from the ancient one the open desert in hindsight mercer felt he should have chanced the mine field again after the sudanese had withdrawn in order to recover any useful equipment from the burnedout land cruiser especially canteens or his satphone though he continued to carry the single backpack everything in it was worthless for the ordeal to come with nightfall only an hour away and their bodies ravaged by thirst those short few yards through the mines could have made the difference between survival or perishing in the desert without food they could last for a couple of weeks but a lack of water would kill them long before starvation mercers mouth was beyond dry his tongue felt like the scaly body of some desert reptile the last time he was able to swallow hours ago it seemed his throat screamed in desiccated protest as if lined with ground glass while a womans body was better suited to survival situations selome wasnt faring well either as they trudged under the unrelenting african sun inventorying their condition mercer judged that they would be dead in twentyfour to thirtysix hours if they couldnt find water selomes revelations about herself her mission and the king solomon mine had buoyed him for a while but now his mind focused only on the miles with the setting sun at their backs the desert bloomed crimson painted in shades and shadows that made the steep mountains look like fairytale castles heavily turreted and remote the sight would have made them pause under normal circumstances but as night deepened they simply continued to walk their pace slowing with each footfall selome and mercer used scraps from their clothing to fashion rudimentary sun protection for their heads and breathed through their noses to reduce fluid loss they tried every survival trick either had ever learned and still their efforts were falling far short had either of them carried a compass or knew celestial navigation they could have walked in the coolness of the night as it was they were forced to march in the daylight the sun as their only guide and after just one day with an unknown number more to go it was clear that they would die the suns almost behind the horizon mercer spoke for the first time in nearly six hours itll be cooler in just a little while and ill be dead in just a little while too selome managed a smile though her voice scratched like an old phonograph record thats the spirit mercer rasped nothing like a positive attitude his grin cracked his dry lips and a tiny bead of blood quivered at the corner of his mouth he surveyed the terrain around them the landscape was spiked by mountainous ramparts that grew from the desert floor with brutal regularity forcing them to follow a meandering route as they tracked eastward toward the adobha river they continued on their steps less sure fatigue and dehydration taking their toll just before total darkness set in mercer steered selome to one of the countless kopjes rocky hillocks similar to the buttes that dot the american southwest and led her into one of the hundreds of caves that pocked the cliff riven out of the stone by eons of erosion too exhausted to speak they tumbled to the floor and soaked up the caves chilled air a full half hour passed before mercer felt he had the energy to sit up and press his aching back against the rock wall he tried to use his pack as a pillow but its contents were even harder and more jagged than the stone neither dared remove their boots their feet would have swollen immediately and they wouldnt be able to don them again in the morning mercer did loosen his laces to ease the pressure against his tender skin try it he prompted selome it feels better than sex you must not be very good she teased how far do you think weve come id guess about twentyfive to thirty miles then were halfway to the adobha river unfortunately no because of the terrain and our need to go around these damned hills i estimate weve only walked about fifteen miles due east though he wanted to protect her from their reality she had a right to know so the river is another fortyfive miles if the ground doesnt flatten out soon well actually have to cover seventy and our bodies are going to weaken even more during the night our pace will be slower tomorrow and every second were out in the sun were going to dehydrate further im sorry to tell you this but these are the facts selomes body slumped in defeat can we go back and take our chances with the sudanese i dont think wed make it half the distance to the mine remember we were driving for a couple of hours before the attack were going to die arent we sure we are in about fifty years when old age catches up to us mercer straightened were not dead yet selome and ive gotten out of worse messes than this mercer couldnt specifically recall facing a more desperate situation but selome took comfort from his words she crawled to him laying her head on the hard pads of his stomach muscles he stroked her hair softly and she mewed before drifting into an exhausted sleep for mercer the respite of oblivion was a long time in coming he was almost too tired and sore to sleep something about what selome had told him nagged at the back of his mind something about levines quest to find king solomons mine it was an archaeological treasure the find of the century but mercer couldnt figure out how the israeli minister planned to use it to gain power or to help him hold it once hed won the elections something didnt fit there was another piece to this puzzle that selome hadnt mentioned had he not been so exhausted and his mind tortured by the dry thirst he would have demanded an explanation but until they were safe again neither could afford to waste the energy talking about something that was for the moment out of their control just before sleep claimed him mercer had one more thought the eritrean refugees he had sent for from sudan they were leaving one hell and heading straight into another he knew their labor would be eagerly accepted by the rebel soldiers who were undoubtedly at the mine at this very moment mercer realized that his and selomes struggle for survival was also a race against time at dawn the next day selome woke before mercer and her feeble stirrings brought him awake they had snuggled together during the night their legs twined it was a position of intimate trust the nocturnal pose of lovers and for several seconds they silently enjoyed the touch it was only when selome tried to lift herself that they realized how much their muscles had stiffened she whimpered her face screwed up with pain oh christ mercer said his voice barely a hoarse croak moving like arthritics mercer followed selomes lead as she began stretching her tensed limbs his joints popped and creaked in the confines of the cave and he knew intimately how harry white felt every morning of every day thinking of his old friend brought a burst of adrenaline to mercers heart the natural drug giving him just enough strength to motion for selome that it was time to continue it was almost six in the morning and they would have a couple of hours before the suns heat began searing the desert floor last one in the swimming pool is a rotten egg mercer tried to joke selome was too exhausted to respond the vastness of the wasteland made their progress seem like that of insects crawling across a huge table yet for them every step was a personal triumph against the ravages of thirst and exhaustion selome called for a break after two hours but mercer urged her on with just a touch of her shoulder she moved like an automaton her gait mechanical her arms no longer swinging because the effort was too great after two more hours mercer could not dissuade her from stopping and she plopped to the ground in the shade of a small granite outcropping mercer slumped next to her watching fifteen minutes ratchet by on his tag heuer before staggering to his feet and extending his hand gamely she reached up and allowed him to haul her up trying to maintain some sort of steady pace mercer began counting footsteps planning on calling for a halt after two thousand guessing that they would have covered another mile but when he reached the number he knew they had walked half that distance he abandoned the counting and continued to put one foot before the other thinking their next rest would come when selome could go no farther yet it was he who needed the break first just after noon at the edge of one more nameless mountain mercer saw a cave similar to the one in which they had spent the previous night and he led selome to it intending to wait out the hottest part of the day the remorseless sun gave him a headache like a thousand migraines an allconsuming agony that left him dizzy and nauseous well get moving again at three he managed to say before drifting into an empty torpor that was neither sleep nor wakefulness but a vacant zone somewhere in between neither was able to stir at their three oclock goal so they didnt start out again until it was nearly dark their pace so slow that they would have trouble making it to the next sheltering mountain before their strength gave out completely death by dehydration would still be another torturous day away but no amount of determination or will could lessen the possibility that when they stopped for the night they might never rise again do you think you can keep going after sunset selome nodded then asked after a pause wont we get lost we already are mercer admitted and they walked on in silence they could cover more ground in the dark regardless of direction he had to keep them movingsimply sitting and waiting for the end just was not an option an hour elapsed before mercer continued their exchange not realizing so much time had passed we can rest again tomorrow and maybe make it a few more miles the next night but thatll be our last selomes halfhour delay in her reply went unnoticed in their misery isnt the monastery on this side of the river a quarter mile later thats what habte and gibby said i dont know how much closer it is twenty minutes lets hope its a lot closer darkness came swiftly sucking the heat from the desert with a welcome suddenness when the stars showed they shone with a cold indifferent brilliance with the temperature down twenty degrees mercer and selome found they could cover a greater distance between rest stops and even those stops were shorter for the first part of the night they felt a small degree of hope but by midnight what little strength theyd managed to hold in reserve had burned away and as suddenly as night had stolen the day exhaustion stole their will from a starting average of two miles per hour they were down to just half and every hour slowed them even further their thirst was no longer a simple agonizing craving every second brought greater and greater damage to their bodies another twelve hours would lead to severe and possible irreversible kidney damage after that death would be quick the sun approached at five rouging the sky amazingly mercer and selome had traveled nearly twenty miles their route eastward more direct as the gaps between mountains widened still there were untold miles remaining and as mercer began searching for another cave in which to hole up he knew they would never see the end of their journey when the sun went down again they might cover a few more miles but most likely this stop would be their last in desperation mercer sucked at the blood that dripped from his cracked lips his eyes were nearly closed by dehydration and the fastapproaching sunrise beyond a few feet everything was a dazzling white the gritty pain in his eyes was nothing compared to the thirst that blistered the back of his tongue the pebble he kept in his mouth could no longer trick his salivary glands into producing so it lay like a boulder his body screamed for water and his mind was beginning to drift into fantasy he could hear a stream just a few hundred yards ahead and even the breeze carried its sharp clean smell but as they approached the illusion moved ahead establishing another goal that he slogged toward mechanically he had forgotten about selome until he felt her collapse against his legs he was too weak to break his own fall and his head rebounded against the sand it took him several long minutes to realize she had lapsed into unconsciousness he looked into the murk ahead of them and saw they had come to the side of yet another mountain a solid wall of rock that stretched beyond his vision he blinked hard but he could see nothing that would lead them around this latest obstacle wriggling slowly like a snake shedding its skin he slid out of his pack had he given any thought to what he was about to do he wouldnt have attempted it but he and selome were beyond the point of choice mercers arms had been darkened by the sun until his skin was the color of leather he drew a pocket knife from his pants fumbled until he could get the smaller sharper blade open and without pause drew it across his arm he half expected dust to blow out from the wound but a steady line of blood welled up and quickly so as not to lose even a drop he pressed the gash to selomes mouth consciously she never would have broken mankinds oldest taboo but her body craved the liquid and her throat gently pumped as the lifegiving fluid eased her agony even as he continued to hold his arm to her lips mercer could see her regaining awareness before she could realize what hed done he drew his arm away binding it with a cloth and wiping her face clean he was leaning over her when her eyes fluttered open what happened you passed out you hit pretty hard and gave yourself a split lip are you okay i think so he could see her tongue moving around experimentally feeling for the source of the taste in her mouth sunll be up in a few minutes we need to find shelter can you walk selome nodded but when she tried to stand she fell back she shot him a pleading frightened look by now you cant weigh much more than the backpack he tried to smile but his face wouldnt cooperate ill carry you he ignored her unbelieving expression and tucked her into his arms lifting her off the ground so easily she was stunned he set her on her feet turned to present his back and stooped to make it easier for her to climb onto him this will be the final boarding call for the mercer limited those waiting for another train should remain on the platform selome was slender under normal conditions and had lost several pounds in the past fortyeight hours but her weight was staggering mercer closed his mind to the pain and started out again selomes chin resting against his shoulder so he could feel her steady breathing in his ear he had no illusions of carrying her all the way to the adohba river hed be lucky to find a cave in the next few minutes once the sun erupted over the mountains his strength would leave him for the last time selome i cant really see anymore you have to keep an eye out for another cave his legs were shaking after only a few dozen yards another agonizing hour went by mercer carrying selome northward along the cliff face he was numbed to the pain using the last scraps of energy left within him like a flame flaring brightest before its extinguished the sun was a brutal weight that tried to pound him like a hammer against the anvil of the desert floor he thought that selome had slipped into unconsciousness once again but suddenly she cried out a choking caw like a startled bird mercer could see the tip of her hand aiming ahead of them he couldnt distinguish what she had spotted so like a donkey following the carrot at the end of a stick he dogged her slender finger glare had become a constant gauzy curtain and it wasnt until they were almost at the entrance to a cave that he saw its shadow emerge from the haze selome slid from his back falling mercer didnt even notice he was beyond the farthest point he had ever pushed himself like any mortally wounded animal he wanted to find a sheltered place in which to die he dropped to his hands and knees and crawled blindly into the cool cave stopping only when his head hit the stone wall selome entered moments later collapsing next to mercers facedown immobile form he knew he would never rise again his head pounded fiercely and he felt it would split at just the slightest touch he reached over to touch selomes arm her skin felt like a driedout parchment every fiber of his body craved water but the last remnants of his rational mind knew it would never come this is where we die mercer mumbled into the dusty floor of the cavern im sorry selome rolled mercer so she could study his face under the days of beard his skin was gray and cracked his lips were so blistered that his mouth looked like an infected wound she saw her own concern reflected in his eyes for she looked just as bad ill read to you to pass the time selome offered and mercer shot her a queer look suspecting that she had finally fallen away from reality yet as he watched she grabbed a leatherbound book from the cave floor resting it on her lap and cracked it open to a random page she stared at it blankly for just a second hey this is shakespeare its in italian but ill translate it for you what else he was too wasted to feel emotion other than the desperation of the near dead what what else is in the cave was it possible a hope flared dimly in his mind selome looked around their mausoleum oh god food water he could hear her crying the air in the cave tasted sweeter when she unstoppered a flask when she held it to her lips mercer watched clear water dribble down her chin softening the dried scabs on her lips and bringing moisture to her seared tongue the sensation closed her eyes in ecstatic pain mercer was overwhelmed not because the water would save his life that wasnt his first thought that selome would be saved was much more important than his own wellbeing he wanted to take credit for getting her through this but it was her own guts that had carried them her uncomplaining determination to continue trying to inspire her with his strength shed turned around and done the same to him even as he faded into oblivion he saw her half fill her mouth with water and press her lips to his forcing his mouth open to allow a little water to pass into him she drank again herself and then gave mercer another mouthful a minute later he was unconscious but his breathing evened and sounded less labored a tiny but noticeable smile on his face the monastery of debre amlak an unfamiliar sensation brought mercer awake and it took him a moment to recognize what it was a mattress oh jesus worn to little more than the thickness of a blanket and covered with sheets of the roughest cotton it still felt as if he were resting on clouds his whole body ached his feet and legs especially however it was a reassuring pain that told him he was still alive he shifted under the bedding the blisters on his feet smeared open against the sheets he gasped and shot up in bed grabbing for his stinging heel instantly his vision clouded over and his head swam he collapsed back against the flat pillow his sore feet all but forgotten selome her image flooded his mind and once again he struggled upright his arms flailing to free himself from the sheets tangling embrace he had to find her nothing else mattered then he heard a voice and he looked to his right the room was just large enough for the bed a desk and a chair the walls were white and clean the floors were bare and well swept and through the single window he could see it was twilight a crucifix above the desk was the rooms only decoration a young boy dressed in a long robe stood at mercers bedside he spoke again in tigrinyan ignoring mercers incomprehension selam mercer finally croaked selam selam the youth greeted kemaylaha the boy must have been asking about his condition hmak bad it was one of the few words mercer had learned shemay tedla iyu the boy said pointing at his chest men shemka mercer understood the boys name was tedla he pointed to himself mercer then added selome the boy gave a lengthy reply but mercer understood none of it he let out a frustrated breath tedla poured water from a pewter pitcher and held it for him after draining the cup mercer settled under the coarse blankets and was asleep in moments the next time he woke he was alone and his room was dark except for a single candle burning on the desk in its glow he saw that a plate of fruit had been left for him he had recovered enough to be hungry and reached for it wolfing two mangoes and a banana before weakness overcame him and he was back asleep the candle had gone out when he regained consciousness again a haunting sound echoed beyond his chamber mercer was disoriented nearly panicked by the darkness his own weakness and the faint noise slowly his mind brought him back to the present and his heart rate eased he recognized the noise as a song a chant then he remembered everything in a rush the march through the desert selomes finding the water in the cave fuzzy pictures flashed in his mind of men carrying him and selome from the cave up a steep trail to an ancient building he lay in the darkness and smiled letting the monks at their midnight prayer serenade him back to sleep theyd made it to the monastery when the sun woke him mercer had enough strength to lever himself out of bed and dress his clothes had been laundered and lay in a bundle on the desk he was surprised to find he needed to use the chamber pot sitting under the bed at least his kidneys were still functioning once in the hallway mercer began to weaken but he continued past several closed doors until he came to the refectory a large cleared table dominating the room he sat at one of the chairs and lay his head on the tabletop his breath coming in uneven gasps selome he needed to find her he must have passed out again because suddenly tedla was taping at his shoulder and speaking to him gently where is everybody mercer asked tedla held up a finger to indicate mercer was to wait and scampered from the room a minute later he returned with another older monk there was a reassuring air about the man a comforting quality that radiated trust it wasnt just the gray beard and the long dark robe there was something behind his eyes that spoke of compassion and understanding selam mercer greeted do you speak english selam no italiano mercer shook his head parlezvous francais un peu a little mercer switched effortlessly into french but he spoke too fast for the monk and had to slow my name is philip mercer im a mine engineer working here in eritrea selome nagast is awake for many hours monsieur mercer i know who you are my name is brother ephraim how long have we been here mercer could barely understand the monk through his thick accent last night was your second mercer had slept through nearly thirtysix hours the eritrean refugees would be reaching the mine soon maybe they were already there he felt his chest tighten with a new panic i need to leave ephraim spoke to his acolyte and tedla ran off leaving mercer alone with him it was clear that they would need a translator if they were to continue their conversation soon after selome entered her ordeal had dulled her eyes some but she was still beautiful the weight loss made her already high cheekbones more prominent and her eyes larger relief flushed through mercer and he closed his eyes opening them again to drink her in when he tried to stand and meet her embrace she held him to his chair her arms twined around his neck her cheek laid against his how are you she asked softly before mercer could reply brother ephraim coughed drawing their attention selome pulled away and adopted a demure attitude in front of the ascetic he spoke for several minutes selome thinking through her translation before turning back to mercer brother ephraim is the monasterys abbot and he welcomes us to debre amlak he says it is highly irregular for a woman to be allowed within the compound and he is concerned about our relationship she spoke to ephraim for a moment and then switched back to english i told him that you are a man of honor and i am a chaste woman who is promised to another you lied to a priest what should i have told him you shouldnt have said im a man of honor thats all mercer suppressed a grin tell our host that any carnal thoughts in my condition are impossible thank him for his hospitality and for carrying us up from the cave and ask him how he managed to find us he says that the cave is his retreat from the monastery a place for him to enjoy an even greater sense of solitude he discovered us himself and went to get other monks to bring us here a retreat from a retreat mercer wondered aloud thankful nonetheless he and i spoke yesterday when you were still unconscious and i told him about our search for an ancient mine he seemed to know all about it what the mine that yes but us too he acted as though hed been expecting us or at least you dont go mystical on me selome im just telling you what happened selome was interrupted by ephraim the elder cleric spoke for a few minutes mercer watched selomes reactions whatever the abbot was saying stunned her she asked ephraim a few questions before translating for mercers benefit brother ephraim was never meant to be the monasterys abbot he fell into the position by default when the monks returned home during the war he told me this by way of explaining why he did what he did why he read a book that was never meant to be seen again what are you talking about selome ignored mercers questions there is a book here titled shame of kings ephraim said that only one other man has read it debre amlaks previous abbot a man whose faith it destroyed ephraim says the former abbot died believing gods punishment for his sacrilege was eritreas years of struggle and suffering brother ephraim read it a few weeks ago because another monk predicted that an ancient secret was about to be revealed and that someone would come to question the priests about it i think he believes that someone is you feeling like cold death mercer didnt know what to say when he looked at ephraim he saw the priest was serious it sent a superstitious shiver up his spine why me for one thing you and i are the first outsiders to visit this monastery in decades also when i told him that youre a miner he said that your presence here and your professional skills make perfect sense when you consider the subject of the book my being a mine engineer relates to some old religious book the shame of kings is more of a history than a religious text the chronicle of an ancient diamond mine in eritrea first worked by the priests of king menyelek its the story of the mine we just discovered menyelek not solomon yes he was the firstborn son of the queen of sheba and solomon the king of israel the diamonds that menyelek found are certainly the basis of the king solomons mine legend only the fable was off by a generation she paused but there is something even greater at stake here mercer caught an undertone in selomes voice and remembered hed felt that she had been holding something back from him something shed known all along and he knew he was about to find out what it was the tale begins in another book the glory of kings which is the ethiopian version of shebas visit to solomon its a very different story from what is written in the old testament you see she was duped into sleeping with solomon by a trick played on her by the king afterward sheba returned to ethiopia with their baby menyelek but the boys destiny was to return to israel he was twentytwo when he visited his father in jerusalem there a high priest told menyelek that god had commanded him to remove the tabernacle of the word of god and carry it back to ethiopia transferring the seat of god from israel to africa seeing his bewilderment she explained in simpler terms solomons son stole the ark of the covenant from the temple and spirited it back to his own kingdom mercer could not believe hed heard correctly the ark of the covenant thats what this is all about he could tell that she hadnt wanted to reveal any of this and his anger mounted this was what shed been hiding from the beginning the diamonds are meaningless to you youre all after the ark and think its hidden in the mine yes defense minister levines agents are in eritrea to find it and return it to israel selomes voice took on a strident note full of emotion and fear it will give him the moral authority to destroy the dome of the rock and erect the third temple mercer was thoughtful for a moment id make him emperor for life if he pulled off a feat like that but the ark of the covenant you cant be serious selome im not doubting your faith but the old testament and this glory of kings arent historical fact theyre stories so was the iliad until heinrich schliemann used it as a reference book selome countered hotly and discovered the city of troy a place many archaeologists said existed only in folklore if youll hear me out youll see ephraims story lends credence to levines plan how so he asked with little interest this was too much to believe soon after returning to ethiopia with the ark menyelek became embroiled in a number of wars expanding ethiopian territory as far as india the revenue from trade caravans werent enough to pay for his campaigns so one of his priests azariah told him of a mountain of diamonds far to the north of their capital the shame of kings describes the discovery of this fabulous mountain and the history of the mining operation the priests in charge used soldiers captured during menyeleks battles to do the actual work after the wars had ended the priests turned to slave labor brought from kush modernday sudan according to the book the conditions were terrible and the worst was yet to come after a hundred years the workers had exhausted the diamonds that could be recovered from the surface and they were forced to tunnel into the earth at first they used pygmies because of their smaller stature but they died quickly in the shafts one passage of the shame of kings laments this for it had seemed like a promising idea and it was still the priests using slaves to dig yes selome obviously didnt want to continue but she did her voice heavy because the pygmies didnt work out the mines overseers started using children boys and girls as young as six were herded into the mine never to return female slaves were used as breeding stock to replenish the losses it sounds like a system more cruel than what the nazis did during the holocaust and the mine was in operation for over four hundred years countless tens of thousands of innocent lives were snuffed in a subterranean hell and the perpetrators of this atrocity were followers of judaism selome it happened two thousand years ago brother ephraim says they were proud of what they did not only does the book describe some of the huge gems they found but it also talks about the inhuman conditions and the practices used to get more work out of the children if hate groups and antisemites found out that the first concentration camps were built by jews do you think it would matter how long ago it was this can never be revealed mercer wanted to disagree but he had a suspicion that she was right hate was an easy commodity to sell okay ill grant you the shame of kings is right about an ancient mine in northern eritrea he conceded the awful working conditions ring true and i know using children in mines was a common practice until just a hundred years ago but what does this have to do with levine and the ark levines quest dates back two decades hes always been obsessed with holy relics especially the ark when operation moses rescued ethiopian jews in he had the refugees questioned about religious artifacts left in their home country rumor surrounded a particular church st mary of zion in aksum ethiopias ancient capital some said the ark was still there levine secretly sent a team of agents to break into the church but they found nothing to convince them that it had ever been a resting place for the ark and he still thought it was in ethiopia he scoffed goddamn it mercer it doesnt matter if you believe this or not levine does and as long as hes holding your friend harry thats all thats important enough people have died in the past weeks to convince you that your doubts dont mean anything mercers scientific background made him naturally skeptical but he suddenly realized she was right it was levines motivation that mattered not its validity and even if he didnt believe he knew he shouldnt close his mind to the possibilities hadnt the shame of kings been correct about the mine im sorry this is all so anyway you were saying levine thought the ark was here ethiopia is the oldest christian country in the world and has jewish ties that date back even further besides he was certain it wasnt in israel there isnt much of our country that hasnt been combed by archaeologists levine started to investigate some of the lesscredible rumors the refugees brought with them he learned that the ark might have been on an island on lake tana but that also turned out to be a false lead the only other reference he got to the ark was a story about a golden chest placed in an ancient mine to help ward off an evil that was killing the workers long long ago when levine saw the kimberlite pipe on the medusa photographs he was sure hed find the mine the refugees spoke of he also felt that somewhere near the pipe hed discover the arks final repository he doesnt know that the mine was dug by solomons son he wouldnt care its the ark hes after does the shame of kings say that the arks in the mine not in so many words the rumor of the golden chest levine is following probably came from it from someone who read it ages ago the shame of kings does talk about a curse that killed the children a mysterious illness caused by satan that made it impossible to continue work in the tunnels to combat it a powerful talisman was brought to the mine and placed in a special chamber that was dug to the exact specifications of the arks original tabernacle in jerusalem it says nothing about it ever being removed did it work did the talisman prevent the disease selome asked ephraim the children died in greater numbers and soon afterward the priests realized that god was punishing them for what theyd done they sealed the mine and never revealed its location for a moment mercer allowed himself to speculate since the mine they discovered was undoubtedly the same one written about in the shame of kings was it possible that the rest of the story was also true the mine had lain undisturbed for two thousand years and if the talisman it mentioned was indeed the ark of the covenant then it could still be there buried under countless tons of rock waiting to be discovered he took his silent musings one step further and considered the consequences if levine managed to find it and return it to israel the mideast would explode in a religious war that would make the past fifty years of conflict seem like petty squabbling selome was right when she said that levine would use its symbolism to raze the dome of the rock the third most sacred site in islam if that happened mercer imagined the ensuing war would go nuclear as muslims from all over the globe used their numerical superiority to overpower the israelis and recapture the temple mount it was a doomsday scenario that mercer knew could happen would happen if he didnt stop it this was all too much just days ago he found he might have discovered king solomons mine and now mercer found that he was in a race to find the ark of the covenant if he wasnt so weak and tired he would have been terrified the desert trek had left him in a worse condition than selome and his mind was beginning to fade again he couldnt absorb any more information i bet the sudanese dont know anything about this their backers are after the diamonds while harrys kidnappers levine ultimately want an archaeological artifact lost thousands of years ago yes and theyre both located in the valley of dead children suddenly the meaning behind the valleys name became shudderingly obvious we should be thankful we still have time judging by the excavating we did before coming to the monastery itll take weeks to reopen the mine and then mercer remembered oh shit there are about two hundred refugees there right now the sudanese who attacked us are probably using them as forced labor as we speak they might already have it opened mercer hadnt told her about the displaced eritreans he had coming from the camps in sudan and her expression registered her shock whered they come from when we were with the nomads in badn getting fuel i hired one of the headmans sons to get them and bring them to the valley guilt cracked mercers voice but beneath it was a grim determination to see them freed selome spoke with brother ephraim for a few minutes then turned back he says its impossible to reach any town until after the adobha has subsided the river is impassable for at least three weeks we have no choice we have to cross it ephraim seemed to understand mercers foul expression and his defiant outburst selome performed an almost simultaneous translation the river moves with the speed and force of a truck and its littered with debris washed down from the highlands the flood would destroy any raft we could build every year dozens of people die trying to cross it be sensible i dont have that luxury peoples lives depend on us not only those refugees but also habte the two drivers and my friend harry white and if somehow the ark really is in the mine then maybe the rest of the world too ill be sensible when the eritrean military arrives at the mine and arrests anyone holding a gun selome asked the monk a couple more questions the priests response seeming to calm her anxiety he says the talisman spoken of in the shame of kings was placed in the deepest part of the mine buried so deeply that it would take an army of workers many months to find it she looked into mercers eyes think about it the sundanese dont know about the ark once they reach the diamonds theyll stop exploring the tunnels and begin mining theyll never know whats buried in some deeper chamber remember how many sudanese troops that headman said were waiting on the border fifty mercer said beginning to understand what selome was saying levine doesnt have enough people to attack a force that size theyll have to wait until after the rebels leave before starting their own search we have weeks or even months to warn the authorities more time to save the world mercer sounded almost flippant then his mood darkened that still leaves two hundred refugees im leaving in the morning you cant even stand right now she shot back mercer ive been to those refugee camps and i can tell you that in the short term those people are going to be better off at the mine how can you say that he was surprised shed put to words that he was just beginning to consider they may be worked as slaves but theyre going to be fed and provided with clean water whoevers running the operation has to take care of the refugees if he expects them to work in his condition mercer knew there was a good chance he wouldnt make it to civilization his effort would be a wasted empty gesture that would help no one it took just a second to come to the only logical option all right well rest up for a couple of days but no more ask ephraim if he can provide us with a guide to ila babu maybe someone there owns a twoway radio he says that tedla will guide us its about forty miles but he says he knows of no one in town who has a radio well worry about that when the time comes ephraim and selome took him back to his room and saw him to bed after the monk left she sat with him wiping his brow with a wet cloth there was such tenderness in her motions that mercer took her hand and kissed each of her fingertips whats that for because ive wanted to do it since we met and couldnt until i trusted you she kissed his lips lightly but there was a greater passion in her eyes so you trust me now no more secrets he tried to smile and then he was asleep selome watched him a few minutes her hand spread on his chest fingers splayed as if to possess more of him she kissed him again no more secrets for the next two days mercer rested and drank water more than he thought possible his strength returned slowly but steadily by the end of the afternoon on the second day he felt strong enough to walk the grounds surrounding the monastery careful to remain on the inside of the stakes that delineated land that had been cleared of mines he saw little of selome she showed enough respect to the monks and their traditions to keep herself out of sight he spent some of his waking hours thinking about the inhumanity described in the shame of kings but mostly he considered how to rescue the eritrean refugees and how to stop levine from using the ark if it had survived the ages he wouldnt be surprised if it was buried in the ancient mine jesus it was well past sunset mercer was lying on his bed when he heard someone walking outside his window which opened onto the monasterys small cloister it was too dark to see more than a shadowy form so he threw on his pants and boots and slid from his room the cloisters entrance was off the refectory and he was aware of the wooden floors creaking as he walked he feared that he would wake the monks selome stood at the center of the pillared cloister her body barely illuminated by the moon and stars she kept her eyes locked with his as he crossed to her slowly i was hoping it would be you she whispered despite his status as an acolyte im afraid tedla has taken a fancy to me i was hoping that it was you too mercer replied softly i want to say thanks you were right id never have made it to ila babu how are you feeling much better but im still as weak as a kitten how weak she asked with a huskiness that mercer recognized immediately she moved a few paces closer to him the heat of her body soaking into his skin as weak as a cat mercer tried to keep the catch out of his voice it had been a couple days since hed seen her and the sexual tension that they had sparked before their trip to the monastery returned with a fury her arms went around his neck one knee cocked forward so it slid between his legs how weak how about a tired lion better she smiled well be leaving the monastery tomorrow and tedla is going to be with us every step of the way once we contact the government itll be a long time before well have a moment to ourselves im sorry but if we are going to make love it has to be tonight now pretty forward of you she placed a slim finger to his lips no jokes selome i his next words were cut off by her hungry kiss she pressed herself to him fitting almost perfectly knees matching knees hips to hips chest to chest he felt her breasts swell and harden against his naked chest more and more heat pouring against him the longer they kissed i was going to say mercer muttered i think it would be a good idea if we found a more private place this is a church after all that dam hed felt cracking when selome told him about her involvement with shin bet gave way completely for the first time in months since the split with aggie mercer gave himself over to another human completely it was liberating and frightening at the same time but also very right he returned to his room for a shirt and his bedding and they walked down the narrow path hacked into the cliff with the moon reflecting off the sandy plain they could clearly see the cave no more than a quarter mile south both were surprised at its proximity to the monastery mercer lit a candle and spread the sheets and blankets on the cavern floor she motioned for him to stretch out and watch as she undressed he expected a hint of selfconsciousness from selome but there was none she pulled her shirt over her head in one fluid motion her high breasts bouncing as they came free her nipples looked painfully erect and his body reacted her pants fell around her ankles with just the tiniest bit of urging she kicked out of them and hooked her thumbs in the waist band of her panties with deliberate slowness she slid them down her thighs bending deeply until they lay at her feet in a rippled puddle of silk she stood proudly a dusky venus her body taut and perfect her skin so flawless and waxy smooth in the candlelight that she looked like marble mercer couldnt help but stare at the shallow cleft that rose from the juncture of her thighs her bodys most secret place veiled by only a thin down his heart pounded and his breath matched the shallow heaving of selomes chest her arousal perfumed the air mercer began shedding his clothes but selome dropped to her knees next to him brushed away his hands and began working at the buttons and zippers her fingers stroking each newly exposed section of his body until he was nude and she held him firmly in her palm she squeezed him every so slightly and his hips bucked involuntarily it was only then that she kissed his mouth again you are so beautiful mercer said and selome smiled so are you she would not let him do any of the work that first time not even sheath himself with one of the condoms mercers doctor made him stash in his wallet for mercer it felt incredibly decadent not to have to worry about his partners pleasure for her expression told him that her arousal came solely from his enjoyment for the ten minutes they were joined they freed each other from the world as selome rocked her body on his drawing him in deeper and deeper mercers climax left him dizzy and gasping then in a feat he hadnt been capable of since college they made love again almost immediately mercer had only seconds to put on another condom before selome drew him on top of her her orgasmic screams echoed far outside their intimate cave they were so lost in their lovemaking neither heard the convoy of trucks approaching from the east half an hour after the vehicles passed they were packing up the bedding and adjusting their clothes for the walk back to the monastery when distant machinegun fire shattered the night the crashing explosion of sound stripped away the euphoria they had just built and brought them back to the ugliness of reality tel aviv israel danny silver was twentythree years old an american by birth who had moved to the jewish state with his parents when he was sixteen he liked israel well enough so long as he stayed in the countrys largest city a few years ago hed tried kibbutz life for a summer and found the backtonature communal living to be a bore he liked the action of tel aviv with its latenight discos and cosmopolitan aura besides being a bartender at one of the big hotels on the beach ensured he could get laid almost any night he wanted american girls on break from college or spending time in israel to discover their jewishness were invariably fascinated by his stories especially the ones he made up about his compulsory tour in the army but it was a tuesday night not yet eight and the cocktail lounge was slow his only customers were a group of israeli businessmen in one corner and two old women from a new jersey tour group near the bars entrance danny busied himself behind the long bar polishing glasses that were already spotless and wiping down bottles that didnt need to be cleaned sara the waitress stood casually at her station one eye on her customers and the other on a college textbook danny really didnt like her she did nothing to hide her disdain for any jew not born in israel screw her he thought absently unable to tear his eyes away from the perfect swell of her breasts under her white uniform blouse a crash from the lobby turned danny away from saras cleavage an old guy had toppled a sign board in the lobby sending it to the floor but the fool didnt stop to right it again he charged into the bar like a merkava battle tank his hard eyes drilling through danny to the display wall of liquor behind him the man resembled a scarecrow thin and wrinkled he looked almost comical but there was nothing funny about his expression had the guy been arab danny would have run for his life but he was white probably american and certainly nuts he rushed straight for the bar heaving himself onto a stool with an explosive grunt hunching his shoulders like a vulture he glared at danny until the israeli sauntered over to ask what he wanted drink american for sure what kind of a drink sir what an idiot give me anything with alcohol or so help me christ ill tear you apart and get it myself normally danny would have laughed at him but the customer spoke with such force that he believed the crazy old bastard would have tried it sure thing sir anything you say danny poured a measure of brandy into a snifter but before he could set the drink on the bar the american lunged for the bottle the man snapped off the speed pourer with a practiced twist and upended the bottle to his lips three swallows vanished in as many seconds before the geezer set the bottle carefully on the bar top sorry about that son harry white rasped but you were taking too damn long if you knew what ive been through in the past couple weeks you wouldve done the same thing yeah sure whatever danny backed away tell you what kid if youve got any bourbon back there jack daniels preferably i promise not to bite deal the expression of madness was transformed into a smile that was almost grandfatherly danny poured a shot of bourbon and wisely left the bottle on the bar stealing a glance at sara he saw her watching the whole bizarre exchange with a smirk she looked as if she expected such repulsive behavior from americans bitch harry gulped down the bourbon and helped himself to another pouring until the glass could not hold one more alcohol molecule when he brought it to his lips he didnt spill a drop youre a lifesaver my friend a goddamned lifesaver the liquor filed the sharper edges off harrys voice eight or ten more of these and i might feel human again mr white a female called from the lobby she was poised at the entrance to the bar with a startled look her chest heaved because she had been forced to run into the hotel chasing after the octogenarian wearing a conservative gray suit with an offtherack blouse and a ridiculous bow to danny she was the picture of a government employee she trod across the marble lobby floor her sensible shoes clacking with a horselike clomp oh thank god mr white i was afraid id lost you for a second harry nodded at his drink a second was all i needed the harried young woman was jessica michaelson she worked for the cia under the cover of a cultural attache and had been assigned the job of minding harry white until his flight back to the united states as the lowestranking cia agent at the embassy she had been saddled with harry for nearly a week now while not involved with his debriefing she had to keep the curmudgeon occupied when he was not in meetings with the more senior officers including the station chief jessica had read the report of what harry had been through in the past couple of weeks and even in its sanitized version his experiences were harrowing but after a week with him she felt her pity wearing thin and was hoping the terrorists would come and take him away again from a portion of the report that jessica michaelson had read harrys own words from a stenographers transcript described what had happened to bring him to the care of the cia id just escaped the gun fight and was real tired i smelled like hell and my whiskers were itchin something fierce i think i picked up some critters in that cell too anyway i was walking along looking for something anything that i could recognize but all the signs were written in squiggly letters that looked like they were done by a blind twoyearold then i saw one sign i could read and damned if fate isnt one cruel bitch it was on a church bulletin board and it was for an alcohol anonymous meeting that was going to start a half hour after curfew had been lifted i hid out for the night in an alley a couple blocks away the next morning i went to the church at the appropriate time but it was hard to step inside this being the holy city and all i expected lightning to strike me dead at any moment well i went in and the group looked at me like theyd been expecting me i sat quiet for a while and listened to the men and women most of em were americans or british after twenty minutes of waiting for gods wrath for desecrating the meeting i stood up and told the group that my name was harry and with my fingers crossed behind my back told them that i was an alcoholic i said id been sober for a couple of hours now having come down from a thirtysevenday binge that started in de moines iowa and ended in the church of the holy sepulcher i told them that most of the details in between were still a bit fuzzy i know what i was doing was wrong you understand i think aa is one hell of a fine program and it does some amazing things for folks who want to get their lives back together but i needed help pretty badly and i figured these people seeing me in the state i was would have a little pity they all listened actually they were hanging on my every word they seemed to know each others stories pretty well and i was laying something entirely new on them they fell all over themselves offering support and advice well anyway after the meeting a guy came up told me his name was walt hayes from missouri and that he was a reporter for newsweek walt said hed help me figure out how to get home said he had some friends at the american embassy later that day he took me to the embassy introduced me to some attache or other and after i told her the true story she sicced all you cia flunkies on me hey how about that drink now interviewer in just a little while mr white tell us again about the woman holding you who you thought was a nurse for the rest of the details of harrys adventure jessica had broken a few security protocols and listened to the old mans ramblings when she spent dinners with him at the embassy cafeteria including his dim recollections about the shootout at dulles airport and the names of a few of his captors her superiors had acquiesced only partially to harrys continuous entreaties for alcohol and allowed him a drink after each days debriefing saying they wanted him fresh for the next session but now that harry was finally being returned to the united states he had bolted from the car transporting him from the embassy to a hotel in tel aviv prior to his flight because harry wasnt in any sort of custody and those that had taken him had gone deep underground the cia had agreed to give him a few hours of free time provided that he was under constant surveillance this also gave the operatives a convenient place away from prying eyes to hand harry over to agents of the fbi who would actually be accompanying him on his flight home hot on jessicas heels into the bar were two additional cia minders both men wearing lightweight jackets to conceal their weapons they too were breathing heavily and looked at harry with mild shock for he had managed to outrun them all mr white you werent supposed to do that jessica chided she moved close so only he could hear when she continued were here for your protection harry turned and pinned her with his stare its not my fault you guys cant keep up if there had been something to drink in that car of yours i wouldnt have needed to get in here so quickly i told you to get me one with a minibar he shot a smile toward danny how about a little ginger ale harry you are still in danger jessica michaelson whispered you should stick by us until we have you safely in the fbis care or what ill be in trouble no mr white you might be dead ehh harry dismissed the comment with a wave a lit cigarette magically appearing in his clawlike hand one of the male agents tapped jessica on the shoulder and pointed toward the ceiling harry lets go up to the room we have waiting she said the fbi should be here in a few minutes and it would be best if we all met upstairs okay harry agreed pouring more bourbon into his nearly finished drink let me just freshen this last one and well go and see what room service can do for us mr white harry do you really think its wise to get drunk before your flight jessica michaelson had no children yet she had the mother voice down perfectly harry had been playing up his situation a bit he admitted but hed done what everyone had asked of him and wanted very little in return and now his patience was about gone listen sweetheart he deliberately taunted ive been through hell in the past few weeks and i managed to get myself out of it without your assistance indeed ive managed to survive eighty years without your help for what thats worth and ive been in worse scrapes than this you may recall world war two from your history booksthe chapter usually ends with a picture of a mushroom cloud i appreciate your concern its touching really but youre a few weeks too late now i promised your superiors that i would keep this affair quiet when i get home but so help me god if you say one more word im going to sell my story to the nearest magazine and let the chips fall where they may everyone says that the middle east is a powder keg well i just spent a few weeks with the bastards who made the fuse and are currently standing over it with a lit match jessica looked chastened she wasnt expecting an eloquent outburst from her charge harry continued im going up to the room with you and im going to allow myself to be passed off to the fbi and im going back to washington to let dick hennas boys debrief me again but if you think for one second that im going to spend the few hours i have between you and them in any kind of sober state then you have a lot to learn about me ms michaelson ill do my patriotic duty honey but right now im on my time he lifted himself from his bar stool and glanced at danny shell be paying my tab and make sure she gives you a good tip monastery of debre amlak mercer identified the sound of a machine gun a fraction of a second quicker than selome hed heard that noise many times before he dropped the bundle of bedding and ducked his head out of the cave the sound had originated above them on the cliff near the monastery but he kept his gaze at ground level searching for a rear picket or a scout party the open desert was still who is it selome whispered mercer didnt answer it wasnt possible that levines agents could have found them here so the gunmen were undoubtedly connected to the sudanese whod chased them from the valley of dead children mercer hated to think what theyd done to habte to get this location from him however identifying the terrorists didnt help another burst of gunfire echoed down from the monastery mercer quickly ran through his options and found he had only one he couldnt let the monks pay for his blundering into their sanctuary his presence had attracted the sudanese and it was up to him to force them out if he couldnt he would surrender and trade himself for the lives of the priests once captured he was certain the rebels would take him to the mine hed just have to hope hed find a way to escape again so he could derail the israelis stay here he ordered his voice calm but forceful he turned left once outside the cave mercer the path to the monastery is the other direction i know but we approached from the south and thats where i dumped the pack ill be right back he kept to the irregular cliff wall moving slowly and deliberately his khaki clothes blending with the sandstone he expected to search for at least half a mile but he came upon the pack after only three hundred yards he thought of that last push before he had stumbled into the cave with selome on his back hed made it on will alone his strength totally depleted his mind all but gone but three hundred yards he was positive hed carried selome farther than that that short distance represented an hour of agonizing labor perhaps the most difficult hour of his life and he realized that had the cave been even a few yards farther they would have died huddled against the cliff there was enough moonlight for mercer to familiarize himself with everything in the satchel much of it was worthless but there was selomes pistol charged with a full clip of ammunition he grabbed up the pack and tramped back to the cave keeping alert for a flash of light reflecting off a weapon or an upturned face on the open plain selome was waiting for him at the caves entrance howd you find it so quickly im not the superman i thought i was the pack was only a couple hundred yards away he secreted items from the bag into his pockets im going up to the monastery if i cant draw the terrorists away from the priests im going to give myself over to them and what about me i dont think they want you just me remember im the geologist thats not what i meant selome said sharply what am i supposed to do while youre off playing hero im not doing this to prove how tough i am thats an understatement mercers fear made it difficult for him to swallow i have to go and you have to warn the authorities about whats been happening i want you to head south again stay along the cliff and drag our blanket behind you to sweep away your tracks find somewhere to hide for the day if i dont come down looking for you in a couple of hours it means i probably wont wait until sunset before returning to the monastery im willing to bet the sudanese will be gone by then her eyes glared dont even consider leaving me out of this mercer im even more responsible than you if you have a plan count me in selome i she cut him off her voice raised dangerously loud i said dont think about it and i mean it i am coming with you like you said youre the geologistwell im the trained agent you did pretty well in asmara but i have more experience in situations like this he was about to list a few of the gunfights hed been in but before he could an unholy scream pierced the night a sharp keening wail that dropped down the cliff growing louder and louder until it was suddenly cut off the silence that followed was more terrible than the scream there was no more time to argue mercer led selome back toward the trail leading up to the monastery about thirty feet from where the path rose into the rock a dark shape revealed itself on the ground they both knew that it was a body a spray radiated from the corpse like a diffused shadow the sheer volume of the bloody splashes made it unnecessary to check if the victim had survived the fall they crossed the narrow entrance to the ascending path and continued along the cliff the monastery now behind and above them mercer could feel selomes questioning stare at his back but he didnt take the time to explain his plan keeping a sharp eye for a place they could climb the hundred feet to the plateau above mercer considered what hed do once they were in sight of the monastery he had no idea how many gunmen had come here nor how they were positioned his only advantage was surprise and even that was relatively worthless by throwing one of the priests off the cliff the terrorists were telling him they knew he was here they were expecting him he could only hope that by coming up behind them rather than climbing the established path he could gain something a quarter mile farther mercer found a suitable spot to make their climb the cliff still soared in a near vertical massif but its face was scarred with deep fissures and scaly projections that would act as hand and foot holds and most important they were out of earshot of the monastery wait here he moved away from the cliff so he could study the whole wall mapping a route to avoid climbing into a dead end a more experienced climber would have been able to judge the features of the stone in the moonlight and possibly pick a safe route but mercer was at best a climber by necessity hed never had a burning desire to hang hundreds of feet above his death he allowed himself only a few minutes his mind absorbing every possible detail before rejoining selome well have you ever climbed before no all right youll lead im going to be right behind you so i can give you directions he couldnt afford to have her freeze below him it looks a lot worse than it is so just move where i tell you and everything will be fine i have to tell you that im afraid of heights she said in a small voice well im afraid of spiders and thats the real reason youre going first you get them for me and ill make sure nothing happens to you okay his grin seemed to give her that last bit of confidence she needed okay their progress was smooth at first the base of the cliff had a shallower pitch than what lay ahead and the stone had been cleaved by erosion they kept three points on the rock at all times cautious but moving well after thirty feet the face steepened and they could no longer climb in a stooped position forced to stand upright they pressed themselves to the cool stone the void sucking at them from below mercer could sense selomes panic rising and he touched her ankle gently reassuring her that he was still with her veer to the left more he whispered theres a natural chimney that should take us up another twenty feet it leads to a shelf where we can take our first break he didnt add that after the shelf the climb would become more difficult the chimney was wide enough for mercer to jam his shoulders against both sides and wriggle his way upward selome had a better strengthtoweight ratio so she could climb even faster they reached the shelf a half hour after beginning their assault and lay side by side both panting from the exertion keep moving your fingers or theyll stiffen mercer warned as he sucked the blood from where he had scraped two of his knuckles how am i doing youre wonderful you arent so bad yourself selome kissed him ready you bet he replied heartened by her positive attitude youll want to move to the right theres a thin lip of stone about six feet above us itll be tricky getting to it but well be able to walk along it until we reach another vertical fissure she looked above them to see the features mercer was describing but a rocky bulge blocked her view youre going to have to trust me on this one she placed her hands on the wall toed her boot into a shallow cup in the stone and lifted herself the rock brow pushed her out over empty space and her balance shifted almost too far mercer could hear her nails digging into the stone and his heart raced fearing she would panic seconds trickled by the only sounds were a caressing breeze selomes labored breathing and the rasp of her clothes against the stone ive got it she finally wheezed mercer followed and in a moment he was beside her a teninchwide strip of stone under his feet immediately mercer saw his miscalculation from the ground the narrow ledge looked as if it continued for a dozen yards to the next crack but it narrowed after just a couple of feet until it was nothing more than a band of shadow against the cliff it vanished completely for about four feet before reappearing again if anything even narrower than where they now stood he saw nothing but glasssmooth stone for twenty feet above them they couldnt climb up from here and backing down was next to impossible they were trapped what are we going to do selome saw their predicament reflected in mercers eyes he stared at the problem before answering were going to have to jump to the next ledge do you see that knob of stone at chest height in the middle of where the ledge disappears you have to lean out and grab it with your left hand and then swing across youre tall enough so your feet will land on the other side no way she cried if you see a better option im open to it she looked around the stone protrusion mercer had seen was fistsized jutting from the wall no more than four inches but it could provide an anchor point for them to pendulum across to the remainder of the ledge she kept her shoulder pressed tightly to the stone her eyes fixed on the knob rather than the sixty feet of nothing beneath them then reached out her palm encircling the knob completely without allowing herself even a second to think she eased her weight further onto her hand until her body was bowed backward she kicked off gently swinging smoothly her clothes hissing against the rock her right foot landed on the ledge first and she quickly shifted her weight twisting so her left knee touched down next to her foot her free hand clutching the wall she let go of the knob and grinned over at mercer he smiled back and was readying himself to repeat her feat when a stone sailed past his head he looked up a dark figure loomed at the top of the cliff silhouetted against the night sky mercer could see another stone in the mans hand and the outline of an automatic weapon over his shoulder the man saw mercers gaze and waved him up eagerly taunting him by tossing the stone from hand to hand mercer lunged for the stone protrusion arcing violently through the air the stone thrower was a moment too late mercer landed on the narrow ledge just as the other rock sailed behind him he hustled selome along the ledge only his toes and the balls of his feet finding purchase on the lip the next vertical fissure was wide and angled into the cliff once they had climbed high enough into it it was possible to move up it like a ramp there was no way they could reach the top before the gunman saw them again but mercer hoped to get high enough to give him a nasty surprise fifteen feet from the top mercer grabbed selomes leg duck he climbed over her so he could take the lead he saw the gunman waiting at the head of the eroded fissure his gun now cradled in his hands had the man wanted to he could have shot them both but mercer suspected his orders were to capture not kill the stone throws had been intentional misses mercer had prepared for this contingency by making sure their climb was far enough from the monastery to prevent a guard from shouting for reinforcements if the sudanese rebel wanted backup he would be forced to run back to the church giving mercer and selome a chance to escape stay flat and hold on tight mercer whispered he was climbing up the steep defile like a machine his legs pistoning propelling him forward deceptively fast mercer wished he could use selomes pistol but a shot would alert everyone within a mile he was ready to implement a plan born in desperation the lighting was poor enough for him to get closer to the sudanese than the rebel suspected the soldier didnt recognize the danger until it was too late before leaving the cave mercer had secured a geologists rock hammer to a fifteenfoot length of nylon rope and kept it coiled under his arm its handle sticking from his unbuttoned shirt the angle was nearly impossible but he yanked the tool from its hiding place twisted to allow for a sidearmed throw and let loose holding on to the ropes free end the hammer sailed cleanly the tether trailing it like the exhaust of a rocket at full stretch the nylon line wrapped around the terrorists neck and arced back again the tool neatly returning to mercers waiting left hand he heaved with all of his strength yanking the man off his feet torquing his body mercer jerked the man up and over himself releasing his grip on the rope and sending the soldier crashing into the defile a few paces from selome the african bounced once and then flew right over her tumbling down the crevasse until he fell into empty space his scream lasted less than two seconds his ak had become wedged behind a rock just a few feet from where mercer lay mercer waited for several minutes but no alarm was raised and when he peeked over the top of the cliff he could see nothing but more desert selome joined him a few seconds later now what im afraid this is as far as ive taken the plan mercer admitted and handed selome her pistol keeping the assault rifle for himself he tucked the hammer into his belt in the far distance the fortresslike walls of the monastery were washed by the headlights of several vehicles occasionally a figure would bisect the shafts of light and cast shadows against the building there were at least three trucks that he could see and mercer estimated at least a dozen terrorists the ak held thirty rounds in its banana magazine he would have to make every one count i guess the best thing to do is sneak up to them and take the rebels as opportunities present themselves mercer the first time we fire theyll be on us in seconds selome reminded him grimly well whatever we do we need to get closer he led selome along the edge of the cliff using the sheer drop to ensure that they couldnt be outflanked the craggy lip also provided a scant amount of cover for their approach thirty yards from the complex of buildings they could see at least ten armed sudanese milling around the trucks several monks were lined up against the monastery wall their dark faces shining with sweat and their eyes bright and frightened in the headlights glow mercer watched for several minutes waiting to see what would happen next and fearful that he already knew suddenly the rebels stiffened to attention another party entered the circle of light four men three of them cradling weapons the fourth was unarmed and walked with the relaxed armswinging gait of a natural leader the fourth man was white one of levines confused mercer watched as the white man spoke to one of the blacks and waited for his orders to be translated to the others several men hopped into one of the idling trucks and drove off mercer assumed they were heading for the base of the cliff to try tracking where he and selome had gone the white and several rebels went into the monastery herding the monks ahead of them another soldier walked to the cliff casting along the escarpment with a powerful flashlight in hopes of spotting their quarry he turned and started straight for where mercer and selome lay hidden they had only moments before the rebel found them huddled in the darkness mercer pressed his mouth to selomes ear so his whisper was almost unaudible stay behind me he moved forward on his stomach to get closer to the approaching sudanese then eased into a shallow depression the sharp hammer in his right hand the ak clamped under his body his mouth had gone dry as the soldier came nearer the flashlight beam shone along the ground with an untutored randomness mercer knew that if the soldier turned it on him he would have to surrender but the african seemed more interested in what lay below the cliff edge the soldier studying the drop was ten paces away when mercer made his move hoisting himself into a crouch and rushing forward faster than the startled soldier could react one swift blow from the hammer was enough to kill and mercer dragged the african back into the dust the entire maneuver had been silent he went back to selome and led her away from the cliff circling wide around the monastery so they could approach from a less likely direction if the white man was an israeli agent that meant theyd put aside their differences with the sudanese and pooled their resources it was an option that he didnt want to consider but what if hes the rebels original backer the moneyman behind their operation and then the answer came to him italian someone with a connection to the mine shaft mercer had explored had returned to carry on that work an italian with ties to eritreas colonial past would never be allowed back into the country but using sudanese mercenaries would allow him to secretly work the old mine with minimal direct involvement shit i led them right to it and provided the labor he thought about the african who had opened fire in the rome airport the gunman must have worked for the italian he had seen the israeli agent shadowing mercer perceived him as a threat to mercers life and murdered him that would have been the beginning of the struggle between the sudanese and the israelis a battle that had continued outside of mercers hotel room in asmara mercer was still left with the question of how the sudanese and their italian backer knew about his coming to eritrea and the purpose behind it but that would have to wait after walking a wide circle he led selome back toward the compound one hand gripping hers the other holding the ak hunkering down a short distance from the buildings he watched the back of the monastery waiting to see any sign that there were sudanese guarding the flankthere was nothing he guided selome to the compound dashing the final hundred yards in a dead run the sound of their feet absorbed by the tilled soil of the monks garden it took only a second to find a window with an unlocked shutter he hefted selome through the opening and scrambled in after her they were in a monks cell similar to the one in which mercer first awoke same plain bed and desk and the ubiquitous crucifix he cracked open the door and listened voices reverberated throughout the monastery angry shouts and an occasional grunt as if someone had just been struck the voices were too distorted to hear clearly but mercer recognized the language as italian he waved selome closer so she too could listen can you understand what theyre saying selome concentrated tucking her hair away from her small ear father ephraim is being questioned about us hes being asked where we are the man speaking has a venetian accent and sounds like hes used to getting his way i think that its another monk whos getting hit every time ephraim says he doesnt know where weve gone what are we going to do mercers expression matched the desperate look in selomes eyes they couldnt allow the interrogation to continue already tonight one priest was dead youre going to have to cover me stay close he opened the door before selome could say anything mercers sudden appearance in the hallway startled a sudanese who was walking past mercer reacted instinctively and struck out with the butt of the ak the wood cracked against the rebels jaw shattering bones and spraying blood and teeth against the wall before the unconscious man hit the floor mercer was in motion easing into the dining room he could feel selome at his shoulder father ephraim was stooped over the prone form of one of his brothers blood pooled around the ruined mouth of the other priest three more monks stood against one wall guarded by several soldiers the italian stood close to where mercer remained partially hidden he faced away from mercer and in the fraction of a second it took a sudanese to spot him mercer raised the ak by its pistol grip grabbed a handful of the italians bush shirt and rammed the barrel of the assault rifle into the mans lower spine nearly bringing him to his knees with the force the italian shouted a name mahdi one of the sudanese raised his own pistol locked back the hammer with his thumb and leveled it at mercers head selome mercer shouted and she came into the room her weapon covering mahdi with chilling calm one more gun goes up friend and your guts are going to decorate the walls mercer said mercer suspected that his prisoner spoke english but he twisted the barrel of the ak further into the mans spine for emphasis i think you call this a standoff yes giancarlo gianelli said casually not a trace of fear in his voice let me end it for us now dr mercer a shot rang out a sharp crack that split the air and brother ephraim was slammed backward against the wall a tendril of smoke coiled from the pistol gianelli had kept in front of him out of mercers view go ahead and shoot doctor none of us have anything to gain by standing around ephraim breathed in shallow gulps his face drained to an unnatural gray he held his hands over the massive wound in his belly blood cascading over his fingers there are another dozen priests here gianelli continued conversationally i give you my word that they will not live five seconds after you kill me gianelli had played the endgame so quickly that mercer had no choice he could kill the italian and would end up killing himself and selome as well gaining nothing or he could lower his weapon and hope for another opportunity since the beginning hed felt he was one step behind the other players and true to form he was behind again now mahdi sneered when mercer released gianelli a contemptuous twist of his mouth that told mercer he would have welcomed the suicidal gunfight selome lowered her own pistol letting it drop with a metallic clatter she moved to ephraims side settling herself so that the priests limp head lay in her lap gianelli showed no interest in restraining mercer as he joined her on the floor one of the sudanese retrieved selomes gun and the ak im sorry mercer whispered to the dying man knowing how empty the apology sounded ephraim was losing his fight as they watched when he spoke it was a wet wheeze that brought blood to his lips the children selome translated softly the children who died in the mine they were killed by his last word was not even loud enough to be a whisper what did he say im not sure it sounded like he said the children were killed by sin weve wasted enough time tonight giancarlo said mahdi and another rebel hauled selome and mercer to their feet dr mercer weve been looking for you for the past couple days you have some questions to answer for me about that ancient mine mercer guessed that the italian had completed the work he and habte had started they had opened king solomons mine but probably didnt recognize the find that was his only advantage if he hoped to stop levine he knew if he expected to keep himself and selome alive he was going to have to make himself indispensable ill tell you what you want to know it wasnt hard to let defeat creep into his voice i know you will tell me first who are you my name is giancarlo gianelli and it was my uncle who opened the barren shaft you discovered gianelli shook his head poor enrique knew there were diamonds in the region but he was apparently off by a couple of miles sinking his mine in the wrong place but someone long ago discovered the kimberlite pipe and judging by the depths we explored before coming to find you had worked it for many years and now its time for me to take up where my uncle failed and you good doctor are going to help mercer knew what ephraim meant about the children being killed by sin he saw it in every fiber of giancarlo gianelli it lurked behind his urbane veneer like a monster the sin that ephraim spoke of was one of the original deadly seven greed valley of dead children answers to the dozens of questions swirling through mercers mind had to wait until the column of giancarlo gianellis trucks ground back to the mine site mercer was in the back of one of the rigs with six heavily armed sudanese while selome rode in the back jump seat of another with gianelli himself he hoped that her proximity to the italian was for her protection from the lewd intentions of the troopers and not for the magnates own carnal thoughts mercer knew of gianelli the name had been synonymous with european finance for centuries almost as famous as the house of rothschild he couldnt recall how many of europes wars the gianelli family had funded but much of their fortune had been soiled with the blood of countless thousands he did remember that they were heavily involved with the facist movement during the s and s and after world war two had come under the protection of the united states because of their strong anticommunism of the current head of the family dynasty he knew little except that the ambition that had made them so powerful ran in giancarlos veins it was midmorning when the caravan entered the valley of dead children they drove past the open shaft bored by gianellis ancestor and headed to the ancient mine when they stopped a guard in mercers truck flipped up the soft canvas flap above the tailgate and jumped to the ground covering mercer with his rifle as he too leapt from the vehicle mercer had lost track of the number of days hed been away from the mine but was staggered by the amount of work that had taken place in his absence it took his ears a moment to adjust from the clamor of the truck to the sharper and significantly louder sounds of the work area apart from the large truckmounted generators pounding away a short distance from the mine gianelli had two bulldozers several bobcat skiploaders the caterpillar excavator that mercer had brought and an ingersollrand rotary drill rig for pulling core samples the equipments din echoed and reechoed off the bowl of mountains into a deafening racket that shook the dusty air amid this mechanical maelstrom mercer saw perhaps fifty africansthe eritrean refugeestoiling by hand with shovels picks and reed baskets he couldnt believe the sheer volume of dirt they had managed to move the mountain that he and habte had dynamited had been clawed up by the machines and carted away by the african laborers one basket at a time the mine that brother ephraim had spoken of had been exposed a dark shaft driven into the side of the mountain it was wide enough for the skiploader to charge into the earth and return again with its bucket loaded with overburden the operator would dump it into a mound and a stream of men attacked it with their hands filling baskets which they hoisted to their heads and carried away mercer thought about the heavy equipment that would be arriving soon machinery he had either leased or bought on behalf of the eritrean government alone the hydraulic shovel could have moved the same amount of dirt in about an hour still the eritreans endeavor was miraculous a guard prodded him with an ungentle thrust of his assault rifle toward where gianelli waited near the mine entrance mercer watched as one of the troopers bothered by the slow pace of an eritrean knocked the worker to the ground his heavy basket of dirt falling onto his chest as he lay defenseless in the dust the rebel kicked the refugee several more times before turning to keep his eye on the rest of the laborers none of the other workers had come to the aid of their countryman they had all bowed themselves to the task of surviving slavery was back what do you think doctor impressive amount of work wouldnt you say gianelli called selome was with him and another white man stood with their little group a hulking figure big in the shoulders and gut yeah and im sure union reps are having a hard time recruiting new members from your workers gianelli gave a genuine laugh i want you to meet joppi hofmyer my supervisor joppi this is philip mercer the famous american mining engineer neither man made a move to shake hands but joppis expression betrayed the fact that he had heard of mercer there was respect behind his dim eyes before you tell me what you know about this mine gianelli said breezily why dont i give you a tour im curious myself about the progress thats been made while ive been gone the mine opening was six feet tall and about the same width the bobcats roof scraped the rough stone ceiling as it emerged from the square aperture joppi spoke to the white skiploader driver for a second and the man shut down the engine gianelli and hofmyer each were handed lighted mining helmets by one of the sudanese guarding the mine shaft neither selome nor mercer got one weve managed to remove another seventy feet of overburden from the tunnel hofmyer told gianelli but the deeper into the mountain we go the more packed the material seems to be its as if whoever sealed the mine wanted to make sure it was never opened again pretty soon we may even have to blast away some of the stones and impacted dirt any deviation on the direction or slope have you found any branches or chambers its still as straight as a string and sloping downward at fifteen degrees i think i should wait and let you see the rest for yourself twenty feet into the shaft hofmyer and gianelli switched on their headlamps the light cut into the gloom yet the tunnel was oppressively dark and the air was heavy and fouled by the skiploaders exhaust the hanging wall or ceiling was low enough to force mercer to bend slightly as he and selome lagged behind the italian and the south african miner two sudanese took up the rear both carrying pistols they continued for over fifteen minutes mercer estimating that the tunnel was at least a mile and a half long while hofmyer and gianelli marched with a singleminded purpose mercer studied the rock walls and ceiling under the bouncing light from his guards lanterns pausing when a particular feature caught his eye he picked up his pace only when prodded by one of the two guerrillas what are you looking for selome whispered an escape route he responded cryptically selome looked behind them but all she saw was an endless tube of featureless rock the tunnel ended on a ledge that overlooked the floor of a chamber a huge vaulted space that had been created eons ago by the natural process of the kimberlite pipes formation molten magma driven by the engine of the earth had risen to this level during an eruption before cooling and solidifying the diamondbearing material injected into the threehundredfootwide dome had settled over time lowering the floor of the chamber until the ceiling lofted fifty or more feet over their heads this was the working area of the ancient mine and the floor was scarred by mans rapacious appetite for diamonds a generator hummed near where the tunnel entered the chamber tripodmounted halogen lights running off its power and illuminating nearly every square foot of the cavern the early miners had divided the caves floor into square grids probably to better track the progress of the slaves who had worked here while much of the floor was uniform some areas had been mined deeper than others so the floor resembled a threedimensional chessboard some of the deeper areas were lost in the penumbra below where the party stood at the lip of the subterranean pit mercer had no way to guess how many tons of ore had been pulled from the chamber for all he knew the entire space had once been solid rock but he began to believe that brother ephraims claim that the mine had been active for four hundred years was conservative my god its the blue ground giancarlo gasped looking to hofmyer for confirmation the big south african nodded the entire bluetinted floor of the chamber was composed of the tough ultramific lodestone for diamond there was no way of knowing the assay valuethe ratio between kimberlite ore and diamonduntil samples were taken and analyzed but it was safe to say that they were all standing on a fortune mercer thought about the crushed samples of kimberlite he had discovered shortly before leaving for the monastery and how thoroughly it had been worked to extract every possible carat that was pretty good proof of the value of the ore yes he thought a fortune one that belonged to the people of eritrea apart from everything else mercer knew that if he didnt act it would end up in gianellis hands he kept his anger behind a stony mask but the effort cost him we found it the day before yesterday ive had the men busting some ass to clear it of dirt before you arrived hofmyers voice shattered the wonder and astonishment gianelli was obviously feeling as he looked at the mine for the first time whoever worked this place first did a pretty good job of filling it back up too its at the far side of this chamber that we may have to blast away some of the kak dumped back in here how deep are those vertical shafts from the working floor of the pit mercer asked i had a couple of kaffirs dig into one and they hadnt hit bottom after pulling up thirty feet of overburden paystreak in the kimberlite my thought too hofmyer agreed way back when they must have hit one particularly rich diamondbearing section and dug into it like dogs this is better than anything i could have possibly hoped for gianelli breathed he turned to mercer now tell me about this mine mercer could feel selome stiffen next to him he too was reluctant to tell the italian anything but knew he had to if he wanted to keep them alive the mine was opened about three thousand years ago dont be ridiculous hofmyer exploded look at this place only machinery could have tunneled this deeply this chamber cant be more than a hundred years old i assure you this is an ancient working mercer kept a smirk off his face as he studied hofmyer just keep showing your ignorance you stupid bastard i found a stone hammer before leaving for the monastery it was badly chipped and looked as though it had been discarded with the tailings youll find it in a leather bag in my tent i doubt miners with access to machinery would use stoneage tools whats more look at the tunnel itself it was bored using a technique that dates back millennia judging by the texture of the walls and ceiling the mining of the tunnel must have been hellish work if you look closely you can still see the cracks created when the original miners used fires to heat the rock then flashquenched them with water and vinegar acid the thermal shock would shatter the stone and allow them to cart out the debris i wouldnt be surprised if every foot of that shaft represented a day or more of work id guess about twentyfive years just to drive that one tunnel is it possible giancarlo asked his mine engineer ja maybe hofmyer muttered possible my ass havent you ever read plinys account of the gold mines in asturias spain mercer doubted hofmyer had even heard of the roman historian he called it the destruction of a mountain starting around bc the romans forced tens of thousand of slaves to tunnel into the las medulas mountains using the technique i just described on the tops of the mountains huge reservoirs and canals and aqueducts were constructed then filled with water when enough interconnecting tunnels were dugand im talking miles and miles of thema torrent could be released into the galleries the waters hydrostatic pressure literally blew the mountains apart and goldladen earth was washed down into a plain where it could be easily retrieved the romans worked those mountains for two hundred years forever changing the landscape and recovering an estimated twelve billion dollars worth of bullion believe me this mine was worked in a similar fashion and a lot longer ago mercer shot a deadly look at gianelli this leads me to my final piece of evidence the monk you shot last night told me he knew of this mine from one of their ancient texts a book lost long ago but its oral tradition had been maintained mercer hoped he was spinning enough fact with the fiction to satisfy gianelli he said that this mine was worked for centuries until there was an invasion the people who operated it sealed it entirely rather than see it captured my god it sounds like king solomons mine gianelli gasped maybe i dont know the italian had gotten too close to the truth and mercer had to derail him it could be that this was the basis for the legend but as im sure yappy here can tell you there are countless spots all over africa that also claim that distinction joppi hofmyer growled at the bastardization of his name fascinating gianelli said it was evident that he was more impressed with his prisoner than with the man he had hired to excavate the mine mercer saw this and started to make it work to his advantage if i may make a suggestion you mentioned bringing explosives into this chamber i wouldnt the dome may look solid but unless you have blast mats to deflect the shock of a detonation down the tunnel you may find yourself proving the hard way that its not do we have blast mats giancarlo demanded of joppi no sir but it would only take a few days to get them from khartoum hofmyer seethed at being so easily undercut and while youre at it mercer continued taking an almost casual command of the conversation i saw outside that youre about to resift the original tailings for diamonds that might have been missed by the original workers dont bother the tailings i checked had been crushed down so fine that unless you brought a portable fluoroscope with you itll be a complete waste of time and manpower that i doubt you can spare hofmyer shot mercer such a scathing look that it appeared he would physically attack him sorting through the tailings had been his idea sounds logical giancarlo said enjoying the frustration on his overseers face if i had gone through the difficult task of mining the ore i imagine that i would also make certain not a single stone had been overlooked he smiled fetching you back here was a good idea i think it would be another good idea if i kept you around for a while longer for the time being you will be my chief among slaves for a fraction of a second mercers thoughts played openly across his face but fortunately gianelli had looked away mercer didnt want the italian to see the hatred or the resolve that flashed in his eyes those he was keeping to himself knowing that they would help him when the time came slave hed been called and slave he would be right up to the moment he would slip his hands around gianellis throat and squeeze until the son of a bitch was dead the mine two weeks passed two weeks in which mercer saw a man beaten to death two weeks in which he saw others drop dead from exhaustion two weeks in which men and machine toiled endlessly to yank the kimberlite from the womb of the earth tearing it free with picks and pneumatic drills and bare hands two weeks in which his own body was pushed mercilessly gianelli and joppi hofmyer worked the male refugees including mercer and habte in twelvehour shifts allowing just ten minutes every two hours for a little food and a meager water ration the pace wasnt enough to kill a healthy adult but many of the refugees had arrived at the mine on the verge of starvation and the labor pushed several of the older ones over the edge because of his expertise mercer was named an underground manager for his shift watched over by one of hofmyers south africans a man named du toit at least ten armed sudanese also guarded the work the pit echoed with the machinegun rattle of compressed air drills and jackhammers a deafening roar of mans fight against earths strength it was impossible to look across the workings the air was thick with dust and fumes and the miners were covered with so much grit that it was difficult to tell white from black a flexible ventilator tube with highspeed fans had been rigged along the tunnel leading to the work but it did little to alleviate the dust or the incredible heat in the chamber taking a lesson from the british prisoners of war who had built the kwai river bridge mercer dedicated himself to mining the kimberlite to the best of his ability he selected those refugees with the strength and stamina to work the drills and jackhammers teaching them the basics and a few tricks to make their task easier others he employed as pick men and priers and still others to haul the ore back to the surface where more people hammered it apart to search for the elusive diamonds but the stones werent that elusive the kimberlite here was the richest mercer had ever seen while he was not allowed in the secure area near the mines entrance where the ore was crushed and the diamonds were stored in a safe he learned enough to guess that the mine was paying out better than twelve carats a ton an astronomically high value he did have the opportunity to see a few stones that were found right in the mine at first the eritreans were dumbfounded at the value placed on the small symmetrical lumps of crystal when mercer pointed them out because there is little of a diamonds hidden fire to be seen before the stone is cut and polished the biggest stone mercer saw for himself was a nice twenty carats but hed heard rumors about a monster stone some said the size of a mans fist that had been found by one of the women sorting the ore it was in the pit that one of the guards beat an eritrean to death it wasnt known if the refugee had broken one of hofmyers numerous rules or if the young sudanese had just done it for the thrill the reason didnt matter to the victim nor did it really matter to those who witnessed the sudanese using the butt of his ak to split open the mans head mercer had been on break when it happened and he sprang to his feet at the first blow habte was next to him he recognized the danger mercer was about to put himself in and habte wrapped his arm around mercers leg tumbling him back to the ground dont mercer just dont that man is already dead and you are still alive habte whispered i learned during the war that no mans life is worth a defiant gesture the beating lasted at least a minute and when it was over du toit ordered the crew back to work the corpse lay where it had fallen until the end of the shift the workers ducking their eyes reverently as they passed by for two weeks the mining went on a continuous chain of men burdened with baskets of kimberlite wending their way along the tunnel to the surface and returning to the workings for more by the end of the second week mercer realized that gianelli intended to work everyone to death not only to ensure their silence but to make certain that every possible diamond could be found in the time hed allowed himself late at night when mercer and habte were lying on the ground in the barbedwire stockade that acted as their quarters they would discuss theories behind gianellis rushed schedule habte maintained that the italian was afraid the location would be discovered by someone else and reported to the government in asmara but mercer suspected that there was another purpose behind the killer pace habte be reasonable mercer said we never saw another person when we were first searching for this place and the nomad in badn said this region is avoided because of some superstition and dont forget the landmines act as one hell of a deterrent shit i havent even seen a plane fly over all this is true habte murmured tiredly rolling so he could pluck a sharp stone from under his back but why is gianelli pushing so hard i dont know mercer admitted too tired to think through the problem it had been plaguing him from the start of the mining operation but at night it took all of his concentration just to eat the weak stew served by the wives of the refugees the other thought dogging him was selomes safety they hadnt been able to speak to each other she was in a separate compound with the other women forced to cook for the workers a slave as surely as he whenever mercer saw her as he was getting his stew he tried to smile and put up a brave front but knew that concern darkened his eyes he could see that she had been hit a couple of times for purple bruises showed on her arms and face each night mercer and the others could hear guards drag a few of the women off for their own pleasure he didnt know if selome had been similarly treated and his inability to help her or the others ate at him like cancer on the morning that started his fifteenth day of captivity the sky was dark with storm clouds the veiled sun didnt even cast shadows the men waiting in line for their breakfast shivered miserably in the damp chill it will rain before the sun sets again habte said to mercer clutching a tin plate for more of the ungodly stew if were going to make a break for it mercer replied first making sure that none of the guards were close enough to overhear itll have to be soon i doubt theyll give us tents and the refugees wont last more than a day or two in the rain neither will we habte grunted do you have a plan mercer paid no attention to his friend he looked at the women tending the cooking fires watching for selome to turn from her task so he could offer a smile when she looked at him he noticed that exhaustion had bent her once erect carriage and dulled her expression he studied her for second and saw the old defiance flash from behind her eyes as gently as he could he nodded her over to him she looked about cautiously before hoisting a platter of injera to her head and moving to the long trestle table that served as the buffet mercer saw that her willowy body was so thin he could see the bony projections of her hips though the fabric of her pants she did not meet mercers eyes as she placed the platter on the table we are getting out of here tonight mercer whispered fiercely his anger making his quick decision easy be ready two hours after my shift ends well never make it the guards will be on us the moment we start running from the camp wouldnt it be wiser if you got out alone and went for help from some village it would take me a week to reach a town and the workers here wont last another two days besides we wont be leaving the camp trust me i have an idea its nuts incredibly dangerous but we have to try ill be ready ive even managed to horde a little food and water for us beaten possibly raped and enslaved yet she still had managed to keep alive a spark of hope mercer ached to touch her he felt his heart squeeze and a burst of adrenaline course through his system when he thought of her courage he drew strength from her refusal to give up ill see you tonight the crew was given only ten minutes to wolf down the food before heading back into the mine while the surface activities ceased at night to conserve fuel for the generators underground the men worked around the clock the outgoing shift passed mercers team in the tunnel each man watching his own feet too exhausted to care that another day was done there was little that mercer could accomplish until nightfall except have habte alert as many workers as possible the escape party would have to be small for any chance at success but mercer wanted the others forewarned in the hope that when he went into action they could help add to the confusion yet the cursed luck that had shadowed mercer was still with him joppi hofmyer was working in the mine and after two weeks of subtle needling by mercer was ready to exact his revenge no sooner has mercer descended the particular shaft that hed been working only hours before than hofmyer approached mercer get your fookin ass up here hofmyer shouted from the top of the fiftyfootdeep hole in the mines working floor his voice booming over the shattering sounds of the equipment as slowly as possible mercer climbed the rope ladder rigged to the side of the pit until he was standing on the original floor level he chanced a look at the long tunnel leading to freedom then rounded back to the south african whats on your mind another lesson in hard rock mining aye itll be a lesson all right hofmyer stood close enough for mercer to be staggered by his rancid breath gianellis gone for the morning so ill have hours to think of an excuse for why you died today hofmyer was a few years older than mercer but that was in no way a disadvantage the boer stood half a head taller and weighed a solid fifty pounds more his shoulders were broad his chest like a barrel and his fists were larger than sledgehammers the knuckles were crisscrossed by numerous white ridges of old scar tissue joppi hofmyer was in peak physical conditionwhile mercer was on the verge of collapse knowing his first shot would most likely be his only mercer struck his move was slowed by his condition but it caught hofmyer off guard mercers fist slammed into joppis mouth snapping two teeth and crushing his lip against the jagged stumps so his blood flowed hofmyer fell back several steps bothered more by the suddenness of the attack than the pain of his injury the workers on the mine floor stopped to watch the drama even the sudanese slackened their vigilance hofmyer grinned at mercer a bloody display of snapped teeth and ruined flesh thats the spirit he said wetly spitting to clear his mouth thisll be a lot more fun if you put up a fight mercer got into a combat stance and prepared to fight for his life as he expected hofmyer stood solidly his arms open he was so accustomed to using his size and strength to overpower opponents that hed never learned the subtleties of unarmed combat mercer hoped that he knew enough to at least survive the pounding that was coming he had no illusions of actually winning hofmyers first punch missed mercer by an inch as he ducked away but the followup landed blowing the air out of mercers lungs and rocking him on his heels it felt as if hed been struck by a baseball bat and the punch had been from in close using just a fraction of hofmyers strength the south african laughed again feigning blows that mercer had no option but to dodge even a glancing shot would land him on his backside for ten minutes hofmyer threw punches some landing some brushing by and some missing completely mercer managed only a single counterpunch a weak swing that hurt his hand more than hofmyers temple where it struck the eritrean laborers had been cheering at the start of the fight but upon seeing mercers ineptitude at defending himself they quieted as each punch slammed into him they cringed for no man could withstand the brutal punishment mercer was enduring but mercer had a reason behind his apparent lack of defense every time joppi came at him he allowed himself through retreat or landed blows to move closer and closer to the idling skip loader its replacement driver had not yet shown for work and the squat excavating machine rested near the middle of the domed chamber its wide bucket elevated off the ground if mercer had any chance of surviving the fight he would need the bobcats power to augment his own flagging strength hofmyer never became aware of mercers intentions but he also never moved to the exact spot that mercer wanted him three times mercer was beaten to within a foot of the skip loader and every time joppi moved out of the fray to catch his breath and enjoy the cheers of the sudanese rebels three times with an undeterred patience mercer was pushed and beaten and kicked until they abutted the bobcat again his face was bloodied and swollen so he could barely see and he kept one arm low to protect what might be broken ribs but still he took the punishment it was during the fourth time that mercer judged everything was right there was a small spark left in him that last bit that gave him a burst of speed and strength joppi came in for a devastating series of body blows twisting his horny fists into mercers flank in order to increase the pain of the battered ribs hofmyer expected mercer to fall back gasping as he had for the past three such attacks but mercer didnt straightening as best he could mercer lashed out with his fist a ranging shot that forced joppi off balance and then so quickly no one even saw it happen mercer threw himself to the ground extending his leg in a sweep that brought hofmyer crashing to the stone floor before joppi could recover mercer was on his feet again reaching across to the controls of the bobcat with a skillful flick of his wrist he pivoted the vehicle in place so the hydraulic bucket centered over joppis head and lowered the blade until it exerted just enough pressure to pin the south african had mercer wanted he could have crushed joppis skull like an overripe melon the sudanese guards finally realized what had happened and their weapons came up back off mercer shouted in english his tone carrying his meaning from under the bucket of the skip loader joppi hofmyer shrieked mercer glanced down at his prisoner thats right you bastard tell them how much it hurts tell them you dont want to die joppi screamed again a horrid sound that pierced every corner of the cavern his body wriggled as the blade kept his head mashed against the floor habte mercer shouted and a second later the eritrean was at his side can you speak to these sudanese the eritrean nodded good joppi i want you to tell them to back out of the tunnel if theyre still here in thirty seconds your brains are going to decorate this cavern the south african repeated the order his voice shrill with fear yet muffled by the weight of the machine habte translated and the sudanese did as ordered forming up in a ragged line and retreating from the cavern youd better hope mercer spoke to hofmyer that gianelli returns soon because you arent getting up until he gets here he handed the control of the skiploader to habte so he could wipe away the blood on his face if he twitches more than you like go ahead and put a little more pressure on his head mercer revved the diesel to punctuate his order and drowned out joppis pleas for mercy giancarlo gianelli entered the cavern about an hour later with a retinue of guards he wore fresh khakis and he smiled disarmingly at mercer who sat slumped in the control seat of the small earthmover i see we have a slight problem not if you dont mind me squeezing joppis head like a grape we dont mercer replied nonchalantly well we cant have that can we youre right mercer revved the engine and eased up on the bucket freeing hofmyer i wanted you to see that i could have killed him and didnt every man present including your troops can confirm that i didnt start this i just want it to end he goes his way and i go mine and just where do you think you are going gianelli seemed amused by the apparent ease mercer had subdued hofmyer and just as casually let him go you know what i mean gianelli call him off and ill go back to work so this wasnt some elaborate effort to escape giancarlo arched an eyebrow mercer looked at him flatly youll be the first to know when im ready to escape your bravado is impressive gianelli chuckled hofmyer was sitting on the ground his head cradled gingerly between his hands no more joppi you want to beat mercer to death do it when we are finished here am i clear hofmyers reply was a moan good gianelli tell me mercer eased himself from the bobcat and stood in front of the italian industrialist it was the first opportunity hed had to speak with him whats this all about working this mine i mean you dont need the money and youve already proved there are diamonds here just like your uncle said there were why work these people to death for a couple thousand carats i know im not getting out of this alive so whats the harm in telling me a thought struck mercer that moment and he voiced it after all do you think the central selling system is going to let you move these stones theyre going to come down on you like a ton of bricks very astute gianelli said you hit upon the crux of my plan on the first try what is this central selling system habte interrupted gianelli rounded to habte and spoke in a patient tone the css is the secret arm behind one of the most recognized corporate names in the world unlike any other industry the diamond market is dominated by a tightfisted monopoly that controls every aspect of the trade mining cutting and selling nearly everyone in europe and america is well acquainted with their artful television and print advertisements that espouse the everlasting quality of their stones the css is a shadowy organization that keeps rein on who gets diamonds who is able to sell them and for exactly how much through their policies the value of diamonds is kept artificially inflated he turned to mercer correct me if im wrong but youre thinking the css will find out about my little operation and close down the mine in order to maintain their monopoly thats about right mercer said they know down to the individual stone how many diamonds are mined worldwide and not only in the facilities that are part of their consortium if previously unknown stones from an unknown source suddenly appear their investigative branch is going to find out and put an end to it through any means necessary you know the power they have the css has contacts in the highest echelons of south africas and englands government they operate with near impunity thats what im relying on you see im the person whos going to tell them about this mine mercers eyes went wide with this admission and gianelli gave a delighted laugh i have neither the desire nor the resources to take on the css they of course dont know that the inherent flaw with any monopoly is their fear of competition and its astounding the lengths they will go to maintain their supremacy mercer finally understood at last youre going to bluff them not bluff them exactly im going to show them the stones weve recovered so they can see my seriousness when i hand over a bucket of diamonds they wont be able to trace theyll know theres a new player in the game i dont know if they will pay me more to know the mines location or more to ensure i dont work it anymore either way they must control this site consider my actions extortion im using their greed against them mercer kept his face neutral but he had to admit it was a brilliant plan elegant and simple gianelli would reap billions the css wouldnt know he didnt really own the mine until they had paid him off and when your actions force the css to raise the price of stones worldwide in order to pay you off and send south africas economy into a tailspin who cares so what if pimplyfaced boys have to pay a few thousand dollars more for engagement rings for their stupid girlfriends as for south africa i hope the country falls apart and the whites retake control i made a lot of money down there before the blacks were given power while part of my motivation was to reinstate my uncles name in the family annals as the true genius he was i certainly wouldnt have spent so much money without some financial recompense mercer knew that south africas fledgling democracy wouldnt survive the shock of tens of thousands of men out of work anarchy would run rampant as people fought to stay alive you sick bastard these are lives youre playing with the cheapest commodity in the world so how much is enough you must have a couple thousand carats and theres a rumor going around about a mammoth stone why keep working these people the more stones i dump on the css the more theyll pay me to get out of the diamond industry im sure you know im walking somewhat of a tightrope between my need for the stones and the chance of being discovered but the efficiency of the men hasnt diminished much in the past two weeks thanks to you so well remain a bit longer to give you a little motivation ill make you a bargain at the end of say three more weeks if i havent been forced to leave prematurely ill make my deal in london i imagine my negotiations shouldnt last more than a few minutes once completed ill have the refugees released after i sell my knowledge of the mine that information no longer has value and they are free to go and tell whomever they wish does that sound fair in three weeks there wont be ten men left alive mercer spat gianellis eyes glazed angrily thats not my concern he turned to hofmyer who had finally gained his feet go get yourself tended to and see that du toit comes in here to watch these monkeys mercer went back to work his mind reeling the mideast south africa the refugees selome habte and harry with stakes this high he had no choice but to succeed the mine the noise was like the pounding of drums a deep bass that rattled the chests of the men heading down the tunnel at the end of their shift even before they were close enough to see the outlet they recognized the sound they had been farmers once these men and they knew when the rains came it was eight at night and so dark that the delineation between the black tunnel and the outside was just a fraction of a shade no more than a ghosts glow water poured over the mouth of the tunnel in a continuous waterfall a solid sheet that every few seconds would disgorge the soaked form of a man heading into the working pits conversation was impossible as mercer and his fellow miners coming off shift approached the cascade the sudden appearance of the replacement workers was startling and eerie will the rain help us or hurt us habte had to shout in mercers ear to overcome the noise of the tremendous runoff mercer could only shrug he was focused on things other than the storm hed told selome to be ready two hours after his shift ended and he and habte had a great deal to accomplish in that time just before it was their turn to step into the torrential night mercer pulled habte aside the closest sudanese guard was still a good five hundred yards down the drive herding the stragglers from mercers team it would be impossible for him to see or hear mercer and habtes conversation are you set with everything you have to do mercer asked tiredly hed rested as much as he could during the shift but he was still weary a bone fatigue that felt like it would be with him forever the only bright spot was that hofmyer hadnt broken any of his ribs yes ill be waiting just outside the tunnel everything will be rigged and ready to go if its not this is going to be the sorriest escape in history mercer growled does everyone know whats expected of them they will know what to do when the time comes those i didnt speak to directly today like the men headed to the mine now will hear from the others dont worry they will be ready mercer was relying on a hunch a thin one at best and if he was wrong hofmyer and gianelli would probably take turns roasting his testicles over an open fire and machinegun everyone else are you set with everything you have to do habte grinned trying to cut through mercers black mood mercer gave a gallows chuckle well both know in two hours as mercer suspected gianelli hadnt provided tents for his laborers yet the italian the other whites and the sudanese troopers were waiting out the storm in separate tents huge affairs that hummed with air conditioners to cut the humidity and glowed feebly through the silver streaks of winddriven rain none of the women were forced to serve food during the storm but they had laid out a meal for the returning workers the injera was so soggy it oozed from mercers hands like mud and the stew kettles overflowed with rain water rather than waste his time with a meal he was too nervous to eat mercer made his way to the barbedwire stockade big blue tarps had been spread on the ground and he could see countless lumps beneath the plastic ground cloths they were the men huddled together for warmth and protection the sky cracked with thunder and lightning piercing explosions that shook the earth following every blow of thunder he heard the moans of the terrified eritreans three sudanese had been given the job of watching the refugees but as mercer passed the tent they had erected for shelter he saw one of them already asleep and the others looking about ready to nod off on a night as foul as this they werent expecting trouble from their prisoners thats right boys mercer thought as he entered the enclosure no one out here but us sheep bunking in for the night you have yourselves a good nap the eritreans had reserved a corner of a tarp for mercer and habte and he was directed to the spot with quiet gestures he rolled under the top piece of reinforced plastic to wait until habte finished his waterlogged meal despite the adrenaline beginning to wend its way through his system he slept for a few minutes until habte appeared at his side you can sleep habte remarked i guess you are not too worried if youre as ugly as i am you need all the beauty rest you can get mercer turned serious do you have it habte showed him a small miners hammer tucked in the waistband of his pants they never knew it was missing and youve got the two men to help one man i will help get us out forget it habte we cant risk your hands getting too cut up you have some delicate work to do after we get out of the stockade habte nodded okay i have another who will do it the fencing that kept the eritreans prisoner was concertina wire heavy coils of razorsharp barbed wire laid in a pyramid ten feet wide at its base and over eight feet tall the snarled strands were wrapped so tightly the obstacle resembled a steel hedgerow protected with tens of thousands of inchlong teeth that could cut cloth or flesh with equal ease mercers plan was simple but it needed the courage of two refugees and a tolerance for pain that was almost beyond comprehension when they were ready the first refugee lay on his stomach before the coils and slowly began to worm his way under the mound he moved with care but even before he managed to extend one whole arm into the spirals of steel he was cut and bleeding he didnt cry out or complain or try to remove his limb instead he started working his other arm in he had borrowed clothing from other miners so he wore several layers to protect himself but as he crawled deeper into the fence the cloth split and seconds later blood as dark as his skin welled up and was washed away by the downpour he cried out only when a barb pierced his face snagging against his chin and tearing a long gash that would require stitches if it was ever to heal properly for ten minutes mercer habte and another refugee watched the mans progress holding their breath when he stuck himself in the groin and exhaling when he removed the tiny dagger and whispered back that it had missed everything critical five more minutes passed before all that remained of the eritrean in the stockade was his bare feet then it was time for the second refugee to broach the wall of razor wire the second man dug himself under the first eritreans feet and like a snake wriggled under him using his predecessors body as a shield from the barbs he snagged only a couple of times minor snarls that he could dislodge with a quick shake of an arm or leg it took him only a few minutes to cover the distance the first volunteer had paid for with his pain and blood they waited another twenty minutes while the second african crawled farther forward tunneling and burrowing slowly and carefully his passage was marked with bits of clothing and flesh stuck on the barbs he stopped only when his knees bracketed his comrades head though there was still another eighteen inches of wire to cover mercer didnt hesitate he put himself to the task with the same fatalism of the eritreans he slithered under first one refugee and then the other his much broader shoulders taking the brunt of the steel thorns yakanyelay he said when he reached the second mans head thank you moving slowly feeling time slipping away mercer began to work himself under the remaining wire his hands were slick with a mixture of blood and rain water was streaming into his eyes so he worked nearly blind only when a bolt of lightning flared could he see how pitifully small his progress had been the two africans had covered twice his distance in half the time while he appeared to be lying completely still he quickened his pace but a careless move rammed a barb under his fingernail all the way to the cuticle a lancing needle of pain shot up his arm exploding in his skull and he had to bite down not to scream out he pulled out the barb and continued closing his eyes to the agony suddenly his probing hands moved against nothing he had reached the end he wriggled forward clearing both arms of the entanglement before whispering for habte to follow it took habte just three minutes to reach mercer snaking under the obstacle with sinuous ease mercer felt at least a dozen barbs sink into his back as habte crawled under him pressing him up against the heavy coils it took an act of will for mercer not to shout for his friend to hurry when habte was finally free he helped mercer clear the last of the tangle plucking wire from his back and legs as mercer slithered those last few feet the rain fell in a biblical deluge there are going to be others following our route habte said as they tasted freedom for the first time in weeks rainwater washed the blood from their faces hands and arms if those two men dont get help they may bleed to death they know its the price if more of us can be freed mercer studied habte and knew the eritrean was speaking the truth as an african saw it he wondered if the ethiopians whod once occupied these lands really believed they could have defeated an enemy with that kind of mettle their sacrifice isnt going to be in vain are you ready yes ill meet you at the mouth of the tunnel in mercer looked at his watch dismayed by the amount of time that had elapsed one hour and twenty minutes youll be able to do everything habte thought for a moment yes it will be tight but ill be waiting see you in a while mercer and habte shook hands and in seconds they were swallowed by the storm mercer looked into the darkness beyond the mining camp it would be easy for him to just walk away he could be miles from the valley by morning and the rain would make it impossible to track him he could be back home in a couple of days he knew now that harry white was being held by israelis and he had enough contacts in the government to secure his friends release the two of them could be enjoying a drink at tinys in a week mercer shook the image from his head angrily and looked away from the beckoning desert in order to stop levine he had to stop gianelli first to do that he had to free some of the refugees so they could cover his attempt to contact dick henna besides hed led the eritreans into slavery and it was his responsibility to get them out again he also thought of selome and what shed been through for the first time since aggie johnston had left him mercer felt that old slow burn in his chest at this point it didnt mater if it was lovemaybe that would come maybe not but it gave him the strength to go on he started in the direction of giancarlo gianellis camp the camp for the whites was about a quarter mile from the prisoners stockade upwind from the openair latrines the eritreans were forced to use the night was inky black and the light spilling from the clutch of tents was like a beacon as mercer slogged through the mud the rain masked any sound he might have made as he slipped and slid toward his destination but it would not shield him if he stumbled into a patrolling sudanese an armed soldier loomed out of the tinsel of rain so suddenly that mercer doubted his own vision the sudanese wore a wet poncho and was facing away his ak held under protective cover mercers throat went dry his breath shallowing until he was holding that last inhalation like a souvenir of a lessfrightened moment he came up on his toes silently urging the soldier not to turn he moved fast making his strides as long as possible in the circumstances with three feet to go the soldier a veteran guerrilla sensed something behind him and started to whirl clearing his assault rifle to engage mercer covered those last few feet like a wraith he brought his elbow up to his head and using his momentum and the soldiers spin to increase the power of the blow smashed it down on the side of the mans neck the force of the blow drilled the sudanese into the mud dead or out mercer didnt take the time to care he snatched up the ak rifled the mans uniform for spare magazines and continued toward the encampment he released that held breath returning to his focus shutting the violence from his brain armed and feeling a measure of control mercer approached the tents they were laid out in two distinct groups the larger ones aligned in four rows the other five grouped in a circle a crack of lightning revealed tables and chairs in the center of the grouping and a ring of stones for a fire pit guessing that the four smaller tents were for the whites mercer dodged around the encampment to approach as far away from the sudanese tents as possible the storm hid him as he worked his way to the back of them nearly choking himself on an invisible guy rope he fell heavily in the mud he lay still for a slow count of twenty waiting to see if his ineptitude had drawn attention but no alarm was raised mercer rested his ear against the tents nylon shell listening for voices he had snapped one of the barbs from the razor wire which he could barely hold without slicing his fingers when he was satisfied that the tent was empty he used the little blade to slit open a gash where the wall attached to the floor he had to strain to make out any details once he was inside light from the adjoining tents cast just the feeblest glow as soon as he realized there were two beds he knew he had the wrong tent he was looking for gianellis and it was doubtful the billionaire would bunk with anyone else this one must belong to a couple of the south africans currently in the pit he thought at the next tent he heard gianelli and joppi hofmyer talking the rain made it impossible to hear what was being said yet there was no mistaking the voices mercer slid to the opposite side from where the voices were loudest and used his blade to cut a tiny eyehole his vision was obscured by a piece of louis vuitton luggage rather than stare inanely at the leather he put his ear to the hole better than using the bobcat why not the mechanical arm of the excavator gianelli laughed and mercer guessed they were discussing the manner of his own murder i think it would be more fun to turn him over to the sudanese and let them rape the fooker to death hofmyer boomed i didnt think christians did that sort of thing aye but remember these monkeys are africans first raping your vanquished enemies is about the oldest custom around here its ninethirty gianelli exclaimed i lost track of time i need to call venice you will have to excuse me sure mr gianelli sorry to make you late for your call not late yet but ive got to use the toilet again boiled water imported food and no ice for weeks and my stomach is still fouled touch of menyeleks revenge eh not funny hofmyer mercer heard a tent fly zip open like the sound of tearing silk and then the voices faded the last words he could discern were a curse by gianelli about the rain he had maybe ten minutes before gianelli returned and he wasted none of them he enlarged his peep hole so he could slip into the tent his movement unsettled the mound of matching luggage tumbling the pile to the floor son of a bitch mercer hissed massaging the back of his head where a valise had caught him he began a systematic search of gianellis tent pawing through the trunks and cases gianelli had brought several pieces of furniture with him on the expedition including an antique ironwood canopy bed complete with mosquito netting mercer searched under the mattress and box spring and rifled the two builtin drawers beneath it where he found the satphone hed given habte at the nomad village of badn one item down one to go the desk was also an antique it had ten drawers and mercer went through them all fruitlessly shuffling through mounds of papers he glanced at his watch eight minutes had passed panic was beginning to hurry his movements next to the camp chair was a small table its top was piled with more papers mercer plucked them up to see if anything was hidden beneathagain he turned up nothing gianelli would be back any second and if mercer failed in his search his plans for escape were finished he would be better off returning to the stockade and trying again the following night the rain pattered against the nylon roof making it impossible to hear anyone approaching mercer checked the time again eleven minutes he had to leave it would take him another minute to right the stack of luggage and hed already stayed too long just then the gas powered refrigerator to his left gave a little shudder as it cycled off mercer realized it was the one place he hadnt looked the fridge was small designed for camping mercer opened it set on the bottom shelf was mercers leather kit bag he took just a moment to make sure the folded medusa photographs were still amid the clutter oh thank you christ had they not been there mercers escape plans would have crumbled gianelli must have put them in the fridge to protect them from the brutal humidity he realized slinging the kit bag across his shoulder he had begun stacking the luggage leaving just enough space for him to crawl back out again when gianellis voice made him freeze the italian sounded as though he was just outside his tent calling something to one of the sudanese guards mahdi perhaps mercer didnt move ignoring the remaining cases mercer ducked for the hole just as the tent fly zippered open the metal tag climbing the wall as if by magic he threw himself to the ground scrambling to get out of the tent before gianelli spotted him at the last second he hooked his foot on the precarious mountain of vuitton sliding it in place just as giancarlo entered his temporary home mercer lay panting next to the tent the rain washing away the nervous sweat that slicked his face and hands he could hear gianelli begin speaking on the satellite phone hooked to his computer five seconds mercer thought five seconds and he wouldve been nailed he snatched up the ak transferring the spare magazines into his satchel and raced back to the compound he had only fifteen minutes to free selome and link up with habte shit he breathed he had anticipated a cushion of a half hour as he ran he wondered if it wouldnt have been smarter to seize gianelli and use his life as a bargaining chip to free the remainder of the eritreans that might have worked he conceded slipping in the clinging morass his eyes straining against the darkness in hopes of spotting any guards before he himself was seen but if gianelli either refused to cooperate which was a distinct possibility given the mans instability or if the soldiers got triggerhappy then mercers action would lead to the deaths of a hundred innocents no he thought his original idea was better mercer felt he couldnt win a headtohead with gianelli so he would hide and fight only when he was ready the womens stockade was smaller than the mens there were only about thirty women and girls in it along with those male children too young to work in the mine mercer had studied it in the earlymorning hours before his shifts and knew its only weakness was the guarded entrance he didnt have the luxury of time to burrow under the coils of razor wire as he had done earlier like the mens enclosure the guards here had erected a tent to shelter themselves from the elements and to give privacy to their nightly rapings there was just enough light for mercer to see the gleam of brass when he snapped the banana mag from the ak to check its load the guards tent was quiet as he approached he had no way to disguise his clothes and white face so he simply ducked in the first sudanese to notice him was sitting on a wooden stool when he stood to challenge mercer cracked the butt of the ak between his eyes sending him sprawling another guard dodged away when mercer twisted to repeat the attack rolling to the floor next to a low pallet the men used for sleep the sudanese hadnt had the time to arm himself and mercer ignored his supplicating hands the gun butt made a sickening crack when it landed on the soldiers skull of the third guard there was no sign damn the guerrilla was either at the latrine or inside the womens stockade selecting a victim for the night mercer couldnt spare the time waiting for him he looked into the enclosure but the rain obscured his vision beyond ten feet everything farther was a murky curtain of darkness the lock on the barbed wire gate was off suggesting the sudanese was inside he stepped in and cleared his eyes of water but it was his ears that gave away his quarrys location a sharp feminine scream lanced out from the far side of the stockade and mercer took off to track down the source there was a large square of plastic on the ground shiny wet and glossy and mercer knew the majority of the women were beneath it huddled like their male counterparts a short distance away he skirted the tarpaulin and came up to where two dark figures struggled in the rain from a few feet away it was impossible to make out who was who and mercer committed his charge to taking down the taller of the two combatants then at the moment before he jammed the ak barrel into the sudaneses kidney he realized that it was the shorter figure who was the man the taller person was selome redirecting his aim slightly the rifle barrel caught the rebel in the lower back rupturing his skin until the steel was buried in the mans flesh up to the forward sight the african arched his spine in agony as he bent back mercer released his hold on the assault rifle grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground he clamped a hand over the mans nose and mouth until his struggles ended hope im not too late he whispered to selome she composed herself id say you were right on time weve got about three minutes to meet up with habte come on they ran from the stockade the other women are going to make a break for it selome said as they passed the guards tent theyll try to free the men and scatter into the surrounding hills that should make gianellis job of finding the rest of us a little more difficult he prayed that the italians revenge when he rounded them back again would wait until after hed dealt with mercers group near the mine opening another large razorwire enclosure encircled the area where the women and children crushed the kimberlite ore it was deserted now except for a couple of guards standing under the cover of a metal shed erected to hold the safe gianelli was using to store the diamonds a generator hummed nearby and a single floodlight shone in the rain mercer and selome approached cautiously using the big caterpillar excavator as cover they were late habte should be around here someplace waiting for them having worked his way into position from above before their dash to the mine mercer had to meet up with him because the eritrean had another task to perform tonight something more important than anything else what now mercers eyes rested on the bobcat sitting a short distance away ah instant tank follow me as they reached the skiploader habte raced from behind a mound of mining debris to join them i was starting to wonder if you had gone off to elope he said struggling with the unfamiliar word thought about it but she wanted a big ceremony you know how women can be mercer clasped habtes hand everything ready detonator is lying behind that hill where i was waiting and there are thirty pounds of explosives rigged above the mine entrance any trouble no you were right it was easy to smash into the explosive locker with the hammer they were relying on the guards to prevent us from getting to them and didnt bother with a stronger lock lucky guess selome quipped elementary my dear selome mercer reached into his kit bag and extracted his iridium satellite phone he handed it to habte this was the one with the stronger charge so he wasnt concerned about draining the batteries when he powered it up the number is programmed into the phone just hit this button here and dial you may have to get away from the surrounding mountains to get a signal im not sure the man youll be talking to is named dick henna if he needs verification that youre with me remind him about our conversation in his car and tell him that if he and his wife do get a dog they should get a tailless pembrooke corgi hell know what it means tell him whats been happening and to send troops here as soon as possible he can get our exact location by contacting the nsa theyll be able to determine our position by triangulating which communication satellites are handling the call make sure he notes the exact time of your call itll make the technicians job a hell of a lot quicker tell him that harry white is being held by israeli extremists linked to defense minister chaim levine and to start working on getting him freed make sure he knows that were in a bad way here and the longer it takes to get the marines on the ground the more people are going to die shouldnt selome make the call her english is better than mine no im going to need her mercer turned to selome unless you want to go and do it no im staying with you okay habte as soon as were twenty feet from the mine entrance i want you to blow those explosives but with this phone we can contact the authorities and by tomorrow the eritrean military will be here in an hour the guards i killed tonight will be discovered and you can believe the refugees will pay for their deaths gianellis going to realize i took the phone and he and his band of bastards will be safely across the sudan border by the time the army arrives we need to keep them here this is the only way get into position at the detonator and after you seal the mine get away from here and make that call mercer hopped into the bucket seat of the skiploader and motioned selome to get on his lap habte vanished back into the storm and mercer handed the ak to selome as soon as you see someone notice us take them out the key was in the overhead ignition and mercer gave it a twist timing the firing of the diesel with a rolling boom of thunder he feathered the throttle to its lowest setting and eased the twin control arms forward the heavy tires clawed into the mud slipping for a full revolution before finding purchase and the bobcat was under way twisting the wrist actuators on the controls brought the bucket up to partially shield them from gunfire when the skiploader entered the glow from the tall spotlight atop the shed the guards saw the unauthorized vehicle and opened fire winking eyes of flame jetting from their weapons selome shrieked as a fusillade rattled against the bucket sparks shooting off the metal fire back mercer screamed the bobcat was taking a pounding both front tires deflating when struck though the vehicle continued to crawl forward mercer rammed the throttle to its stops despite the increased speed it was obvious hed underestimated the number of guards at the mine entrance and their accuracy selome was returning fire controlled threeround bursts that pinned men behind cover but had yet to diminish the sudanese ranks mercer chanced a look under the bucket just as one of the guerrillas caught a bullet and flew back into the mud he was about to congratulate selome on her shot when he realized she was changing clips another sudanese went down punched through the mouth so his entire skull erupted as the round passed through mercer thought habte was shooting from his cover behind the mound of tailings but the angle was all wrong it was during a secondlong pause in the murderous exchange of fire that he heard the sharp distinctive whip crack of a highpowered rifle there was someone else involved in the fight a sniper helping mercer and selome make it to cover and he knew who it was the israeli commandos the men hed thought hoped he had lost weeks ago he had no idea how long they had been watching the camp or what their plans were but mercer wasnt about to lose the advantage they were giving him empty the clip as fast as you can this is it they were twenty feet from the entrance and as they drew closer more sudanese fell gunned down from above by the unseen assassin mercer realized that the israeli had positioned himself in the middle of where habte had planted the explosives he felt nothing that the man who had just helped them was about to die he drove the hearty little excavator into the tin shack that housed the safe crushing one guard between the blade and the metal wall the building collapsed under the grinding pressure falling apart like a house of cards the safe was white and very hightech about the size of a steamer trunk mercer lowered the blade and scooped it up its weight was almost too much and the bobcats engine seethed but they continued forward with the safe nestled in the bucket fifteen feet from the entrance mercer felt the ground shudder ten crimson blooms erupted in the darkness above the mine entrance habte had fired the charges hed planted and the stability of the rock face was gone the overhanging mountain started to come down in an avalanche they had ten feet to cover and the bobcats motor was missing every few moments an ominous skip that signified a bullet had pierced something critical mercer lowered the blade and released the thigh restraints that had locked over him and selome be ready to run he screamed seeing a solid wall of dirt rock and mud rushing down the mountain hundreds of tons of debris that forced the air ahead of it in a gust the bobcat surged again finding a bit of power that carried them into the mine just a fraction of a second before the first of the avalanche plummeted to the desert floor mercer kept the throttles to their stops racing ahead of the debris that started to fill the tunnel itself the ground continued to shake rock falling from the ceiling the tunnel was about to collapse mercer selome gasped the explosion had weakened the ancient tunnel and it started to come down in huge slabs cracks and fissures appearing in the walls the rents racing forward faster than the bobcat could possibly move mercer considered abandoning the excavator but he needed the safe and the diamonds inside it for bait pressure bursts erupted just behind them chunks of rock exploding down the shaft with the speed of bullets more rubble clogging the tunnel stones rattled off the skiploaders safety cage they drove for two hundred yards with a surging wall of debris chasing their heels the engine began coughing again just as they started to pace ahead of the wending fissures in the walls mercers lips worked in a silent entreaty for the rig to keep moving after a few more seconds the sound of falling stone receded he looked behind them the cavein had stopped though he could still feel the earth shifting as the mountain settled he shut down the bobcat and silence rushed in he and selome panting in the dustchoked air the string of lights in the tunnel were powered by a generator in the main chamber and they danced in time with the manmade earthquake a few of the bulbs had smashed against the ceiling and plunged the drive into shadow behind them stood a packed jumble of stones some as large as automobiles others mere shards but still the drive was completely sealed what in the hell was that all about selome coughed stunned by the ferocity of the avalanche our entombment mercer replied unconcerned by the destruction around him valley of dead children yosef couldnt believe his eyes when the mountain beneath his snipers position suddenly began sliding downward in an unstoppable rush he was a quarter mile away higher in the hills that surrounded the valley and he watched the whole thing through nightvision glasses even in the greenish distortion of the secondgeneration optics the sight was unbelievable one moment he saw his man work his rifle the long silencer fitted to the americanmade remington eliminating all telltale signs of his location while cutting just a fraction off the deadly weapons accuracy and then the hill heaved upward in multiple gouts of earth the sniper was caught unaware vanishing into the maelstrom of debris so quickly that yosef couldnt track his position as he was swallowed by the avalanche nor could he tell if selome nagast and philip mercer had made it into the tunnel it was possible theyd been crushed by the tons of rock and dirt he radioed his other team thinking that the mine was under attack the twoman team reported that nothing was happening at their sector if it wasnt an attack then yosef had no idea what had happened hed watched mercers escape from the barbedwire enclosure and tracked him as he moved stealthily around the mining camp first to a cluster of tents and later to free selome their dash for the mine in the small digging machine was dismaying yosef couldnt understand why they hadnt tried to escape the valley and then came the avalanche he considered that perhaps the explosions were the result of a tripwire booby trap designed to prevent unauthorized entry into the mine there could be no other explanation then came the full realization the ancient mine had been sealed by the landslide he gaped at the mounds of rock and earth that blocked the entrance and was struck dumb all the work that had gone into the opening of the mine was lost and it could only be the fault of philip mercer yosef prayed that the american had been smeared into a wet stain mercer had destroyed yosefs chance for ever recovering the tabernacle of the lord the sacred ark in which moses had carried the word of god into israel the israeli team had kept the mine under observation since the column of equipment had arrived from the west followed shortly by hundreds of refugees they had found the valley from the plane theyd rented in asmara using the map supplied by rabbi yadid theyd landed twenty miles away and yosef and the others had taken only a day to march to the mine and establish observation posts that theyd manned around the clock for the past weeks in all that time none of them had seen anything remotely resembling the ark of the covenant removed from the mine and yosef assumed that the artifact was still buried inside the miners would have a better chance than the commandos at finding it so he had hoped to make his assault when it was discovered and removed from the tunnel the superior training of his small team would ensure theyd have little trouble stealing the ark once it was on the surface but things back home had changed all that during his last contact with levine the defense minister had told him that his agents in israel had failed to find harry white it was crucial that yosef find the ark before whites debriefing or the operation would fail so far no alarms had been sounded within the intelligence community but both men knew that once the old man told his story it was only a matter of time before an investigation implicated the minister levine ordered yosef and his men to make a direct approach by taking over the mine and finding the ark themselves yosef noted the strong odor of desperation in levines plan at first levine had wanted the ark to secure his election to the prime ministers office but now the discovery might be needed to protect him from prosecution hed promised yosef that he could still count on close air support from the ch super stallion standing by levine needed just four hours notice to get the chopper and an inflight tanker into the air and en route choking down his own emotions yosef continued to watch the camp below him he saw the two white leaders of the expedition take charge of the pandemonium he assumed one of them was giancarlo gianelli and the larger man with him was a mining engineer yosef couldnt hear their voices but the gestures and the speed in which the orders were carried out demonstrated total control within minutes additional lamps had been brought to the landslide and the large crawler excavator was up and running its twin lights piercing the rain the mechanical arm began tearing into the loose rubble ripping out long trenches of debris yosef saw some of the armed sudanese lope off into the night and assumed they were chasing the few eritreans who had escaped the stockades after mercer and selome only twenty minutes after the disaster nearly a quarter of the detritus had been cleared the israeli was amazed at the efficiency with which the white men worked the crews perhaps yosef thought hope remained they looked as though they would get the shaft cleared in just a few hours this meant yosef and his people could still sneak in later to search for their prize even as he watched more eritreans were put to the task crawling over the mounds of rubble with shovels and picks adding their labor to the machines yosef lay cradled in a hollow between several boulders rain pounded mercilessly turning the top layer of soil into a slipping mass that oozed downhill he hated that the ark was going to become just another political tool its very symbolism tarnished by the manner of its recovery yet as long as it went to the people of israel he felt justified with levine now backed into a corner recovering the artifact could mean the difference between prison and freedom for all of them a noise pulled his attention from the workers clearing the mine someone was on the mountain with him moving laterally to get away from the encampment he thought it was one of the fleeing eritrean refugees he hunkered a little deeper into his burrow if either an eritrean or one of the armed guards stumbled onto his position he would kill without hesitation if he remained undiscovered he would leave them to their nocturnal fumbling he put the noise out of his mind and redirected his attention to the mine when a voice disturbed him again he thought maybe two eritreans had linked up in the dark and was about to turn back to his vigil when he realized he could hear only one voice a man was speaking on a phone and he was speaking in english inside the mine no sooner had the earth stopped trembling than mercer began smashing the light bulbs that had survived the collapse with the butt of selomes ak she took no notice of his peculiar behavior instead she stared down the drive her eyes misted with emotion this was only the second time she had seen the interior of the mine and it filled her mind with wonderment about the people who had built it she knew it had been dug by slaves children who were worked to death but it still represented a tangible piece of her history and as a jew she knew how little physical evidence remained of her faith selome mercer called what get hold of yourself the guards down in the pit are going to come to investigate and we need to be ready he came up to her in the dark touching her hand to reassure her of his location in the darkness take this light he handed her a small penlight hed kept in his kit bag and settled them next to the dead skiploader when i squeeze your hand i want you to turn it on and shine it down the tunnel the drive was a mile and a half long and it took a few minutes for the sudanese guarding the slave workers to send someone to see what had taken place and for the hapless guard to reach the end of the shaft mercer could hear tentative steps shuffling on the dusty foot wall as the rebel drew nearer crossing into the darkened section of the tunnel where he waited with selome when he gauged the guerrilla was about twenty feet away probing the wall like a blind man in an unfamiliar place he gave selomes fingers a gentle squeeze the penlight wasnt powerful but after the total blackness its beam was blinding motes of dust hung in the air as thick as a new england blizzard and at the far reach of the light a soldier paused peering into the glow as soon as mercer saw the armed figure he triggered off a single shot one down four more to go earlier gianelli had used ten sudanese to guard each shift but the number had dropped to five since there had been no trouble from the slave workers he stood handed the rebels ak to selome and started walking toward the domed chamber mercer how are we going to get out of here there must be a thousand tons of rock blocking the exit selome didnt know mercer well enough to appreciate one of his insane plans so panic put a raw edge to her voice dont worry when were done tonight theres going to be another thousand tons in this tunnel the light bulbs lining the hanging wall were in little metal cages and as they moved closer to the working pit mercer smashed them to eliminate the chance he and selome were backlit to other investigating soldiers after twenty minutes of quiet walking they reached a spot about forty feet from the chamber still no one had come to see what had befallen their comrade or the mine entrance damn mercer cursed bitterly theyre better disciplined than i thought i was hoping to catch another of them in the tunnel as usual the pit was well lit and echoed with the sounds of the generators which had probably masked mercers earlier rifle shot the tools though were now idled the eritreans leaned against the pneumatic drills while their guards looked blankly at each other all work had stopped while they waited to see what happened next the south african miner appeared to be the only one not immobilized by the catastrophe he was shining one of the halogen lamps on the dome arching over the pit checking to see if it had been damaged by the explosions and avalanche that cavein may have looked bad mercer whispered but gianelli will get it cleared pretty quickly we have a lot more work to do what next we need to immobilize the rest of the guards and then were going to do a disappearing act what do you mean a disappearing act im going to make every one in this chamber vanish into thin air he noted the disbelief in her expression and grinned dont you believe in magic outside the sealed mine entrance the men worked feverishly in the rain pushed on by the brutal prompts of the sudanese and by the sharp tongues of joppi hofmyer and giancarlo gianelli the italian was frantic screaming at everyone and kicking piles of dirt like a spoiled child he yelled at hofmyer and the other three south africans not trapped in the mine and he yelled at the eritreans and the sudanese even though the natives couldnt understand a word he said by now he knew what had happened mercer was gone from the mens compound and only a few of the feebler women remained in theirs theyd found two corpses under the barbed wire of the mens enclosure and a dozen male workers had vanished into the raging storm gianelli felt that the avalanche was a diversion on mercers part to redirect interest from the refugees and force a reopening of the mine while they made their escape however gianelli still had more than enough men to both capture the runaways and clear away the avalanche in all mercer had done little to derail gianelli from his plan hofmyer assured the industrialist that he would have the tunnel reopened in short order the trapped men should be in good condition and it was possible that du toit who was the overseer inside would keep them working confident that his comrades would rescue him i bet we dont lose more than a few hours because of this hofmyer said and mercers trapped in the mountain apart from the couple of guards he killed and a little inconvenience he did nothing to us i swear yes well there are a couple thousand carats of rough diamonds in the safe that bastard buried inside this mountain and this whole operation will be a waste if we dont recover them i call that more than a little inconvenience mr gianelli i bet that safe is no more than a couple of feet into the tunnel a guard at the mine entrance said that just before the avalanche the skiploader was running very rough gianelli whirled you had better well hope so spittle flew from his lips mercers satellite phone is missing which means the government is going to know about us shortly i need those stones we still have time but not much the men and machines continued to rip apart the mounds of dirt and rock that covered the entrance if anything hofmyers time estimate was too generous to gianellis eye it appeared that the tunnel would be cleared in two hours maybe less one of the south african miners had come up with the idea of using the pumps brought to empty the earlier italian workings and use them to power a water cannon the apparatus was turned on while giancarlo watched water drawn from a raincreated lake that had grown to enormous proportions the highpressure jet tore into the debris like a drill washing away soil and smaller rocks yes he thought maybe this wont be too bad after all he hoped mercer had survived the cavein so he could watch the man die a much slower death the idea gave him a grim satisfaction mercer didnt have a good plan for eliminating the four other sudanese guarding the pit he wanted to avoid a firefight since he and selome had only two guns and a finite amount of ammunition while waiting for inspiration providence provided for him the white minermercer recalled the mans name was du toitstarted up from the pit floor heading for the tunnel exit and his own investigation hidden as they were the miner wouldnt see mercer and selome until he was almost on top of them selome read mercers intentions and crossed the tunnel to take up a position to prevent du toit from bolting the south african walked between them his flashlight aimed straight ahead mercer stepped from around a large boulders his ak held low across his belly the barrel pointed at du toits groin the south african raised his hands so quickly that his knuckles scraped on the low ceiling selome made a tiny scuffing sound as she came up behind du toit and if anything the miners hands pressed tighter against the hanging wall smart choice mercer said softly now were going back to the pit and see if you can convince the guerrillas to do the same thing nod if you think thats a good idea du toit bobbed his head vigorously though his eyes never left the mm aperture of the ak leveled at his genitals thats good because if you arent convincing youll be the first to die mercer stood at the top of the working pit holding du toit by the shirt collar and gave a bellowing primeval yell the four sudanese swiveled their guns to the duo standing ten feet over their heads but held off firing selome quickly crawled forward to cover the guards with her own ak drop your weapons she shouted in tigrinyan and when one of the sudanese who understood the language did so the others followed suit eritreans near the guards scrambled to retrieve the assault rifles many of them had been freedom fighters just a few years earlier and they handled the weapons with easy familiarity forcing the sudanese to their knees and asking selome if they could kill them no she called we need the ammunition for later and these dogs may have value when we get out she looked at mercer and repeated what shed just said in english i didnt think you wanted them dead good assumption mercer released du toit and trotted down the ramp that led to the floor of the mine he sat at a table used as the underground office clearing away rock samples and mining gear with a sweep of his arm i estimate we have another three hours before gianelli breaks through so first we need to put another roadblock in his way and then weve got some serious mining to do whats your plan selome joined him first thing is to send some men to drag that safe in here with us then we need to drop more of the tunnel hanging wall close to where it reaches the pit theres more than enough explosives here for the job didnt you say something to hofmyer about needing to channel the explosions away from the chamber to avoid destroying the main dome mercer chuckled hofmyer might be a miner but hes no geologist that domes been here for a billion years sitting near some of the most active fault lines on the planet if earthquakes havent destroyed it by now itd take a nuke to damage it today so we replug the tunnel im guessing thats to slow gianelli again correct and what will we be doing while hes digging i told you were going to vanish into thin air mercer slid the medusa pictures from his kit bag and carefully unfolded them when he found the one he wanted he showed it to selome she studied the unintelligible jumble of lines and swirls and splashes of color im sorry but those pictures make no sense to me if alice had a photograph like these she never would have gotten lost in wonderland mercer grinned ill explain it all in a while but first we need to get these men working well split into two teams so youll have to do double duty interpreting for me unless anyone else here speaks english twenty minutes later mercer had a gang of ten men standing in the tunnel hed used a can of fluorescent spray to mark where he wanted holes drilled into the ceiling and fashioned a piece of metal wire as a depth gauge there were about thirty bright orange spots spread along a hundredfoot section of the tunnel through selomes translations he explained that he wanted half the holes drilled straight upward and the other half at an angle angling the holes would direct the force of their explosives in a more random destructive pattern the holes didnt need to be any deeper than the wire gauge he left instructions to be told when the first fifteen holes had been drilled so he could place the charges needed to bring down the hanging wall he watched for several minutes to make certain the men knew what he wanted and was pleased at how proficient they had become with the drills each one weighed a hundred pounds and they were as long and unwieldy as railroad ties yet the eritreans worked them with the expertise of seasoned professionals water from a tank lubricated the drills cutting heads and chips of rock and mud began pouring from the ceiling in a steady drizzle one of the men paused to wave at mercer when he removed the drill from the first completed hole hit it again man mercer slapped him on the shoulder and the miner started boring into another of the painted marks mercer left them to their task and returned to the table with the medusa photographs selome had laid out some food and water for him and he ate while studying one particular picture she sat close by watching him as he worked but he paid her little heed his face was a mask of concentration and when he looked up from his task his eyes were hard and his expression grim without proper tools and measurements mercer had set himself a nearly impossible task and amid the din of the workers rigging the tunnel he felt the responsibility weighing heavily he needed a plug that would slow gianelli not deter him entirely mercer knew there was a chance that when they collapsed more of the tunnel its entire length would come down if the italian abandoned the diamonds mercer had stolen there wasnt enough fuel for the drills or explosives for them to tunnel themselves back out hed intentionally buried them alive and if he continued with his plan he might seal them in forever murdering selome and the other forty people in here with him selome touched mercer on the back of his scarred hand and he looked into her dark eyes for what its worth she said i believe in you this time i dont think its going to be enough he replied but hauled himself to his feet and waved over the cluster of miners waiting for instructions they walked to one of the deeper shafts that had been dug into the working floor of the mine the bottom of the fiftyfoot hole was lost in the gloom mercer scrambled down the ladder followed by selome and the eritrean who was the gangs leader he shook the can of spray paint hed carried with him the tiny ball bearing clattering like the tail of a rattlesnake glancing again at the medusa picture hed brought mercer painted two bold crisscrossing diagonal lines near the south corner of the shaft x marks the spot he tossed the can to the ground we dig here faster than mike mulligan and his steam shovel and just maybe well make it out of this mess alive selomes next question was lost in the bustle of men lowering equipment into the hole minutes later mercer had stripped off his shirt and stood poised over one of the big drills its tip resting on the rock floor our only saving grace is theres no kimberlite down here the early miners dug like bastards but didnt find anything the rock is a much softer matrix otherwise my plan would never work whats beneath us he looked at her the real king solomons mine with that he opened the compressed air valve on the drill it was as if the shattering sound alone splintered the stone as the cutter head sank into the earth valley of dead children within a few minutes of leaving the camp habte makkonen knew that he had been spotted and followed yet he did not change his pace or direction doing so would alert the stalker the man who shadowed him was good an expert actually and the storm made his job that much easier but habte hadnt survived so many years in the front lines of the rebellion without becoming better still there were two other problems besides the fact he wasnt armed and his pursuer most likely was first the mountains ringing the valley were steep and too treacherous to climb in the rain and the valley floor offered little cover as he moved away from the mine he was terribly exposed second was that the pursuit had been taken up much too quickly for the stalker to be one of the sudanese guards the rebels hadnt had the time to mount an organized search by the time habte fled the camp this left only the snipers whod opened fire moments before the explosives had buried the mine habte was also certain his watcher had a pair of nightvision goggles and his rifles scope had similar capabilities the sniper certainly an israeli agent was interested in the mineaccording to what mercer had saidbut habte could guess at the mans interest in him now he had made an earlier unsuccessful call to dick henna on mercers satellite phone hed spoken for a few seconds before realizing that the recorded voice he heard was telling him he had a bad connection and to try the call again the israeli must have overheard him responding to the unfamiliar device habte cursed his own stupidity for not calling farther from the mining site if he was going to alert henna quickly habte didnt have much leeway to wait out the sniper he had to get clear to make that call skirting an ancient landslide habte saw something across the plain that gave him an idea and he wondered if the sniper would allow him to do it walking across a thousand yards of open land with a snipers scope on his back was not the most brilliant tactical solution hed ever devised but he hoped that if he kept his gait even and unthreatening and waited for the sniper to close range every few minutes he might just make it the old head gear sat forlornly on the open expanse the buildings next to it darker shadows in the night lightning illuminated the eerie site every few seconds outlining the skeletal structure that had once hauled workers and worthless ore out of the italianbuilt mine as casually as a man on a stroll habte veered from the hills and made for the old facility he expected a bullet in the back but when none came after the first forty yards he paused to allow the sniper to move into a better shooting position as long as the sniper felt he wasnt trying to bolt habte prayed that he wouldnt take the shot the mine was far enough from the other workings to ensure that if the sniper wanted he could pin habte with a few wellplaced shots and close in for an interrogation that was what habte was betting his life on that the sniper was more interested in his intentions than his death he continued to walk slowly his pace almost ambling as if the storm didnt matter once he thought he heard the sniper moving along a hillside the sliding hiss of loose stones betraying both his position and the fact that he was closing and then a sudden thought struck habte and he took off at a full run legs flying arms pumping and his breath heaving against years of cigarette smoke a silenced shot winged by ricocheting against the ground well behind and to the right the shot was made in desperation it was an inaccurate estimation of habtes position because the sniper didnt have him in his sights habte then realized that the sudden bursts of brilliant electricity that cut through the storm would blind him if viewed through any lightamplifying device the sniper couldnt use the starlite scope or the nightvision goggles while the israeli was still armed the playing field had been leveled by a common atmospheric phenomenon habte dove into the building they had used as a camp when they first arrived at the valley he had only moments before the pursuer reached the dilapidated structure and habte needed all of them to put his plan into motion he stripped out of his clothing dumping the soaked garments on the floor and nude scrambled back out of the building his black skin would be shiny in the rain but for his purpose he was invisible the israeli sniper might have received the finest military training in the world but his experience was nowhere near habtes as he loped silently toward the head gear his bare feet silent in the mud the eritrean felt the odds were evening out one of the things that had kept him alive all those years fighting the ethiopians was an understanding of human nature he could anticipate what others were going to do long before they knew themselves ignoring the hundredfoot hole beneath the head gears lattice of struts habte leaped onto one of the supports scampering up ten feet without pause ignoring the slashes in his skin made by the scaly surfaces he nestled the satellite phone into the crotch of two beams and clung tightly his silhouette hidden in the tangle of metal he doubted the israeli had seen this mine before and was certain the sniper would not be able to resist the urge to peer into the stygian mine shaft the sniper had shouldered his long rifle and moved slowly an uzi rucked hard against his flank the bulbous nightvision gear resting on the top of his head his body was shrouded in a ghillie suit a camouflage garment made of hundreds of sewntogether rags that from a distance of a few feet looked like an innocuous shrub with the amount of rain that had soaked the suit habte estimated the soldier was carrying an additional thirty pounds and his movements would be slowed by the encumbrance a bolt of lightning cast a sizzling light across the sky and the israeli rolled to the ground coming up against the camp building covering his exposed right side with the machine pistol habtes suspicions were confirmed the mans movements appeared lethargic at this range there was enough ambient light for habte to watch the israeli clip the goggles over his eyes for a moment to peer around the camp and into the building before slipping them off again hed studied the head gear for an instant but didnt notice habte as predicted the sniper seemed more interested in the mine shaft as the only other logical place for his quarry to hide and began crawling over for a better look habte estimated he had only a few seconds to wait before springing on the soldier the sound was sharp enough to carry over the storms fury and so incongruous that habte waited until it sounded again before reacting the satphone was about to ring for a third time when habte snatched at it clumsily dislodging it from its resting place and knocking it from his perch the israeli was equally startled but there was nothing clumsy about his movements he rolled on his back bringing his uzi to his shoulder and when the phone rang again he adjusted his aim his reactions were instinctive he fired off a quarter of the magazine a long tongue of fire leaping from the compact weapon as bullets pinged off the steel scaffold his aim however was directed at the falling phone and not at the dark figure poised in the murk above habte leaped from the tower propelling himself out into the night landing yards short of where the israeli lay on the muddy ground the sniper scrambled to trigger the uzi at the apparition rolling toward him he took just a second too long and while habtes lunge lacked force it was enough to foul the weapons aim a harmless spray of mm rounds streaked into the sky the phone had survived the drop and hadnt been hit by the opening fusillade so it rang again with the uzi clamped between the two struggling figures habte had the advantage the israeli grappled with him but habtes wet skin gave him no handhold the eritrean grabbed a hank of the ghillie suit and started to shake the sniper vigorously slamming his head into the mud even when the sniper tried to hook an ankle around habtes and roll them to gain the upper hand his feet just slid up habtes bare leg yet habte couldnt get enough of a grip to force the writhing agents face into the ooze to drown him so they continued in a macabre parody of lovemaking both moving against each other arms and legs entwined the advantage shifted when the israeli grasped the dangling bunch of habtes genitals and squeezed them with all of his strength habte howled arching his body in an effort to break the grip but the sniper held on with the tenacity of a remora managing to free one hand habte wrapped his fingers around the israelis throat and angled the sniper for a vicious head butt that shattered teeth and forced blood to pool in the soldiers mouth choking on his own blood and with his wind pipe almost crushed the sniper started to die his grip on habtes balls loosening habte maintained the pressure long after the sniper stopped struggling and only stood when he felt that all the life had been crushed from the body he studied the face and recognized him as the driver of the car parked outside the ambasoira hotel when the sudanese and the israelis had clashed in mercers room habte wished it was the israeli teams leader lying here covered in mud and soaked with his own blood but that would have to wait the phones ring shocked habte and he lifted himself painfully from the ground and found the small device half buried in the mud it had landed about an inch from the lip of the mine shaft habte snapped it open and pressed the button to accept the call his voice was a painful wheeze hello you have reached the phone of philip mercer hes been buried alive may i help you my name is habte makkonen the men working to clear the mine entrance heard and felt another explosion deep within the earth a jolt that shook the ground in the pause that followed gianelli asked joppi hofmyer if he knew the origin of the subterranean detonation the south african had no answer and rather than speculate as gianelli seemed to want hofmyer put the crews back to work it took another forty minutes to clear the entrance enough for a man to slip inside hofmyer went first a powerful flashlight supplementing the lamp on his miners helmet gianelli scrambled after him and the two started down the nearblack tunnel hofmyer kept his eyes on the walls and ceiling looking for new cracks in the rock every few feet he would tap the stone with a hammer listening for a dull thud that would indicate a rotten place in contrast gianelli stared into the gloom ahead of them his mind focused on recovering his diamonds they must have tried to blow open the safe thats what we heard he told an uninterested hofmyer mercer warned about using explosives under the dome without blast mats so it couldnt be anything else the lights cut just a few feet into the choking veil of dust that mingled with the chemical stench of explosives so far the path into the mountain was clear nothing seemed out of place amid the dressed stones that lined the walls and ceiling hofmyer was the first to see a new plug in the tunnel when he estimated they were only about two hundred feet from the pit rubble blocked the drive from floor to ceiling but this avalanche wasnt as tightly packed as the first one the rock was loose and shifted with just a tap of his foot and when he levered a few pieces out of the pile nothing new fell from above whats this all about gianelli asked no idea but if mercer thinks thisll stop us for long hes out of his bloody head hofmyer sneered itll take nothing to move this out of the way and get to the pit are you sure yeah the ceiling seems stable but just to be safe well shore this lot up as we clear the muck outa the way hofmyer finished his examination of the pile of debris and turned to his employer gianelli had promised him a bonus commensurate with the speed in which the diamonds were recovered so he had a newfound desire to get into the mine i told ya i heard of this mercer before from some of the trade magazines and from mates back in south africa and i expected a hell of a lot more from him blocking the tunnel like this is childs play i dont know what hes playing at but this is starting to piss me off when we get our hands on him hell wish he had died in the avalanche once the entrance to the main tunnel was completely cleared hofmyer ordered the eritreans to remove the debris from mercers drop mat the explosives had rendered the waste into easily maneuvered chunks and a human chain was quickly established to transfer the debris outside it still took nearly two hours because of the distance to the surface and because hofmyer used specially designed screw jacks to prop up the hanging wall gianelli was standing next to the south african when they broke through to the pit hofmyer poked his head into the chamber a pistol held in his fist just in case he was silent for a long moment well gianelli panted hofmyer didnt answer he directed a couple of workers to clear away the last of the rubble and crawled into the domed chamber emboldened by hofmyers actions gianelli dogged his heels they found themselves standing on the ledge above the ancient mine floor lights still blazed brightly running on internal battery power because the generators were silent in fact they had been destroyed their mechanical guts spread around them in pools of oil the drills were lined up next to the generators and they too had been wrecked the couplings for the air hoses smashed beyond repair apart from the equipment the chamber was empty gone gianelli said not believing his eyes they are all gone hofmyer stood next to him slackjawed incredulity on his face there was no sign of mercer or the eritrean miners or the sudanese guards mercer had made the entire group vanish on the far wall of the pit written with neon yellow paint in letters five feet tall was a simple sixword message composed no doubt by philip mercer it sent a deep chill through hofmyer and especially gianelli they both felt that somehow it was true im waiting for you in hell the mine an hour before gianelli broke through the first avalanche and encountered the drop mat the working floor of the mine had been far different machinery thrummed and ratcheted echoing off the arched roof and drowning the shouts and oaths of the eritrean workers the activity was frantic as they strove to reach mercers nearly impossible deadline they tore into the deep shaft like madmen jackhammering out chunks of stone that had to be muscled from the pit they had bored a mansized hole a further fifteen feet into the soft stone deflected at an angle from the main shaft in strict accordance to mercers instructions in the entry tunnel the scene was less hectic but just as noisy the crew continuing to drill tenfootdeep holes into the hanging wall mercer had left the work in the pit and joined this crew following behind them with bundles of explosives he placed each charge carefully not letting the pressure of time rush the delicate process selome worked with him handing him the cylinders of plastique from a cart they had dragged into the tunnel the drillers were far enough ahead so they could hold a shouted conversation are you finally going to explain what were doing she asked mercer didnt look up from the charge he was wiring yeah this drop mat is going to buy us a few more hours before gianelli reaches us you already told me that selome replied and you said youre going to make us all disappear but what do you mean mercer answered her question with one of his own did you notice something incongruous between the mine that brother ephraim described and this tunnel here selome shook her head he said that solomons mine was excavated by children working in slave conditions right yes then explain to me why the children needed to dig this tunnel so wide and so tall also how could they have dug it straight to the kimberlite deposit the odds against that are about one in a trillion i have no idea it was obvious that she hadnt considered either of these points this tunnel was built after the kimberlite had been discovered in order to make extracting the ore more efficient it was sized for adults not children dug so that two men carrying baskets of ore in their hands could pass each other comfortably the kimberlite had already been located through another set of tunnels that run beneath this one and thats the mine that the shame of kings describes oh my god selome breathed it was staring in front of me all along and i never saw it hey i do this for a living mercer said this one was dug when the mines high assay value made it economical to drive a tunnel directly to the ore body rather than haul it out through the smaller childrens tunnels below us so the other team is digging where you think the two mines intersect you found the location from the satellite photographs yes mercer finished with the charge hed been wiring and inserted it into the hole over his head tamping it gently to seat it properly those medusa pictures finally had some value after all when i first saw them in washington i noticed that white lines covered some of them and assumed they were either distortions or veins of a dense mineral giving back a strong echo to the positron receiver what i figured out since coming here is that they represent hollows in the earth tunnels like this one and you found a way back to the surface mercer looked a little sheepish well not exactly remember the resolution on those pictures was terrible its not quite guesswork on my part but damn close still i think where those men are drilling will lead to the older tunnels the ones ephraim told us about im not saying i dont believe you but what if it doesnt then gianellis going to break into this mine and gun down everyone he sees mercer shrugged ive gotten us this far havent i maybe our luck will hold they blasted the drop mat as soon as mercer had rigged the last charge everyone having taken an impromptu vote to either surrender to gianelli or try to find a way out on their own mercer felt he owed them that he explained the pitfalls and the danger but the vote was unanimous to seal off the mine again when the crew had finished blocking the tunnel mercer shifted them to the pit they drilled for another hour the men working with machinelike efficiency mercer in the thick of it he was operating one of the drills when the bit struck a void in the rock and the entire rig sank up to its couplings not wanting to hope too much but feeling a building excitement he hauled the drill back up aligned it a few inches away and fired in another hole a section of floor collapsed and he found himself standing above a black hollow that hadnt seen light in three thousand years his triumphant whoop alerted the other men and they crowded around recoiling at the fetid decaying odor that belched from the depths mercer shut down the drill and signaled to a man above to silence the generators in moments the shaft was filled with excited voices as those workers not otherwise engaged clambered to look into the darkness you did it selome shrieked and threw her arms around mercers shoulders her passionate kiss brought a round of cheering from the workers and a delighted smile to mercer little early for the champagne he warned theres something i forgot and it may already be too late cave disease cave disease whats that cryptococcus its a fungus that lives in undisturbed areas like caves and abandoned mines once inhaled it germinates in the lungs and can cause fatal meningitis if not treated quickly the main tunnel was safe because hofmyer vented it before sending in workers but this other mine may be rife with the stuff mercer paused assessing the odds weve already breathed the air blowing out of the hole and we dont have a choice but to continue is there a cure yeah um amphotericin and flourocytosine i think but we dont have time to worry about that now gianelli should be working on the blast mat and we have to get everyone into the original mine and hide every trace that we were ever here mercer then added with a fiendish grin and that includes the safe full of diamonds another twenty minutes and they were ready to abandon the chamber mercer had rigged a coffer dam above the pit that led to the old mine and loaded it with tons of rubble he configured it so its contents could be dumped into the shaft after they had escaped through the hole in its bottom he also ordered the destruction of the remaining mining equipment and scrawled a personal greeting to gianelli and hofmyer for their arrival dropping the safe into the hole widened it enough for the men to begin lowering themselves into the cramped tunnels below mercer considered leaving du toit and the sudanese behind but they would give away the escape route the instant gianelli reached the chamber he couldnt bring himself to murder them they were prisoners and deserved some sort of fair treatment he made sure they were securely bound and well guarded before allowing them into the tunnel he was the last one to descend into the childrens mine dragging the lanyard that would breach the coffer dam behind him once in the cramped tunnel he moved away from the hole connecting the two mines when he judged he was far enough he yanked the line and held his breath as debris filled the pit above them unless hofmyer possessed a photographic memory he would never know the pit had been filled or how mercer had taken his people out of the main chamber it was only after the last of the rubble settled that he took a moment to investigate their surroundings in the beam of his flashlight the tunnel was only three feet tall and maybe as wide circular rather than squared all the surfaces were rough showing the marks where they had been worked by primitive stone tools the air was just rich enough to breathe but it was a struggle in the few moments since the tunnel had been sealed the air was starting to foul mercer realized he had to string out the forty men with him if he was to avoid depleting the oxygen in one section yet he couldnt have them too far apart for fear of losing someone from where he sat he could see three branch tunnels meandering off one to left one to right and one rising up and over this one the claustrophobic tunnels reminded him of pictures hed seen of the myriad branches in a human lung or the den of some burrowing rodent a man could become hopelessly lost after only a few feet he crawled over the supine men until he had reached the front of the group passing the sudanese guards oblivious to their wrathful stares selome waited for him with her own flashlight they had only two others but these lights were powered by hand crank mechanisms that required no batteries so there wasnt any danger of them dying still the tunnel was so dim that it was impossible to see beyond just a couple of yards what now fearless leader selome asked her pride in mercer evident in her eyes and smile mercers kit bag bulged with items he thought he might need for the ordeal to come he dug out one of the lighters he sparked the wheel and watched the flame until the metal top was too hot to touch the flame remained in a solid column not flickering in the slightest no air movement but that doesnt mean we wont find some it just means we are too far back to feel it what i want to do is find a place to leave everyone behind a chamber like the children would have used as a dormitory chances are it will be situated near a natural air vent and then you and i find the way out of here well be able to move a lot faster if we dont have to worry about stragglers and our prisoners mercer glanced back into the darkness listening to the coughing fits of the men the air was rank now you know why i didnt want habte with us as much as he smokes he wouldnt last five minutes in here by the time we get out he should have reached dick henna and a couple hundred marines will have landed taking care of our former italian slave master and then we come back for the rest of the miners you got it they started out mercer in the lead with selome right behind they followed the erratic beam of his flashlight as he crawled through the serpentine tunnels on his hands and knees after an hour all of them were feeling the effects of the dust their motion kicked up and the tunnel echoed like a tuberculosis ward the eritreans were drinking water at a prodigious rate to salve their burned throats mercer was becoming concerned they needed to find a small chink in the earths armor that allowed a seep of air to reach the dark maze another two hours of uninterrupted agony followed as the party oozed through the warren with wormlike slowness every few hundred yards mercer would test the air for movement but each time the lighters flame held steady he studied the medusa pictures at many of the major junctures their resolution was so poor that the lines on the photos did not correspond with the threedimensional map he was creating in his mind after the fourth frustrating time he angrily tucked them back in his bag their only hope lay with mercers instincts and his intimate knowledge of mines and mining he was the only one who could navigate this subterranean realm ignoring large branches and side tunnels that might have tempted another and leading them through tiny crawl spaces that someone else would have ignored they were well into their fourth hour when mercer sparked his lighter again the small flames swayed away from him its movement so slight that had he not been staring he never would have noticed it selome saw the expression on his face and grinned i think were going to be okay he said the chamber they found fifteen minutes later was about twenty feet square and while the quarters were cramped everyone fit mercer noted that the cavity was a natural formation one that the child miners had discovered and exploited for themselves it was like a warm womb deep underground a sanctuary from the agonizing labor they endured until their young lives ended in the darkness the ceiling of the cave was about six feet tall and was scarred with hundreds of cracks through one of these fissures and through a labyrinthine twist in the living rock a trickle of air descended into the earth freshening the atmosphere after the foul odor of the tunnels the air in the chamber was sweet and joyously refreshing selome settled against mercers chest as he lay against one wall taking a much needed break the men were tangled around them like a litter of exhausted puppies too tired to sort themselves out many minutes would pass before the last coughing spell ended with a wet expectoration of blood its all downhill from here mercer said you mean it gets easier no mercer shook his head weve been climbing toward the surface for the past hour so these tunnels will have to slope downward again if were going to find an exit we can use okay mister selome looked at him with mock severity youve been giving cryptic answers and telling only half the story since we entered the mine and every time you pull some trick out of your hat so whats your trick this time mercer laughed found me out did you yes i have another trick remember when we first entered the mine after gianelli caught us at the monastery i said i was looking for an escape route selome nodded i noticed a section of wall a hundred feet from the surface that looked as if it had been rebuilt the stone was a shade lighter than the blocks used to line the rest of the tunnel im betting our lives that theres another tunnel behind it that had been covered over hidden you think these old mine shafts lead to it he nodded but if they dont we are seriously screwed they rested for another half hour before mercer decided that if he delayed any longer hed be too stiff to continue he roused selome and spoke with the gang leaders again asking her to translate he laid out his plan and the eritreans agreed their faith in his abilities was an inspiration for mercer but also a burden first it was harrys life which depended on what he did then selomes and habtes and now hed added forty more people plus the others still in the slave compounds he cleared his mind of creeping defeatism it was much too late to doubt his decisions even if he led them into a possible and quite literal dead end are you ready mercer asked have i ever said no thats my girl they started out of the chamber exiting through one of the larger tunnels in only a few seconds they could no longer see the glow from the two flashlights theyd left with the eritreans the beam of their own single light seemed puny in the mounting blackness of the unnatural maze and as mercer crawled ahead of selome the single ak hed taken with him seemed just as ineffective if they managed to reach the surface and had to face gianelli again mahdi had bided his time he was not a patient man and the quiet waiting had been frustrating but now it was all about to pay off he lay with the three other sudanese soldiers men who had been under his command for years men who would kill or die for him just having him with them had given his troops the necessary discipline to wait out the american and his eritrean whore lying amid the stinking pile of humanity mahdi congratulated himself for getting this far of course it was pure chance hed been in the mine talking with his troops when mercer appeared he was the soldier to drop his weapon first sensing that even with superior firepower mercer had taken the tactical advantage by holding the white miner when he saw the whore appear a moment later her own weapon leveled mahdi knew hed made the correct choice another element of chance at work tonight was the large bandage that swathed the upper half of his face and dressed his right cheek hed been practicing fighting moves against one of his lieutenants with unsheathed knives as was their habit when the soldier slipped and the blade slashed mahdis face the wound would heal nicely adding a new scar to the older wounds marring his body the bandage his medic had applied hid enough of his features to prevent anyone from recognizing him and since neither mercer nor the eritreans had looked too closely they hadnt realized their prisoner was the commander of the sudanese guard detail mahdi had allowed himself to be taken cowed like the rest of his men and shepherded along with this suicide mission for no other reason than to see mercer choke to death on his tongue when there was the chance to cut it out and feed it to him maybe hed have a piece of the whore before he killed her too he smiled in the dark chamber a tightening of his facial muscles that on a normal person would look like a grimace he wondered if he could work it so mercer was still alive when he stuck it to the eritrean slut but he doubted it better to just kill the american and then have his fun he needed to get after them first while it would be easy to track them in the dusty tunnels he didnt want them getting too far ahead waiting for more of the slave laborers to fall asleep mahdi used subtle hand signals to communicate with the other guards a secret code of gestures that theyd used countless times during the civil war in sudan mahdi ordered one of his men to sacrifice himself in a blatant escape attempt that would give him the opportunity to make a break for it hed considered trying to overpower their captors but the eritreans were armed with the guards aks a silent retreat would work the best and even if mahdi got out without one of the kalishnikovs he still carried a throwing knife in his boot waiting for the right moment he glanced at the boots and remembered the fat bald man who had once owned them that had been a boring hunt but a very satisfying kill he recalled hadnt his victim said he was an archeologist clever cover but mahdi had already been warned by gianelli that the man was searching for the lost mine mahdi knew now that the man need not have died he had been searching fifty miles from the mine but mahdi liked the boots when three quarters of the eritreans were asleep including one of the armed ones he decided that it was time mahdi showed his comrade the old cavalrymans signal of a closed fist and the waiting soldier gave a sharp nod charge the trooper didnt hesitate he leaped to his feet kicking sleeping miners as he rushed toward a side tunnel away from where mercer and selome had disappeared screaming unintelligible curses as he went mahdi too was in motion using the other sudanese as shields as he twisted away from the group blending himself into the darkness beyond the feeble glow of the single lit flashlight the eritreans came awake one of them taking aim in the gloom and gave the trigger a quick tap three red explosions appeared on the diversionary guerrillas back and he pitched forward his body collapsing against the wall next to the exit in the confusion mahdi rolled away from the group the rope binding his hands making it difficult to move but still he managed to grasp the spare light on his way out of the cavern he regained his feet and stumbled on the tunnel was so dark he walked with his eyes closed keeping his arms stretched to one side so he could brush along the wall after passing several side branches he ducked into another one and snapped on the light it took him only a moment to pluck the knife from his boot and cut through the hemp securing his wrists his men would destroy the other flashlight left with the eritreans in the melee following his escape so he was now immune from pursuit he and he alone was the hunter in this hellish world and mercer would never know what was coming if mercer thought the early part of their trek was torturous it was nothing compared to the past couple of hours it seemed he could do no wrong leading the miners to the fresh air chamber but since then hed led selome up two long blind alleys and had been forced to wriggle through areas that even the children whod dug these galleries would have trouble negotiating it was as though they were trapped in the body of some enormous creature not willing to give up its latest meal as they corkscrewed through the twisting intersections and aimless shafts mercer was beginning to think he would get them hopelessly lost so far their motion had created a trail in the dust but if they passed a spot that was clean it would be impossible to backtrack to where the eritreans waited finally they entered another tall cavern one that lacked fresh air but had been mined extensively the flashlights beam revealed a sight that would haunt him for the rest of his life unlike the bodies hed discovered in the italian mine these were not neatly laid out it appeared they had been left where they had died their poses were agonizing there were maybe a dozen of them desiccated mummies with skin stretched tightly over screams of pain the corpses were all of children the oldest not more than ten or twelve even in death their suffering transcended the millennia oh god selome gagged mercer said nothing he looked at the pitiable remains of the slave children trying to keep emotions from clouding his judgment by the ore piled around a couple of them he could see that work had continued without pause next to the bodies no attempts had been made to give the children any kind of burial they had been abandoned worked to death and left to rot where theyd died selome began praying still in shock mercer forced himself to make a closer examination of one of the bodies wanting to know the exact cause of death he didnt dare disturb the fragile corpse but from the areas he could study he saw no signs of injury no broken bones or blunt trauma the only bizarre feature was the unnatural curling of its hands arms and feet they were coiled so tightly they looked as if they had no bones in them at all mercer noted that the other bodies were all in similar positions what the hell could have done this he thought he noted the child still had its teeth so he discounted scurvy but rickets was a possible candidate then the clinical side of his brain shut down and he felt pity wash over him in tidal surges what did it matter how they died they were gone murdered by a nameless slave master long ago whod probably been rewarded for his efficiency mercer had to force himself to breathe he said a silent prayer for the children and when he raised his eyes and took note of the vein of ore theyd been working a sickening realization came to him he wanted to escape this macabre cave but the scientist in him had to be sure even if he knew the results could be a death sentence for him and selome she continued to pray as he crushed down a small sample of the ore left on the footwall he unclipped the protective steel casing off the boxy flashlight and poured a measure of the ore into it he ignored the coils of fuse in the bag and withdrew a stick of dynamite he worked the explosive until he could pour the powder onto the ground beneath the container only when he was finished did she notice his efforts and join him what are you doing an experiment he replied and selome recognized the fear in his voice he laid their full canteen onto the metal case so it acted as a lid do you remember what brother ephraim said about the children who worked the mine being killed by sin without a tight constraint the explosive burst into flame when he touched it off with his lighter illuminating the cavern in harsh white light when the fire burned out he tapped the canteen several times and stuck it back into his bag the reddish ore in his makeshift apparatus had darkened considerably he dumped it onto a jagged rock and waited it took just a few seconds for silvery beads to ooze out of the ore and pool on the ground next to him he wasnt warning us about sin with a s but sin with a c as in cinnabar also called red mercuric sulfide its the principal ore stone for raw mercury they both stared at the shimmering pool of liquid metal but isnt mercury one of the most toxic substances on the planet it can cripple paralyze or kill just by breathing its fumes thats what killed the children thats what going to kill us too if we dont get out of here its so deadly that miners who dig this stuff today only work eight days a month every second we delay can have permanent effects he was already leading selome down another tunnel is there anything we can do yeah sweat a lot believe it or not perspiration can cleanse the body of mercury if its not allowed to bond to the cell proteins after every shift miners spend time in a room called the beach to sweat out the toxins under powerful heat lamps the mine was stuffy and hot already so there wasnt a problem keeping their pores open but they only had that single canteen of water and when that ran out their bodies would no longer waste fluids on temperature control the mercury would then begin its absorption process and the consequences after that might be irreversible they encountered several more horror chambers as they wound through the mine one of them containing at least a hundred mummified victims mercer could see that many of the children had been exposed to mercury through their mothers when they were in the womb the poison had done terrible damage to their chromosomes and they suffered horrifying malformations some were barely recognizable as human somehow the kimberlite vent came up through a vein of mercuric sulfide ive never heard of a geologic feature like this but i can understand why they thought the ark of the covenant may have helped the children mercer said how even at the time the ark was brought to africa metallurgists knew that mercury bonded with gold i think they were hoping it would absorb the mercury vapor and stop its debilitating effects remember apart from any mythical properties it may have had the ark was covered with gold but this much mercury i didnt say it was a good idea they continued through more endless passages for another hour until selome had a disturbing thought mercer the tunnel leading to the working pit was about a mile and a half long and even at a slow crawl we must have covered five times that distance on our way back her voice was muffled by the tight passage as the walls soaked up the sound you noticed that too he replied im beginning to get a little concerned myself these tunnels were constructed through softer material to make the mining easier but it doesnt seem possible that theyd meander as badly as this im starting to think we may be in another dead end were lost she started to panic mercer stopped twisted around so he could see her with the flashlight her face was tigerstriped by beads of sweat cutting runnels through the dust caked to her skin he could see she was starting to lose confidence mercer cupped her chin in his palm there are two inevitabilities in life death and taxes you have my word that come next april youll be cutting a big check she forced bravery into her voice americans pay taxes in april im eritrean the next chamber they found was high enough for them to stand and unlike the others it was enormous their flashlight could penetrate only a fraction of the way across but by gauging the echoes mercer estimated the cavity was nearly the size of a football field he immediately recognized the mining technique used to excavate the space room and pillar mining called for huge spaces to be gouged into the ore while leaving support columns of undisturbed rock to hold up the hanging wall it was a common technique in coal mining but not very efficient in a diamond mine and he was surprised it had been used to work this kimberlite vein the pillars were so numerous it felt as if they were walking among the trunks of a dense petrified forest or in the eerie catacombs under an ancient cathedral he was stunned that the mine overseers had conceived and engineered the system as he led selome across the expanse over their heads the hanging wall was in terrible shape cracked and scored by the enormous pressure of the earth bearing down on it he guessed that in another hundred years or so the pillars would succumb to the strain and the entire room would collapse halfway to the other side of the room a shadow caught mercers eye and when he turned to investigate selome gave a startled scream and was thrown to the floor mercer was flattened by a rushing apparition that materialized out of the darkness his head cracked against the ground his mind spinning it was impossible that anything alive could be down here with them the mine had been sealed for thousands of years a vicious kick to his stomach pulled him back to reality it didnt matter who or what was with them they were about to be killed a knife glinted sharply in the beam of the flashlight that had flown from his stunned hands the ak lay out of reach beyond the penumbra the thing jumped on mercer as he lay stunned he managed to raise a hand and deflect the blade plunging at his chest he twisted his assailant enough for him to counter with a crushing punch the blow snapping a couple of short ribs rather than being slowed by the shot the attacker went wild striking mercer across the jaw with his elbow and the darkness of the cavern rushed into mercers brain he would have lost the fight right then had selome not leaped on the assailants back drawing him off mercer for a moment for her effort mercer saw her catch a savage punch in the face that sent her reeling her body falling like a deflated balloon he scrambled to find his assault rifle and the attacker was on him again this time sinking the knife into the fleshy part of mercers thigh screaming with the needlehot pain mercer torqued and backhanded the creature across the cheek to his horror he felt his hand sink into its putrid face and saw a chunk of flesh fly off the wound did nothing to deter the assault and mercer realized he really was fighting some demon who roamed the labyrinth he scrambled out of the monsters reach dodging around a pillar and into total darkness from his vantage point he could see the creature shuffling to the abandoned light the beam caught the apparition in the face and mercer recognized gianellis principal henchman the leader of the rebels mahdi he remembered one of the guards hed taken prisoner had worn a bandagethat was what hed wiped off mahdis face mercer had no time to consider how he had escaped the eritreans or managed to track them he knew mahdi would go for the ak next and he had to get to the gun first he concentrated on his exact position when mahdi had first hit him and the most logical direction the gun would have sailed a glint in the distance caught mercers attention but it was too far away to be the gun he struck out boldly his hands in front of him to avoid slamming into one of the stone columns in the darkness selome was still screaming as if she believed that some specter stalked these galleries both men spotted the weapon when it caught the lights beam mahdi had a shorter distance to run to reach it but mercers reactions were quicker and they both dove and got a hand on it at the same time mercer had a better grip on the ak and used it to twist the weapon away from the soldier mahdi kneed him viciously in the inside of his forearm and mercers entire hand went numb suddenly the gun was in mahdis control struggling under the mans weight and only able to use his bad arm to deflect the gloating sudanese mercer reached into the kit bag still slung around his shoulder hed planned to use the highspeed fuse in conjunction with the dynamite he carried if theyd needed to blast any obstacles that got in their way but now it had a more urgent purpose mahdi either didnt notice or didnt care as mercer dropped the twohundredfoot coil of fuse over his head the rebel was laughing knowing he had the advantage but when he spied a tiny flame shooting from the zippo in mercers fingers his eyes went wide with terror in those last seconds he understood what mercer had looped over him the fuse burned at twentytwo thousand feet per second so the entire coil cooked off faster than the eye could see even under its protective coating the temperature of the burning chemicals skyrocketed the smell was almost as bad as the screech when the veins in mahdis throat burst under the pressure of his blood turning to steam his flesh roasted like a joint of meat mahdis finger tightened on the aks trigger even as his eyes rolled back into his skull a full clip arrowed into the ceiling ricocheting and filling the chamber with deadly lead the crashing shots and the echoes weakened a section of the scaly hanging wall and a fiftyton slab of stone crashed to the floor a short distance away followed seconds later by several more the whole ceiling was giving way mercer rolled out from under the struggling terrorist grabbed up the assault rifle by its hot barrel and grasped the flashlight in his other hand more stones let go huge chunks whose impact loosened even more of the ceiling in a domino effect it was as if the earth had come alive and they were caught in its jaws with the weight shifting its balance one of the pillars exploded like a bomb crushed beyond its structural tolerance hurtling rock like grapeshot mercer heaved selome off the floor as if she was no more than a child as more debris rained around them they ducked into a side tunnel he took just a second to look back and watched a slab of rock larger than an automobile land squarely on mahdi as he writhed with the pain of his burned neck the weight of the stone forced the contents of his torso toward his head but they could not erupt through the cranium mercer saw mahdis throat expand like that of a bull frogs until the entire bulbous mass exploded in a red mist and the body lay still he trained the light to the far end of the gallery where he had seen the distant glint just before his view was obliterated by the crumbling chamber he watched an eerie blue light radiate from the gloom burning brighter and brighter until a chunk of stone crashed right in front of him sealing the room forever the side tunnels roof was lower than most of the others theyd encountered and mercer had to ease selome to the ground and coax her to follow as more of the chamber behind them collapsed huge clouds of dust blew into the tunnel enveloping them choking them until they could no longer open their eyes and every breath was torture and still more of the room fell a roaring sound that filled their world and threatened to tear away their sanity they scrambled from it ripping skin from their hands and knees as this tunnel began to fill with debris they covered fifty yards before the cavein ended the sudden silence left their ears ringing looking back the way theyd come mercer saw that they were cut off from the others by untold billions of tons of earth even if they had wanted to there was no way they would ever be able to return what the hell was that glow the blue light had to be a static discharge he thought when rock is crushed it can give off a small amount of electricity given the amount of moving stone the phenomenon could easily explain what hed seen or maybe it was a pocket of methane catching fire after being ignited by a spark he had several other naturally occurring explanations but deep in the back of his mind he knew there was also an unnatural one no it couldnt be what happened in there mahdi suffered a crushing defeat mercer rasped waiting for selome to take a drink from their canteen he wanted to give her time to recover before telling her that this tunnel went in the opposite direction from where they wanted to go there was no way he was going to tell her what else hed seen you have no idea what i was thinking in there when he attacked us selome replied wiping her lips against the delicate bones on the back of her hand cant be any weirder than what was going through my mind mercer agreed are you okay my jaw hurts and im sure itll be black and blue in a few hours but im fine you mercer removed his pants and began working on the knife wound in his leg he didnt waste any of their precious water cleaning the gash but slapped a fragment of his shirt over the incision and secured it with a strips of silvery duct tape from his bag dr mercers antiseptic surgery secondary infections are our specialty is it bad nothing major was hit mercer said then added with dark humor and itll stiffen long before we get to see your black and blues the dust was still too thick to rest this close to the cavein so mercer donned his pants and they started out of the area particles lay heavily in the air and the powerful light could cut only a feeble swath through it after a further hundred yards the tunnel had shrunk in diameter so that their backs scraped the ceiling as they crawled still they were dogged by chocking clouds of grit this may take a while to settle mercer gagged each time he opened his mouth and his nose felt scored by acid they were forced to lower themselves even more as the tunnel continued to shrink in moments the shoulders of mercers shirt were ripped through and the abraded skin began to bleed without choice or option they continued using their elbows and toes to propel themselves forward mercer whats happening selome cried i dont know the tunnel was no larger than a coffin just wide enough for them to squirm on their bellies and in the murky light mercer could see its diameter constricting even further for the first time he considered that this tunnel might pinch out into solid rock as if reading his thoughts selome called his name again her voice teetering on the edge of hysteria i know i know it was becoming tougher for him to move hed taken off his kit bag a while back and pushed it and the ak ahead of him he had to twist and struggle to gain every inch for a while the tunnel remained the same size neither growing or shrinking but their progress was cut to a snails pace rock encircled mercer completely not one section of his body was out of contact with its jagged embrace the tunnel walls were pure bloodred mercury ore in a few places raw mercury had worked itself from the ceiling and dripped into little hollows and troughs on the floor how long did you say we could stay in here im not sure the light revealed a stretch of tunnel glittering with hundreds of tiny pools of quicksilver remember mercury can be absorbed through the skin so dont let it touch any open wounds you might have my entire body is an open wound they made it through the severely contaminated section and started down a gentle slope mercer could see where the mercury had cut canals in the floor as it flowed downhill his coughing fits were becoming less frequent but their severity was punishing unlike selome who had a little room between her body and the tunnel walls mercer was so constricted that every cough seemed stillborn in his chest exploding within his body without finding a proper outlet he had to prepare himself for the pain when he felt one coming already he could taste the coppery salt of blood in his mouth from ruptured lung tissue mercer jammed fighting panic he rolled his shoulders and tried to work them forward but the more he struggled the more it seemed the walls tightened around him like the remorseless coils of a python the tunnel floor was compacted dirt and he tried to tear into it with his hands but it was as hard as cement and left his fingers bleeding selome saw his frantic movements and slid back to avoid his flailing feet whats happening im afraid im stuck what do you mean stuck i mean i cant move i cant go back and i cant go forward well try in the confines of the tunnel her voice was muted dead like she was speaking from the other side of a wall and you think ive been lying here taking a nap mercer snapped but he couldnt draw a deep enough breath to give force to his words he felt like he was drowning im sorry selome said what do you want me to do grab my feet and pull as hard as you can he needed to breathe he wanted to scream the rock wouldnt let him it took five minutes to pull him back enough for him to gain some working room mercer calmed again but he could feel panic clawing at the back of his thoughts his shoulders and back were flecked with blood now we go back again but that way is blocked by the cavein not that far back we need to find a place where you can crawl over me and take the lead i think you will be able to squeeze through what about you well burn that bridge after we cross it it took two hours of slithering backward for them to find an area with enough ceiling height for selome to crawl over him when she was lying on his back she rested her head against his neck for a moment her breath in his ear god be careful mercer cried i dont have the room in here to get an erection with selome leading the way they slowly returned to the area where mercer had gotten stuck what happens now you keep going take the light and the gun and try to find a way out of here mercer sounded emotionless when he spoke but was glad that she couldnt see his face panic was a reaction to the unfamiliar he told himself but this time he had no experience to give him the confidence to keep from losing his grip with the rational i cant you dont have a choice even as he knew he might not escape alive he thought about the others there are forty trapped miners waiting to be rescued and if we both die right here they die too i dont care about them dammit i care about you she was sobbing mercer reached out and stroked her ankle pulling down her sock so he could touch her smooth skin and i care about you too but unless you get moving and find some help ill never be able to take you on a sexfilled vacation in some exotic place is that a promise i havent let you down yet mercer felt another racking cough coming the last words came out in a painful gasp i cant leave you her cry made him wince he didnt want to die alone but he hardened himself pushing aside his own needs he struggled to regain his breath and purged his mouth of more blood just go you have to find a way out of here i cant have your death as the last thing on my conscience you cant do that to me she sniffed back tears what about the canteen and the flashlight take them philip i think that i he could hear her struggling with the words and her own feelings and before she committed herself she changed her mind i think that we should go to egypt maybe a nile cruise ive always wanted to see the ancient monuments ill call my travel agent when youre gone selome slithered away vanishing from sight after a couple of yards mercer could see that a few impossible feet in front of him the tunnel tantalizingly widened the rock held him tighter than a straitjacket and he struggled between panic and frustration hed never suffered claustrophobia but he felt its icy tentacles reaching for him grabbing him around every inch of his body and squeezing until his lungs convulsed he drew shallow gulps of air so fouled with dust that he retched he was alone shrouded in a darkness worse than death he tried to wriggle forward but became more tightly trapped the tunnel pressing him from all sides holding him in a grip it would never relinquish the blackness was so complete he could taste it as it filled his mouth and smell it as it invaded his lungs his skin crawled with the silence of his tomb his mind screamed for release from this prison to move just a fraction of an inch he could barely swivel his head and when he did crumbly mercury ore scraped off the ceiling more poisonous dust for him to draw into his body okay well this is interesting isnt it it would only take a few days before his words became the ravings of a madman as he fought against the darkness and the silence and the isolation of his death another spasm of coughing took him his chest was unable to expand properly and the internal pressure threatened to shatter his ribs like glass he wondered if pneumonia would develop and kill him before the mercury he was breathing destroyed his motor control and rotted his brain he remembered that the beginning stage of mercury poisoning was a tremor in the extremities and he couldnt tell if the quiver in his legs was real or imagined rather than dwell on the inevitable he let his mind drift to the blue glow what if he hadnt seen a static discharge or a methane explosion what if it really was the ark now crushed beyond recovery ive got the rest of my life to figure it out washington dc dick henna broke years of training when he made that call since the early days of their marriage fay had worked tirelessly to get a little culture into her workaholic husbands life she had started out easy on him the occasional foreign film or ethnic restaurant and over time she had him going to musicals and actually enjoying the opera her only major setback had been a tooearly introduction to ballet that had soured him forever but the night he made the call to mercers phone shed crossed another invisible line it wasnt that he didnt care about the plight of tibet but two hours of gongs and chanting and dance moves he couldnt identify by the tibetan national troupe were just too much hed mumbled an apology to fay about needing the rest room and slid from the box at the kennedy center dodging out of the huge theater and into the redcarpeted lobby his secret service escorts seemed equally relieved at their temporary escape from the performance next to the bronze bust of the late president kennedy which to him was the ugliest statue hed ever seen he snapped open his cell phone and dialed mercer for the hundredth time in the past weeks it was a fruitless gesture he knew but he hadnt had word from his friend and state department reports about violence in asmara had him concerned he was about to cut the connection after the fifth ring when an unfamiliar voice answered in accented english hello you have reached the phone of philip mercer hes been buried alive may i help you my name is habte makkonen their fifteenminute conversation cut short hennas concert he sent an agent back to his seat to apologize to fay like just about every other husband in the country he figured hed spend his retirement making up to his wife for the years of broken promises the phone in his limo was more secure than his cell phone and the attached scrambler had the latest in encryption software he was on it for the entire drive to the pentagon after alerting marge doyle he called the pentagon and had them track down c thomas morrison the limo reached the department of defenses sprawling headquarters just as admiral morrison was located evening dick howre you doing the joint chiefs chairman asked jovially ive got a present for you but youre going to have to unwrap it henna replied where are you right now home my sons in town looking at colleges for his daughter she wants howard because its a black school and he wants her at georgetown because of its reputation tell them theyre going to have to thumb through the catalogs without you im at the pentagon and youre going to want to be here too whats happening i found your medusa photographs and were going to need some firepower to get them back admiral morrisons voice went serious the instant he heard the word medusa say no more im putting on my shoes right now i should be there in half an hour leave it to a military man to know the exact time of his commute no matter what the traffic situation twentynine minutes later morrison strode through the entry doors closest to his ering suite of offices two uniformed aides pacing behind him in an arrowhead formation he and henna shook hands and strode to the elevators arriving at morrisons office just an hour after habtes call that hour was the longest delay in the chain of events to follow henna quickly outlined his conversation with habte and the circumstances surrounding it northern eritrea huh morrison studied the world map behind his desk he chuckled isnt that a coincidence since our last conversation a detachment of force recon marines found themselves rotated to an amphibious assault ship off the coast of somalia there are two hundred soldiers on that ship whod been planning a pieceofcake tour in italy and are mighty pissed off at their new deployment i bet theyd love to vent some of that anger hennas reply had the same mocking tone coincidences are compounding as we speak i called lloyd easton at the state department while i was waiting for you right now hes convincing the president of eritrea that an american training exercise in his country would be in his best interests what about authorization from the president as soon as were done here ill contact him in light of our conversation with israels prime minister hes been expecting that something like this might happen hell be astounded when he hears gianelli is involved marge pulled his file for me when i was in my limo and it must be a foot thick interpol has never been able to directly link him to anything illegal but if were quick here well nail the bastard to the wall itll be a feather in the presidents cap during the next g summit if we can haul him into a courtroom as long as the political ends covered ill handle the military side itll take some time to get this ball rolling morrison snatched up a phone and ordered a call put through to the national security agency and the national reconnaissance office he offered henna a zeppelinsized cohiba when he finished were going to need some photo intelligence of the area and the marines are going to need some prep time ive got to call habte makkonen back and give him a time line what do you think six hours minimum and even thats pushing it too hard not from where mercers sitting henna said through a cloud of fragrant cigar smoke the phone rang and morrison spoke with the duty officer at the nro theres a civilian on the ground reporting a heavy cloud cover in the area but theres a lot of machinery working at the site if you cant get clear pictures switch to ir and well find the bastards by their heat signature he clamped his hand over the mouthpiece and spoke to henna this is going to take a while if you want use the phone on my secretarys desk to brief the old man and reach makkonen tell him what to expect and to get his butt under cover when the marines hit the mine henna left morrison coordinating satellite coverage and planted himself at a desk in the outer office he figured he could afford a little time so he placed a call he felt was equally important hed personally met the plane carrying harry white from israel at dulles driving into the city with the octogenarian and seeing him ensconced at an fbi safe house until the situation settled true to his word harry was stone sober and didnt complain through the subsequent hours of questioning it wasnt until after hennas agents had finished that harry demanded to know what had happened to mercer his glare had spoken volumes when henna admitted that they had no idea where he was or what had happened to him hello harry its dick henna weve found mercer harry heard hennas declaration but it took a few seconds for him to absorb it you really found him he asked at last hes at an abandoned mine in eritrea hes okay no hes not harry snapped hes in deep shit or you wouldnt be calling me he would harry really hes all right ive been more than cooperative with you the least you can do is be honest with me what the hell is really going on henna couldnt fathom how harry knew he was lying it was just one of those things part of that bond that mercer and harry shared he blew out a breath okay youre right im sorry he is in eritrea but hes the prisoner of a group of sudanese rebels whore working for an italian industrialist whos a known criminal from what we know so far hes buried himself in the mine with some eritrean refugees as a way to buy us some time to get marines into the area and and what do you have marines going in im at the pentagon right now with the chairman of the joint chiefs harry were moving heaven and earth to get him back hes pulled your asses from the fire a couple of times now you had goddamned better move a lot more than that or so help me christ by the end of the week ill be on every talk show in the country harry im not fooling around you get mercer back or you can kiss your job and this administration goodbye i know enough to bury all of you jesus harry it doesnt need to come to that i know it doesnt because youll rescue him end of discussion seven and a half hours later a swarm of uh blackhawk helicopters thundered into eritrean airspace the marines on board eager for a good fight king solomons mine at first it wasnt a noisemerely the absence of the allconsuming silence mercer strained to listen his ears ringing with the effort and his eyes watering as he stared into the sable blackness there a tiny sound existing only in the deepest level of his consciousness a hissing like a gentle whisper he tried to shout but his mouth was cemented closed by his thirst and he could manage only a hoarse croak time might have passed he had no way to tell but he was sure that the mysterious hiss was growing louder he wouldnt let himself hope he couldnt do that if he was wrong then he saw a light just a muted flicker to him it was like a blinding star burst he drank it in his eyes streaming with the joyous pain of it hello he rasped hello yourself selome called cheerily from a short distance away ill be with you in just a few minutes what are you doing mercers question was too quiet for her to hear so there was no response it took ten more minutes but he didnt care selome was coming for him the tears behind his eyes were no longer caused by the light as he waited in his stone cocoon he had a thought that tempered his joy hed given up on himself hed actually believed that he was going to die hed never ever been one to quit until the very end but this time hed really thought he was finished even as he was about to be rescued he was furious with himself and even worse disappointed mercer suddenly felt the dirt beneath him begin to shift the constricting pressure against his chest slackened he could hear selome more clearly now she was digging furiously using some sort of heavy spade and with every slash into the dirt ahead of him mercer felt the tunnel floor sink a fraction of an inch when he tried to wriggle he gained ground his shoulders scraping against the walls his back no longer squashed to the ceiling then in a rush like childbirth he was free sliding forward dangerously fast gaining speed as the slope steepened and the ceiling vanished above him he started to tumble caught in a cascade of loose soil and rocks that scored his eyes and nose and jammed solidly into his ears he banged against the walls as he fell wanting to cry out at the agony of a smashed shin but there was so much dirt boiling around him that if he opened his mouth he would suffocate then his headlong plunge stopped and he lay still as more rubble poured over him the weight of it increasing with every second he was about to black out when the dirt blanketing his body was thrust aside he felt a hand grasp his belt and shake him dirt flew like water from a spaniel and he could breathe again he cleared the filth from his eyes and peered around his first sight was of selome standing over him i should dig for buried treasure more often its amazing what a girl can find she looked radiant even in the glimmer from the flashlight gold doubloon im not he couldnt believe how good it felt to be sore it meant he was still alive he swayed to his feet reaching to brush a tendril of hair from selomes face i didnt think you were coming back his voice was thick he wanted to tell her what had happened when she left him alone but he couldnt what he felt went beyond words he simply stepped into her embrace soaking up the heat of her body thank you there was just enough amber incandescence from the flashlight for him to visually explore the chamber they occupied and to understand how she had gotten him out of his tomb the gallery was roughly rectangular and at least thirty feet tall with a shallow alcove at one end its walls had been covered with blocks of dressed stone mercer recognized the stones used in the closetsized niche he had seen them before they were the same type as those lining the main tunnel from the surface this room had been a staging area a link between the direct path to the kimberlite ore beds and the older more meandering tunnels behind him a towering pile of dirt reached almost to the ceiling at its summit he saw the tiny round hole that led to the rest of the old mine and had held him prisoner for so long when the new straighter drift had been driven into the mountain the workers must have backfilled the passageway to the room and pillar mine chamber in the thousands of years since then the fill had settled enough for mercer to crawl almost to the point where it emptied into this room of course selome had recognized that if she dug into the base of the mountain of dirt it would collapse into the room and free him im sorry it took so long but when i fell into this chamber i cracked my head against the floor and blacked out there was an angry bruise above her left eye you wont hear me complaining mercer gulped half the remaining water from their canteen and examined the shovel selome had used to loosen his earthen constraints its a shame you had to use that its a beautiful example of a bronzeaged tool then im glad youre not an archaeologist i ruined about five of these things getting you out there was a collection of primitive tools in one corner of the room picks and shovels some scaled for an adults use other miniature versions for the child slaves next to them sat rotted piles of leather that had been buckets and water flasks a little bit off lay stacks of clay lamps we can bemoan lost artifacts later mercer said right now i want to get us out of here and take care of some business he rigged the stones blocking the alcove exit with explosives from his kit bag careful to use just enough to take down a section of the wall and not blow it apart he had no idea what was happening in the main tunnel beyond the barrier and didnt want to advertise his presence until he was ready what about fuse didnt you use it against mahdi mercer plucked another coil from his bag and snipped off a length second rule of hard rock mining you can never have enough fuse whats the first rule mercer held up more dynamite you can never have enough explosives the fuse was much slower than the one hed used to disable mahdi so they had plenty of time to make it to the trench redoubt hed dug with selomes help he covered his head with one arm keeping his body over selome when the charge blew the concussion pelted them with debris he looked up and blinked the wall hadnt crumbled but there was a threefoot crawl space at its bottom and light from the outside spilled into the chamber neither of them had ever thought they would see sunshine again and they embraced in its comforting aura now lets see this put to an end mercer slung his bag over his shoulder snatched up the ak and led selome into the tunnel the echoing sounds of a gun battle reverberated down the length of the shaft stray tracer rounds winking by mercer quickly shoved selome back into the chamber stay here and dont move until i come for you you just saved my life now its my turn he stepped out keeping low to the footwall the ak at the ready mercer couldnt tell who was using the mine as a cover position so he started crawling forward as more rounds streaked over his head his eyes adjusted to the sunlight filling the shaft but the haze of cordite smoke was nearly blinding and he had to get close to recognize the men firing out toward the camp they were sudanese soldiers habte must have made the call because he guessed the return fire ricocheting down the drive was from the marines the rebels held an unassailable position against the american soldiers as long as they had ammunition unless a rocket launcher was used there was no way to dislodge them the marines surely knew habtes warning to henna about the trapped miners so explosives were not an option remembering mahdis sneak attack in the mine and the brutal raping that had taken place outside the womens stockade mercer felt nothing as he brought the ak to his shoulder with controlled double taps on semiautomatic he shot four sudanese in the back and the remaining two in the chest when they whirled to face the threat that had come unexpectedly from behind he scrambled up to their barricade and searched frantically for something white to wave at the marines still pouring rounds into the tunnel entrance he had to make do with the wellused handkerchief he found in the pocket of one of the dead man a second after waving it over the barricade he heard a command in english to hold fire he stood dont shoot im an american dr mercer a texas drawl asked over the din of a continuing battle farther from the mine yeah im mercer the euphoria he should be feeling had been suppressed by his desire to make the sudanese and especially gianelli suffer for what had happened in the past weeks ive got a woman with me and there are forty miners still trapped in here he looked to where he thought the marines had taken cover but he couldnt see them there were too many places to hide on the desert floorbehind the scattered equipment boxes or near some of the heavy equipment that hadnt been damaged during the battle or behind one of the countless piles of dirt excavated from the mine yall have to hold tight for a spell longer this is one hot lz the soldiers comment was drowned by the thundering rotors of an ah apache gunship as it crabbed across the desert its chin gun pouring a steady stream of mm rounds into the far side of the camp mercer spotted the cluster of force recon marines huddled next to an overturned and still burning d bulldozer the soldier in charge saw him waved in acknowledgment and led his squad across the camp mercer drained the contents of two sudanese canteens and when the marines were out of sight he bolted from the mine jinxing around toppled lighting towers and mountains of overburden though the rain had stopped the sky was thick with clouds the heat and humidity made his dash slow and his bruised chest protested every breath the knife wound in his leg was a sharp throb suddenly the sky directly overhead exploded a pressure wave of air slammed him to the earth the concussion blasting against his eardrums he rolled to his back and began scrabbling across the ground two hundred feet above him the flaming carapace of the apache gyrated out of control streamers of greasy smoke belching from its engine its tail rotor assembly coming apart like a shrapnel bomb one of the rebels had fired a surfacetoair missile into the helo and scored a direct hit the gunship crashed close enough to throw mercer again fiery sheets of aviation fuel raining around him but incredibly none landed on his clothes or skin when he stood the ribs that had first taken a pounding under hofmyers fists and later by mahdi and the tunnel walls had finally given out he felt a sharp stab of pain that reached all the way to his heart and the agony of the broken bones forced him to his knees he had taken so much physical abuse that he wondered just what he hoped to accomplish the marines were here they would handle the rebels he was putting his life in danger for absolutely no reason deciding that maybe it was best to wait this one out he was searching for a good place to hole up when bullets kicked up erratic fountains of dirt at his feet clutching his ribs with one arm mercer ran as best he could reaching cover behind a big portable generator he squinted into the haze created by the dozens of smoke grenades their clouds of smog cutting visibility to almost nothing he didnt see who had opened up on him but spotted a sudanese ambush set up for a squad of patrolling marines the american soldiers were alert and moved well but they were about to be diced in a surprise crossfire the ak bucked in his hands stitching two of the guerrillas and then the clip ran empty mercer fumbled to slam home a fresh one dodging to the other side of the mobile generator as rounds pinged off its metal hide the marines dropped to the ground entering the melee and killing three more sudanese mercer was joined a second later by the four young americans thanks pal the leader of the patrol wheezed slumping against the ingersollrand my pleasure cant tell you how glad i am to see you youre mercer right yeah we were briefed to look for you when we landed but werent you buried or something i was until about ten minutes go mercer took a protein bar the latino corporal offered and devoured it in three bites whats the situation shit you know more than we do briefing said about fifty armed troops guarding this camp with minimum equipment and arms bastards capped an apache just a minute ago with a portable sam and there seem to be a lot more than fifty the numbers about right mercer countered but these guys have been fighting for years in the sudan theyve got combat experience to spare and their former commander was one mean son of a bitch yeah well anyway weve taken heavy losses if it werent for all the civilians mixed up with the bad guys the captain wouldve called in some close air support and bombed the shit out of this place any chance for a continued conversation was shattered by a chain of detonations at the fuel tank farm the eruptions of flame and smoke towered into the leaden sky building and blooming like deadly flowers the ground shook so hard that mercer felt his teeth were going to loosen from his jaw as he was recovering the marine seated on the far side of the corporal jumped spastically and the paintwork of the generator behind him splattered with clots of blood and the back of his skull the marines reacted even before they knew where the shot had originated sending out a scathing return fire and racing from their cover mercer had no choice but to follow he ran in a doubledup position aiming the ak behind his hip and unleashing a fusillade of his own they slogged up a mound of overburden the soldiers slowed by the pounds of equipment each carried and mercer by his own condition another shot blew a geyser of dirt just an inch to the left of mercers shoulder grit lashing his face as he clawed his way to the summit in the protection of the artificial hills flat peak he realized just who was shooting at them and why the israeli team was still here the two shots were so accurate that they could only come from a sniper rifle they were either firing to add to the confusion so they could slip into the mine or they were planning on an evacuation and wanted to keep the combatants occupied while they escaped for mercer both options were unacceptable chancing a look over the parapet of their earthen fortress he could survey the entire camp and the clusters of men fighting below it looked as if the sudaneses numbers were greatly diminished he could see a few holdouts near gianellis big transporters in the distance there were figures running away from the battle but he guessed they were eritreans of the bodies he could see littering the ground that werent dressed in american desert bdus two were white but from this range he couldnt tell if either was gianelli say again the corporal was shouting into the radio built into his combat helmet roger that sky eyes keep us posted whats happening mercer clipped his last banana magazine into the well of the ak awacs plane circling off the coast reports a lowlevel contact about six klicks east of here and moving in at a hundred miles an hour shit what is it theres a team of israelis in the area theyve been after this mine for a while but i think theyre cutting their losses and bugging out well theyre going to make it the marine said not really interested in another enemy with his hands so full of sudanese we dont have any more gunships to go after it and if that awacs only now just spotted it you can believe itll disappear just as easily mercer knew the soldier was right flying nap of the earth a good chopper pilot could evade even the most sophisticated airborne radar systems he got an idea howd you guys get here blackhawks there are a half dozen of them on the ground about ten miles north we hoofed it the rest of the way in can you radio for one to pick us up yeah but it wont do any good those birds are just troop ships no guns just get one well be the firepower mercer tapped the corporals ma with the butt of his ak the corporal switched the channel on his radio captain saunders this is chavez im with mercer he says the bogey sky eyes just painted is an evac chopper for some uglies i want permission to go after it in a blackhawk he paused his gaze on mercer yes sir i know were on top of a hill and it looks like things are dying down in our sector yes sir ill keep an eye on him no sir ill ask him dr mercer where are the rest of the eritrean nationals still trapped in the mine theres a woman in the main tunnel who knows exactly where they are the soldier nodded and activated his mike again in the mine sir yes sir were standing by well the captains calling a chopper well pop some green smoke when the bird gets here were going to drop you at our staging area and go after the israelis ourselves its not my place to ask but what kind of international situation are we getting ourselves into here think of the deepest pile of shit you can imagine and then double it mercer grunted only bright spot is were the good guys for a change the soldier carrying the heavy squad automatic weapon spotted a target and ripped off about fifteen rounds empty brass arcing from the mm in a tight necklace chavez and the other marine scanned the camp for more targets but only indistinct shapes moved in the smoke and they couldnt chance a friendlyfire kill whadya have moose two of them with aks at ten oclock moving clockways theyre behind that tenwheel truck keep em pinned corporal chavez ordered moose gave the saws trigger another long pull but watch your ammo discipline how long till the chopper gets here chavez clicked to another frequency on his radio inbound helo this is charlie one give me an eta to sector seven about eight hundred yards north of the mine entrance copy well pop green when we hear you he turned to mercer about six minutes moose fired another barrage with the saw and the two other marines started to pour lead down the hill screaming unintelligible curses mercer saw half a dozen rebel soldiers advancing from their left flank four were armed with ak s and two carried rpg rocket launchers one went down before he could fire the other took a snap shot with the bazookalike weapon and a section of the hill erupted like a miniature mount st helens the squad automatic weapon fell silent moose had been killed by blast debris mercer chavez and the other marine dodged for cover and even as dirt continued to rain down they fired back when mercer emptied his last clip he tossed aside the ak and reached for the saw the machine gun was huge almost too heavy to carry into combat but its effectiveness was unquestionable three charging guerrillas were hit in the hail of gunfire snapped back by the pounding gun in near perfect sequence keep the fuckers back chavez screamed as he worked on a gash in the leg of the other soldier the mans desert camo uniform was soaked through with blood from a point just below his groin mercer continued to fire the weapon traversing the barrel in tight sweeps to keep the sudanese pinned another rocket slammed into the hill and part of its peak blew away exposing their flank he had no idea how many rounds were in the boxy magazine clamped under the saw but he prayed it was enough to cover them until the chopper arrived evac flight chavez was on the radio with the helicopter again we need some help here roger chavez unclipped a smoke grenade from his combat harness slipped the ring and tossed it to the other side of the hills summit a second later putrid green clouds boiled off the mountain marking their location to the approaching blackhawk bullets raked the top of the hill explosions of dirt and lead that sent mercer and the two surviving marines reeling yet over the din they could still hear the chopper as it came in its rotors whipping the smoke in violent eddies the copilot had opened the helicopters side door but as they began their hover for the pickup he was forced to return to the cockpit the pilot cant land not enough room up here youll have to jump in first chavez screamed over the rotor blast his dirty hand still clamped over the entrance wound in his squad mates leg i need to hold pressure on this dressing mercer emptied the saws clip a further thirty rounds chewing up the camp he commandeered the wounded soldiers m and as the blackhawk lowered even closer to the hillock leaped for the open door a surge of air grabbed the chopper at that instant and mercers chest slammed into the bottom of the door frame in the split second before the pain struck he felt the ends of his ribs grind against each other like corroded machine parts the blackhawk had been pushed away from the mountain of overburden and mercer found himself dangling above seventy feet of empty space his legs bicycling uselessly as the pain loosened his grip on the door sill the pilot must have seen what happened ignoring the turbulence and the whirling blades proximity to the ground he heeled the nimble chopper nearly onto its side throwing mercer bodily into the aircraft by the time mercer recovered enough to crawl to the doorway the blackhawk was once again on station over the hill chavez was ready to pass the wounded marine up to him they came under renewed and intense fire the chopper taking a dozen rounds ricochets scoring the cabin like hot coals mercer fired his m onehanded the stock braced against the helos body as he lay half in and half out to help chavez he had his free arm under the young marines limp arms when a third rpg rocket hit the top of the hill the blackhawk lurched with the explosion and the marine slid from mercers tentative grip the soldier and corporal chavez disappeared in a hellish world of flame and smoke and debris the blackhawk pilot lifted his craft away from the hill and out over the open desert well beyond the range of any weapons the sudanese might have mercer sat numb unmoving staring downward as if he could bring back the two dead soldiers by freezing his position it took all of his strength to blink to wash away part of the horror he saw in corporal chavezs eyes in the instant of his death he sat immobile for two minutes before he could reach up and slip a pair of headphones off the firewall that partially protected the cockpit hows the ship his voice sounded as if it came from someone else a different person who could still function still think rationally still care about what happened next were okay the pilot responded im sorry about your buddies back there there was nothing i could do it wasnt really an apology just a statement of fact in war whats the status of that bogey hold on the pilot said and mercer guessed he was switching frequencies to talk with the circling awacs bogey vanished from radar about five minutes ago roughly a mile from the camp then was spotted again moving eastward about two minutes later sky eye lost the signal right after that sounds like someone made a pickup start flying east as fast as this thing can go i suspect the helicopter were chasing is much bigger than this one a cargo ship that wont have your speed mercers assumption was based on the israelis deluded plan to recover the ark of the covenant he had no idea how big the artifact was reported to be but he guessed that the israelis would provide a large enough machine no matter what its size mercer ducked his head into the cockpit who in the hell are you the pilot was startled that his passenger was a civilian philip mercer im the guy you were brought in to rescue hey weve got orders to drop you at the staging area the copilot said fine by me but you do that and theres no way well catch that other chopper chavez told me the awacs cant track it and were the only other pairs of eyes in the area the twin general electric ts screamed at their maximum rating pushing the lightly laden utility helicopter at over two hundred miles per hour the ground under the roiling sky rushed by in a nauseating blur mercer buckled himself into the seat closest to the open door acting as another observer for the pilots scanning their starboard side for the fleeing israeli craft the pain in his chest was excruciating he found an emergency medical pack under his seat and choked down some painkillers he then used the pocket knife from it to slice off two seat belts he tied the cut ends together and wrapped the belts around his chest using the buckle mechanism to ratchet his makeshift binding tight it was a dangerous mend but for the first time since the apache had exploded over his head he could breathe with a degree of normalcy he wiped sweat from his face and no longer feared mercury poisoning he didnt think hed stopped sweating since his first mad dash into the mine with selome and the diamonds there the copilot called out at our one oclock position about two miles ahead the blackhawk was fast approaching the red sea coast and the weather had deteriorated wind whistling into the back cabin of the craft carried a deluge of rain and drops peppered the wind screen like pebbles the massive escarpment that protected the african coast from the ravages of the ocean dropped from under the helicopter in a gutwrenching swoop and the pilot mirrored the dramatic plunge perfectly in another minute they would be over the red sea and shortly after that if the fleeing helicopter didnt change direction they would fly into saudi arabian airspace south of mecca the american chopper was gaining on the israeli super stallion but the huge khaki helicopter had a big head start and mercer knew they couldnt catch it until they reached the arabian peninsula if we maintain pursuit were going to have to alert the saudi air force the pilot pointed out so do it mercer replied exasperated by the details ive got a transmission on an emergency channel the copilot called i think its from the super stallion the voice over the radio was accentless and the transmission was clear american helicopter american helicopter this is mercy flight one en route to mecca with victims from the sudan famine why are you pursuing us you want to handle this the copilot asked mercer yes he replied tightly ive got it mercy flight one this is a united states marine corps helicopter we do not wish to open fire but you are carrying international fugitives wanted for terrorist acts over negative marine flight we are contracted to the relief agency medecins sans frontiers we are carrying starving children to a hospital in mecca if you do not return to eritrean airspace and land at massawa we will have no choice but to shoot down your craft over mercer bluffed with just an m he couldnt do more than dent the fleeing craft the coast of the arabian peninsula was fast approaching and the blackhawk pilot was reluctant to broach the sovereignty of a friendly nation a new voice came over the net one mercer recognized immediately anger boiled up within him dr mercer how good to hear from you again yosef said i was hoping you were listening ive learned that you may be erratic but you can also be very predictable too you are going to die you son of a bitch mercer seethed i dont think so yosef replied mildly you see were still holding your friend mercer felt as if the helicopter had hit the side of a mountain hed forgotten they still held harry at that moment he knew the fanatics were going to get away with everything switching to intercom mode he asked the pilot if their communications gear could make a satellite call and when he received an affirmative he asked him to contact dick hennas cell phone i take your silence as acknowledgment yosef said across the airwaves very reasonable calling in the marines was poor form doctor since the sniper i sent after your friend with the phone didnt return you forced my hand a bit early and without the ark there is no way to guarantee mr whites safety in fact my last order to my people was that he is to be killed unless i rescind that order your friends life is at an end give me and my team free passage and when we arrive in israel ill have white released dont consider this a failure on your part just a stalemate the pilot cut off yosefs speech by switching channels from the cockpit and mercer heard dick hennas voice saying hello hi dick its mercer jesus h christ where in the hell are you ill tell you in a second but first have you made any progress finding harry yeah hes back in washington hes been here for a while now ill call you later mercer killed the connection and slumped oh god thank you the guilt and the fear and the responsibility fell off mercer in a liberating wave leaving his mind clear for the first time since harrys abduction it was over he was finished nothing else mattered anymore harry was safe selome was safe the eritreans were free even gianellis plan to blackmail the diamond cartel was over he knew if he let it his relief would cut through his resolve but he wasnt quite done yet mercer wasnt going to allow yosef to escape he didnt want it for his friends or for anyone else he wanted this for himself the pilot spoke before he could switch the radio back to the fleeing chopper weve got two problems here dr mercer one is well enter saudi airspace in about four minutes the other is a pair of fast movers just came up on radar theyre closing at mach one from the north eta is ten minutes whose are they mercer had a sinking suspicion he knew the origin of the approaching jets ive got no iff signature off either of them the pilot referred to the identify friend or foe transponders carried by the military aircraft of the united states and her allies so theyre not saudi i doubt theyd shut off their iffs over their own territory especially since the coastlines covered with sam installations in other words weve got ten minutes before that helicopters fighter escort arrives yup lets take em down hey listen doc is that such a good idea i mean whoever has the clout to wrangle up fighter cover must be legit mercer grunted were about to be one of the checks and balances of the israeli democracy maneuver us directly over that helicopter ive got an idea two miles from where the land met the sea the israeli renegades banked north to meet up with the jet fighters skirting the outer reach of saudi arabias coastal defenses there was no chance the lumbering super stallion could outrun the blackhawk but they certainly were trying it took only three more minutes for the american helicopter to take up a position above the israelis huge rotor youd better have a damn good idea the copilot shouted radar has those jets down our throats in four minutes mercer worked furiously when i shout break left as hard as you can then land this pig fast those jets may take a shot even after i destroy the stallion he keyed his mike to speak to yosef listen up you son of a bitch and listen good ah the good doctor is back yosef replied mockingly i thought youd already left us ive always preferred roulette but i know enough about poker to know that when your bluff gets called the games over yosefs voice was strained and his reply took just a fraction too long and you think im bluffing remember its not your life you are gambling with but that of your friend harry white asshole i know youre bluffing mercer estimated how long it would take a twopound object to fall from the door of his helicopter and land on top of the other gauging as best he could he cut ten seconds worth of fuse from the coil in his kit bag and seated it into his last stick of dynamite and in about a minute youre going to pay the highest stakes of all bravado dr mercer yosef replied in one minute if im not given free passage two fs are going to blow you from the sky i may die yes but so will harry white your revenge may be gratifying but it will also be shortlived you should have known when to fold em partner mercer drawled it took a few tries to light the fuse in the air whipping around the cabin but once it was burning evenly he shouted now the blackhawk pilot had anticipated mercer by a crucial half second and when he released the explosive he realized it would miss the upperworks of the israeli helicopter while an explosion near the hull of the sikorsky would be damaging it was doubtful it would cripple the huge cargo chopper mercers mouth opened for a scream of frustration even as the blackhawk twisted and fell from the sky so fast that he became momentarily weightless yet his gaze never left the israeli helo or the little package tumbling torward it a helicopters rotor produces lift by creating a pocket of high pressure below the blades and low pressure above for a chopper the size of the ch tons of air rush into the vortex around the rotor centering the craft like the eye of a hurricane into this maelstrom fell the dynamite the little bomb would have fallen harmlessly past a conventional aircraft but when it felt the relentless draw of the turbinepowered blades it changed direction in midair the millisecond before the packet was shredded by the rotor the fuse touched the chemical explosives the helicopter vanished behind an expanding blossom of fire and when it finally reemerged the six rotor blades and the top third of the aircraft were gone the super stallion was dead in the air only its forward momentum carrying it in a flagging parabola mercer didnt blink until it slammed into the cobaltblue sea fire from its ruptured tanks washing away on the waves spawned by the impact in a second it was gone get us to the arabian coast and under their radar umbrella mercer shouted to the pilot but the veteran was way ahead of him the chopper settled into a flight path scant feet above the sea the engines torqued for maximum speed those jets are breaking off and returning north the copilot yelled a minute later mercer was too tired to care but he gave a weak cheer for the crews benefit lets get back to the mine were not done yet it took forty minutes and on the inbound flight they heard radio chatter from other blackhawks ferrying the injured to the amphibious assault ship habte was the first to greet mercer on the ground shaking his hand solemnly then enfolding him in a brotherly hug that would add another day or two to the recovery time for mercers broken ribs i didnt think id see you again habte tried to keep the emotion out of his voice but failed came damn close selome was next to reach the little group huddled near the blackhawk she too hugged mercer much more gently but her kiss was consumingas if she was trying to fit every possible emotion into that one gesture mercers response was no less enthusiastic im fine dont worry she preempted his question the marines have already freed the miners and theyve been sent with the worst of the injured to their base ship mercer was still on an adrenaline high everything felt otherworldly an hour ago he had been fighting for his life and now he was holding hands with a beautiful woman surrounded by grimy but satisfied soldiers it would take a long time for everything to soak in the horror and the pain but for just a few minutes he felt like he was invincible and the thought made him grin thats great but i was about to ask if you are ready for that vacation yet a marine approached extending his hand to mercer behind him two guards held giancarlo gianelli and joppi hofmyer the smile vanished from mercers face his gray eyes going deadly flat captain james saunders usmc the redheaded marine introduced its an honor to meet you dr mercer honors mine captain mercer grasped the outstretched hand on behalf of all of us thank you just doing our job sir the marine demurred i thought you might want to see these two characters before i shipped them out of here the fbi already has agents in asmara to escort them to europe where theyre going to stand trial ive seen enough ugliness in the past weeks to want to pass up this last opportunity thanks anyway fair enough saunders gestured for the guards to take the two to a waiting helicopter but when they were just a couple of steps away mercer reconsidered one second captain both captives were filthy and looked ravaged by their attempt to flee the battle yet both were also uninjured mercer addressed hofmyer first ive already kicked your ass once so im not even going to bother with you then he directed his hatred at gianelli the italian yelped when mercers murderous eyes fell on him you on the other hand well this im going to enjoy mercer cocked his fist centering gianellis face perfectly but he stayed his hand screw it youre not worth the effort gianelli sagged with relief and stared goggleeyed when mercer turned away like hell youre not mercer twisted back and slammed gianelli the punch rolling the industrialists eyes into his skull and laying him flat in the dirt thank you captain saunders i think i needed that selome ducked under one of mercers arms and habte braced up the other so he walked between the two of them using them for support then he straightened the old fire returning his face lit with a devilish thought what do you say we go find gianellis safe and see what all this fuss has been about masada israel in a land where nearly every building and hillock and cave has significance few sites are as aweinspiring or sacred as king herods fortress at masada it sits atop a diamondshaped mountain commanding a view unlike any other in the world the dead seaearths deepest spotlies in its shadow over a thousand feet below sea level the salty haze reflecting off the lifeless waters making it impossible to distinguish the jordanian coast just seven miles away masada had been built as an unassailable defensive fort but became a favorite retreat to king herod whod spared nothing in making its opulence legendary it had two separate palaces and a swimming pool that was kept full yearround despite the brutal judean summers however its not the architecture that makes masada so significant its what happened there during the great revolt in the first century ad when jewish zealots battled with their roman masters during the revolt masada was captured by menachen ben yehuda and became a retreat for the zealots and after four years of warfare and another three of siege it also became their last stand using jewish slaves the romans constructed a huge ramp to the top of the mountain an impressive engineering feat for the time and when they finally broached the fortress walls they discovered a funeral pyre surrounded by the roman tenth legion under the command of procurator flavius silva jews chose suicide rather than submit to the army whod besieged them like the western wall masada has become a tangible link to jewish history a site of pilgrimage and reverence today every soldier inducted into the israeli defense force has his swearingin ceremony on the windswept thirtyacre shrine a reminder of the heroism and strength of his people that was why prime minister david litvinoff was so angry as his aerospatiale helicopter descended through the night its landing lights shining brightly on the sandy hill top how dare levine soil this spot by agreeing to his surrender here his brazenness knew no bounds levine had disappeared shortly after harry white had been taken back to the united states hed narrowly missed an arrest and since then shin bet had been unable to locate him litvinoff was assured it would only be a matter of time but after two weeks it seemed the defense minister would never resurface even as he continued to work to his goal of recovering the ark of the covenant levine had even managed to get fighter jets scrambled on his orders and a cargo helicopter sent to eritrea to rescue his team there the fighter pilots hadnt known their mission wasnt government sanctioned but they had still been dismissed from active duty pending a further investigation litvinoffs chopper settled lightly and two soldiers sprang out nightvision goggles scanning the parade ground south of herods principal palace weapons at the ready the engine spooled to silence the rotor blades beating the air slower and slower until they sagged like limp palm fronds litvinoff unhooked his seat belt and stepped to the ground if levine wanted me dead he reassured one of his personal guards he wouldnt have let us land levine had called that morning acting like he hadnt a care in the world and told litvinoff that he would surrender himself but only if the prime minister met him at masada wait here litvinoff ignored the expression on his guards face he wants to meet me alone at the upper terrace of herods villa ill be back shortly he was quickly swallowed by the night the beam of his flashlight jerking as he walked north litvinoff tried to keep his mind blank as he rounded the walls of the ancient storerooms and the crumbling foundations of the roman administration building the night was warm but the salty breeze was cooling his sparse hair blew around his eyes and the wind whipped dust from the ground passing the stairs that led to the lower terraces of the villa litvinoff continued through a stone maze until he came to a semicircular wall that hung over the northern tip of masada like the prow of a great ship it was too dark to see anything below him but litvinoff could feel the emptiness reaching out from just a few feet away i knew youd come a voice called from the darkness litvinoff turned to face the voice his back to the starless void how dare you desecrate this place by coming here you almost destroyed everything masada stands for he didnt want to get into this with levine but his emotions were too much his hate his outrage destroyed david no i almost made everything worthwhile i almost succeeded returning to israel its most coveted artifact levine stepped into the flashlights beam nothing about his posture looked like he was sorry about what hed done he even wore his uniform in comparison to his striking figure litvinoff was short and gray a tired old man who looked out of place anywhere other than an office well its over levine laughed do you really think its over are you that naive this wasnt all my doing you know there are others working with me powerful men and women many of them in your own government we failed this time but that doesnt mean we wont continue we will find the ark and restore the temple and then we will do away with the palestinians you cant stop us maybe i cant but that doesnt matter litvinoff said and saw that his words confused his defense minister symbols can be powerful chaim but only if people give them power even if you had found the ark do you think you wouldve been able to do all the other things you wanted the excitement about its discovery would last only as long as the next scandal or the next war no one cares anymore they dont want symbols youre wrong levine snapped symbols are needed more than ever the world is falling apart america is turning our planet into a homogenized strip mall we need to maintain our differences we need something to remind us all that we are jews first and foremost then israelis or americans or europeans its all we have left i wont disagree with you but this isnt the way david weve been friends for a long time weve never been friends livtinoff said evenly you were nothing but a political necessity to me a way to keep a coalition government going dont mistake that for friendship levine nodded slowly surprised by the frank declaration very well we have worked together for many years you know i would do nothing to harm israel that is why we are out here tonight i failed at my quest and i know that my continued involvement in politics will only harm your government how kind dont think its for your sake i told you before the people working with me will continue ive been exposed and i cant let that jeopardize their efforts a gun appeared in levines hand hed kept it in a holster behind his back this is the only way the shot was brutally loud a crashing explosion of light and sound that assaulted litvinoffs ears like thunder he hadnt fired a pistol since the six day war and his hand stung hed fired his own weapon pulling it from his pocket in front of levine but the defense minister hadnt seen the action because of the flashlight beaming in his face chaim levine looked at the wound in his chest even as he struggled to raise his own pistol to his temple litvinoff fired again and levine fell back hitting the stone wall and slumping to the ground his automatic slipping from his fingers you wont become a symbol chaim litvinoff said to the corpse i wont let you martyr yourself and add your ghost to the spirits that haunt masada you dont deserve it and despite what you thought you never did egypt many factors made it inevitable that the nile river would become one of civilizations cradles there were the yearly floods that deluged the river valley with such fertile soil that farming could continue yearround and then there was the quirky fact that while the river flowed northward the prevailing winds blew south guaranteeing easy passage in either direction it was this wind that gently moved across the wooden deck of the luxury barge flicking at the canvas awning over the upper salon and drying beads of sweat dotting philip mercers face and bare chest soaking into the waistband of his shorts his upper body was still bruised multiple shades of purple and deep breaths bothered him but he was healing well and the physician who had visited the boat in luxor a week ago said that hed make a full recovery thankfully neither he nor selome had any lasting effects from their exposure to mercury and mercers fears about cryptococcus had been unfounded he and selome had been on the barge for three weeks cruising up the river from the bustle of cairo the boat belonged to a former client of mercers whod made a fortune after contracting his geologic services and was more than willing to allow the use of his vessel from the shore she looked unremarkable sixtyeight feet long and nearly twenty wide with a flat bottom and squared bow and stern her pilot house was a square block haphazardly placed too far forward to be aesthetically pleasing it was only when one stepped onto her decks that she revealed her true beauty and luxury appointments the upper deck was mahogany sanded so smooth that it shimmered in the desert sun the small swimming pool and the jaccuzi looked like miniature oases amid the palm planters a wet bar beckoned apart from the crew mercer and selome had the barge to themselves below decks were six cabins including the masters suite with a bed big enough for a polo match and a gold and marble bath the dining room and main salon were equally lavish and while the decor wasnt mercers style he appreciated its beauty he wiped perspiration from his eyes and opened them slowly enjoying the sight that lay before him selome nagast was stretched out on a wicker chaise longue her dusky skin like oiled stone in both firmness and gloss her hair was bunched atop her head but still cascaded around her shoulders the henna dye glinting like a pillow of rubies the only other color on her body was a wisp of a bikini bottom that vanished in cords around her narrow hips and flashed just a tiny triangle between her legs her breasts perfect in any position were spread by her relaxed pose riding high and peaked so delicately that mercer felt his lower body shift as he studied them moving only a hand for he did not want to disturb her sleep he plucked a gimlet from the table behind him he estimated sipping the biting lime and vodka mixture that this was his third and it wasnt yet noon mercer knew some people searched for excitement to escape the doldrums of their lives while on vacation he wanted just the opposite on the river side of the anchored luxury barge called aga khan a steady procession of tourist cruise ships paraded in both directions loaded with americans japanese and europeans opposite sat the temple of kom ombo a sandstone complex dedicated to horus and sobek the crocodile god the temple looked similar to the acropolis in athens with sturdy columns in the shape of lotus plants and crowned with massive rock lintels mercer and selome had spent the day before walking through the ruins admiring the ptolemaic hieroglyphics and the mummified remains of sacred crocodiles the temple had once been a pilgrimage destination for the lame and injured and many of the pictographs depicted medical procedures and prayers today was their last day alone together here at kom ombo they were being joined by dick henna and his wife fay later in aswan the two couples would leave the boat for another week of sightseeing including a privately chartered plane trip to the massive ramses ii temple at abu simbel no sooner had mercer thought about the impending end to their solitude than there came a disturbance at the gangplank at first he thought it was another curio merchant trying to sell souvenirs but then he heard dick hennas voice and fays excited exclamation as she got her first look at the true nature of her ride south selome wake up mercer called and her eyes fluttered open he tossed her the bikini top companys arrived she gave a little moue of annoyance and slipped the bikini over her chest settling her breasts in the twin cups just as henna and fay came out to the sundeck mercer was on his feet in an instant shaking dicks hand and kissing fays cheek welcome to mercers barge of sin your whim is our command i said it before and ill say it again i got into the wrong line of work henna drank in the barges opulence until his gaze fell on selome he gaped selome nagast this is dick and fay henna while dick was shaking her hand fay shot mercer an approving wink that made him smile how was your trip great dick replied firstclass from dulles to cairo private jet from there to aswan and a limo here who could complain mercer had paid for it all as thanks to dick for his help and fay for her patience and harry hell be here the day after tomorrow hes in israel now helping mossad identify the people who held him captive i cant believe he has that much energy his constitution is like iron while his hearts gold and his liver is lead mercer laughed why dont you two get settled we can talk over lunch an hour later they sat at one of the outside tables henna and fay dressed in shorts and loose shirts mercer had thrown on a tshirt and selome had covered up with a colorful wrap as they ate two lateenrigged feluccas dashed by the barge the traditional craft still a regular sight on the river after countless hundreds of generations after the stewards cleared the table and refreshed everyones drinks mercer finished his nearly textbook history of the temple behind them and turned the conversation more serious we might as well get the working part of your trip out of the way so we can enjoy the rest of the week in peace i agree fay chimed quickly fair enough henna looked lovingly at his wife of thirtyfive years okay well do the bad stuff first and work our way to the good news three of the miners trapped when you escaped the mine pit have died from mercury poisoning and four others arent expected to make it most however responded well to treatment and will make a full recovery mercer said nothing he didnt think of the thirty he had saved only the ones hed lost and selome put a hand over his henna continued only four eritreans were killed during the marine assault and autopsies proved they were all killed by the sudanese out of the marine detachment we lost eight men with another twelve wounded only three sudanese survived the battle and are being held in asmara awaiting trial the minister of justice assures me their execution will be swift in a deal between interpol and the eritrean authorities they also get to keep joppi hofmyer and the other south african mine engineer but giancarlo gianelli went to europe the board of directors for gianelli spa have been forthcoming about his other illegal activities in an attempt to stave off bad publicity even with good behavior hell be in prison long after the next ice age has he shown any remorse none i should have killed him when i had the chance mercer grunted he knew even a life sentence was too lenient for what gianelli had done now for the good news ill save the best stuff for last as im sure you heard defense minister levine died mysteriously a couple of weeks ago the official cover story is heart attack but the truth is prime minister litvinoff shot levine himself litvinoff called for a postponement of the elections but it looks like when they are held he will retain the prime ministership with a labor party majority in the knesset the other conspirators we know about will be tried in secret israels government is keeping this whole affair quiet but our president knows exactly what transpired and hes going to use that for leverage during the next round of peace negotiations if they balk at old promises again carrot and stick diplomacy not my concern im just a cop henna smirked now for the really good parts that heavy mining equipment you had ordered from washington arrived in eritrea the day after you and selome came here the army corps of engineers gave them a hand getting it to the mine site as part of a cooperative loan package habte makkonen has been named as the mines general manager and hell have it in operation soon of course theyre calling it the king solomon mine makkonen and the minister of mines have already struck a deal with the london diamond cartel for distribution within another few weeks the first stones will be shipped no one can predict how much this will change eritrea but everyone agrees that their cycle of poverty is over tell him the other part fay prompted oh yeah remember that safe the one you couldnt open at the mine mercer tried everything short of dynamite on that stupid thing selome offered gianelli refused to give us the combination so the safes manufacturer was contacted and they sent one of their technicians i guess that little pig was the latest in strongbox technology because it took the safecracker a full week to open it and it was fay who was showing more excitement than anyone else even though she knew the story you probably heard rumors about a huge stone that had been found when you were working in the pits well they were true rough it weighs one hundred and twenty carats diamondcutting experts who have it in antwerp say itll polish out at over sixty jesus christ mercer was stunned a stone that size is priceless a collector will pay a fortune for the right to name it its already been spoken for who mercer asked guessing it would soon adorn someones trophy wife the people of eritrea have donated it to the smithsonians museum of natural history it will be displayed next to the hope diamond in the hooker hall of geology henna beamed its going to be called the mercer diamond mercer felt a prick of tears behind his eyes and turned away before the others could see how touched he was by the gesture when he recovered he looked at selome you knew about this i learned about it the last time i called the minister of mines she couldnt keep the smile from her face on behalf of all my people we wanted some way to thank you for what you did for us such gratitude made mercer look uncomfortable but there was a glint of selfsatisfaction behind his expression later that night mercer and selome made love in the big master suite as they lay in the damp tangle of sheets selome rested her head on mercers chest so he could not see her face when she spoke youve changed since this morning was it the diamond he respected her enough not to evade the question no it isnt that how could he explain it to her what words could tell her that despite all they had been through he wanted to go home and pick up where hed been before that first call from prescott hyde he had to forget about this nightmare it wasnt fair or right to include her too but she was part of it everything was just too painful images of gibby and brother ephraim and the mummified children the sight of bodies hed found in the other mine chavezs face when the hill exploded it would take years for the horror to dissipate and some of it would be with him forever it is dick and fay then she said they remind you that life exists away from here and you are now eager to return selome i he wasnt eager but he had to go he had to sever every tie with what had happened he had to make a clean break if he hoped to start the long healing process i know philip i understand you are ready to go home dont think i didnt know this was coming i expected it her voice caught when we met i sensed you were carrying an old pain something from your recent past that you could not get rid of its gone now but maybe youre afraid that this experience will follow you too mercer smiled you were the one who made the old memories fade i think id given up on people shut myself off but you reminded me that im still alive inside i can never repay you for what youve done for me and then mercer realized he could i made a promise with myself that i wouldnt tell anyone what im about to tell you and you have to promise that the secret stays here in this room selome twisted so she could look at him his serious tone demanding her full attention in the chamber where mahdi died i saw something something i cant explain he could see her searching his eyes ive been trying to rationalize what i saw come up with a scientific explanation in my mind but i cant what was it selome asked already sensing she knew her body quivered it was unlike any natural phenomena id ever seen an otherworldly blue light that glowed and pulsed as if it was alive i didnt actually see what caused it but im pretty sure that the ark of the covenant was down there with us levine was right we have to tell someone my god we have to go get it do you know what this means yes i do mercer said how many people have died because of it already if the search continues more will be killed until all of israel is destroyed maybe the world no selome we shouldnt go get it it was crushed under a billion tons of rock and thats exactly where it should stay he paused do you remember that ephraim said god commanded menyelek to take the ark to africa maybe it was for just this reason it was meant to be a tool for gods veneration not a means for men to destroy each other we arent ready for it yet we cant handle it but her voice trailed off she knew mercer was right i told you this so at least you would know the truth thats my gift for your help she could see what it had cost him to reveal this secret the internal conflict etched his face and tightened the muscles in his body thank you she whispered i think my gift was much less painful to give im now in your debt no more debts were even so what will you do once you get home her serene expression told mercer that they really were even will you find some new adventure to occupy your mind and help you forget about me ill never forget you but no more adventures mercer said im teaching mine rescue in pennsylvania in a few weeks after that i hope to be heading to greenland as part of a scientific expedition compared to what you and i have been through itll be a cakewalk selome studied his eyes a secret little smile on her lips in all of your questing have you ever really found what youre looking for mercer considered for a minute its not the goal that interests me its the quest itself in that case promise me that for our last week together i am your sole quest he did
