you know macumba voodoo my granddad was a priest in trinidad he used to tell us when theres no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth ken foree as peter in george a romeros dawn of the dead when i first started assembling this anthology i thought to myself this is not going to be the sort of book that begins with an origin of the word zombie because thats not the point is it zombie fiction is about the unburied dead returning to life and seeking human victims its about battling a frightening implacable foe and imagining what it would be like to survive the end of the world and trying to figure out what to do when the dead wont stay dead regardless of where the word actually comes from today the word zombie generally refers to the sort of shambling reanimated corpses as depicted in george a romeros landmark film night of the living dead in his short fiction collection zombie jam author david j schow explains the influence of romero the plain fact is that the aptlychristened romero zombies have infiltrated the culture to the extent that even people who have never experienced the movies know what zombies are in shortform theyre dead they walk they want to eat you and they usually outnumber you most of the stories in this book are either inspired by romeros unholy trilogynight of the living dead dawn of the dead and day of the deador are a reaction to it that influence is obvious in much of the fiction contained herein and authors frequently cite seeing romeros films as pivotal moments in their youth and indeed their lives so why are we so drawn to zombie fiction whats so appealing about the idea of the living dead john langan author of how the day runs down pg says that zombiesthe postromero zombie that has defined our current concept of the beasthave the virtue of simplicity while you can trace aspects of their behavior to a host of monsters that have come before like vampires they rise from the dead like ghouls and werewolves they eat our flesh like frankensteins monster theyre reanimated corpses like most monsters they have a particular weakness that will kill them immediately they boil all that down to the basics theyre back from the dead they want to eat us they can be killed with a shot to the head he says i suspect that part of their effectiveness lies in the way they present us to ourselves by which i mean if you think about a monster like the vampire or the werewolf you can see them as aspects of human behavior magnified and embodied ie the vampires connection to various kinds of taboo eroticism has been explored ad infinitum while the werewolfs link to animal violence has also been recognized with the zombie what you get is us pretty much as we are maybe with a little damage and we consume one another no eroticism no animal violence just a single overwhelming appetite thats simultaneously very straightforward and very disturbing david barr kirtley author of the skullfaced boy pg says that there are two reasons we find zombies appealing one i think theres an enormous segment of our brain thats evolved for running away from packs of predators and zombie stories give us a rare opportunity to take this primal part of our psyches out for a spin he says and two zombies are a great metaphor the great mass of humanity often comes across to us as unreasoningly hostile and driven to consumption and the image of the zombie captures this perfectly the popularity of zombies comes from the fact that the vampire that we all loved got lost says the age of sorrow pg author nancy kilpatrick a lot of us miss the old resuscitated corpse the ugly vampire the mindless one that cant be reasoned with she says i think zombies were there already and evolved from the haitian voodoo zombie to the romero zombie that evolved further over the course of his film series so that the cause of zombification became different and rather than being bland slaves they turned into fullblown predators en masse most of us miss the predatory vampire zombies i think have ascended in popularity because they not only fill that archetypal void but they also reflect societys fear of something overtaking us making us lessthanhuman or the victim of that lessthanhuman its especially traumatizing when lessthanhuman is family friends and neighbors but hey strangers in numbers will do it for most of usi think theres an inherent fear of mindless mobs in all of us its the hordes that swarm over you add to that our unconscious horror of our rampant consumption in the first world and its like a hundredthousand inhuman pacmen eating everything in sight theres not much in the horror field that terrifies me but zombies do their driven singleminded quality is both terrifying and aweinspiring i think its what all sane people fear being confronted by somethingsomeone that has your destruction at heart and whichwho cant be stopped and now a note about the stories that are in this book and the ones that arent in the process of assembling this anthology i read more zombie stories than you could possibly imagine and i found more good ones than could possibly fit in one volume even a mammoth tome like this one so in order to help narrow down my selections i created a few loose guidelines for myself first i wanted to avoid taking too many stories from any one source second i wanted to avoid taking too many stories from other zombie anthologies i discovered a lot of great zombie fiction elsewhere and thought that this book would be more valuable to zombie fans if it were to collect that material many hardcore zombie aficionados will have already read john skipp and craig spectors zombie anthologies book of the dead still dead and mondo zombie or james lowders eden studios zombie anthologies the book of all flesh the book of more flesh and the book of final flesh so rather than reprint a large number of stories from those books i reprinted a few from those volumes but focused my efforts elsewhere and for those of you who havent read any of those other zombie anthologies well go dig them up third i deliberately didnt always choose the obvious story from an author assuming of course that the stories i included instead were just as good for instance i didnt reprint joe r lansdales on the far side of the cadillac desert with dead folks or david j schows jerrys kids meet wormboy because they each have written other great zombie stories as well and i figured if youve read one story by either of them it would have been that one fourth i didnt want to use anything that felt like an excerpt of a larger work so for example that meant omitting anything from max brookss excellent zombie novel world war z although the novel is episodic reading the episodes separately robs them of some of their power i thought instead ill just urge you to go buy it right now well after youve bought this book and finally i wanted the anthology to include a wide range of zombie fiction incorporating all types of zombies from the romerostyle zombie to the technozombie and everything in between so herein you will find the dead mysteriously returned to life hungering for human flesh corpses reanimated by necromancers corpses reanimated by technology andor science voodoo zombies revenants and other less easily categorized zombies but getting back to the appeal of zombies so what about it why do you enjoy zombie fiction well whatever your reason for liking zombie stories there are enough great zombie stories in the pages that follow to please even the most discerning zombie aficionado so dive in and consume these stories as if they were the brains of the last human left on earth bon app√©tit some zombie contingency plans by kelly linkkelly link is the author of many wonderful short stories

links collection magic for beginners which incidentally also includes another great zombie story called the hortlak as this story illustrates a zombie contingency plan is an important thing to have so before we progress any further in this anthology you should have a look at this tale so that you can stop and consider a plan of your own in fact you may want to think about that now although this book is a rather weighty tome it probably wouldnt make a very effective weapon against the living dead this is a story about being lost in the woods this guy soap is at a party out in the suburbs the thing you need to know about soap is that he keeps a small framed oil painting in the trunk of his car the painting is about the size of a paperback novel wherever soap goes this oil painting goes with him but he leaves the painting in the trunk of his car because you dont walk around a party carrying a painting people will think youre weird soap doesnt know anyone here hes crashed the party which is what he does now when he feels lonely on weekends he just drives around the suburbs until he finds one of those summer twilight parties that are so big that they spill out onto the yard kids are out on the lawn of a twostory house lying on the damp grass and drinking beer out of plastic cups soap has brought along a sixpack its the least he can do he walks through the house past four black guys sitting all over a couch theyre watching a football game and theres some music on the stereo the television is on mute over by the tv a white girl is dancing by herself when she gets too close to it the guys on the couch start complaining soap finds the kitchen theres one of those big professional ovens and a lot of expensivelooking knives stuck to a magnetic strip on the wall its funny soap thinks how expensive stuff always looks more dangerous and also safer both of these things at the same time he pokes around in the fridge and finds some presliced cheese and english muffins he grabs three slices of cheese the muffins and puts the beer in the fridge theres also a couple of steaks and so he takes one out heats up the broiler a girl wanders into the kitchen shes black and her hair goes up and up and on top are these sturdy springy curls like little waves toe to top of her architectural haircut shes as tall as soap she has eyes the color of iceberg lettuce theres a heartshaped rhinestone under one green eye the rhinestone winks at soap like it knows him shes gorgeous but soap knows better than to fool around with girls who arent out of high school yet maybe what are you doing she says cooking a steak soap says want one no she says i already ate she sits up on the counter beside the sink and swings her legs shes wearing a bikini top pink shorts and no shoes who are you she says will soap says although will isnt his name soap isnt his real name either im carly she says you want a beer theres beer in the fridge will says and carly says i know there is will opens and closes drawers and cabinet doors until hes found a plate a fork and a knife and garlic salt he takes his steak out of the oven you go to state carly says she pops off the beer top against the lip of the kitchen counter and will knows shes showing off no will says he sits down at the kitchen table and cuts off a piece of steak hes been lonely ever since he and his friend mike got out of prison and mike went out to seattle its nice to sit in a kitchen and talk to a girl so what do you do carly says she sits down at the table across from him she lifts her arms up and stretches until her back cracks shes got nice tits telemarketing will says and carly makes a face that sucks she says yeah will says no it isnt too bad i like talking to people i just got out of prison he takes another big bite of steak no way carly says what did you do will chews he swallows i dont want to talk about it right now okay carly says do you like museums will says she looks like a girl who goes to museums some drunk white kid wanders into the kitchen he says hey to will and then he lies down on the floor with his head under carlys chair carly carly carly he says i am so in love with you right now youre the most beautiful girl in the world and you dont even know my name thats hurtful museums are okay carly says i like concerts jazz improvisational comedy i like stuff that isnt the same every time you look at it how about zombies will says no more steak he mops up meat juice with one of the muffins maybe he could eat another one of those steaks the kid with his head under carlys chair says carly carly carly i like it when you sit on my face carly you mean like horror movies carly says the living dead says the kid under the chair the walking dead why do the dead walk everywhere why dont they just catch the bus you still hungry carly says to will i could make you some cinnamon toast or some soup they could carpool the kid under the chair says hey yall i dont know why they call carpools carpools its not like there are cars with swimming pools in them because people might drown on their way to school what a weird word carpool carpool carlys pool there are naked people in carlys pool but carly isnt naked in carlys pool is there a phone around here will says i was thinking i should call my dad hes having openheart surgery tomorrow its not his name but lets call him soap thats what they called him in prison although not for the reasons youre thinking when he was a kid hed read a book about a boy named soap so he didnt mind the nickname it was better than oatmeal which is what one guy ended up getting called you dont want to know why oatmeal got called oatmeal it would put you off oatmeal soap was in prison for six months in some ways six months isnt a long time you spend longer inside your mother but six months in prison is enough time to think about things and all around you everyone else is thinking too it can make you go crazy wondering what other people are thinking about some guys thought about their families and other guys thought about revenge or how they were going to get rich some guys took correspondence courses or fell in love because of what one of the volunteer art instructors said about one of their watercolors soap didnt take an art course but he thought about art art was why soap was in prison this sounded romantic but really it was just stupid even before soap and his friend mike went to prison soap was sure that hed had opinions about art even though he hadnt known much about art it was the same with prison art and prison were the kind of things that you had opinions about even if you didnt know anything about them soap still didnt know much about art these were some of the things that he had known about art before prison he knew what he liked when he saw it as it had turned out he knew what he liked even when he couldnt see it museums gave him hiccups he had hiccups a lot of the time while he was in prison too these were some of the things soap figured out about art while he was in prison great art came out of great suffering soap had gone through a lot of shit because of art there was a difference between art which you just looked at and things like soap which you used even if the soap smelled so good that you didnt want to use it only smell it this was why people got so pissed off about art because you didnt eat it and you didnt sleep on it and you couldnt put it up your nose a lot of people said things like thats not art when whatever they were talking about could clearly not have been anything else except art when soap got tired of thinking about art he thought about zombies he worked on his zombie contingency plan thinking about zombies was less tiring than thinking about art heres what soap knew about zombies zombies were not about sex zombies were not interested in art zombies werent complicated it wasnt like werewolves or ghosts or vampires vampires for example were the middleuppermiddle management of the supernatural world some people thought of vampires as rock stars but really they were more like martha stewart vampires were prissy they had to follow rules they had to look good zombies werent like that you couldnt exorcise zombies you didnt need luxury items like silver bullets or crucifixes or holy water you just shot zombies in the head or set fire to them or hit them over the head really hard there were some guys in the prison who knew about that there were guys in the prison who knew about anything you might want to know about there were guys who knew things that you didnt want to know it was like a library except it wasnt zombies didnt discriminate everyone tasted equally good as far as zombies were concerned and anyone could be a zombie you didnt have to be special or good at sports or goodlooking you didnt have to smell good or wear the right kind of clothes or listen to the right kind of music you just had to be slow soap liked this about zombies there is never just one zombie there was something about clowns that was worse than zombies or maybe something that was the same when you see a zombie you want to laugh at first when you see a clown most people get a little nervous theres the pallor and the cakey morticianstyle makeup the shuffling and the untidy hair but clowns were probably malicious and they moved fast on those little bicycles and in those little crammed cars zombies werent much of anything they didnt carry musical instruments and they didnt care whether or not you laughed at them you always knew what zombies wanted given a choice soap would take zombies over clowns any day there was a white guy in the prison who had been a clown nobody was sure why he was in prison it turned out that everyone in the prison had a zombie contingency plan once you asked them just like everyone in prison had a prison escape plan only nobody talked about those soap tried not to dwell on escape plans although sometimes he dreamed that he was escaping then the zombies would show up they always showed up in his escape dreams you could escape prison but you couldnt escape zombies this was true in soaps dreams just the way it was true in the movies you couldnt get any more true than that according to soaps friend mike who was also in prison people worried too much about zombies and not enough about icebergs even though icebergs were real mike pointed out that icebergs were slow like zombies maybe you could adapt zombie contingency plans to cope with icebergs mike asked soap to start thinking about icebergs no one else was somebody had to plan for icebergs according to mike even after soap got out of prison when it was much too late he still dreamed about escaping from prison so whose house is this anyway will asks carly shes walking up the stairs in front of him if he reached out just one hand he could untie her bikini top it would just fall off this girl carly says and proceeds to relate a long sad story a friend of mine her parents took her to france for this bicycle tour theyre into amway this trip is some kind of bonus like her father sold a bunch of water filters and so now everyone has to go to france and build their own bicycles in marseilles isnt that lame she cant even speak french shes a francophilophobe shes a klutz her parents dont even like her if they could have they would have left her at home or maybe theyll leave her somewhere in france shit would i love to see her try and ride a bike in france shell probably fall right over the alps i hate her we were going to have this party and then she said i should go ahead and have it without her shes really pissed off at her parents is this a bathroom will says hold on a minute he goes in and takes a piss he flushes and when he goes to wash his hands he sees that the people who own this house have put some chunk of fancy soap beside the sink he sniffs the soap then he opens up the door carly is standing there talking to some asian girl wearing a strapless dress with little shiny fake plastic flowers all over it its too big for her in the bust so shes holding the front out like shes waiting for someone to come along and drop a weasel in it will wonders who the dress belongs to and why this girl would want to wear an ugly dress like that anyway he holds out the soap smell this he says to carly and she does what does it smell like i dont know she says marmalade lemongrass will says he marches back into the bathroom and opens up the window theres a swimming pool down there with people in it he throws the soap out the window and some guy in the pool yells hey whyd he do that the girl in the hall says carly starts laughing soaps friend mike had a girlfriend named jenny jenny never came to see mike in prison soap felt bad about this soaps dad was living in new zealand and every once in a while soap got a postcard soaps mom who lived in california out near manhattan beach was too busy and too pissed off with soap to visit him in prison soaps mom didnt tolerate stupidity or bad luck soaps older sister becka was the only family member who ever came to visit him in prison becka was an actresswaitress who had once been in a lowbudget zombie movie soap had watched it once and wasnt sure which was stranger seeing your sister naked or seeing your naked sister get eaten by zombies becka was almost good looking enough to be on a reality dating show but not funny looking or sad enough to be on one of the makeover shows becka was always giving notice so then their mom would buy becka a roundtrip ticket to go visit soap soap figured he was supposed to be an example to becka find a good job and keep it or youll end up in prison like your brother becka might have been average in la but average in la is queen of mars in the visiting room of a federal penitentiary in north carolina guys kept asking soap when they were going to see his sister on tv soaps mom owned a boutique right on manhattan beach it was called float becka and soap called it wash your mouth the boutique sold soaps and shampoos nothing else the soaps and shampoos were supposed to smell like food what the soaps really smelled like were those candles that were supposed to smell like food but which smelled instead like those air fresheners which hang from the rearview mirrors in taxis or stolen cars like looking behind you smells like strawberries like making a clean getaway smells the same as the room freshener soap and becka used to spray when theyd been smoking their mothers pot before she got home once when they were in high school soap and becka had bought a urinal cake it smelled like peppermint theyd taken the urinal cake out of its packaging and put it in a fancy box with some tissue paper and a ribbon soap had wrapped it up and given it to their mother for mothers day told her it was a pumice soap for exfoliating feet soap liked soap that smelled like soap his mom was always sending care packages of soaps that smelled like olive oil and neroli and peppermint and brown sugar and cucumber and martinis and toasted marshmallow you werent supposed to have bars of soap in prison if you put a bar of soap in a sock you could hit somebody over the head with it you could clobber somebody but becka made an arrangement with the guards in the visiting room and the guards in the visiting room made an arrangement with the guards in charge of the mailroom soap gave out his mothers soaps to everyone in prison whoever wanted them it turned out everyone wanted soap that smelled like food social workers and prison guards and drug dealers and murderers and even people who hadnt been able to afford good lawyers no wonder his moms boutique did so well while soap was in prison becka kept soaps painting for him sometimes he asked and she brought it with her when she came to visit he made her promise not to give it to their mother not to pawn it for rent money to keep it under her bed where it would be safe as long as her roommates cat didnt sneak in becka promised that if there were a fire or an earthquake shed rescue the painting first even before she rescued her roommate or her roommates cat carly takes will into a bedroom theres a big painting of a flower garden and under the painting is a kingsized bed with dresses lying all over it there are dresses on the floor go ahead and call your dad carly says ill come back in a while with some more beer you want another beer why not will says he waits until she leaves the room and then he calls his dad when his dad picks up the phone he says hey dad hows it going junior his dad says hows it going did i wake you up what time is it there junior says doesnt matter his dad says i was working on a jigsaw puzzle no picture on the box i think its lemurs or maybe binturongs not much junior says staying out of trouble super his dad says thats super i was thinking about that thing we talked about about how i could come visit you sometime junior says sure his dad says his dad is always enthusiastic about juniors ideas hey that would be great get out of that fucking country while you still can come visit your old dad we could do fatherson stuff go bungee jumping the girl in the plastic flower dress marches into the bedroom she takes the dress off and drops it on the bed she goes into the closet and comes out again holding a dress made out of black and purple feathers it looks like something a dancer in las vegas might wear when she got off work some girl just came in and took off all her clothes junior says to his dad well you give her my best his dad says and hangs up my dad says hello junior says to the naked girl then he says my dad and i have a question for you do you ever worry about zombies do you have a zombie contingency plan the girl just smiles like she thinks thats a good question she puts the new dress on she walks out will calls his sister but becka isnt answering her cell phone so will picks up all the dresses and goes into the closet he hangs them up people clean up after themselves zombies dont in wills opinion zombies are attracted to suburbs the way that tornadoes are attracted to trailer parks maybe its all the windows maybe houses in suburbs have too many windows and thats what drives zombies nuts if the zombies showed up tonight will would barricade the bedroom door with the heavy oak dresser will will let the naked girl come in first carly too the three of them will make a rope by tying all those dresses together and escape through the window maybe they could make wings out of that feather dress and fly away will could be the bird man of suburbitraz will looks under the bed just to make sure there are no zombies or suitcases or that drunk guy from downstairs under there theres a little black kid in superman pajamas curled up asleep under the bed when becka was a kid she kept a suitcase under the bed the suitcase was full of things that were to be rescued in case of an earthquake or a fire or murderers the suitcases secondary function was using up some of the dangerous dark space under the bed which might otherwise have been inhabited by monsters or dead people here be suitcases in the suitcase becka kept a candle shaped like a dragon which shed bought at the mall with some birthday money and then couldnt bear to use as a candle a little ceramic dog some favorite stuffed animals their mothers charm bracelet a photo album black beauty and a whole lot of other horse books every once in a while becka and her little brother would drag the suitcase back out from under the bed and sort through it becka would take things out and put other things in her little brother always felt happy and safe when he helped becka do this when things got bad you would rescue what you could modern art is a waste of time when the zombies show up you cant worry about art art is for people who arent worried about zombies besides zombies and icebergs there are other things that soap has been thinking about tsunamis earthquakes nazi dentists killer bees army ants black plague old people divorce lawyers sorority girls jimmy carter giant squids rabid foxes strange dogs news anchors child actors fascists narcissists psychologists ax murderers unrequited love footnotes zeppelins the holy ghost catholic priests john lennon chemistry teachers redheaded men with british accents librarians spiders nature books with photographs of spiders in them darkness teachers swimming pools smart girls pretty girls rich girls angry girls tall girls nice girls girls with superpowers giant lizards blind dates who turn out to have narcolepsy angry monkeys feminine hygiene commercials sitcoms about aliens things under the bed contact lenses ninjas performance artists mummies spontaneous combustion soap has been afraid of all of these things at one time or another ever since he went to prison hes realized that he doesnt have to be afraid all he has to do is come up with a plan be prepared its just like the boy scouts except you have to be even more prepared you have to prepare for everything that the boy scouts didnt prepare you for which is pretty much everything soap is a waste of time too what good is soap in a zombie situation soap sometimes imagines himself trapped in his mothers soap boutique zombies are coming out of the surf dripping wet hellishly hungry always so fucking slow shuffling hopelessly up through the sand of manhattan beach soap has barricaded himself in float with his mother and some blond japanese tourists with surfboards do something sweetheart his mother implores so sweetheart throws water all over the floor theres the surfboards a baseball bat under the counter some rolls of quarters and a swordfish mounted up on the wall but sweetheart decides the cash register is best for bashing he tells the japanese tourists to get down on their hands and knees and rub soap all over the floor when the zombies finally find a way into float his mother and the tourists can hide behind the counter the zombies will slip all over the floor and sweetheart will bash them in the head with the cash register it will be just like a busby berkeley zombie musical whats going on carly says hows your father doing hes fine will says except for the openheart surgery thing except for that hes good i was just looking under the bed theres a little kid under there oh carly says him thats the little brother of my friend le bro de mon ami im taking care of him he likes to sleep under the bed whats his name will says leo carly says she hands will a beer and sits down on the bed beside him so tell me about this prison thing what did you do should i be afraid of you probably not will says it doesnt do much good to be afraid of things so tell me what you did carly says she burps so loud that will is amazed that the kid under the bed doesnt wake up leo this is a great party will says thanks for hanging out with me somebody just puked out of a window in the living room someone else almost threw up in the swimming pool but i got them out in time if someone throws up on the piano im in big trouble you cant get puke out from between piano keys will thinks carly says this like she knows what shes talking about there are girls who have had years of piano lessons and then there are girls who have taken piano lessons who also know how to throw a party and how to clean throwup out of a piano theres something sexy about a girl who knows how to play the piano and keys that stick for no apparent reason will doesnt have any zombie contingency plans that involve pianos and it makes him sick how could he have forgotten pianos ill help you clean up will says if you want you dont have to try so hard you know carly says she stares right at him like theres a spider on his face or an interesting tattoo some word spelled upside down in a foreign language that she wants to understand will doesnt have any tattoos as far as hes concerned tattoos are like art only worse will stares right back he says when i was at this party outside kansas city i heard this story about a kid who threw a lot of parties while his parents were on vacation right before they got home he realized how fucked up the house was and so he burned it down this story always makes will laugh what a dumb kid you want to help me burn down my friends house carly says she smiles like what a good joke what a nice guy he is what time is it two if its two in the morning then you have to tell me why you went to prison its like a rule weve known each other for at least an hour and its late at night and i still dont know why you were in prison even though i can tell you want to tell me or otherwise you wouldnt have told me you were in prison in the first place was what you did that bad no will says it was just really stupid stupid is good carly says come on pretty please she pulls back the cover on the bed and crawls under it pulls the sheets up to her chin good night carly good night carlys gorgeous tits it was so small and it was so far away even when you looked at it up close soap said it was trees a wood mike said it was a painting of an iceberg when soap thinks about the zombies he thinks about how theres nowhere you can go that the zombies wont find you even the fairy tales that becka used to read to him ali baba and the forty zombies open zombie snow white and the seven tiny zombies any place will thinks of the zombies will eventually get there too he pictures all of these places as paintings in a gallery because as long as a place is just a painting its a safe place landscapes with frames around them to keep the landscapes from leaking out to keep the zombies from getting in a ski resort in summer all those lonely gondolas an oil rig on a sea at night the museum of natural history the playboy mansion the eiffel tower the matterhorn david lettermans house buckingham palace a bowling alley a laundromat he puts himself in the painting of the flower garden thats hanging above the bed where he and carly are sitting and its sunny and warm and safe and beautiful but once he puts himself into the painting the zombies show up just like they always do the space station new zealand he bets his dad thinks hes safe from zombies in new zealand because its an island his dad is an idiot people paint trees all the time all kinds of trees art is supposed to be about things like trees or icebergs although there are more paintings of trees than there are paintings of icebergs so mike doesnt know what hes talking about i wasnt in prison for very long soap says what mike and i did wasnt really that bad we didnt hurt anybody you dont look like a bad guy carly says and when soap looks at carly she looks like a nice kid a nice girl with nice tits but soap knows you cant tell by looking soap and mike were going to be rich once they got out of college the two of them had it all figured out they were going to have an excellent website just as soon as they figured out what it was going to be about and what to call it while they were in prison they decided this website would have been about zombies that would have been fucking awesome hungryzombiecom lonelyzombiecom nakedzombiecom soyoumarriedazombiecom zombiecontingencyplancom dotcomofthewalkingdeadcom were just a few of the names they came up with in wills opinion people will go anywhere if theres a zombie involved cool people would have gone to the site and hooked up people would have talked about old horror movies or about their horrible temp jobs there would have been comics and concerts there would have been advertising sponsors movie deals soap would have been able to afford art he would have bought picassos and vermeers and original comic book art he would have bought drinks for women beautiful bisexual bionic women with unpronounceable names and weird habits in bed only by the time soap and mike and the rest of their friends got out of school all of that was already over nobody cared if you had a website everybody already had websites no one was going to give you money there were lots of guys who knew how to do what soap and mike knew how to do it turned out that mikes and soaps parents had paid a lot of money for them to learn how to do things that everyone could already do mike had a girlfriend named jenny soap liked jenny because she teased him but jenny really isnt important to this story she wasnt ever going to fall in love with soap and soap knew it what matters is that jenny worked in a museum and so soap and mike started going to museum events because you got brie on crackers and wine and martinis free food all you had to do was wear a suit and listen to people talk about art and mortgages and their children there would be a lot of older women who reminded soap of his mother and it was clear that soap reminded these women of their sons what was never clear was whether these women were flirting with him or whether they wanted his advice about something that even they couldnt put their finger on one morning in prison soap woke up and realized that the opportunity had been there and hed never even seen it he and mike they could have started a website for older uppermiddleclass women with strong work ethics and confused resentful grownup children with bachelor degrees and no jobs that was better than zombies they could even have done some good okay will says ill tell you why i went to prison but first you have to tell me what youd do if zombies showed up at your party tonight i ask everyone this everyone has a zombie contingency plan you mean like with colleges just in case you dont get into your first choice carly says she holds an eyelid open puts her finger to her eyeball and pops out a contact lens she puts it on the table beside the bed she doesnt take the other lens out maybe that eye isnt scratchy so my eyes arent actually green the breasts are real by the way i dont watch a lot of horror movies they give me nightmares leo likes that stuff will sits on the other side of the bed and watches her shes thinking about it maybe she likes how the world looks through one green contact lens my parents keep a gun in the fridge i guess id go get it and shoot the zombies or maybe id hide in my moms closet behind all her shoes and stuff id cry a lot id scream for help id call the police okay will says i was just wondering what about your brother how would you protect him carly yawns like she isnt impressed at all but

leo over on your parents dresser okay carly says this is my parents bedroom theyre in france building bicycles and they left me and they left leo here so i threw a party serves them right if someone burns their house down i feel like weve known each other for a long time will says even though we just met for example i knew your eyes werent really green we dont really know each other very well carly says but she says it in a friendly way i keep trying to get to know you better i bet you didnt know that i want to be president someday i bet you didnt know that i think about icebergs a lot although not as much as i think about zombies will says id like to go live on an iceberg carly says and id like to be president too maybe i could do both i could be the first black woman president who lives on an iceberg id vote for you will says will carly says dont you want to get under the covers with me are you intimidated by the fact that im going to be president someday are you intimidated by competent successful women will says do you want to fool around or do you want me to tell how i ended up in prison door a or door b im a really good kisser but leo is asleep under the bed your brother jenny and mike used to go off and kiss in the museum where jenny worked but soap never kissed jenny once in college soap kissed mike they were both drunk men kissed men in prison white men made out with black men becka used to make out with her boyfriends out on the beach while her brother hid in the dunes and watched in the zombie movie a zombie ate beckas lips you dont ever want to kiss a zombie hes a heavy sleeper carly says maybe you should just tell me what you did and we can go from there soap and mike and a couple of their friends were at one of the parties at the little private museum where jenny worked they drank a lot of wine and they didnt eat much except some olives jenny was busy and so soap and mike and their friends left the gallery where the wine and cheese were laid out where the docents and the rich people were getting to know each other and wandered out into the rest of the museum they got farther and farther away from jennys event but nobody told them to come back and nobody showed up and asked them what they were doing the other galleries were dark and so somebody dared mike to go in one of them they wanted to see if an alarm would go off mike did and the alarm didnt next soap went into the gallery his name wasnt soap then his name was arthur but everybody called him art ha ha you couldnt see anything in the gallery art felt stupid just standing there so he put his hands straight out in front of him in the darkness and walked forward until his fingers touched a wall he kept his fingers on the wall and walked around the room every now and then his fingers would touch a frame and hed move his hand up and down and along the frame to see how big the painting was he walked all the way around the room until he was at the door again then somebody else went in it was markson who went in and when markson came out he was holding a painting in his arms it was about three feet by three feet a painting of a ship with a lot of masts and sails lots of little dabs of blue little people on the deck of the ship looking busy holy shit mike said markson what did you just do you have to understand that markson was an idiot everyone knew that right then he was a drunk idiot but everyone else was drunk too i just wanted to see what it looked like markson said i didnt think it would be so heavy he put the painting down against the wall no alarms were going off the gallery on the other side of the hall was dark too so they made it a game everyone went into one of the galleries and walked around and chose a painting then you came out again and saw what you had someone got a seurat someone had a mary cassatt someone else had a winslow homer there were a lot of paintings by artists whom none of them knew so those didnt count art went back into the first gallery this time he was slow there were already some gaps on the gallery wall he put his ear up against some of the paintings he felt that he was listening for something only he didnt know what he chose a very small painting when he got it out into the hall he saw it was an oil painting a blobby bluegreen mass that might have been water or a person or it might have been trees woods from very far away something slow and far away he couldnt read the artists signature mike was in the other gallery when he came out with a painting the painting turned out to be a picasso some sadlooking freaky woman and her sadlooking freaky dog everyone agreed that mike had won then that idiot markson said i bet you cant walk out of here with that picasso sometimes when hes in houses that dont belong to him soap feels bad he shouldnt be where he is he doesnt belong anywhere nobody really knows him if they did they wouldnt like him everyone always seems happier than soap and as if they know something that soap doesnt he tells himself that things will be different when the zombies show up you guys stole a picasso carly says it was a minor picasso hardly a picasso at all we werent really stealing it will says we just thought it would be funny to smuggle it out of jennys museum and see how far we got with it we just walked out of the museum and nobody stopped us we put the picasso in the car and drove back to our apartment i took that little painting too just so the picasso would have company and because i wanted to spend some more time looking at it i put it under my coat under one arm while the other guys were helping mike get past the party without being seen we hung the picasso in the living room when we got back and i put the little painting in my bedroom we were still drunk when the police showed up jenny lost her job we went to prison markson and the other guys had to do community service he stops talking carly takes his hand she squeezes it she says thats the weirdest story ive ever heard why is it that everything is so much sadder and funnier and so much more true when youre drunk i havent told you the weird part yet will says he cant tell her the weirdest part of the story although maybe he can try to show her did i tell you that i used to be on my schools debate team carly says thats the weirdest thing about me i like getting in arguments the boy with his head under my chair i kicked his ass in a debate about marijuana i humiliated him all over the map will doesnt use drugs anymore its too much like being in a museum it makes everything look like art and makes everything feel like just before the zombies show up he says the museum said that i hadnt stolen the little painting from them they said it wasnt theirs even when i explained the whole thing i told the truth and everyone thought i was lying the police asked around just in case mike and i had done the same thing somewhere else at some other museum and nobody came forward nobody knew the artists name so finally they just gave the painting back to me they thought i was trying to pull some scam so what happened to it carly says ive still got it my sister kept it for me while i was in prison will says for two years since i got out ive been trying to find a place to ditch it ive left it a couple of places but then it turns out that i havent i cant leave it behind no matter how hard i try it doesnt belong to me but i cant get rid of it my friend jessica does this thing she calls shopleaving carly says when someone gives her a hideous shirt for her birthday or if she buys a book and its not any good she goes into a store and leaves the shirt on a hanger she leaves the book on the shelf once she took this crazy mean parakeet to a shoe store and put him in a shoebox what happened to your friend mike he went to seattle he started up a website for excons he got a lot of funding there are a lot of people out there who have been in prison they need websites thats nice carly says thats like a happy ending ive got the painting in the car will says do you want it i like van gogh carly says and georgia okeeffe let me go get it will says he goes downstairs before she can stop him the guys on the couch are watching somebodys wedding video now he wonders what they would think if they knew carly was upstairs in bed waiting for him the dancing girl is in the kitchen with the boy under the table the girl in the dress is out on the lawn she isnt doing anything except maybe looking at stars she watches will go to his car open the trunk and take out the little painting out behind the house will can hear people in the pool will hasnt felt this peaceful in a long time its like that first slow part in a horror movie before the bad thing happens will knows that sometimes you shouldnt try to anticipate the bad thing sometimes you are supposed to just listen to swimmers fooling around in a pool people you cant see the night and the moon and the girl in the dress will stands on the lawn for a while holding the painting wishing that becka was here with him or mike will takes the painting back upstairs and into the master bedroom he turns the lights off and wakes carly up shes been crying in her sleep here it is he says will carly says you turned off the light is it the ocean it looks like the ocean i cant really see anything sure you can will says theres moonlight i only have one contact lens in carly says will stands on the bed and lifts the painting of the garden off its picture hook how can a painting of some flowers be so heavy he leans it against the bed and hangs up the painting from the car iceberg zombie a bunch of trees some obscured and unknowable thing how are you supposed to tell what it is it makes him want to die sometimes there you go he says its yours its beautiful carly says will thinks maybe shes crying again she says will will you just lie down with me for a little while sometimes soap has this dream he isnt sure whether its a prison dream or a dream about art or a dream about zombies maybe it isnt about any of those things he dreams that hes in a dark room sometimes its an enormous room very long and narrow sometimes there are people in it leaning silently up against the walls he can only figure out if there are people or how big the room is when he stretches out his arms and walks forward he has no idea what theyre doing in the room with him he has no idea what hes supposed to do either sometimes its a very small room its dark its dark hey kid hey leo wake up leo we gotta go soap is lying on the floor beside the bed holding up the dust ruffle he has to whisper carly is asleep on the toobig bed under the covers leo uncurls he wriggles forward towards will then he wiggles back again away

everyone loves her even her parents her parents are so proud of her when she wakes up the first thing she seesbefore she sees all the other things that are missing besides the oil painting of the woods that nobody lives in nobody painted and nobody stoleis the empty space on the wall in the bedroom above her parents bed death and suffrage by dale baileydale bailey is the author of the novels the fallen house of bones and sleeping policemen with jack slay jr his short stories have appeared in the magazine of fantasy science fiction amazing stories and sci fiction he has also written a nonfiction book american nightmares the haunted house formula in american popular fiction this story won the international horror guild award and was adapted into an episode of the television series masters of horror bailey has also twice been nominated for the nebula award in his collection the resurrection mans legacy bailey says that due to the realworld events that mirrored the events of this story death and suffrage seems to confirm the dictum that the writer of fiction can no longer compete with the strangeness of contemporary reality its also an example of how completely a writers intentions can go awry in keeping with the pun in the title i intended this one to be short and light bailey says but somewhere along the way it turned long and very dark indeed its funny how things happen burton used to tell me the very moment youre engaged in some task of mindnumbing insignificancecutting your toenails maybe or fishing in the sofa for the remotethe world is being refashioned around you you stand before a mirror to brush your teeth and halfway around the planet flood waters are on the rise every minute of every day the world transforms itself in ways you can hardly imagine and there you are sitting in traffic or wondering whats for lunch or just staring blithely out a window history happens while youre making other plans burton always says i guess i know that now i guess we all know that me i was in a sixthfloor chicago office suite working on my r√©sum√© when it started the usual chaos swirled around mephones braying people scurrying about the televisions singing exit poll data over the dinbut it all had a forced artificial quality the campaign was over our numbers people had told us everything we needed to know when the polls opened that morning stoddard was up seventeen points so there i sat dejected and soon to be unemployed with my feet on a rented desk and my laptop propped against my knees mulling over synonyms for directed as in directed a staff of fifteen as in directed public relations for the democratic national committee as in directed a national political campaign straight into the toilet then cnn started emitting the little overture that means somewhere in the world history is happening just like burton always says i looked up as lewis turned off the television whatd you do that for lewis leaned over to shut my computer down ill show you he said i followed him through the suite past clumps of people huddled around televisions nobody looked my way nobody had looked me in the eye since sunday i tried to listen but over the shocked buzz in the room i couldnt catch much more than snatches of unscripted anchorspeak i didnt see burton and i supposed he was off drafting his concession speech no sense delaying the inevitable he had told me that morning what gives i said to lewis in the hall but he only shook his head lewis is a big man fifty with the drooping posture and hangdog expression of an adolescent he stood in the elevator and watched the numbers cycle rubbing idly at an acne scar he had lots of them a whole face pitted from what had to be among the worst teenage years in human history i had never liked him much and i liked him even less right then but you couldnt help admiring the intelligence in his eyes if burton had been elected lewis would have served him well now hed be looking for work instead the doors slid apart and lewis steered me through the lobby into a typical november morning in chicago a diamondtipped wind boring in from the lake a bruised sky spitting something that couldnt decide whether it wanted to be rain or snow i grew up in southern californiamy grandparents raised meand theres not much i hate more than chicago weather but that morning i stood there with my shirtsleeves rolled to the elbow and my tie whipping over my shoulder and i didnt feel a thing my god i said and for a moment my mind just locked up all i could think was that not two hours ago i had stood in this very spot watching burton work the crowd and then the world had still been sane afterwards burton had walked down the street to cast his ballot when he stepped out of the booth the press had been waiting burton charmed them the consummate politician even in defeat we could have done great things and even then the world had still been sane no longer it took me a moment to sort it all outthe pedestrians shouldering by with wild eyes the bellhop standing dumbfounded before the hotel on the corner his chin bobbing at halfmast three taxis had tangled up in the street bleeding steam and farther up the block loomed an overturned bus the size of a beached plesiosaur somewhere a woman was screaming atonally over and over and over with staccato hitches for breath sirens wailed in the distance a tv crew was getting it all on tape and for the first time since i blew burtons chance to hold the highest office in the land i stood in the presence of a journalist who wasnt shoving a mike in my face to ask me what had come over me i was too stunned even to enjoy it instead like lewis beside me i just stared across the street at the polling place dead people had gathered there fifteen or twenty of them and more arriving even then there was never any question in my mind that they were dead you could see it in the way they held their bodies stiff as marionettes in their shuffling gaits and the bright haunted glaze of their eyes you could see it in the lacerations yawning open on the ropy coils of their guts in their random nakedness their haphazard clotheshospital gowns and bloodstained blue jeans and immaculate suits fresh from unsealed caskets you could see it in the dark patches of decay that blossomed on their flesh you could just see that they were dead it was every zombie movie you ever saw and then some gooseflesh erupted along my arms and it had nothing to do with the wind off lake michigan my god i said again when i finally managed to unlock my brain what do they want they want to vote said lewis the dead have been voting in chicago elections since long before richard j daley took office one wag wrote in the next mornings tribune but yesterdays events bring a whole new meaning to the tradition ill say the dead had voted all right and not just in chicago they had risen from hospital gurneys and autopsy slabs from open coffins and embalming tables in every precinct in the nation and they had cast their ballots largely without interference who was going to stop them more than half the pollworkers had abandoned ship when the zombies started shambling through the doors and even workers who stayed at their posts had usually permitted them to do as they pleased the dead didnt threaten anyonethey didnt do much of anything youd expect zombies to do in fact but most people found that inscrutable gaze unnerving better to let them cast their ballots than bear for long the knowing light in those strange eyes and when the ballots were counted we learned something else as well they voted for burton every last one of them voted for burton its your fault lewis said at breakfast the next day everyone else agreed with him i could tell the entire senior staff harried and sleepdeprived they studied their food as he ranted or scrutinized the conference table or scribbled frantic notes in their dayplanners anything to avoid looking me in the eye even burton alone at the head of the table just munched on a bagel and stared at cnn the muted screen aflicker with footage of zombies staggering along on their unfathomable errands toward dawn as the final tallies rolled in from the western districts they had started to gravitate toward cemeteries no one yet knew why my fault i said but my indignation was manufactured about five that morning waking from nightmare in my darkened hotel room i had arrived at the same conclusion as everyone else the goddamn talk show lewis said as if that explained everything and maybe it did the goddamn talk show in question was none other than crossfire and the sunday before the polls opened i got caught in it i had broken the first commandment of political life a commandment i had flogged relentlessly for the last year stay on message stick to the talking points thou shalt not speak from the heart the occasion of this amateurish mistake was a sixyearold girl named dana maguire three days before i went on the air a fiveyearold boy gunned dana down in her afterschool program the kid had found the pistol in his fathers nightstand and just as danas mother was coming in to pick her up he tugged it from his insulated lunch sack and shot dana in the neck she died in her mothers arms while the fiveyearold looked on in tears just your typical day in america except the first time i saw danas photo in the news i felt something kick a hole in my chest i can remember the moment to this day october light slanting through hotel windows the television on low while i talked to my grandmother in california i dont have much in the way of family there had been an uncle on my fathers side but he had drifted out of my life after my folks died leaving my mothers parents to raise me theres just the two of us since my grandfather passed on five years ago and even in the heat of a campaign i try to check on gran every day mostly she rattles on about old folks in the home a litany of names and ailments i can barely keep straight at the best of times and that afternoon halfwatching some glib cnn hardbody do a standup in front of little tykes academy i lost the thread of her words altogether next thing i know shes saying robert robert in this troubled voice and me im sitting on a hotel bed in dayton ohio weeping for a little girl i never heard of grief shock you name itten years in public life nothing like that had ever happened to me before but after that i couldnt think of it in political terms after that dana maguire was personal predictably the whole thing came up on crossfire joe stern stoddards campaign director and a man ive known for years leaned into the camera and espoused the usual lineyou know the one about the constitutional right to bear arms as if jefferson had personally foreseen the rapidfire semiautomatic with a sixteenround clip coming from the mouth of joe stern a smug fleshy ideologue who ought to have known better this line enraged me even so i hardly recognized the voice that responded to him i felt as though something else was speaking through meas though a voice had possessed me a speaker from that broken hole in the center of my chest what it said that voice was if grant burton is elected hell see that every handgun in the united states is melted into pig iron hell do everything in his power to save the dana maguires of this nation joe stern puffed up like a toad this isnt about dana maguire the voice interrupted him if theres any justice in the universe dana maguire will rise up from her grave to haunt you the voice said it said if its not about dana maguire then what on earth is it about stoddard had new ads in saturation before the day was out burtons face my words in voiceover if grant burton is elected hell see that every handgun in the united states is melted into pig iron by monday afternoon we had plummeted six points and lewis wasnt speaking to me i couldnt seem to shut him up now though he leaned across the table and jabbed a thick finger at me overturning a styrofoam cup of coffee i watched the black pool spread as he shouted we were up five points we had it won before you opened your goddamn angela dey our chief pollster interrupted him look she said pointing at the television burton touched the volume button on the remote but the image on the screen was clear enough a cemetery in upstate new york one of the new ones where the stones are set flush to the earth to make mowing easier three or four zombies had fallen to their knees by a fresh grave good god dey whispered what are they doing no one gave her an answer and i suppose she hadnt expected one she could see as well as the rest of us what was happening the dead were scrabbling at the earth with their bare hands a line from some old poem i had read in college ahh whos digging on my grave lodged in my head rattling around like angry candy and for the first time i had a taste of the hysteria that would possess us all by the time this was done graves had opened the dead walked the earth all humanity trembled ahh whos digging on my grave lewis flung himself back against his chair and glared at me balefully this is all your fault at least they voted for us i said not that we swept into the white house at the head of a triumphal procession of zombies anything but actually the voting rights of the dead turned out to be a serious constitutional question and stoddard lodged a complaint with the federal election commission dead people had no say in the affairs of the living he argued and besides none of them were legally registered anyway sensing defeat the democratic national committee countersued claiming that the sheer presence of the dead may have kept legitimate voters from the polls while the courts pondered these issues in silence the world convulsed church attendance soared the president impaneled experts and blueribbon commissions the senate held hearings the cdc convened a task force to search for biological agents at the un the security council debated a quarantine against the united states the stock market lost fifteen percent on the news meanwhile the dead went unheeding about their business they never spoke or otherwise attempted to communicate yet you could sense an intelligence inhuman and remote behind their mass resurrection they spent the next weeks opening fresh graves releasing the recently buried from entombment with bare hands they clawed away the dirt through sheer numbers they battered apart the concrete vaults and sealed caskets you would see them in the streets stinking of formaldehyde and putrefaction their hands torn and ragged the rich earth of the grave impacted under their fingernails their numbers swelled people died but they didnt stay dead the newly resurrected kept busy at their graves a week after the balloting the supreme court handed down a decision overturning the election congress meeting in emergency session set a new date for the first week of january if nothing else the year debacle in florida had taught us the virtue of speed lewis came to my hotel room at dusk to tell me were in business he said when i didnt answer he took a chair across from me we stared over the fogshrouded city in silence far out above the lake threads of rain seamed the sky good news for the dead the digging would go easier lewis turned the bottle on the table so he could read the label i knew what it was glenfiddich a good single malt id been sipping it from a hotel tumbler most of the afternoon whynt you turn on some lights in here lewis said im fine in the dark lewis grunted after a moment he fetched the other glass he wiped it out with his handkerchief and poured so tell me lewis tilted his glass grimaced january fourth the president signed the bill twenty minutes ago protective cordons fifty yards from polling stations only the living can vote jesus i cant believe im even saying that he cradled his long face in his hands so you in does he want me yes what about you lewis do you want me lewis said nothing we just sat there breathing in the woodsy aroma of the scotch watching night bleed into the sky you screwed me at staff meeting the other day i said you hung me out to dry in front of everyone it wont work if you keep cutting the ground out from under my feet goddamnit i was right in ten seconds you destroyed everything weve worked for we had it won oh come on lewis if crossfire never happened it could have gone either way five points thats nothing we were barely outside the plus and minus you know that still whyd you have to say that i thought about that strange sense id had at the time another voice speaking through me mouthpiece of the dead you ever think about that little girl lewis he sighed yeah yeah i do he lifted his glass look if youre angling for some kind of apology i dont want an apology good he said then grudgingly we need you on this one rob you know that january i said that gives us almost two months were way up right now stoddard will make a run wait and see yeah lewis touched his face it was dark but i could sense the gesture hed be fingering his acne scars id spent enough time with him to know that i dont know though he said i think the right might sit this one out they think its the fuckin rapture whos got time for politics well see he took the rest of his scotch in a gulp and stood yeah well see i didnt move as he showed himself out just watched his reflection in the big plate glass window he opened the door and turned to look back a tall man framed in light from the hall his face lost in shadow rob yeah you all right i drained my glass and swished the scotch around in my mouth im having a little trouble sleeping these days i wanted to say im having these dreams but all i said was im fine lewis im just fine i wasnt though not really none of us were i guess but even nowmaybe especially nowthe thing i remember most about those first weeks is how little the resurrection of the dead altered our everyday lives isolated incidents made the newsi remember a serial killer being arrested as his victims heaved themselves bodily from their shallow backyard gravesbut mostly people just carried on after the initial shock markets stabilized stores filled up with thanksgiving turkeys radio stations began counting the shopping days until christmas yet i think the hysteria must have been there all along like a swift current just beneath the surface of a placid lake an undertow the kind of current thatll kill you if youre not careful most people looked okay but scratch the surface and we were all going nuts in a thousand quiet ways ahh whos digging on my grave and all that me i couldnt sleep the stress of the campaign had been mounting steadily even before my meltdown on crossfire and in those closing days with the polls in californiaand all those lovely delegatesa hair too close to call id been waking grainyeyed and yawning every morning i was feeling guilty too three years ago gran broke her hip and landed in a long beach nursing home and while i talked to her daily i could never manage to steal a day or two to see her despite all the time we spent campaigning in california but the resurrection of the dead marked a new era in my insomnia stumbling to bed late on election night my mind blistered with images of zombies in the streets i fell into a fevered dream i found myself wandering through an abandoned city everything burned with the tenebrous significance of dreamsevery brick and stone the scraps of newsprint tumbling down highrise canyons the darkness pooling in the mouths of desolate subways but the worst thing of all was the sound the lone sound in all that sea of silence the obscurely terrible cadence of a faraway clock impossibly magnified echoing down empty alleys and forsaken avenues the air rang with it haunting me drawing me on at last into a district where the buildings loomed over steep close streets admitting only a narrow wedge of sky an open door beckoned a black slot in a high thin house i pushed open the gate climbed the broken stairs paused in the threshold a colossal grandfather clock towered within its hands poised a minute short of midnight transfixed i watched the heavy pendulum sweep through its arc driving home the hour the massive hands stood upright the air shattered around me the very stones shook as the clock began to toll clapping my hands over my ears i turned to flee but there was nowhere to go in the yard in the streetas far as i could seethe dead had gathered they stood there while the clock stroked out the hours staring up at me with those haunted eyes and i knew suddenly and absolutelythe way you know things in dreamsthat they had come for me at last that they had always been coming for me for all of us if only we had known it i woke then coldly afraid the first gray light of morning slit the drapes but i had a premonition that no dawn was coming or at least a very different dawn from any i had ever dared imagine stoddard made his run with two weeks to go december fourteenth were feet over the midwest in a leased boeing and angela dey drops the new numbers on us gentleman she says weve hit a little turbulence it was a turning point i can see that now at the time though none of us much appreciated her little joke the resurrection of the dead had shaken things upit had put us on top for a month or sobut stoddard had been clawing his way back for a couple of weeks crucifying us in the farm belt on a couple of ag bills where burton cast deciding votes hammering us in the south on vouchers we knew that of course but i dont think any of us had foreseen just how close things were becoming were up seven points in california dey said the gay votes keeping our heads above water but the numbers are soft stoddards got momentum christ lewis said but dey was already passing around another sheet it gets worse she said florida were up two points a statistical dead heat weve got the minorities stoddard has the seniors everythings riding on turnout libby dixon burtons press secretary cleared her throat weve got a pretty solid network among hispanics dey shook her head seniors win that one every time hispanics never vote lewis said we might as well wrap florida up with a little bow and send it to stoddard dey handed around another sheet shed orchestrated the moment for maximum impact doling it out one sheet at a time like that lewis slumped in his seat probing his scars as she worked her way through the list michigan new york ohio all three delegate rich all three of them neckandneck races three almost physical blows too you could see them in the faces ranged around the table what the hells going on here lewis muttered as dey passed out another sheet and then the news out of texas rendered even him speechless stoddard had us by six points i ran through a couple of alamo analogies before deciding that discretion was the better part of wisdom i thought we were gaining there lewis said dey shrugged i just read the numbers i dont make them up things could be worse libby dixon said yeah but robs not allowed to do crossfire any more lewis said and a titter ran around the table lewis is good ill give him that you could feel the tension ease suggestions burton said dey said ive got some focus group stuff on education i was thinking maybe some ads clarifying our hell with the ads someone else said weve gotta spend more time in florida weve got to engage stoddard on his ground maybe a series of town meetings lewis said and they went around like that for a while i tried to listen but lewiss little icebreaker had reminded me of the dreams i knew where i was feet of dead air below me winging my way toward a rally in virginiabut inside my head i hadnt gone anywhere at all inside my head i was stuck in the threshold of that dream house staring out into the eyes of the dead the world had changed irrevocably i thought abruptly that seems selfevident i suppose but at the time it had the quality of genuine revelation the fact is we had alland i mean everyone by that the entire culture not just the campaignwe had all been pretending that nothing much had changed sure we had un debates and a cnn feed right out of a george romero movie but the implications of mass resurrectionthe spiritual implicationshad yet to bear down upon us we were in denial in that moment with the plane rolling underneath me and someonetyler oneill i think it was libby dixons mousy assistantdroning on about going negative i thought of something id heard a professor mention back at northwestern copernicus formulated the heliocentric model of the solar system in the mids but the church didnt get around to punishing anyone for it until they threw galileo in jail nearly a hundred years later they spent the better part of a century trying to ignore the fact that the fundamental geography of the universe had been altered with a single stroke and so it had again the dead walked three simple words but everything else paled beside themsocial security campaign finance reform education vouchers everything i wadded deys sheet into a noisy ball and flung it across the table tyler oneill stuttered and choked and for a moment everyone just stared in silence at that wad of paper youd have thought id hurled a hand grenade not a twoparagraph summary of voter idiocy in the lone star state libby dixon cleared her throat i hardly thin shut up libby i said listen to yourselves for christs sake we got zombies in the street and you guys are worried about going negative the whole dey flapped her hand zombie thing its not even on the radar my numbers people lie angela libby dixon swallowed audibly when it comes to death sex and money everybody lies a total stranger calls up on the telephone and you expect some soccer mom to share her feelings about the fact that grandpas rotten corpse is staggering around in the street i had their attention all right for a minute the plane filled up with the muted roar of the engines no human sound at all and then burtonburton smiled what are you thinking rob a great presidency is a marriage between a man and a moment i said you told me that remember i remember this is your moment sir you have to stop running away from it what do you have in mind lewis asked i answered the question but i never even looked lewiss way as i did it i just held grant burtons gaze it was like no one else was there at all like it was just the two of us and despite everything thats happened since thats the closest ive ever come to making history i want to find dana maguire i said id been in politics since my second year at northwestern it was nothing i ever intendedwho goes off to college hoping to be a senate aidebut i was idealistic and i liked the things grant burton stood for so i found myself working the phones that fall as an unpaid volunteer one thing led to anotheran internship on the hill a postgraduate job as a research assistantand somehow i wound up inside the beltway i used to wonder how my life might have turned out had i chosen another path my senior year at northwestern i went out with a girl named gwen a junior freckled and streaky blonde with the kind of sturdy good looks that fall a hair short of beauty partnered in some forgettable lab exercise we found we had grown up within a half hour of one another simple geographic coincidence two californians stranded in the frozen north sustained us throughout the winter and into the spring but we drifted in the weeks after graduation and the last i had heard of her was a christmas card five or six years back i remember opening it and watching a scrap of paper slip to the floor her address and phone number back home in laguna beach with a little note call me sometime it said but i never did so there it was i was thirtytwo years old i lived alone id never held a relationship together longer than eight months gran was my closest friend and i saw her three times a year if i was lucky i went to my ten year class reunion in evanston and everybody there was in a different lifeplace than i was they all had kids and homes and churches me i had my job twelve hour days five days a week saturdays i spent three or four hours at the office catching up sundays i watched the talk shows and then it was time to start all over again that had been my routine for nearly a decade and in all those years i never bothered to ask myself how i came to be there it never even struck me as the kind of thing a person ought to ask four years ago during burtons reelection campaign for the senate lewis said a funny thing to me were sitting in a hotel bar drinking miller lite and eating peanuts when he turns to me and says you got anyone rob got anyone you know a girlfriend a fianc√©e somebody you care about gwen flickered at the edge of my consciousness but that was all a flicker nothing more i said no thats good lewis said it was just the kind of thing he always said sarcastic a little meanhearted usually i let it pass but that night i had just enough alcohol zipping through my veins to call him on it whats that supposed to mean lewis turned to look at me i was going to say you have someone you really care aboutsomebody you want to spend your life withyou might want to walk away from all this whys that this job doesnt leave enough room for relationships he finished his beer and pushed the bottle away his gaze steady and clear in the dim light his scars were invisible and i saw him then as he could have been in a better world for maybe a moment lewis was one step short of handsome and then the moment broke good night he said and turned away a few months after thatnot long before burton won his second sixyear senate termlibby dixon told me lewis was getting a divorce i suppose he must have known the marriage was coming apart around him but at the time nothing like that even occurred to me after lewis left i just sat at the bar running those words over in my mind this job doesnt leave enough room for relationships he had said and i knew he had intended it as a warning but what i felt instead was a bottomless sense of relief i was perfectly content to be alone burton was doing an event in st louis when the nursing home called to say that gran had fallen again eightyoneyearold bones are fragile and the last time i had been out therejust after the conventiongrans case manager had privately informed me that another fall would probably do it do what i had asked the case manager looked away she shuffled papers on her desk while her meaning bore in on me another fall would kill her i suppose i must have known this at some level but to hear it articulated so baldly shook me from the time i was four gran had been the single stable institution in my life i had been visiting in long beach half a continent from home when my familymy parents and sisterdied in the car crash it took the state police back in pennsylvania nearly a day to track me down i still remember the moment grans masklike expression as she hung up the phone her hands cold against my face as she knelt before me she made no sound as she wept tears spilled down her cheeks leaving muddy tracks in her makeup but she made no sound at all i love you robert she said she said you must be strong thats my first true memory of my parents my sister i remember nothing at all i have a snapshot of them at a beach somewhere maybe six months before i was born my father lean and smoking my mother smiling her abdomen just beginning to swell in the picture aliceshe would have been four thenstands just in front of them a happy blonde child cradling a plastic shovel when i was a kid i used to stare at that photo wondering how you can miss people you never even knew i did though an almost physical ache way down inside me the kind of phantom pain amputees must feel a ghost of that old pain squeezed my heart as the case manager told me about grans fall we got lucky she said shes going to be in a wheelchair a month or two but shes going to be okay afterwards i talked to gran herself her voice thin and querulous addled with pain killers robert she said i want you to come out here i want to see you i want to see you too i said but i cant get away right now as soon as the elections over im an old woman she told me crossly i may not be here after the election i managed a laugh at that but the laugh sounded hollow even in my own ears the words had started a grim little movie unreeling in my heada snippet of grans cold body staggering to its feet that somehow inhuman tomb light shining out from behind its eyes i suppose most of us must have imagined something like that during those weeks but it unnerved me all the same it reminded me too much of the dreams it felt like i was there again gazing out into the faces of the implacable dead that enormous clock banging out the hours robert gran was saying and i could hear the demerol singing in her voice are you there ro and for no reason at all i said did my parents have a clock gran a clock a grandfather clock she was silent so long i thought maybe she had hung up that was your uncles clock she said finally her voice thick and distant my uncle don she said on your fathers side what happened to the clock robert i want you to come out he what happened to the clock gran well how would i know she said he couldnt keep it could he i suppose he must have sold it what do you mean but she didnt answer i listened to the swell and fall of demerol sleep for a moment and then the voice of the case manager filled my ear shes drifted off if you want i can call back later i looked up as a shadow fell across me lewis stood in the doorway no thats okay ill call her in the morning i hung up the phone and stared over the desk at him he had a strange expression on his face what i said its dana maguire what about her theyve found her eight hours later i touched down at logan under a cloudy midnight sky we had hired a private security firm to find her and one of their agentsan expressionless man with the build of an exathletemet me at the gate you hook up with the ad people all right i asked in the car and from the way he answered a monosyllabic fine you could tell what he thought of ad people the crews in place theyre already rigging the lights howd you find her he glanced at me streetlight shadow rippling across his face like water dead people aint got much imagination soons we get the fresh ones in the ground theyre out there digging he laughed humorlessly youd think peopled stop burying em its the ritual i guess maybe he paused then finding her we put some guys on the cemeteries and kept our eyes open thats all whyd it take so long for a moment there was no sound in the car but the hum of tires on pavement and somewhere far away a siren railing against the night the agent rolled down his window and spat emphatically into the slipstream city the size of boston he said it has a lot of fucking cemeteries the cemetery in question turned out to be everything i could have hoped for remote and unkempt with weathered gothic tombstones right off a hollywood back lot and wouldnt it be comforting to think so i remember thinking as i got out of the carthe ring of lights atop the hill nothing more than stage dressing the old world as it had been always but it wasnt of course and the ragged figures digging at the grave werent actors either you could smell them for one the stomachwrenching stench of decay a light rain had begun to fall too and it had the feel of a genuine boston drizzle cold and steady toward the bleak fag end of december andy the director turned when he heard me any trouble i asked no they dont care much what were about long as we dont interfere good andy pointed there she is see yeah i see her she was on her knees in the grass still wearing the dress she had been buried in she dug with singleminded intensity her arms caked with mud to the elbow her face empty of anything remotely human i stood and stared at her for a while trying to decide what it was i was feeling you all right andy said what i said are you all right for a second there i thought you were crying no i said im fine its the rain thats all right so i stood there and halflistened while he filled me in he had several cameras running multiple filters and angles he was playing with the lights he told me all this and none of it meant anything at all to me none of it mattered as long as i got the footage i wanted until then there was nothing for me here he must have been thinking along the same lines for when i turned to go he called after me say rob you neednt have come out tonight you know i looked back at him the rain pasting my hair against my forehead and running down into my eyes i shivered i know i said a moment later i added i justi wanted to see her somehow but andy had already turned away i still remember the campaign ad my own private nightmare dressed up in cinematic finery andy and i cobbled it together on christmas eve and just after midnight in a darkened boston studio we cracked open a bottle of bourbon in celebration and sat back to view the final cut i felt a wave of nausea roll over me as the first images flickered across the monitor andy had shot the whole thing from distorted angles in grainy black and white the film just a hair overexposed to sharpen the contrast sixty seconds of derivative expressionism some media critic dismissed it but even he conceded it possessed a certain power youve seen it too i suppose who hasnt she will rise from her grave to haunt you the opening title card reads and the image holds in utter silence for maybe half a second too long long enough to be unsettling andy said and you could imagine distracted viewers all across the heartland perking up wondering what the hell was wrong with the sound the words dissolve into an image of hands bloodless and pale gouging at moist black earth the hands of a child battered and raw and smeared with the filth and corruption of the grave digging digging theres something remorseless about them something relentless and terrible they could dig forever and they might you can see that and now gradually you awaken to sound rain hissing from a midnight sky the steady slither of wet earth underhand and something else a sound so perfectly lacking that its almost palpable in its absence the unearthly silence of the dead freeze frame on a tableau out of goya or bosch seven or eight zombies halfdressed and rotting laboring tirelessly over a fresh grave fade to black another slug line another slow dissolve dana maguire came back the words melt into a long shot of the child on her knees in the poison muck of the grave her dress clings to her thighs and its a dress someone has taken some care aboutwhite and lacy the kind of dress youd bury your little girl in if you had to do itand its ruined all the care and heartache that went into that dress utterly ruined torn and fouled and sopping rain slicks her blonde hair black against her skull and as the camera glides in upon dana maguires face halfshadowed and filling threequarters of the screen you can glimpse the wound at her throat flushed clean and pale dark roses of rot bloom along the high ridge of her cheekbone her eyes burn with the cold hard light of vistas you never want to see not even in your dreams the image holds for an instant a mute imperative and then mercifully fades words appear and deliquesce on an ebon screen three phrases one by onethe dead have spoken now its your turn burton for president andy touched a button a reel caught and reversed itself the screen went gray and i realized i had forgotten to breathe i sipped at my drink the whiskey burned in my throat it made me feel alive what do you think andy said i dont know i dont know what to think grinning he ejected the tape and tossed it in my lap merry christmas he said raising his glass to our savior born and so we drank again dizzy with exhaustion i made my way back to my hotel and slept for eleven hours straight i woke around noon on christmas day an hour later i was on a plane by the time i caught up to the campaign in richmond lewis was in a rage pale and apoplectic his acne scars flaring an angry red you seen these he said thrusting a sheaf of papers at me i glanced through them quicklymore bad news from angela dey burton slipping further in the pollsand then i set them aside maybe thisll help i said holding up the tape andy and i had cobbled together we watched it together all of us lewis and i the entire senior staff burton himself his face grim as the first images flickered across the screen even now viewing it for the second time i could feel its impact and i could see it in the faces of the others as welldeys jaw dropping open lewis snorting in disbelief as the screen froze on the penultimate imagedana maguires decayravaged facelibby dixon turned away theres no way we can run that she said weve got i began but dey interrupted me shes right rob its not a campaign ad its a horror movie she turned to burton drumming his fingers quietly at the head of the table you put this out there youll drop ten points i guarantee it lewis burton asked lewis pondered the issue for a moment rubbing his pitted cheek with one crooked finger i agree he said finally the ads a frigging nightmare its not the answer the ads revolting libby said the media will eat us alive for politicizing the kids death we ought to be politicizing it i said we ought to make it mean something you run that ad rob lewis said every redneck in america is going to remember you threatening to take away their guns you want to make that mistake twice is it a mistake for christs sake the dead are walking lewis the old rules dont apply i turned to libby whats stoddard say libby can you tell me that he hasnt touched it since election day exactly he hasnt said a thing not about dana maguire not about the dead people staggering around in the street ever since the fec overturned the election hes been dodging the issue because its political suicide dey said hes been dodging it because its the right thing to do bullshit i snapped its not the right thing to do its pandering and its cowardiceits moral cowardiceand if we do it we deserve to lose you could hear everything in the long silence that ensuedcars passing in the street a local staffer talking on the phone in the next room the faint tattoo of burtons fingers against the formica table top i studied him for a moment and once again i had that sense of something else speaking through me as though i were merely a conduit for another voice what do you think about guns sir i asked what do you really think burton didnt answer for a long moment when he did i think he surprised everyone at the table the death rate by handguns in this country is triple that for every other industrialized nation on the planet he said they ought to be melted into pig iron just like rob said lets go with the ad sir dey was standing ive made up my mind burton said he picked up the sheaf of papers at his elbow and shuffled through them were down in texas and california were slipping in michigan and ohio he tossed the papers down in disgust stoddard looks good in the south angela what do we got to lose we couldnt have timed it better the new ad went into national saturation on december th in the shadow of a strange new year i was watching a bowl game in my hotel room the first time i saw it on the air it chilled me all over as though id never seen it before afterwards the room filled with the sound of the ball game but now it all seemed hollow the cheers of the fans rang with a labored gaiety the crack of pads had the crisp sharpness of movie sound effects a barb of loneliness pierced me i would have called someone but i had no one to call snapping off the television i pocketed my keycard downstairs the same football game was playing but at least there was liquor and a ring of conversation in the air a few media folks from burtons entourage clustered around the bar but i begged off when they invited me to join them i sat at a table in the corner instead staring blindly at the television and drinking scotch without any hurry but without any effort to keep track either i dont know how much i drank that night but i was a little unsteady when i stood to go i had a bad moment on the way back to my room when the elevator doors slid apart i found i couldnt remember my room number i couldnt say for sure i had even chosen the right floor the hotel corridor stretched away before me bland and anonymous a hallway of locked doors behind which only strangers slept the endless weary grind of the campaign swept over me and suddenly i was sick of it allthe long midnight flights and the hotel laundries the relentless blur of cities and smiling faces i wanted more than anything else in the world to go home not my cramped apartment in the district either home wherever that was independent of my brain my fingers had found my keycard i tugged it from my pocket and studied it grimly i had chosen the right floor after all still in my clothes i collapsed across my bed and fell asleep i dont remember any dreams but sometime in the long cold hour before dawn the phone yanked me awake turn on cnn lewis said i listened to him breathe as i fumbled for the remote and cycled through the channels i punched up the volume unsubstantiated reports out of china concerning newly awakened dead in remote regions of the tibetan plateau i was awake now fully awake my head pounded i had to work up some spit before i could speak anyone got anything solid i asked im working with a guy in state for confirmation so far we got nothing but rumor if its true if its true lewis said youre gonna look like a fucking genius our numbers were soft in the morning but things were looking up by midafternoon the chinese werent talking and no one yet had footage of the tibetan deadbut rumors were trickling in from around the globe unconfirmed reports from un peacekeepers in kosovo told of women and children clawing their way free from previously unknown mass graves by new years day rumors gave way to established fact the television flickered with grainy images from groznyy and addis ababa the dead were arising in scattered locales around the world and here at home the polls were shifting burtons crowds grew larger and more enthusiastic at every rally and as our jet winged down through the night towards pittsburgh i watched stoddard answering questions about the crisis on a satellite feed from cspan he looked gray and tired his long face brimming with uncertainty he was too late we owned the issue now and watching him i could see he knew it too he was going through the motions thats all there was a celebratory hum in the air as the plane settled to the tarmac burton spoke for a few minutes at the airport and then the secret service people tightened the bubble moving us en masse toward the motorcade just before he ducked into the limo burton dismissed his entourage his hand closed about my shoulder youre with me he said he was silent as the limo slid away into the night but as the downtown towers loomed up before us he turned to look at me i wanted to thank you he said theres no he held up his hand i wouldnt have had the courage to run that ad not without you pushing me ive wondered about that you know it was like you knew something like you knew the story was getting ready to break again i could sense the question behind his wordsdid you know rob did youbut i didnt have any answers just that impression of a voice speaking through me from beyond from somewhere else and that didnt make any sense or none that i was able to share when i first got started in this business burton was saying there was a local pol back in chicago kind of a mentor he told me once you could tell what kind of man you were dealing with by the people he chose to surround himself with when i think about that i feel good rob he sighed the worlds gone crazy thats for sure but with people like you on our side i think well be all right i just wanted to tell you that thank you sir he nodded i could feel him studying me as i gazed out the window but suddenly i could find nothing to say i just sat there and watched the city slide by the past welling up inside me unpleasant truths lurked like rocks just beneath the visible surface i could sense them somehow you all right rob just thinking i said being in pittsburgh it brings back memories i thought you grew up in california i did i was born here though i lived here until my parents died how old were you four i was four years old we were at the hotel by then as the motorcade swung across two empty lanes into the driveway grans words that was your uncles clock he couldnt keep it sounded in my head the limo eased to the curb doors slammed agents slid past outside putting a protective cordon around the car the door opened and cold january air swept in burton was gathering his things sir he paused looking back tomorrow morning could i have some time alone he frowned i dont know rob the schedules pretty tight no sir i meani mean a few hours off something wrong theres a couple of things id like to look into my parents and all that just an hour or two if you can spare me he held my gaze a moment longer then thats fine rob he reached out and squeezed my shoulder just be at the airport by two that night i dreamed of a place that wasnt quite dana maguires daycare it looked like a daycarehalf a dozen squealing kids big plastic toys an indestructible grade of carpetbut certain details didnt fit the massive grandfather clock my uncles clock standing in one corner my parents dancing to big band music that seemed to emanate from nowhere i was trying to puzzle this through when i saw the kid clutching the lunch sack there was an odd expression on his face a haunted heartbroken expression and too late i understood what was about to happen i was trying to move to scream anything as he dragged the pistol out of the bag but my lips were sealed i couldnt speak glancing down i saw that i was rooted to the floor literally rooted my bare feet had grown these long knotted tendrils the carpet was twisted and raveled where they had driven themselves into the floor my parents whirled about in an athletic foxtrot their faces manic with laughter the music was building to an awful crescendo percussives bleeding seamlessly together the snap of the snare drums the terrible booming tones of the clock the quick sharp report of the gun i saw the girl go over backwards her hands clawing at her throat as she convulsed blood drenched me a spurting arterial fountaini could feel it hot against my skinand in the same moment this fiveyearold kid turned to stare at me tears streamed down his cheeks and this kidthis child really and thats all i could seem to think hes just a child hes only a child he had my face i woke then stifling a scream silence gripped the room and the corridor beyond it and beyond that the city i felt as if the world itself were drowning sunk fathoms deep in the fine and private silence of the grave i stood brushing the curtains aside an anonymous grid of lights burned beyond the glass an alien hieroglyph pulsing with enigmatic significance staring out at it i was seized by an impression of how fragile everything is how thin the barrier that separates us from the abyss i shrank from the window terrified by a sense that the world was far largerand immeasurably strangerthan the world id known before a sense of vast and formless energies churning out there in the dark i spent the next morning in the carnegie library in oakland reeling through back issues of the postgazette it didnt take long to dig up the article about the accidenti knew the date well enoughbut i wasnt quite prepared for what i found there gran had always been reticent about the wreckabout everything to do with my life in pittsburgh actuallybut id never really paused to give that much thought shed lost her family too after alla granddaughter a soninlaw her only childand even as a kid i could see why she might not want to talk about it the headline flickering on the microfilm reader rocked me though two die in fiery collision it read and before i could properly formulate the question in my mind there were three of them i was scanning the paragraphs below disconnected phrases seemed to hover above the cramped columnsbridge abutment high speed alcoholrelatedand halfway through the article the following words leapt out at me friends speculate that the accident may have been the product of a suicide pact the couple were said to be griefstricken following the death of their daughter alice nine in a bizarre shooting accident three weeks ago i stood abruptly nauseated afraid to read any further a docent approached sir are you all but i thrust her away outside traffic lumbered by stirring the slush on forbes avenue i sat on a bench and fought the nausea for a long time cradling my face in my hands while i waited for it to pass a storm was drifting in and when i felt better i lifted my face to the sky anxious for the icy burn of snow against my cheeks somewhere in the city grant burton was speaking somewhere reanimated corpses scrabbled at frozen graves the world lurched on i stood belting my coat i had a plane to catch i held myself together for two days during our final campaign swing through the midwest on january and the election that followed but i think i had already arrived at a decision most of the senior staff sensed it as well i think they congratulated me on persuading burton to run the ad but they didnt come to me for advice much in those final hours i seemed setapart somehow isolated contagious lewis clapped me on the back as we watched the returns roll in jesus rob he said youre supposed to be happy right now are you lewis i looked up at him his tall figure slumped his face a fiery map of scars what did you give up to get us here i asked but he didnt answer i hadnt expected him to the election unfolded without a hitch leaving off their work in the graveyards the dead gathered about the polling stations but even they seemed to sense that the rules had changed this time around they made no attempt to cast their ballots they just stood behind the cordons the national guard had set up still and silent regarding the proceedings with flat remorseless eyes voters scurried past them with bowed heads their faces pinched against the stench of decay on nightline ted koppel noted that the balloting had drawn the highest turnout in american history something like ninetythree percent any idea why so many voters came out today he asked the panel maybe they were afraid not to cokie roberts replied and i felt an answering chord vibrate within me trust cokie to get it right stoddard conceded soon after the polls closed in the west it was obvious by then in his victory speech burton talked about a mandate for change the people have spoken he said and they had but i couldnt help wondering what might be speaking through them and what it might be trying to say some commentators speculated that it was over now the dead would return to the graves the world would be the old world we had known but thats not the way it happened on january the dead were digging once again their numbers always swelling cnn was carrying the story when i handed burton my resignation he read it slowly and then he lifted his gaze to my face i cant accept this rob he said we need you now the hard works just getting underway im sorry sir i havent any choice surely we can work something out i wish we could we went through several iterations of this exchange before he nodded well miss you he said youll always have a place here whenever youre ready to get back in the game i was at the door when he called to me again is there anything i can do to help rob no sir i said i have to take care of this myself i spent a week in pittsburgh walking the precipitous streets of neighborhoods i remembered only in my dreams i passed a morning hunting up the house where my parents had lived and one bright cold afternoon i drove out and pulled my rental to the side of the interstate a hundred yards short of the bridge where they died eighteen wheelers thundered past throwing up glittering arcs of spray and the smell of the highway enveloped me diesel and iron it was pretty much what i had expected a slab of faceless concrete nothing more we leave no mark evenings i took solitary meals in diners and talked to gran on the telephonetranquil gossip about the old folks in the home mostly empty of anything real afterwards i drank iron city and watched cable movies until i got drunk enough to sleep i ignored the news as best i could but i couldnt help catching glimpses as i buzzed through the channels all around the world the dead were walking they walked in my dreams as well stirring memories better left forgotten mornings i woke with a sense of dread thinking of galileo thinking of the church i had urged burton to engage this brave new world yet the thought of embracing such a fundamental transformation of my own historyof following through on the article in the postgazette the portents within my dreamsparalyzed me utterly i suppose it was by then a matter mostly of verifying my own fears and suspicionssuppose i already knew at some level what i had yet to confirm but the lingering possibility of doubt was precious safe and i clung to it for a few days longer unwilling to surrender finally i could put it off no longer i drove down to the old public safety building on grant street upstairs a grizzled receptionist brought out the file i requested it was all there in untutored bureaucratic prose there was a sheaf of official photos too glossy black and white prints i didnt want to look at them but i did anyway i felt it was something i ought to do a little while later someone touched my shoulder it was the receptionist her broad face creased with concern her spectacles swung at the end of a little silver chain as she bent over me you all right she asked yes maam im fine i stood closing the file and thanked her for her time i left pittsburgh the next day shedding the cold as the plane nosed above a lid of cloud from lax i caught the south to long beach i drove with the window down grateful for the warmth upon my arm the spike of palm fronds against the sky the slipstream carried the scent of a world blossoming and fresh a future yet unmade a landscape less scarred by history than the blighted industrial streets id left behind yet even here the past lingered it was the past that had brought me here after all the nursing home was a sprawl of landscaped grounds and lowslung stucco buildings faintly spanish in design i found gran in a garden overlooking the pacific and i paused studying her before she noticed me in the doorway she held a paperback in her lap but she had left off reading to stare out across the water a saltladen breeze lifted her gray hair in wisps and for a moment looking at her her eyes clear in her distinctly boned face i could find my way back to the woman i had known as a boy but the years intervened the way they always do in the end i couldnt help noticing her wasted body or the glittering geometry of the wheelchair that enclosed her her injured leg jutted before her i must have sighed for she looked up adjusting the angle of the chair robert gran i sat by her on a concrete bench the morning overcast was breaking and the sun struck sparks from the wavetops id have thought you were too busy to visit she said now that your man has won the election im not so busy these days i dont work for him anymore what do you mean i mean i quit my job why she said i spent some time in pittsburgh ive been looking into things looking into things whatever on earth is there to look into robert she smoothed the afghan covering her thighs her fingers trembling i laid my hand across them but she pulled away gran we need to talk talk she laughed a bark of forced gaiety we talk every day look at me i said and after a long moment she did i could see the fear in her eyes then i wondered how long it had been there and why id never noticed it before we need to talk about the past the past is dead robert now it was my turn to laugh nothings dead gran turn on the television sometime nothing stays dead anymore nothing i dont want to talk about that then what do you want to talk about i waved an arm at the building behind us the ammoniascented corridors and the endless numbered rooms inhabited by faded old people already ghosts of the dead they would become you want to talk about cora in and the way her son never visits her or jerry in whose emphysema has been giving him trouble or all the all the what she snapped suddenly fierce all the fucking minutia we always talk about i wont have you speak to me like that i raised you i made you what you are today i know i said and then more quietly i said it again i know her hands twisted in her lap the doctors told me youd forget it happens that way sometimes with trauma you were so young it seemed best somehow to just let it go but you lied i didnt choose any of this she said after it happened your parents sent you out to me just for a little while they said they needed time to think things through she fell silent squinting at the surf foaming on the rocks below the sun bore down upon us a heartbreaking disk of white in the faraway sky i never thought theyd do what they did she said and then it was too late after that how could i tell you she clenched my hand you seemed okay robert you seemed like you were fine i stood pulling away how could you know robert i turned at the door shed wheeled the chair around to face me her leg thrust toward me in its cast like the prow of a ship she was in tears why robert why couldnt you just leave everything alone i dont know i said but even then i was thinking of lewis that habit he has of probing at his face where the acne left it pittedas if someday hell find his flesh smooth and handsome once again and its through his hands hell know it i guess thats it you know weve all been wounded every one of us and we just cant keep our hands off the scars i drifted for the next day or two living out of hotel rooms and haunting the places id known growing up theyd changed like everything changes the world always hurrying us along but i didnt know what else to do where else to go i couldnt leave long beach not till i made things up with gran but something held me back i felt ill at ease restless and then as i fished through my wallet in a bar one afternoon i saw a tiny slip of paper eddy to the floor i knew what it was of course but i picked it up anyway my fingers shook as i opened it up and stared at the message written there call me sometime with the address and phone number printed neatly below i made it to laguna beach in fifty minutes the address was a mile or so east of the water a manicured duplex on a corner lot she had moved no doubtfive years had passedand if she hadnt moved she had married at the very least but i left my car at the curb and walked up the sidewalk all the same i could hear the bell through an open window footsteps approaching soft music lilting from the back of the house then the door opened and she was there wiping her hands on a towel gwen i said she didnt smile but she didnt close the door either it was a start the house was small but light with wide windows in the kitchen overlooking a lush back lawn a breeze slipped past the screens infusing the kitchen with the scent of freshcut grass and the faraway smell of ocean this isnt a bad time is it i asked well its unexpected to say the least she told me lifting one eyebrow doubtfully and in the gesture i caught a glimpse of the girl id known at northwestern rueful and wry and always faintly amused as she made coffee i studied her still freckled and faintly gamine but not unchanged her eyes had a wary light in them and fresh lines caged her thin upper lip when she sat across from me at the table toying with her coffee cup i noticed a faint pale circle around her finger where a ring might have been maybe i looked older too for gwen glanced up at me from beneath a fringe of streaky blonde bangs her mouth arcing in a crooked smile you look younger on television she said and it was enough to get us started gwen knew a fair bit of my storymy role in burtons presidential campaign had bought me that much notoriety at leastand hers had a familiar ring to it law school at ucla five or six years billing hours in one of the big la firms before the cutthroat culture got to her and she threw it over for a job with the aclu trading long days and a handsome wage for still longer ones and almost no wage at all her marriage had come apart around the same time not out of any real animosity she said more like a mutual lack of interest and now are you seeing anyone the question came out with a weight i hadnt intended she hesitated no one special she lifted the eyebrow once again a habit i picked up as a litigator risk aversion by this time the sky beyond the windows had softened into twilight and our coffee had grown cold as shadows lengthened in the little kitchen i caught gwen glancing at the clock she had plans i stood i should go right she took my hand at the door a simple handshake thats all but i felt something pass between us an old connection close with a kind of electric spark maybe it wasnt there at all maybe i only wanted to feel itgwen certainly seemed willing to let me walk out of her life once againbut a kind of desperation seized me call it nostalgia or loneliness call it whatever you want but suddenly the image of her wry glance from beneath the slant of hair leaped into mind i wanted to see her again listen i said i know this is kind of out of the blue but you wouldnt be free for dinner would you she paused a moment the shadow of the door had fallen across her face she laughed uncertainly and when she spoke her voice was husky and uncertain i dont know rob that was a long time ago like i said im a little risk aversive these days right well then listenit was really great seeing you i nodded and started across the lawn i had the door of the rental open when she spoke again what the hell she said let me make a call its only dinner right i went back to washington for the inauguration lewis and i stood together as we waited for the ceremony to begin looking out at the dead they had been on the move for days legions of them gathering on the mall as far as the eye could see a cluster of the living maybe a couple hundred strong had been herded onto the lawn before the bandstanda token crowd of warm bodies for the television camerasbut i couldnt help thinking that burtons true constituency waited beyond the cordons still and silent and unutterably patient the melting pot made flesh folk of every color race creed and age in every stage of decay that would allow them to stand upright dana maguire might be out there somewhere she probably was the smell was palpable privately lewis had told me that the dead had begun gathering elsewhere in the world as well our satellites had confirmed it in cuba and north korea in yugoslavia and rwanda the dead were on the move implacable and slow their purposes unknown and maybe unknowable we need you rob he had said worse than ever im not ready yet i replied he had turned to me then his long pitted face sagging what happened to you he asked and so i told him it was the first time i had spoken of it aloud and i felt a burden sliding from my shoulders as the words slipped out i told him all of it grans evasions and my reaction to dana maguire that day on cnn and the sense id had on crossfire that something else something vast and remote and impersonal was speaking through me calling them back from the grave i told him about the police report too how the memories had come crashing back upon me as i sat at the scarred table staring into a file nearly three decades old it was a party i said my uncle was throwing a party and mom and dads babysitter had canceled at the last minute so don told them just to bring us along he lived alone you know he didnt have kids and he never thought about kids in the house so the gun wasnt locked up no it was late it must have been close to midnight by then people were getting drunk and the music was loud and alice didnt seem to want much to do with me i was in my uncles bedroom just fooling around the way kids do and the gun was in the drawer of his nightstand i paused memory surging through me and suddenly i was there again a child in my uncles upstairs bedroom music thumped downstairs jazzy big band music i knew the grownups would be dancing and my dad would be nuzzling moms neck and that night when he kissed me good night id be able to smell him the exotic aromas of bourbon and tobacco shot through with the faint floral essence of moms perfume then my eyes fell upon the gun in the drawer the light from the hall summoned unsuspected depths from the blued barrel i picked it up heavy and cold all i wanted to do was show alice i just wanted to show her i never meant to hurt anyone i never meant to hurt alice i said it to lewisi never meant to hurt herand he looked away unable to meet my eyes i remember carrying the gun downstairs to the foyer mom and dad dancing beyond the frame of the doorway alice standing there watching i remember everything i said to lewis everything but pulling the trigger i remember the music screeching to a halt somebody dragging the needle across the record my mother screaming i remember alice lying on the floor and the blood and the weight of the gun in my hand but the weird thing is the thing i remember best is the way i felt at that moment the way you felt lewis said yeah a bullet had smashed the face of the clock this big grandfather clock my uncle had in the foyer it was chiming over and over as though the bullet had wrecked the mechanism thats what i remember most the clock i was afraid my uncle was going to be mad about the clock lewis did something odd then reaching out he clasped my shoulderthe first time hed ever touched me really touched me i meanand i realized how strange it was that this man this scarred bitter man had somehow become the only friend i have i realized something else too how rarely id known the touch of another human hand how much i hungered for it you were a kid rob i know its not my fault its no reason for you to leave not now not when we need you burton would have you back in a minute he owes this election to you he knows that come back not yet i said im not ready but now staring out across the upturned faces of the dead as a cold january wind whipped across the mall i felt the lure and pull of the old life sure as gravity the game burton had called it and it was a game politics the biggest monopoly set in the world and i loved it and for the first time i understood why i loved it for the first time i understood something else too why i had waited years to ring gwens doorbell why even then it had taken an active effort of will not to turn away it was the same reason because it was a game a game with clear winners and losers with rules as complex and arcane as a cotillion and most of all because it partook so little of the messy turmoil of real life the stakes seemed high but they werent it was ritual thats allmovement without action a dance of spin and strategy designed to preserve the status quo i fell in love with politics because it was safe you get so involved in pushing your token around the board that you forget the ideals that brought you to the table in the first place you forget to speak from the heart someday maybe for the right reasons id come back but not yet i must have said it aloud for lewis suddenly looked over at me what he asked i just shook my head and gazed out over the handful of living people stirring as the ceremony got underway the dead waited beyond them rank upon rank of them with the earth of the grave under their nails and that cold shining in their eyes and then i did turn to lewis what do you think they want i asked lewis sighed justice i suppose he said and when they have it maybe theyll rest a year has passed and those wordsjustice i supposestill haunt me i returned to dc in the fall just as the leaves began turning along the potomac gwen came with me and sometimes as i lie wakeful in the shelter of her warmth my mind turns to the past it was gran that brought me back the cast had come off in february and one afternoon in march gwen and i stopped by surprised to see her on her feet she looked frail but her eyes glinted with determination as she toiled along the corridors behind her walker lets sit down and rest i said when she got winded but she merely shook her head and kept moving bones knit rob she told me wounds heal if you let them those words haunt me too by the time she died in august shed moved from the walker to a cane another month her case manager told me with admiration and she might have relinquished even that we buried her in the plot where we laid my grandfather to rest but i never went back after the interment i know what i would find the dead do not sleep they shamble in silence through the cities of our world their bodies slack and stinking of the grave their eyes coldly ablaze baghdad fell in september vanquished by battalions of revolutionaries rallying behind a vanguard of the dead state teems with similar rumors and cnn is on the story unrest in pyongyang turmoil in belgrade in some views burtons has been the most successful administration in history all around the world our enemies are falling yet more and more these days i catch the president staring uneasily into the streets of washington aswarm with zombies our conscience hes taken to calling them but im not sure i agree they demand nothing of us after all they seek no end we can perceive or understand perhaps they are nothing more than what we make of them or what they enable us to make of ourselves and so we go on mere lodgers in a world of unpeopled graves subject ever to the remorseless scrutiny of the dead

companion and a collection of essays called wild hairs hes also generally considered to be the originator of the term splatterpunk in zombie jam schow says blossom is a simple story written in a single day the process beginning with the image of a beautiful nude woman eating flowers working backward from that image along the way it was decided that the incidental background of the story would address the notion of what it was like in the big cities two nights before the spread of the zombie virus made survival the overriding issue each of us has a moment quinn told her the moment when we shine that instant when we are at our absolute best just as each of us has an aberration a hidden secret some might call it a perversion though thats rather a rough word crude nonspecific is it a perversion to do that thing youre best at to enjoy your individual moment amelia nodded vaguely watching the older man through her glass of sauvignon blanc he was going to answer his own obtuse question and the answer he had already decided upon was no it was the puffery that preceded the crunchwas she going to fuck him tonight or not she was positive he had already answered that one in his head as well dinner had run to ninetyfive bucks not counting the wine or the tip dessert had been highpriced highercaloried chocolate elegant cabs had been taken and token gifts dispensed she had worked in loan approvals at columbia savings for nine months riding the receptionists desk older men frequently asked her out when quinn invited her to dinner a weekend date she had pulled his file consulted his figures and said yes all the girls in the office did it he drove a jaguar xjs and was into condo development the dinner part had been completed two hours ago now it was his place when your income hit the high six figures there was no such animal as date rape amelia had herpes it was inactive tonight best to stay mum it was like compensation to her certain knowledge she had never bedded bisexuals or intravenousdrug users and in truth she feared contracting aids in the same unfocused way she feared getting flattened in a crosswalk by a bus it could happen but probably not there was no way in the world either of them could fit a condom over their mouths so it was academic right quinns watery gray eyes glinted as he rattled on about aberrations and special moments probably the wine it had gotten to amelia half an hour ago a fuzzy vino cloud that put her afloat and permitted her to tune out quinns voice while staring past him to nod and generate tiny noises of acknowledgment on a schedule that allowed him to believe she was actually listening she had disconnected and felt just fine she took a deep languorous breath keeping him on the far side of her wine glass and stifled the giggle that welled within her oh my yes she felt nice adrift on a cumulus pillow of gasified brain cells she would look past him through him in just this way when he was on top of her grunting and sweating and believing he had seduced her just as he now believed she was paying attention she rewound back to the last utterance she cared to remember and acted upon it i have an aberration she said she added a glowing smile and toyed with a long curl of her copper hair just adorable his interest came full blast too eager yes yes he replaced his wine glass on the clear acrylic tabletop and leaned forward to entreat her elucidation she played him like a catfish on a hook no its silly really look at my legs she commanded through the tabletop he watched her legs recross the whisper of her stockings flushed his face with blood his brain was giddy already jumping forward in time to the clinch please he said his voice was so cultured his tone so paternal he was losing control and she could smell it she kept a childlike killer smile precisely targeted well okay she rose a slim and gracile woman of thirtyfour one who fought hard to keep what she had and had nothing to show for her effort except a stupid airhead bimbo job at columbia savings so much bitterness there beneath the manner and cosmetics there was a tall vase of irises on an antique end table near the fireplace firelight mellowed all the glass and scandinavian chrome in the room and danced in the floortoceiling wraparound windows of quinns eighthfloor eyrie he kept his gaze on her the fire was in his eyes as well every inch the coquette amelia bit off the delicate chiffon of the iris chewed swallowed and smiled quinns face grew robust with pleasure his old mans eyes cleared ever since i was a little girl she said perhaps because i saw my cat sterling eating grass i like the flavor i dont know i used to think the flowers life added to mine and this is your quinn had to clear his throat aberration ah he left his chair to close up the distance between them it became evident that his erection was making him blunder amelias eyes dipped to notice bemused and she ate another flower she had made a point of telling quinn she liked lots of flowers and he and his gold card had come through in rainbow colors all over the penthouse were longstemmed roses carnation bouquets spring bunches mums more quinn found the sight of amelia chewing the flowers throatclosingly erotic his voice grew husky and repeated her name it was time for him to lunge let me show you my specialty dear amelia my aberration she had been tied up before so far no big deal quinn used silk scarves to secure her wrists and ankles to the mahogany poles of the fourposter bed with a long curved ebonyhandled knife he halved the front of her dress into the vanilla highlands of her breasts he mumbled promises of more expensive replacement garments his hands lost their sophistication and became thickfingered in a big masculine hurry shredding her hose to the knees and groping to see if she was as moist as his fantasies then he was thrusting amelia rocked and pretended to orgasm this would be done in a hurry no big deal he withdrew still hard saying dont be afraid she had been falling asleep she expected him to go for the knife again to stroke her nipples with its razor edge or tease her nerve endings with mock danger instead he reached into a headboard compartment and brought out a rubber mask festooned with sewn leather and buckles and shiny gold zippers it almost made her laugh she protested the contraption engulfed her head like a thick tootight glove she thought of getting stuck in a pullover sweater only this material was definitely nonporous her lungs felt brief panic until the thing was fully seated and she could gulp air through the nose and mouth slits then quinn resumed pushing himself into her his prodding more urgent now he broke rhythm only to zip the holes in the mask shut fear blossomed loud in her chest becoming a fireball she pulled in a final huge draught of air before he zipped the nose shut and wasted breath making incomprehensible mewling noises against the alreadysealed mouth hole she could not tell him now of her congenital lung problems that respiration was sometimes a chore when the weather was wrong she had to resort to prescription medication just to breathe it had never come up all through dinner they had been too busy with aberrations and prime moments and eating flowers all she could feel now was a slow explosion in her chest and the steady pounding down below in and out she began to buck and heave thrashing quinn loved every second of it battering her lustily despite her abrupt lack of lubrication the friction vanished when he came inside her panting he lumbered immediately to the bathroom when he returned amelia had not changed position and he finally noticed she was no longer breathing sometimes it went down this way he thought the price of true passion however aberrant but she was still moist and poised at the ready so he opted to have one more go he huffed with surprise when she began to squirm beneath him again he went aahhh and started stroking rigid and slippery in a fast tempo that was itshe had fainted sometimes it went down that way as wellorgasm put them in the zone for a while she would awaken on highburn and come her teeny secretary brains right out her jaw wrenched around at a ridiculous angle and bit into the leather muzzle of the mask from within shredding a hole a drop of quinns sweat flew to mix with the blood staining her teeth and the vomit clogging her throat and before quinn could make sense out of what he thought he saw amelia bit his nose off in the brief second before the pain hit quinn thought of that crazy shit on the news cannibal attacks on the eastern seaboard some whackpot scientist had claimed that dead people were reviving and eating live people it was all big apple ratshit yet it flashed through quinns mind right now because amelia had bitten his nose off and was chewing it up and swallowing the pieces his throat flooded with the foaming pink backwash of inhaled blood he made a liquid gargling noise as he tried to recoil to back out of her to get the hell away from this fucking lunatic but she had a deathgrip on him belowdecks as well then quinn was able to yell and he did because he could feel the ring of vaginal muscle increasing pressure locking up beyond the circumference of his cock the more he tried to pull out the harder he got hed heard of men getting stuck in wine bottles the same way you cant compress a liquid blood was a liquid his panic erection was vised with no options he shoved wildly against the bed blood pumping from the cavern in his face he began hitting her with both fists but she was beyond feeling a thing when he felt the muscle sever his penis like a wire cutter he began to scream hoarsely none of his neighbors would pay any mind weird games aberrations were the standard menu at quinns suddenly freed he sprawled backward blood gushed ruining the carpet and sputtering from his crotch he watched the stump of his stillstiff manhood vanish into the slick red chasm between amelias legs overwhelmed by the sight of it being swallowed whole by the orifice that had bitten it off quinn hit the floor and kept screaming until catatonia blanketed him it took amelia about half an hour to gnaw through her bonds she spent another hour and a half eating quinn during her meal the life left his body and the queer radiations mentioned on the news did their alien work by then there was not enough left of his corpse to rise or walk or eat anyone else the pieces lolled around on the floor feeling the first pangs of a new hunger unearthly and unsatisfiable her savaged dress dropped away swaying sidetoside she found her way into the room where they had dined when they were alive sparks of remembered behavior capered through her dead brain matter evaporating for the last time she began eating the flowers in their vases in no hurry to begin her nightwalk the flowers were alive but dying every moment their life might become hers when she stopped all the bouquets had been stripped eventually amelia found her way to a door and moved into the world to seek others of her newborn kind never again would she be as beautiful it was her moment just as quinn had said she blended with the shadows a striking creamskinned nude with flower petals drifting down from her mouth ocher mauve bright red the third dead body by nina kiriki

anthologies such as firebirds the coyote road and redshift her work has been nominated for the world fantasy award and the nebula award four times each in the nineties hoffman went through a summer where she read one serial killer biography after another i was in the grip of some monstrous curiosity about how far humans will go she says my favorite book that summer was about a case that wasnt even solved at the time the search for the green river killer by carlton smith and thomas guillen part of my thinking in the third dead body was to give the victim a voice there were so many victims in this case where the serial killer was the celebrityas so often happensi wanted to focus elsewhere i didnt even know richie i surely didnt want to love him after he killed me though i found him irresistible i opened my eyes and dirt fell into them having things fall into my eyes was one of my secret terrors but now i blinked and shook my head and most of the dirt fell away and i felt all right so i knew something major had happened to me with my eyes closed i shoved dirt away from my face while i was doing this i realized that the inside of my mouth felt different i probed with my tongue my trained and talented tongue and soon discovered that where smooth teeth had been before there were only broken stumps what puzzled me about this and about the dirt in my eyes was that these things didnt hurt they bothered me but not on a pain level i frowned and tried to figure out what i was feeling not a lot not scared or mad not hot or cold this was different too i usually felt scared standing on street corners waiting for strangers to pick me up and cold working evenings in skimpy clothes that showed off my best features right now i felt nothing i sat up dirt falling away from me and bumped into branches that gridded my view of the sky some of them slid off me the branches were loose and wilting not attached to a bush or tree i used my hands to push them out of the way and noticed that the backs of my fingers were blackened beyond my natural cocoa color i looked at them trying to remember what had happened before i fell asleep or whateverhad i dipped my fingers in ink but no the skin was scorched my fingerprints were gone they would have told police that my name was tawanda foote which was my street name my teeth would have led police to call me mary jefferson a name i hadnt used since two years before when i moved out of my parents house at fifteen in my own mind i was sheila a power name i had given myself no one could have discovered from any evidence about me no teeth no fingerprints richie really didnt want anybody to know who i was not that anybody ever had richie with my scorched fingers i tried to take my pulse though it was hard to find a vein among the rope burns at my wrists with my eyes i watched my own naked chest there were charred spots on my breasts where richie had touched me with a burning cigarette no pulse but maybe that was because the nerves in my fingertips were dead no breathing no easy answer to that so i chose the hard answer dead i was dead after i pushed aside the branches so i could see trees and sky i sat in my own grave dirt and thought about this my grannie would call this dirt goofer dust any soil thats been piled on a corpse whether the bodys in a box or just loose like me turns into goofer dust dirt next to dead folk gets a power in it she used to say she used to tell me all kinds of things she told me about the walking dead but mostly she said they were just big scary dummies who obeyed orders when i stayed up too late at night reading library books under my covers with a flashlight she would say maybe you know somebody who could give those nightwalkers orders maybe she can order em to come in here and turn off your light she had started to train me in recognizing herbs and collecting conjo ingredients but that was before i told the preacher what really happened when i sat in grandp√®res lap and grandp√®re got in trouble with the church and then with other people in the parish i had a lot of cousins and some of the others started talking up about grandp√®re but i was the first after the police took grandp√®re away grannie laid a curse on me may you love the thing that hurts you even after it kills you she underlined it with virgin blood the wax of black candles and the three of spades i thought maybe if i left louisiana i could get the curse off but nobody i knew could uncross me and the curse followed me to seattle in the midst of what was now goofer dust i was sitting next to something i reached out and touched it it was another dead body wake up i said to the woman in the shallow grave beside me but she refused to move so no fingerprints no teeth i was dead next to someone even deader and off in some woods i checked in with my body an act i saved for special times when i could come out of the numb state i spent most of my life in and found i wasnt hungry or thirsty all the parts of me that had been hurting just before richie my last trick took a final twist around my neck with the nylon cord he was so fond of all those parts were quiet not bothering me at all but there was a burning desire in my crotch and a pinprick of fire behind my eyes that whispered to me get up and move we know where to go i looked around at my back the slope led upward toward a place where sun broke through trees at my feet it led down into darker woods to either side more woods and bushes plants grannie had never named for me foreign as another language i moved my legs bringing them up out of the goofer dust all of me was naked dirt caught in my curly hair below i pulled myself to my feet and something fell out of my money pit as my pimp blake liked to call my pussy i looked down at what had fallen from me it was a rock flaked and shaped into a blade about the size of a flat hand and it glistened in the dulled sunlight wet and dark with what had come from inside me and maybe with some of his juices too the fire in my belly flared up but it wasnt a feeling like pain it felt like desire i put my hands to my neck and felt the deep grooves the rope had left there heat blossomed in my head and in my heart i wanted to find the hands that had tightened the rope around my neck wrists and ankles i wanted to find the eyes that had watched my skin sizzle under the kiss of the burning cigarette i wanted to find the mind that had decided to plunge a crude blade into me like that the compulsion set in along my bones jetted into my muscles like adrenaline i straightened looked around i had to find richie i knew which direction to look something in my head was teasing me nudging mea fire behind my eyes urging me back to the city i fought the urge and lifted more branches off the place where i had lain if i was going to get to seattle from here wherever here was i needed some clothes i couldnt imagine anybody stopping to pick me up with me looking the way i did i knew richie had worked hard to get rid of all clues to who i was but i thought maybe my companion in the grave might not be so naked of identity so i brushed dirt off her and found she was not alone there were two bodies in the dirt with no sign of afterlife in them except maggots and no trace of clothes one was darker than me with fewer marks on her but the same rope burns around her neck the other one was very light maybe white she was really falling apart they looked like they must smell pretty bad but i couldnt smell them i couldnt smell anything i could see and hear and my muscles did what i told them but i didnt feel much except the gathering fire inside me that cried for richie i brushed dirt back over the other women and moved the branches to cover their resting place again downslope the trees waited making their own lowlevel night upslope open sun a road probably i scrambled up toward the light the heat in my head and heart and belly burned hotter and i churned up the hillside and stepped into the sun a twolane highway lay before me its yellow dotted center stripe bright in the sun its edges tailed into the gravel i stood on crushed snack bags and coke and beer cans lay scattered in the bushes beside the road cellophane glinted i crossed the road and looked at the wooded hill on its far side then down in the ditch no clothes not even a plastic bag big enough to make into a bikini bottom the heat inside me was like some big fat drunk who will not shut up yelling for a beer i started walking knowing which direction would take me toward town without knowing how i knew after a while a car came from behind me behind was probably my best side my microbraids hung down to hide the marks on my neck and richie hadnt done any cigarette graffiti on my back that i could remember a lot of tricks had told me i had a nice ass and good legs even my pimp had said it and he never said anything nice unless he thought it was true or it would get him what he wanted and he had everything he wanted from me i could hear the car slowing but i was afraid to look back i knew my mouth must look funny because of the missing teeth and i wasnt sure what the rest of my face looked like since i couldnt feel pain anything could have happened i bent my head so the sun wasnt shining in my face miss oh miss either a womans deep voice came from the car behind me or a mans high one it sounded like an older person the engine idled low as the car pulled up beside me it was a red volkswagen rabbit i crossed my arms over my chest hiding the burn marks and tucking my ropemark bracelets into the crooks of my elbows miss ya i said trying to make my voice friendly not sure i had a voice at all miss are you in trouble i nodded my braids slapping my shoulders and veiling my face may i help you miss i cleared my throat drew in breath yayou goin do down i managed to say what down i said pointing along the road seaddle oh yes would you like a ride mmhmm i said cloze i glanced up this time wondering if the cars driver was man or woman a man might shed his shirt for me but a woman unless she was carrying a suitcase or something might not have anything to offer oh you poor thing what happened to you the car pulled up onto the shoulder ahead of me and the driver got out it was a big beefy white woman in jeans and a plaid flannel shirt she came toward me with a nononsense stride she had short dark hair she was wearing a mans khaki cloth hat with fishing flies stuck in the band all different feathery colors what ha i put one hand over my face covering my mouth with my palm what happened she whispered stopping while there was still a lot of space between us my boyfriend dreeded me preddy bad i said behind my hand my tongue kept trying to touch the backs of teeth no longer there it frustrated me that my speech was so messy i thought maybe i could talk more normally if i touched my tongue to the roof of my mouth my boyfriend i said again then treated me pretty bad poor thing poor thing she whispered then turned back to the car and rummaged in a back seat came up with a shortwaisted levis jacket and held it out to me i ducked my head and took the jacket she gasped when i dropped my arms from my chest i wrapped up in the jacket which was roomy but not long enough to cover my crotch then again from the outside my crotch didnt look so bad i turned the collar up to cover my neck and the lower part of my face thank you i said her eyes were wide her broad face pale under her tan you need help she said hospital police seattle i said medical attention wont help me now i shrugged you could get infections die from septicemia or something i have a first aid kit in the car at least let me what would help me i said is a mirror she sighed her shoulders lowering she walked around the car and opened the passenger side door and i followed her i looked at the seat it was so clean and i was still goofer dusted gonna get it dirty i said lord thats the last thing on my mind right now she said get in mirrors on the back of the visor i slid in and folded down the visor sighed with relief when i saw my face nothing really wrong with it except my chin was nearer to my nose than it should be and my lips looked too dark and puffy my eyes werent blackened and my nose wasnt broken i could pass i gapped the collar just a little and winced at the angry dark rope marks around my neck then clutched the collar closed the woman climbed into the drivers seat my names marti she said holding out a hand still keeping the coat closed with my left hand i extended my right and she shook it sheila i said it was the first time id ever said it out loud she la two words for woman put together i smiled then glanced quickly at the mirror and saw that a smile was as bad as id thought my mouth was a graveyard of broken teeth brown with old blood i hid my mouth with my hand again christ said marti whats your boyfriends name dont worry about it i said if he did that to you he could do it to others my daughter lives in renton this has to be reported to the police who is he where does he live near seatac the airport she took a deep breath let it out you understand dont you this is a matter for the authorities i shook my head the heat in my chest was scorching urging me on i have to go to town now i said gripping the door handle put your seat belt on she said slammed her door and started the car once she got started she was some balloffire driver scared meeven though there wasnt anything i could think of that could hurt me where were we anyway i asked after i got used to her tiresquealing cornering on curves well i was coming down from kanaskat im on my way in to renton to see my daughter shes got a bellydance recital tonight and she stared at me then shook her head and focused on the road the land was leveling a little we hit a main road highway and she turned north on it the burning in my chest raged up into my throat no i said reaching for her hand on the steering wheel what no that way i pointed back to the other road we had been on actually the urge inside me was pulling from some direction between the two roads but the smaller road aimed closer to where i had to go maple valleys this way she said not turning and we can talk to the police there and a doctor no i said she looked at me youre in no state to make rational decisions she said i closed my hand around her wrist and squeezed she cried out she let go of the steering wheel and tried to shake off my grip i stared at her and held on remembering my grandm√®res tales of the strength of the dead stop i said i felt strange totally strange ordering a woman around the way a pimp would i knew i was hurting her too i knew i could squeeze harder break the bones in her arm and i was ready to but she pulled the car over to the shoulder and stamped on the brake i got to go to seatac i said i released her arm and climbed out of the car thanks for ride you want the jacket back i fingered the denim my lord she said you keep it child she was rubbing her hand over the wrist i had gripped she heaved a huge sigh get in ill take you where you want to go i cant just leave you here your daughters show i said ill phone were going someplace with phones arent we i wasnt sure exactly where we would end up i would know when we arrived i remembered the inside of richies apartment but that was later first he had pulled up next to where i was standing by the highway rolled down the passenger window of his big gold fourdoor buick said hed like to party and that he knew a good place standard lines except i usually told johns the place down one of the side streets and in the driveway behind an abandoned house i had asked him how high he was willing to go my pimp had been offering me coke off and on but id managed not to get hooked so i was still a little picky about who i went with but richie looked cleancut and just plain clean and his car was a couple years old but expensive i thought he might have money i want it all richie had said ill give you a hundred bucks i climbed into his car he took me down off the ridge where the seatac strip is to a place like the one where i usually took my tricks behind one of the abandoned houses near the airport that are due to be razed someday theres two or three neighborhoods of them handy i asked him for money and he handed me a hundred so i got in back with him but then things went seriously wrong that was the first time i saw and felt his rope the first time i heard his voice cursing me the first time i tasted one of his sweaty socks not the worst thing id ever tasted but close when he had me gagged and tied up and shoved down on the back seat floor he drove somewhere else i couldnt tell how long the drive was it felt like two hours but was probably only fifteen or twenty minutes i could tell when the car drove into a parking garage because the sounds changed he put a shopping bag over my head and carried me into an elevator again something i could tell by feel and then along a hall to his apartment that was where i learned more about him than i had ever wanted to know about anybody i didnt know his apartments address but i knew where richie was if he was at the apartment i would direct marti there even without a map the fire inside me reached for richie like a magnet lusting for a hammer shaping words carefully i told marti going to the strip plenty of phones right she said on the other road i pointed behind us she sighed get in i climbed into the car and she waited for an rv to pass then pulled out and turned around as soon as we were heading the way i wanted to go the fire inside me cooled a little i sat back and relaxed why are we going to theto the strip she asked what are you going to do when we get there dont know i said we were driving toward the sun which was going down glare had bothered me before my death but now it was like dirt in my eyes a minor annoyance i blinked and considered this then shrugged it off cant you even tell me your boyfriends name she asked richie richie what dont know are you going back to him fire rose in my throat like vomit i felt like i could breathe it out and it would feel good it felt good inside my belly already i was drunk with it oh yes i said how can you she cried she shook her head i cant take you back to someone who hurt you so much but she didnt stop driving i have to go back i said you dont you can choose something else there are shelters for battered women the government should offer you some protection the police you dont understand i said i do she said her voice got quieter i know what its like to live with someone who doesnt respect you i know how hard it is to get away but you are away sheila you can start over no i said i cant you can ill help you you can live in kanaskat with me and hell never find you or if you just want a bus ticket someplaceback home wherever that isi can do that for you too you dont understand i said she was quiet for a long stretch of road then she said help me understand i shook my braids back and opened the collar of the jacket pulled down the lapels to bare my neck i stared at her until she looked back she screamed and drove across the center lane fortunately there was no other traffic still screaming she fought with the steering wheel until she straightened out the car then she pulled over to the shoulder and jumped out of the car and ran away i shut off the cars engine then climbed out marti i yelled okay im walking away now the cars all yours im leaving its safe thanks for the jacket bye i buttoned up the jacket put the collar up buried my hands in the pockets and started walking along the road toward richie i had gone about a quarter mile when she caught up with me again the sun had set and twilight was deepening into night six cars had passed going my way but i didnt hold out my thumb and though some kid had yelled out a window at me and somebody else had honked and swerved nobody stopped it had been so easy to hitch before i met richie somehow now i just couldnt do it i heard the rabbits sputter behind me and kept walking not turning to look at her but she slowed and kept pace with me sheila she said in a hoarse voice sheila i stopped and looked toward her i knew she was scared of me i felt strong and strange hearing her call me by a name i had given myself as if i might once have had a chance to make up who i was instead of being shaped by what had happened to me i couldnt see it being possible now though when i was only alive to do what the fire in me wanted marti blinked turned away then turned back get in she said you dont have to take me i said ill get there sooner or later doesnt matter when get in i got back into her car for half an hour we drove in silence she crossed interstate paused when we hit the strip which way i pointed right the fire was so hot in me now i felt like my fingertips might start smoking any second she turned the car and we cruised north toward the seatac airport my old stomping grounds we passed expensive hotels and cheap motels convenience stores and fancy restaurants lighted buildings alternated with dark gaps the roar of planes taking off and landing lights rising and descending in the sky ahead of us turned rapidly into background we drove past the goldilocks motel where blake and i had a room we rented by the week and i didnt feel anything but as we passed the intersection where the red lion sprawls on the corner of th street and the pacific highway fire flared under my skin slowly i said to marti she stared at me and slowed the car a mile further past the airport one of the little roads led down off the ridge to the left i pointed marti got in the leftturn lane and made the turn then pulled into a gas station on the corner and parked by the rest rooms now wait she said what are we doing here richie i whispered i could feel his presence in the near distance all my wounds were resonating with his nearness now all the places he had pressed himself into me with his rope and his cigarette and his sock and his flaked stone knife and his penis imprinting me as his possession surely as a knife slicing into a trees bark he had branded me with his heart yes said marti richie you have any plans for what youre going to do once you find him i held my hands out open palms up the heat was so strong i felt like anything i touched would burst into flame what are you going to do strangle him have you got something to do it with she sounded sarcastic i was having a hard time listening to her all my attention was focused down the road i knew richies car was there and richie in it it was the place he had taken me to tie me up he might be driving this way any second and i didnt want to wait any longer for our reunion though i knew there was no place he could hide where i couldnt find him my love for him was what animated me now strangle i said and shook my head i climbed out of the car sheila said marti i let the sound of my selfgiven name fill me with what power it could and stood still for a moment fighting the fire inside then i walked into the street stood in the center so a car coming up out of the dark would have to stop i strode down into darkness away from the lights and noise of the strip my feet felt like matchheads as if a scrape could strike fire from them presently the asphalt gave way to potholes and gravel i could tell by the sound of pebbles sliding under my feet i walked past the first three dark houses to the right and left looming shapes in a darkness pierced by the flight lights of airplanes but without stars i turned left at the fourth house dark like the others but with a glow behind it i couldnt see with my eyes but could feel in my bones heat pulsed and danced inside me i pushed past an overgrown lilac bush at the side of the house and stepped into the broad drive in back the car was there as i had known it would be dark and quiet its doors were closed i heard a brief cry and then the dome light went on in the car richie was sitting up in back facing away from me richie i walked across the crunching gravel looking at his dark head he wore a white shirt he was staring down focused his arms moving as i neared the car i could see he was sitting on a woman she still had her clothes on richie hadnt taken my clothes off until he got me in his apartment tape was across her mouth and her head thrashed from side to side her upper arms jerking as richie bound his thin nylon rope around her wrists her legs kicking i stood a moment looking in the window she saw me and her eyes widened she made a gurgling swallowed sound behind the sock the tape i thought he doesnt need her he has me i remembered the way my mind had struggled while my body struggled screaming silently no oh no blake where are you no one will help me the way no one has ever helped me and i cant help myself that hurts that hurts maybe hell play with me and let me go if im very very good oh god what do you want just tell me i can do it you dont have to hurt me okay rip me off its not like youre the first but you dont have to hurt me hurt me i love you i love you so much i stared at him through the glass the woman beneath him had stilled and she was staring at me richie finally noticed and whirled for a moment we stared at each other then i smiled showing him the stumps of my teeth and his blue eyes widened i reached for the door handle opened it before he could lock it richie i said dont he said he shook his head hard as though he were a dog with wet fur slowly he lifted one hand and rubbed his eye he had a big bread knife in the other hand had used it to cut the rope then flicked it across the womans cheek leaving a streak of darkness he looked at me again his jaw worked richie dont dont interrupt i held out my arms my fingertips scorched black as if dyed or tattooed made special the wrists dark beyond the ends of my sleeves richie i said tenderly the fire in me rising up like a firework a burst of stars im yours no he said you made me yours i looked at him he had made tawanda his and then he had erased her he had made mary his and then erased her even though he had erased tawanda and mary these feelings inside me were tawandas whoever hurts me controls me and marys i spoke up once and i got a curse on me i cant get rid of if im quiet maybe ill be okay but sheila richie hadnt erased sheila he had never even met her it was tawanda who was talking you killed me and you made me yours she said my fingers went to the jacket unbuttoned it dropped it behind me what i am i owe to you i he said and coughed no he said i heard the purr of car engines in the near distance not the constant traffic of the strip but something closer i reached into the car and gripped richies arm i pulled him out even though he grabbed at the door handle with his free hand i could feel the bone in his upper arm as my fingers pressed his muscles richie i whispered and put my arms around him and laid my head on his shoulder for a while he was stiff tense in my embrace then a shudder went through him and he loosened up his arms came around me youre mine he said yours said tawanda does that mean youll do what i say his voice sounded like a little boys whatever you say she said put your arms down he said i lowered my arms stand real still he backed away from me then stood and studied me he walked around looking at me from all sides wait a sec i gotta get my flashlight he went around to the trunk and opened it pulled out a flashlight as long as his forearm turned it on he trained the beam on my breasts my neck i did you he said nodding i did you you were good almost as good as the first one show me your hands again i held them out and he stared at my blackened fingers slowly he smiled then looked up and met my eyes i was going to visit you he said when i finished with this one i was coming back to see you i couldnt wait said tawanda dont talk richie said gently dont talk tawanda and mary accepted that without a problem but i sheila was tired of people telling me not to talk what did i have to lose on the other hand what did i have to say i didnt even know what i wanted tawandas love for richie was hard to fight it was the burning inside me the sizzling under my skin all i had left of life will you scream if i say so said richie in his little boys voice yes said tawanda but suddenly lights went on around us and bullhorn voices came out of the dark hold it right there buddy put your hands up blinking in the sudden flood of light richie slowly lifted his hand the knife glinting in the left one the flashlight in the other step away from him miss said someone else i looked around too not blinking glare didnt bother me i couldnt see through it though i didnt know who was talking miss move away from him said another voice from outside the light come here richie whispered and i went to him releasing the flashlight he dropped his arms around me held the knife to my neck and yelled stay back sheila it was martis voice this time not amplified i looked toward her sheila get away from him marti yelled do you want him to escape tawanda did mary did they after all had found the place where they belonged in the circle of his arms my body glowed the fire banked but burning steady he put the blade closer to my twisted throat i could almost feel it i laid my head back on his shoulder looking at his profile out of the corner of my eye the light glare brought out the blue in his eye his mouth was slightly open the inside of his lower lip glistening he turned to look down into my face and a slight smile curved the corner of his mouth okay he whispered were going to get into the car now he raised his voice do what i say and dont struggle keeping me between him and the lights he kicked the back door closed and edged us around the car to the drivers side moving in tandem with his arm still around my neck we slid in behind the wheel me going first keep close he said to me slide down a little so i can use my arm to shift with but keep close sheila screamed marti the drivers side window was open richie started the car sheila theres a live woman in the back of that car tawanda didnt care and mary didnt care and i wasnt even sure i cared richie shifted from park into drive and eased his foot off the brake and onto the gas pedal i could feel his legs moving against my left shoulder from the back seat i heard a muffled groan i looked up at richies face he was smiling just as he gunned the engine i reached up and grappled the steeringwheelmounted gear shift into park then i broke the shift handle off you said youd obey me he said staring down into my face he looked betrayed his eyes wide his brow furrowed his mouth soft the cars engine continued to snarl without effect fire blossomed inside me hurting me this time because id hurt him pain came alive i coughed choking on my own tongue my throat swollen and burning my wrists and ankles burning my breasts burning between my legs a column of flame raging up inside me i tried to apologize but i no longer had a voice you promised said richie in his little boys voice looking down at me i coughed i could feel the power leaving me my arms and legs were stiffening the way a body is supposed to do after death i lifted my crippling hands as high as i could palms up pleading but by that point only my elbows could bend it was tawandas last gesture dont make a move said a voice keep your hands on the wheel we looked a man stood just outside the car aiming a gun at richie through the open window richie edged a hand down the wheel toward me make a move for her and ill shoot said the man someone else came up beside him and he moved back keeping his gun aimed at richies head while the other man leaned in and put handcuffs on richie thats it said the first man and he and the second man heaved huge sighs i lay curled on the seat my arms bent at the elbows my legs bent at the knees when they pulled richie out of the car i slipped off his lap and lay stiff my neck bent at an angle so my head stuck up sideways this woman needs medical attention someone yelled i listened to them freeing the woman in the back seat and thought about the death of tawanda and mary tawanda had lifted me out of my grave and carried me for miles mary had probably mostly died when grannie cursed me and drove me out of the house but sheila in a way i had been pregnant with sheila for years and she was born in the grave she was still looking out of my eyes and listening with my ears even though the rest of me was dead even as the pain of death faded leaving me with clear memories of how richie had treated me before he took that final twist around my neck the sheila in me was awake and feeling things shes in an advanced state of rigor someone said i felt a dim pressure around one of my arms my body slid along the seat toward the door wait said someone else i got to take pictures what are you talking about said another ten minutes ago she was walking and talking lights flashed but i didnt blink are you crazy said the first person even rapidonset rigor doesnt come on this fast ask anybody tony we all saw her try feeling for a pulse are you sure he wasnt just propping her up and moving her around like a puppet but that wouldnt explain you done with the pictures yet crane said one of the cops then to me in a light voice honey come on out of there dont just lie there and let him photograph you like a corpse you dont know what he does with the pictures wait till the civilians are out of here before you start making jokes said someone else maybe shes just in shock sheila said marti from the passenger side marti i whispered gasps sheila you did it you did it did what let him kill me then kill me again suddenly i was so angry i couldnt rest anger was like the fire that had filled me before only a lower slower heat i shuddered and sat up another gasp from one of the men at the drivers side door see said the one with the shock theory one of them had a flashlight and shone it on me i lifted my chin and stared at him my microbraids brushing my shoulders keerist oh god they fell back a step i sucked breath in past the swelling in my throat and said i need a ride and feeling for a pulse i think youll be happier if you dont marti gave me back her jacket i rode in her rabbit the cop cars and the van from the medical examiners office tailed us marti had a better idea of where she had found me than i did whats your full name she said when we were driving is there anybody i can get in touch with for you no ive been dead to them for a couple years already are you sure did you ever call to check with them i waited for a while then said if your daughter was a hooker and dead would you want to know yes she said immediately real information is much better than not knowing i kept silent for another while then told her my parents names and phone number ultimately i didnt care if the information upset them or not she handed me a little notebook and asked me to write it down turning on the dome light so i could see what i was doing the pain of scorching had left my fingers again holding the pen was awkward but i managed to write out what marti wanted when i finished i slipped the notebook back into her purse and turned off the light it was somewhere along here she said half an hour later you have any feeling for it no i didnt have a sense of my grave the way i had had a feeling for richie martis headlights flashed on three coke cans lying together by the road though and i remembered seeing a cluster like that soon after i had climbed up the slope here i said she pulled over and so did the three cars following us someone gave me a flashlight and i went to the edge of the slope and walked along looking for my own footprints or anything else familiar a broken bramble a crushed fern a tree with a hooked branchi remembered them all from the afternoon here i said pointing down the mountainside okay dont disturb anything said the cop named joe one of the others started stringing up yellow tape along the road in both directions but i was having a feeling now a feeling that sheila had lived as long as she wanted all i needed was my blanket of goofer dust and i could go back to sleep when joe went back to his car to get something i slipped over the edge and headed home i pushed the branches off the other two women and lay down beside their bodies thinking about my brief life i had helped somebody and i had hurt somebody which i figured was as much as id done in my first two lives i pulled dirt up over me even over my face not blinking when it fell into my eyes but then i thought martis going to see me sooner or later and shed probably like it better if my eyes were closed so i closed my eyes the dead by michael

besides zombies it also features coldblooded businessmen its hard to say which is more frightening three boy zombies in matching red jackets bussed our table bringing water lighting candles brushing away the crumbs between courses their eyes were dark attentive lifeless their hands and faces so white as to be faintly luminous in the hushed light i thought it in bad taste but this is manhattan courtney said a certain studied offensiveness is fashionable here the blond brought menus and waited for our order we both ordered pheasant an excellent choice the boy said in a clear emotionless voice he went away and came back a minute later with the freshly strangled birds holding them up for our approval he couldnt have been more than eleven when he died and his skin was of that sort connoisseurs call milk glass smooth without blemish and all but translucent he must have cost a fortune as the boy was turning away i impulsively touched his shoulder he turned back whats your name son i asked timothy he might have been telling me the sp√©cialit√© de maison the boy waited a breath to see if more was expected of him then left courtney gazed after him how lovely he would look she murmured nude standing in the moonlight by a cliff definitely a cliff perhaps the very one where he met his death he wouldnt look very lovely if hed fallen off a cliff oh dont be unpleasant the wine steward brought our bottle chateau la tour i raised an eyebrow the steward had the sort of old and complex face that rembrandt would have enjoyed painting he poured with pulseless ease and then dissolved into the gloom good lord courtney you seduced me on cheaper she flushed not happily courtney had a better career going than i she outpowered me we both knew who was smarter better connected more likely to end up in a corner office with the historically significant antique desk the only edge i had was that i was a male in a sellers market it was enough this is a business dinner donald she said nothing more i favored her with an expression of polite disbelief i knew from experience shed find infuriating and digging into my pheasant murmured of course we didnt say much of consequence until dessert when i finally asked so whats loebsoffner up to these days structuring a corporate expansion jims putting together the financial side of the package and im doing personnel youre being headhunted donald she favored me with that feral little flash of teeth she made when she saw something she wanted courtney wasnt a beautiful woman far from it but there was that fierceness to her that sense of something primal being held under tight and precarious control that made her hot as hot to me youre talented youre thuggish and youre not too tightly nailed to your present position those are all qualities were looking for she dumped her purse on the table took out a single folded sheet of paper these are the terms im offering she placed it by my plate attacked her torte with gusto i unfolded the paper this is a lateral transfer unlimited opportunity for advancement she said with her mouth full if youve got the stuff mmm i did a linebyline of the benefits all comparable to what i was getting now my current salary to the dollarms soffner was showing off and the stock options this cant be right not for a lateral there was that grin again like a glimpse of shark in murky waters i knew youd like it were going over the top with the options because we need your answer right awaytonight preferably tomorrow at the latest no negotiations we have to put the package together fast theres going to be a shitstorm of publicity when this comes out we want to have everything nailed down present the fundies and bleeding hearts with a fait accompli my god courtney what kind of monster do you have hold of now the biggest one in the world bigger than apple bigger than home virtual bigger than hivaciv she said with relish have you ever heard of koestler biological i put my fork down koestler youre peddling corpses now please postanthropic biological resources she said it lightly with just the right touch of irony still i thought i detected a certain discomfort with the nature of her clients product theres no money in it i waved a hand toward our attentive waitstaff these guys must bewhatmaybe two percent of the annual turnover zombies are luxury goods servants reactor cleanups hollywood stunt deaths exotic serviceswe both knew what i meanta few hundred a year maybe tops theres not the demand the revulsion factor is too great theres been a technological breakthrough courtney leaned forward they can install the infrasystem and controllers and offer the product for the factoryfloor cost of a new subcompact thats way below the economic threshold for bluecollar labor look at it from the viewpoint of a typical factory owner hes already downsized to the bone and labor costs are bleeding him dry how can he compete in a dwindling consumer market now lets imagine he buys into the program she took out her mont blanc and began scribbling figures on the tablecloth no benefits no liability suits no sick pay no pilferage were talking about cutting labor costs by at least twothirds minimum thats irresistible i dont care how big your revulsion factor is we project we can move five hundred thousand units in the first year five hundred thousand i said thats crazy where the hell are you going to get the raw material for africa oh god courtney i was struck wordless by the cynicism it took to even consider turning the subsaharan tragedy to a profit by the sheer raw evil of channeling hard currency to the pocket hitlers who ran the camps courtney only smiled and gave that quick little flip of her head that meant she was accessing the time on an optic chip i think youre ready she said to talk with koestler at her gesture the zombie boys erected projector lamps about us fussed with the settings turned them on interference patterns moir√©d clashed meshed walls of darkness erected themselves about us courtney took out her flat and set it up on the table three taps of her nailed fingers and the round and hairless face of marvin koestler appeared on the screen ah courtney he said in a pleased voice youre innew york yes the san moritz with donald the slightest pause with each accessed bit of information did you have the antelope medallions when we shook our heads he kissed his fingertips magnificent theyre ever so lightly braised and then smothered in buffalo mozzarella nobody makes them better i had the same dish in florence the other day and there was simply no comparison i cleared my throat is that where you are italy lets leave out where i am he made a dismissive gesture as if it were a trifle but courtneys face darkened corporate kidnapping being the growth industry it is id gaffed badly the question iswhat do you think of my offer its interesting for a lateral its the startup costs were leveraged up to our asses as it is youll make out better this way in the long run he favored me with a sudden grin that went mean around the edges very much the financial buccaneer then he leaned forward lowered his voice maintained firm eye contact classic peoplehandling techniques youre not sold you know you can trust courtney to have checked out the finances still you think it wont work to work the product has to be irresistible and its not it cant be yes sir i said succinctly put he nodded to courtney lets sell this young man and to me my stretch is downstairs he winked out koestler was waiting for us in the limo a ghostly pink presence his holo rather a genial if somewhat coarsegrained ghost afloat in golden light he waved an expansive and insubstantial arm to take in the interior of the car and said make yourselves at home the chauffeur wore combatgrade photomultipliers they gave him a buggish inhuman look i wasnt sure if he was dead or not take us to heaven koestler said the doorman stepped out into the street looked both ways nodded to the chauffeur robot guns tracked our progress down the block courtney tells me youre getting the raw materials from africa distasteful but necessary to begin with we have to sell the idea firstno reason to make things rough on ourselves down the line though i dont see why we cant go domestic something along the lines of a reverse mortgage perhaps life insurance that pays off while youre still alive itd be a step towards getting the poor off our backs at last fuck em theyve been getting a goddamn free ride for too long the least they can do is to die and provide us with servants i was pretty sure koestler was joking but i smiled and ducked my head so id be covered in either case whats heaven i asked to move the conversation onto safer territory a proving ground koestler said with great satisfaction for the future have you ever witnessed bareknuckles fisticuffs no ah now theres a sport for gentlemen the sweet science at its sweetest no rounds no rules no holds barred it gives you the real measure of a mannot just of his strength but his character how he handles himself whether he keeps cool under pressurehow he stands up to pain security wont let me go to the clubs in person but ive made arrangements heaven was a converted movie theater in a rundown neighborhood in queens the chauffeur got out disappeared briefly around the back and returned with two zombie bodyguards it was like a conjurers trick you had these guys stashed in the trunk i asked as he opened the door for us its a new world courtney said get used to it the place was mobbed two maybe three hundred seats standing room only a mixed crowd blacks and irish and koreans mostly but with a smattering of uptown customers as well you didnt have to be poor to need the occasional taste of vicarious potency nobody paid us any particular notice wed come in just as the fighters were being presented weighing twofiveoh in black trunks with a red stripe the ref was bawling tha gangbang gangsta tha bareknuckle brawla tha man with tha courtney and i went up a scummy set of back stairs bodyguardusbodyguard as if we were a combat patrol out of some twentiethcentury jungle war a scrawny potbellied old geezer with a damp cigar in his mouth unlocked the door to our box sticky floor bad seats a good view down on the ring gray plastic matting billowing smoke koestler was there in a shiny new hologram shell it reminded me of those plaster madonnas in painted bathtubs that catholics set out in their yards your permanent box i asked all of this is for your sake donaldyou and a few others were pitting our product oneonone against some of the local talent by arrangement with the management what youre going to see will settle your doubts once and for all youll like this courtney said ive been here five nights straight counting tonight the bell rang starting the fight she leaned forward avidly hooking her elbows on the railing the zombie was grayskinned and modestly muscled for a fighter but it held up its hands alertly was light on its feet and had strangely calm and knowing eyes its opponent was a real bruiser a big black guy with classic african features twisted slightly out of true so that his mouth curled up in a kind of sneer on one side he had gang scars on his chest and even uglier marks on his back that didnt look deliberate but like something hed earned on the streets his eyes burned with an intensity just this side of madness he came forward cautiously but not fearfully and made a couple of quick jabs to get the measure of his opponent they were blocked and countered they circled each other looking for an opening for a minute or so nothing much happened then the gangster feinted at the zombies head drawing up its guard he drove through that opening with a slam to the zombies nuts that made me wince no reaction the dead fighter responded with a flurry of punches and got in a glancing blow to its opponents cheek they separated engaged circled around then the big guy exploded in a combination of killer blows connecting so solidly it seemed they would splinter every rib in the dead fighters body it brought the crowd to their feet roaring their approval the zombie didnt even stagger a strange look came into the gangsters eyes then as the zombie counterattacked driving him back into the ropes i could only imagine what it must be like for a man who had always lived by his strength and his ability to absorb punishment to realize that he was facing an opponent to whom pain meant nothing fights were lost and won by flinches and hesitations you won by keeping your head you lost by getting rattled despite his best blows the zombie stayed methodical serene calm relentless that was its nature it must have been devastating the fight went on and on it was a strange and alienating experience for me after a while i couldnt stay focused on it my thoughts kept slipping into a zone where i found myself studying the line of courtneys jaw thinking about later tonight she liked her sex just a little bit sick there was always a feeling fucking her that there was something truly repulsive that she really wanted to do but lacked the courage to bring up on her own so there was always this urge to get her to do something she didnt like she was resistant i never dared try more than one new thing per date but i could always talk her into that one thing because when she was aroused she got pliant she could be talked into anything she could be made to beg for it courtney wouldve been amazed to learn that i was not proud of what i did with herquite the opposite in fact but i was as obsessed with her as she was with whatever it was that obsessed her suddenly courtney was on her feet yelling the hologram showed koestler on his feet as well the big guy was on the ropes being pummeled blood and spittle flew from his face with each blow then he was down hed never even had a chance he mustve known early on that it was hopeless that he wasnt going to win but hed refused to take a fall he had to be pounded into the ground he went down raging proud and uncomplaining i had to admire that but he lost anyway that i realized was the message i was meant to take away from this not just that the product was robust but that only those who backed it were going to win i could see even if the audience couldnt that it was the end of an era a mans body wasnt worth a damn anymore there wasnt anything it could do that technology couldnt handle better the number of losers in the world had just doubled tripled reached maximum what the fools below were cheering for was the death of their futures i got up and cheered too in the stretch afterwards koestler said youve seen the light youre a believer now i havent necessarily decided yet dont bullshit me koestler said ive done my homework mr nichols your current position is not exactly secure mortonwestern is going down the tubes the entire service sector is going down the tubes face it the old economic order is as good as fucking gone of course youre going to take my offer you dont have any other choice the fax outed sets of contracts a certain product it said here and there corpses were never mentioned but when i opened my jacket to get a pen koestler said wait ive got a factory three thousand positions under me ive got a motivated workforce theyd walk through fire to keep their jobs pilferage is at zero sick time practically the same give me one advantage your product has over my current workforce sell me on it ill give you thirty seconds i wasnt in sales and the job had been explicitly promised me already but by reaching for the pen i had admitted i wanted the position and we all knew whose hand carried the whip they can be catheterized i saidno toilet breaks for a long instant koestler just stared at me blankly then he exploded with laughter by god thats a new one you have a great future ahead of you donald welcome aboard he winked out we drove on in silence for a while aimless directionless at last courtney leaned forward and touched the chauffeurs shoulder take me home she said riding through manhattan i suffered from a waking hallucination that we were driving through a city of corpses gray faces listless motions everyone looked dead in the headlights and sodium vapor streetlamps passing by the childrens museum i saw a mother with a stroller through the glass doors two small children by her side they all three stood motionless gazing forward at nothing we passed by a stopandgo where zombies stood out on the sidewalk drinking forties in paper bags through upperstory windows i could see the sad rainbow trace of virtuals playing to empty eyes there were zombies in the park zombies smoking blunts zombies driving taxies zombies sitting on stoops and hanging out on street corners all of them waiting for the years to pass and the flesh to fall from their bones i felt like the last man alive courtney was still wired and sweaty from the fight the pheromones came off her in great waves as i followed her down the hall to her apartment she stank of lust i found myself thinking of how she got just before orgasm so desperate so desirable it was different after she came she would fall into a state of calm assurance the same sort of calm assurance she showed in her business life the aplomb she sought so wildly during the act itself and when that desperation left her so would i because even i could recognize that it was her desperation that drew me to her that made me do the things she needed me to do in all the years id known her wed never once had breakfast together i wished there was some way i could deal her out of the equation i wished that her desperation were a liquid that i could drink down to the dregs i wished i could drop her in a wine press and squeeze her dry at her apartment courtney unlocked her door and in one complicated movement twisted through and stood facing me from the inside well she said all in all a productive evening good night donald good night arent you going to invite me inside no what do you mean no she was beginning to piss me off a blind man couldve told she was in heat from across the street a chimpanzee couldve talked his way into her pants what kind of idiot game are you playing now you know what no means donald youre not stupid no im not and neither are you we both know the score now let me in goddamnit enjoy your present she said and closed the door i found courtneys present back in my suite i was still seething from her treatment of me and stalked into the room letting the door slam behind me so that i was standing in neartotal darkness the only light was what little seeped through the draped windows at the far end of the room i was just reaching for the light switch when there was a motion in the darkness jackers i thought and all in a panic lurched for the light switch hoping to achieve i dont know what creditjackers always work in trios one to torture the security codes out of you one to phone the numbers out of your accounts and into a fiscal trapdoor a third to stand guard was turning the lights on supposed to make them scurry for darkness like roaches nevertheless i almost tripped over my own feet in my haste to reach the switch but of course it was nothing like what id feared it was a woman she stood by the window in a white silk dress that could neither compete with nor distract from her ethereal beauty her porcelain skin when the lights came on she turned toward me eyes widening lips parting slightly her breasts swayed ever so slightly as she gracefully raised a bare arm to offer me a lily hello donald she said huskily im yours for the night she was absolutely beautiful and dead of course not twenty minutes later i was hammering on courtneys door she came to the door in a pierre cardin dressing gown and from the way she was still cinching the sash and the disarray of her hair i gathered she hadnt been expecting me im not alone she said i didnt come here for the dubious pleasures of your fair white body i pushed my way into the room but couldnt help remembering that beautiful body of hers not so exquisite as the dead whores and now the thoughts were inextricably mingled in my head death and courtney sex and corpses a gordian knot i might never be able to untangle you didnt like my surprise she was smiling openly now amused no i fucking did not i took a step toward her i was shaking i couldnt stop fisting and unfisting my hands she fell back a step but that confident oddly expectant look didnt leave her face bruno she said lightly would you come in here a motion at the periphery of vision bruno stepped out of the shadows of her bedroom he was a muscular brute pumped ripped and as black as the fighter id seen go down earlier that night he stood behind courtney totally naked with slim hips and wide shoulders and the finest skin id ever seen and dead i saw it all in a flash oh for gods sake courtney i said disgusted i cant believe you that youd actually that things just an obedient body theres nothing thereno passion no connection just physical presence courtney made a kind of chewing motion through her smile weighing the implications of what she was about to say nastiness won we have equity now she said i lost it then i stepped forward raising a hand and i swear to god i intended to bounce the bitchs head off the back wall but she didnt flinchshe didnt even look afraid she merely moved aside saying in the body bruno he has to look good in a business suit a dead fist smashed into my ribs so hard i thought for an instant my heart had stopped then bruno punched me in my stomach i doubled over gasping two three four more blows i was on the ground now rolling over helpless and weeping with rage thats enough baby now put out the trash bruno dumped me in the hallway i glared up at courtney through my tears she was not at all beautiful now not in the least youre getting older i wanted to tell her but instead i heard my voice angry and astonished saying you you goddamn fucking necrophile cultivate a taste for it courtney said oh she was purring i doubted shed ever find life quite this good again half a million brunos are about to come on the market youre going to find it a lot more difficult to pick up living women in not so very long i sent away the dead whore then i took a long shower that didnt really make me feel any better naked i walked into my unlit suite and opened the curtains for a long time i stared out over the glory and darkness that was manhattan i was afraid more afraid than id ever been in my life the slums below me stretched to infinity they were a vast necropolis a neverending city of the dead i thought of the millions out there who were never going to hold down a job again i thought of how they must hate meme and my kindand how helpless they were before us and yet there were so many of them and so few of us if they were to all rise up at once theyd be like a tsunami irresistible and if there was so much as a spark of life left in them then that was exactly what they would do that was one possibility there was one other and that was that nothing would happen nothing at all god help me but i didnt know which one scared me more the dead kid by darrell schweitzer darrell schweitzer is the author of the novels the shattered goddess and the mask of the sorcerer as well as numerous short stories which have been collected in transients nightscapes refugees from an imaginary country and necromancies and netherworlds wellknown as an editor and critic he coedited the magazine weird tales for several years and is currently coediting anthologies with martin h greenberg for daw books such as the secret history of vampires schweitzer says one of the inspirations for the dead kid was the true story of the boy in the box whose corpse was found in a woods in northeast philadelphia in the case remains unsolved and there are police detectives who have obsessed over it throughout their entire careers and into their retirement they dont even know his name schweitzer says he is a complete mystery schweitzer joked that given the mystery surrounding this case the zombie tale he imagined is as good an explanation as any turns out that an informantwho is deeply unreliablesaid that the boys name was jonathan just like in this story so perhaps he has the real answer after all i its been a lot of years but i think im still afraid of luke bradley because of what he showed me i knew him in the first grade and he was a tough guy even then the sort of kid who would sit on a tack and insist it didnt hurt and then make you sit on the same tack which definitely did hurt because you were afraid of what hed do if you didnt once he found a baldfaced hornet nest on tree branch broke it off and ran yelling down the street waving the branch around and around until finally the nest fell off and the hornets came out like a cloud nobody knew what happened after that because the rest of us had run away we didnt see luke in school for a couple days afterwards so i suppose he got stung rather badly when he did show up he was his old self and beat up three other boys in one afternoon two of them needed stitches when i was about eight the word went around the neighborhood that luke bradley had been eaten by a werewolf come on said tommy hitchens lukes current sidekick ill show you whats left of him up in a tree i didnt believe any werewolf would have been a match for luke bradley but i went when tommy pointed out the alleged remains of the corpse up in the tree i could tell even from a distance that i was looking at a tshirt and a pair of bluejeans stuffed with newspapers i said so and tommy flattened me with a deft right hook which broke my nose and my glasses the next day luke was in school as usual though i had a splint on my nose when he saw me he called me a pussy and kicked me in the balls already he was huge probably a couple of years older than the rest of the class though he never admitted it everybody knew hed been held back in every grade at least once even kindergarten but he wasnt stupid he was crazy that was the fascination of hanging out with him even if you could get hurt in his company he did wild things that no one else dared even think about there was the stunt with the hornet nest or the time he picked up fresh dogshit in both his bare hands and claimed he was going to eat it right in front of us before everybody got grossed out and ran because we were afraid he was going to make us eat it maybe he really did he was just someone for whom the rules all the rules simply did not apply that he was usually in detention and had been picked up by the police several times only added to his mystique and in the summer when i was twelve luke bradley showed me the dead kid things had progressed quite a bit since then no one quite believed all the stories of lukes exploits though he would beat the crap out of you if you questioned them to his face had he really stolen a car did he really hang onto the outside of a pw lightrail train and ride all the way into philadelphia without getting caught nobody knew but when he said to me and to my tenyearold brother albert hey you two scuzzesscuzz being his favorite word of the momenttheres a dead kid in cabbage creek woods wanna see it wasnt really a question albert tried to turn away and said david i dont think we should but i knew what was good for us yeah i said sure we want to see luke was already more than a head taller than either of us and fifty pounds heavier he was cultivating the hood image from some handmedown memory of james dean or elvis with his hair up in a greasy swirl and a black leather jacket worn even on hot days when he kept his shirt unbuttoned so he could show off that he already had chest hair a cigarette dangled from his lips he blew smoke in my face i strained not to cough well come on then he said its really cool so we followed him along with a kid called animal and another called spikethe beginnings of lukes gang with which he said he was going to make himself famous one day my little brother tagged after us reluctantly at first but then as fascinated as i was to be initiated into this innermost forbidden secret of the older badder set luke had quite a sense of showmanship he led us under bushes crawling through natural tunnels under vines and dead trees where when we were smaller wed had our own secret hideouts as i suppose all children do luke and his crowd were getting too big for that sort of thing but they went crashing through the underbrush like bears i was small and skinny enough david was young enough in fact it was all we could do to keep up with a great flourish luke raised a vine curtain and we emerged into the now halfabandoned radnor golf course it was an early saturday morning mist was still rising from the poorly tended greens i saw one golfer far away otherwise we had the world to ourselves we ran across the golf course then across lancaster pike then up the hill and back into the woods on the other side i only thought for a minute hey wait a minute were going to see a corpse a kid like us only dead but as i said for luke bradley or even with him all rules were suspended and i knew better than try to ask what the kid died of because wed see soon enough in the woods again by secret and hidden ways we came to the old fort which had probably been occupied by generations of boys by then though of course right now it belonged to the luke bradley gang i dont know who built the fort or why it was a rectangle of raised earth and piled stone with logs laid across for a roof and vines growing thickly over the whole thing so that from a distance it just looked like a hillock or knoll that was part of its secret you had to know it was there and only luke could let you in he raised another curtain of vines and with a sweep of his hand and a bow said welcome to my house you assholes spike and animal laughed while albert and i got down on our hands and knees and crawled inside immediately i almost gagged on the awful smell like rotten garbage and worse albert started to cough i thought he was going to throw up but before i could say or do anything luke and his two henchmen had come in after us and we all crowded around a pit in the middle of the dirt floor which didnt used to be there now there was a fourfoot drop a roughly square cavity and in the middle of that a cardboard box which was clearly the source of the unbelievable stench luke got out a flashlight then reached down and opened the box its a dead kid i found him in the woods in this box hes mine i couldnt help but look it was indeed a dead kid an emaciated pale thing naked but for what might have been the remains of filthy underpants lying on its side in a fetal position little clawlike hands bunched up under its chin a dead kid said luke really cool then albert really was throwing up and screaming at the same time and scrambling to get out of there only animal and then spike had him by the back of his shirt the way you pick up a kitten by the scruff of its neck and they passed him back to luke who held his head in his hands and forced him down into that pit saying now look at it you fucking pussy faggot this because its really cool albert was sobbing and sniffling when luke let him go but he didnt try to run nor did i even when luke got a stick and poked the dead kid with it this is the best part he said we didnt run away then because we had to watch just to convince ourselves that we werent crazy because of what we were seeing luke poked and the dead kid moved spasming at first then grabbing at the stick feebly and finally crawling around inside the box like a slow clumsy animal just barely able to turn scratching at the cardboard with bony fingertips what is he i had to ask a zombie said luke arent zombies supposed to be black you mean like a nigger that was another of lukes favorite words this year he called everybody nigger no matter what color they were well you know voodoo in haiti and all that as we spoke the dead kid reared up and almost got out of the box luke poked him in the forehead with his stick and knocked him down i suppose if we let him rot long enough hell be black enough even for you the dead kid stared up at us and made a bleating sound the worst thing of all was that he didnt have any eyes only huge sockets and an oozy mess inside them albert was sobbing for his mommy by then and after a while of poking and prodding the dead kid luke and his friends got tired of this sport luke turned to me and said you can go now but you know if you or your pisspants brother tell about this ill kill you both and put you in there for the dead kid to eat ii i cant remember much of what albert and i did for the rest of that day we ran through the woods tripped fell flat on our faces in a stream then later we were walking along the old railroad embankment turning over ties to look for snakes and all the while albert was babbling on about the dead kid and how we had to do something i just let him talk until he got it all out of him and when we went home for dinner and were very quiet when mom and our stepdad steve tried to find out what we had been doing all day just playing i said in the woods its good for them to be outdoors steve said to mom too many kids spent all their time in front of the tv watching unwholesome junk these days im glad our kids are normal but albert ended up screaming in his sleep for weeks and wetting his bed and things were anything but normal that summer he was the one with the obvious problems he was the one who ended up going to a specialist and whatever he said in therapy must not have been believed because the police didnt go tearing up cabbage creek woods luke bradley and his neanderthals were not arrested and i was more or less left alone in fact i had more unsupervised time than usual and i used it to work out problems of my own like i hated school and i hated stepdad steve for the sanctimonious prig he was i decided with the full wisdom of my twelve years and some months that if i was to survive in this rough tough evil world i was going to have to become tough myself bad and very likely evil i decided that luke bradley had the answers so i sought him out it wasnt hard he had a knack for being in the right place at the right time when youre ready to sell your soul just like the devil i met him in town in front of the wayne toy town where i used to go to buy model kits and stuff i still liked building models and doing scientific puzzles though i would never admit it to luke bradley so i just froze when i saw him there well well he said if it aint the little pussy scuzz he blew smoke from the perennial cigarette hello luke i said i nodded to his companions who included spike animal and a virtually hairless pale gorilla who went by the unlikely name of corky as i spoke i slipped my latest purchase into my shoulder bag and hoped he didnt notice corky grabbed me by the back of the neck and said whaddaya want me to do with him but before luke could respond i said hey have you still got the dead kid at the fort they all hesitated they werent expecting that well hes cool i said i want to see him again okay said luke we didnt have any other way to get there so we walked about an hour to cabbage creek woods luke dispensed with ceremony we just crawled into the fort and gathered around the pit the smell if anything was worse this time the dead kid was already moving around inside the box when luke opened the cardboard flaps the dead kid stood up with his horrible pusfilled eyesockets staring he made that bleating groaning sound again he clawed at the edge of the box really cool i forced myself to say swallowing hard i can make him do tricks said luke watch this i watched as he shoved his finger through the skin under the dead kids chin and lifted him up like a hooked fish out of the pit the dead kid scrambled over the edge of the box then crouched down on the dirt floor at the edge of the pit staring into space luke passed his hand slowly in front of the dead kids face he snapped his fingers the dead kid didnt respond luke smacked him on the side of the head the dead kid whimpered a little and made that bleating sound everybody outside luke said so we all crawled out and then luke reached back inside with a stick and touched the dead kid who came out too clinging to the stick trying to chew on it but not quite coordinated enough so that he just snapped his teeth in the air and rubbed the side of his face along the stick i could see him clearly now he really was rotten with bone sticking out at his knees and elbows only scraggly patches of dark hair left on his head every rib showing in hideous relief on his bare back and holes through his skin between some of them look said luke look at him dance he swirled the stick around and around and the dead kid clung to it staggering around in a circle corky spoke up ya think ifn he gets dizzy hell puke luke yanked the stick out of the dead kids hands then hit him hard with it across the back with a thwack the dead kid dropped to all fours and just stayed there his head hanging down cant puke got no guts left they all laughed at that i didnt quite get the joke but despite everything i tried to get the joke despite even the incongruity that i really was like it or not a more or less normal kid and right now i had a model kit for a plastic fokker triplane in my schoolbag i still wanted to measure up to luke bradley for all i was more afraid of him than i had ever been i figured you had to be afraid of what you did and who you hung out with if you were going to be really bad you did what luke did that was what transgression was all about so i unzipped my fly and pissed on the dead kid he made that bleating sound the others chuckled nervously luke grinned pretty cool davey my boy pretty cool then luke started to play the role of wise elder brother he put his arm around my shoulders he took me a little ways apart from the others and said i like you i think you got something special in there he rapped on my head with his knuckles hard but i didnt flinch away then he led me back to the others and said i think were gonna make david here a member of the gang so we all sat down in the clearing with the dead kid in our circle as if he were one of the gang too luke got out an old briefcase from inside the fort and produced some very crumpled nudie magazines and passed them around and we all looked at the pictures he even made a big funny show of opening out a foldout for the dead kid to admire he smoked and passed cigarettes out to all of us id never had one before and it made me feel sick but luke told me to hold the smoke in then breathe it out slowly i was amazed and appalled when right in front of everyone he unzipped his pants and started to jerk off the others did it too making a point of trying to squirt on the dead kid luke looked at me come on join in with the other gentlemen the other gentlemen brayed like jackasses i couldnt move then i really wanted to be like them but i knew i wasnt going to measure up all i could hope for now was to put up a good front so maybe theyd decide i wasnt a pussy after all and maybe let me go after they beat me up a little bit i could hope for that much but luke had other ideas he put his hand on the back of my neck it could have been a friendly gesture or if he squeezed he could have snapped my head off for all i could have done anything about it now david he said i dont care if youve even got a dick any more than i care if he does he jerked his thumb at the dead kid but if you want to join our gang if you want to be cool you have to meet certain standards he flicked a switchblade open right in front of my face i thought he was going to cut my nose with it but with a sudden motion he slashed the dead kids nose right off it flew into the air corky caught it then threw it away in mindless disgust the dead kid whimpered his face was a black oozing mess then luke took hold of my right hand and slashed the back of it i let out a yell and tried to stop the bleeding with my other hand no luke said let him lick it he needs a little blood now and then to keep him healthy i screamed then and sobbed and whimpered the way albert had that first time but luke held onto me with a grip so strong that i was the one who wriggled like a fish on a line and he held my cut hand out to the dead kid i couldnt look but something soft and wet touched my hand and i could only think oh god what kind of infection or disease am i going to get from this okay david luke said then youre doing just fine but there is one more test you have to spend the whole night in the fort with the dead kid weve all done it now its your turn they didnt wait for my answer but laughing hauled me back inside the fort then luke had the dead kid hooked under the chin again and lowered him down into his box in the pit the others crawled back outside before he left luke turned to me you have to stay here until tomorrow morning you know what ill do to you if you pussy out so i spent the rest of the afternoon and the evening inside that fort with the dead kid scratching around in his box it was already dark in the fort i couldnt tell what time it was i couldnt think very clearly at all i wondered if anyone was looking for me i lay very still i didnt want to be found especially not by the dead kid who for all i knew could crawl out of the box and the pit if he really wanted to and maybe rip my throat out and drink my blood my hand hurt horribly it seemed to be swelling i was sure it was already rotten the air was thick and foul but i stayed where i was because i was afraid because i was weak with nausea but also incredibly because somehow somewhere deep down inside myself i still wanted to show how tough i was to be like luke bradley to be as amazing and crazy as he was i knew that i wasnt cut out for this and thats why i wanted itto be bad so no one would ever beat me up again and if i hated my stepdad or my teachers i could just tell them to go fuck off as luke would do hours passed and still the dead kid circled around and around inside his cardboard box sliding against the sides he made that bleating coughing sound as if he were trying to talk and didnt have any tongue left for a time i thought there was almost some sense in it some pattern he was clicking like a cricket this went on for hours maybe i even slept for a while and fell into a kind of dream in which i was sinking slowly down into incredibly foulsmelling muck and there were thousands of baldfaced hornets swarming over me all of them with little luke bradley faces saying cool really cool until their voices blended together and became a buzzing then became wind in the trees then the roar of a pw lightrail train rushing off toward philadelphia and the dead kid and i were hanging onto the outside of the car swinging wildly my arm hit a pole and snapped right off and black ooze was pouring out of my shoulder and the hornets swarmed over me eating me up bit by bit once i am certain the dead kid did reach up and touch me very gently running his dry sharp fingertip down the side of my cheek cutting me then withdrawing with a little bit of blood and tears on his fingertip to drink but strangest of all i wasnt afraid of him then it came to me then that we too had more in common than not we were both afraid and in pain and lost in the dark iii then somehow it was morning the sunlight blinded me when luke opened the vine curtain over the door hey you were really brave im impressed davey i let him lead me out of the fort taking comfort in his chumbigbrother manner but i was too much in shock to say anything you passed the test youre one of us he said welcome to the gang now there is one last thing for you to do not a test youve passed all the tests its just something we do to celebrate his goons had gathered once more in the clearing outside the fort one of them was holding a can of gasoline i stood there swaying about to faint unable to figure out what the gasoline was for luke brought the dead kid outside corky poured gasoline over the dead kid who just bleated a little and waved his hands in the air luke handed me a cigarette lighter he flicked it until there was a flame go on he said itll be cool but i couldnt i was too scared too sick i just dropped to my knees then onto all fours and started puking so luke lit the dead kid on fire and the others hooted and clapped as the dead kid went up like a torch staggering and dancing around the clearing trailing black oily smoke then he fell down and seemed to shrivel up into a pile of blackened smoldering sticks luke forced me over to where the dead kid had fallen and made me touch what was left with my swollen hand and the dead kid moved he made that bleating sound he whimpered you see you cant kill him because hes already dead they were all laughing but i just puked again and finally luke hauled me to my feet by both shoulders turned me around and shoved me away staggering into the woods come back when you stop throwing up he said iv somehow i found my way home and when i did mom just stared at me in horror and said my god whats that awful smell but stepdad steve shook me and demanded to know where i had been and what id been doing did i know the police were looking for me did i care no and no he took me into the bathroom washed and bandaged my hand then held me so i couldnt turn away and said have you been taking drugs that was so stupid i started to laugh and he smacked me across the face something he rarely did but this time i think he was determined to beat the truth out of me and mommy dearest mommy didnt raise a finger to stop him as he laid on with his hand then his belt and i was shrieking my head off all they got out of me was the admission that i had been with luke bradley and his friends i dont want you to associate with those boys any further theyre unwholesome he didnt know a tenth of it and i started to laugh again like i was drunk or something and he was about to hit me again when mom finally made him stop she told me to change my clothes and take a bath and then go to my room i wasnt allowed out except for meals and to go to the bathroom that was fine with me i didnt want to come out i wanted to bury myself in there to be quiet and dead like the dead kid in his box but when i fell asleep i was screaming in a dream and i woke up screaming in the dark because it was night again mom looked in briefly but didnt say anything the expression on her face was more of disgust than concern as if she really wanted to say serves him damn right but oh god another crazy kid well have to send to the so so expensive psychiatrist and id rather spend the money on a new mink coat or a car or something it was my kid brother albert who snuck over to my bed and whispered its the dead kid isnt it huh the dead kid he talks to me in my dreams hes told me all about himself hes lost his fathers a magician who is still trying to find him there was a war between magicians or something and thats how he got lost huh is this something you read in a comic book no its the dead kid you know what we have to do david we have to go save him i have to give my brother credit for bringing about my moral redemption as surely as if hed handed me my sanity back on a silver platter and said go on dont be a pussy take it because he was right we had to save the dead kid maybe the dead kid talked to albert in his dreams but he didnt tell me anything why should he still id gotten the message so that night very late albert and i got dressed and slipped out the window of our room dropping onto the lawn he wasnt afraid not a little bit he led me by the ritual route under the arching bushes through the tunnels of vines to all our secret places as if we had to be there first to gain some special strength for the task at hand under the bushes in the darkness we paused to scratch secret signs in the dirt then we scurried across the golf course across the highway into cabbage creek woods we came to the fort by the light of a full moon now flickering through swaying branches it was a windy night the woods were alive with sounds of wood creaking and snapping of animals calling back and forth and nightbirds cawing somewhere very close at hand an owl cried out albert got down on all fours in the doorway of the fort poked his head in and said hey dead kid are you in there he backed out and waited there was a rustling sound but the dead kid didnt come out so we both crawled in and saw why there wasnt much left of him he was just a bundle of black sticks his head like a charred pumpkin balanced precariously on top all he could do was sit up weakly and peer over the side of the box so we had to lift him out of the pit box and all come on albert said to him we want to show you some stuff we carried the dead kid between us we took him back across the golf course under the bushes to our special places we showed him the secret signs then we took him into town we showed him the storefronts wayne toy town where i bought models where there were always neat displays of miniature battlefields or of monsters in the windows we showed him where the pet store was and the ice cream store and where you got comic books albert sat down on the merrygoround in the playground holding the dead kids box securely beside him i pushed them around slowly metal creaked we stood in front of our school for a while and albert and the dead kid were holding hands but it seemed natural and right then we went away in the bright moonlight through the empty streets no one said anything because whatever the dead kid could say or hear wasnt in words anyway i couldnt hear it i think albert could in the end the dead kid scrambled out of his box somehow he had regained enough strength to walk somehow he was beginning to heal in the end he wanted to show us something he led us back across the golf course but away from cabbage creek woods we crossed the football field at radnor high school then went across the street up in back of wyeth labs and across the high bridge over the pw tracks i was afraid the dead kid would slip on the metal stairs and fall but he went more steadily than we did albert and i were both a little afraid of heights he led us across another field into woods again then through an opening where a stream flowed beneath the pennsylvania railroad embankment we waded ankledeep in the chilly water and came at last to the old grant estate a huge ruin of a victorian house which every kid knew was haunted which our parents told us to stay away from because it was dangerous there were so many stories about kids murdered by tramps or falling through floors but now it wasnt a ruin at all no broken windows no holes in the roof every window blazed with light from a high window in a tower a man in black gazed down at us the dead kid looked up at him then began to run i hurried after him now it was albert who had better sense who hung back i caught hold of the dead kids arm as if to stop him and i felt possessive for a moment as if i owned him the way luke bradley had owned him hey dead kid i said where are you going he turned to me and by some trick of the moonlight he seemed to have a face pale round with dark eyes and he said to me in that bleating croaking voice of his actually forming words for once my name is jonathan that was the only thing he ever said to me he never talked to me in dreams he went to the front of the house the door opened the light within seemed to swallow him he turned back briefly and looked at us i dont think he was just a bundle of sticks anymore then he was gone and all the lights blinked out and it was dawn my brother and i stood before a ruined mansion in the morning twilight birds were singing raucously wed better get home albert said or well get in trouble yeah i said v that autumn i began junior high school because i hadnt been very successful as a bad boy and my grades were still a lot higher i wasnt in any of luke bradleys classes but he caught up with me in the locker room after school several weeks into the term all he said was i know what you did and beat me so badly that he broke several of my ribs and one arm and smashed in the whole side of my face and cracked the socket around my right eye he stuffed me into a locker and left me there to die and i spent the whole night in the darkness in great pain amid horrible smells calling out for the dead kid to come and save me as id saved him i made bleating clicking sounds but he didnt come the janitor found me in the morning the smell was merely that id crapped in my pants i spent several weeks in the hospital and afterwards stepdad steve and mom decided to move out of the state they put both me and albert in a prep school it was only after i got out of college that i went back to radnor township in pennsylvania where id grown up everything was changed there was a sears headquarters where the golf course used to be our old house had vanished beneath an apartment parking lot most of cabbage creek woods had been cut down to make room for an altmans department store and the grant estate was gone too to make room for an office complex i didnt go into the remaining woods to see if the fort was still there i imagine it is i imagine other kids own it now later someone told me that luke bradley who turned out to have really been three years older than me had been expelled from high school committed several robberies in the company of his three goons and then all of them were killed in a shootout with the police what luke bradley inadvertently showed me was that i could have been with the gang all the way to their violent and pointless end if albert and the dead kid whose name was jonathan hadnt saved me malthusians zombie by jeffrey ford jeffrey ford is the author of several novels including the physiognomy the portrait of mrs charbuque the girl in the glass and the shadow year he is a fourtime winner of the world fantasy award and has also won the nebula and edgar awards he is a prolific author of short fiction whose work has appeared in the magazine of fantasy science fiction sci fiction and in numerous anthologies two collections of his short work have been published the fantasy writers assistant and other stories and the empire of ice cream with a thirdthe drowned lifeon the way the idea for this story came from fords reading of julian jayness the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind the book posits that the voice of god in ancient cultures was in fact one side of the brain communicating with the other across the corpus callosum through the wernickes area ford says add to this the fact that at the time as now ford was teaching poe he says the setup of the story is sort of like what poe would do take some speculative aspect of science a theory that has not been corroborated an idea not many know the extent of and extrapolate a bizarre fanciful tale from it im not sure what nationality malthusian was but he spoke with a strange accent a stuttering lilt of mumblement it took weeks to fully comprehend as english he had more wrinkles than a witch and a shock of hair whiter and fuller than a samoyeds ruff i can still see him standing at the curb in front of my house slightly bent clutching a cane whose ivory womans head wore a blindfold his suit was a size and a half too large as were his eyes peering from behind lenses cast at a thickness that must have made his world enormous the two details that halted my raking and caused me to give him more than a neighborly wave were his string tie and a mischievous grin i had only ever seen before on my sixyearold daughter when she was drawing one of her monsters malthusian he said from the curb i greeted him and spoke my name he mumbled something and i leaned closer to him and begged his pardon at this he turned and pointed back at the house down on the corner i knew it had recently changed hands and i surmised he had just moved in welcome to the neighborhood i said he put his hand out and i shook it his grip was very strong and he was in no hurry to let go just as i realized he was aware of my discomfort his grin turned into a wide smile and he released me then he slowly began to walk away nice to meet you i said to his back he turned waved and let loose an utterance that had the cadence of poetry there was something about leaves and fruit and it all came together in a rhyme only when he had disappeared into the woods at the end of the block did i realize he had been quoting pope words are like leaves where they most abound beneath little fruit or sense is found as a professor of literature this amused me and i decided to try to find out more about malthusian i was on sabbatical that year supposedly writing a book concerning the structure of poes stories which i saw as lacking the energetic ascent of the fichtian curve and being comprised solely of denouement like houses of usher the reader comes to them as in a nightmare with no prior knowledge at the very moment they begin to crumble what i was really doing was dogging it in high fashion id kiss my wife goodbye as she left for work take my daughter to school and then return home to watch reruns of those shows my brother and i had devoted much of our childhood to malthusians daily constitutional was an opportunity to kill some time and so when i would see him passing in front of the house id come out and engage him in conversation our relationship grew slowly at first until i began to learn the cues for his odd rendering of the language by thanksgiving i could have a normal conversation with him and we began to have lengthy discussions about literature oddly enough his interests were far more contemporary than mine he expressed a devotion to pynchon and the west african writer amos tutuola i realized i had spent too long teaching the canon of early american works and began to delve into some of the novels he mentioned one day i asked him what he had done before his retirement he smiled and said something that sounded like mindfucker i was sure i had misunderstood him i laughed and said what was that mindfucker he said psychologist interesting description of the profession i said he shrugged and his grin dissipated when he spoke again he changed the subject to politics through the winter no matter the weather malthusian walked i remember watching him struggle along through a snowstorm one afternoon dressed in a black overcoat and black tyrolean hat bent more from some invisible weight than a failure of his frame it struck me then that i had never seen him on his return journey the trails through the woods went on for miles and i was unaware of one that might bring him around to his house from the other end of the block i introduced him to susan my wife and to my daughter lyda there at the curb he kissed both their hands or tried to when lyda pulled her hand back at his approach he laughed so i thought he would explode susan found him charming but asked me later what the hell was he saying the next day he brought a bouquet of violets for her and for lyda because she had shown him her drawing pad he left with me a drawing he had done rolled up and tied with a green ribbon after dinner she opened it and smiled a monster she said it was a beautifully rendered charcoal portrait of an otherwise normal middleaged man wearing an unnerving look of total blankness the eyes were heavy lidded and so realistically glassy the attitude of the body so slack that the figure exuded a palpable sense of emptiness at the bottom of the page in a fine calligraphic style were written the words malthusians zombie i told him i liked monsters said lyda why is that a monster asked susan who i could tell was a little put off by the eerie nature of the drawing it looks more like a college professor on sabbatical he thinks nothing said lyda and with her pinky finger pointed to the zombies head she had me tack it to the back of her door so that it faced the wall unless she wanted to look at it for the next few weeks she drew zombies of her own some wore little hats some bow ties but all of them no matter how huge and vacant the eyes wore mischievous grins in early spring malthusian invited me to come to his house one evening to play a game of chess the evening air was still quite cool but the scent of the breeze carried the promise of things green his house which sat on the corner lot was enormous by far the largest in the neighborhood it had three acres of woods appended to it and at the very back touched upon a lake that belonged to the adjacent town malthusian was obviously not much for yard work or home repair the very measure of a man in this part of the world a tree had cracked and fallen through the winter and it still lay partially obstructing the driveway the threestory structure and its four tall columns in front needed paint certain porch planks had succumbed to dry rot and its many windows were streaked and smudged the fact that he took no initiative to rectify these problems made him yet more likable to me he met me at the door and ushered me into his home i had visions of the place being like a dim candlelit museum of artifacts as odd as their owner and had hoped to decipher malthusians true character from them as if they were clues in a mystery novel there was nothing of the sort the place was well lit and tastefully though modestly decorated i hope you like merlot he said as he led me down an oak paneled hallway toward the kitchen yes i said its good for the heart he said and laughed the walls i passed were lined with photographs of malthusian with different people he moved quickly and i did not linger out of politeness but i thought i saw one of him as a child and more than one of him posing with various military personnel if i wasnt mistaken i could have sworn i had caught the face of an expresident in one of them the kitchen was old linoleum in blackandwhite checkerboard design brightly lit by overhead fluorescent lights sitting on a table in the center of the large expanse was a chessboard a magnum of dark wine two fine crystal goblets and a thin silver box he took a seat on one side of the table and extended his hand to indicate i was to sit across from him he methodically poured wine for both of us opened the box retrieved a cigarette lit it puffed once and then led with his knight im not very good i said as i countered with my opposite knight he waved his hand in the air flicked ash onto the floor and said lets not let it ruin our game we played in silence for some time and then i asked him something that had been on my mind since he had first disclosed his profession to me and what type of psychologist were you jungian freudian neither he said those are for children i was a rat shocker i made dogs drool behaviorist i asked sorry to disappoint he said with a laugh i teach the puritans with the same method i said and this made him laugh louder he loosened his everpresent string tie and cocked his glasses up before plunging through my pitiful pawn defense with his bishop i couldnt help but notice those photos in the hall i said were you in the army please no insults he said i worked for the us government what branch i asked one of the more shadowed entities he said it was necessary in order to bring my mother and father and sister to this country from where i asked the old country which one is that it no longer exists you know like in a fairy tale it has disappeared through geopolitical enchantment with this he checked me by way of a pawncastle combination your sister i asked she was much like your girl lyda beautiful and brilliant and what an artist as with the game he took control of the conversation from here on out directing me to divulge the history of my schooling my marriage the birth of my daughter the nature of our household it was a gentle interrogation the wine making me nostalgic i told him everything and he seemed to take the greatest pleasure in it nodding his head at my declaration of love for my wife laughing at all of lydas antics i could remember and i remembered all of them before i knew it we had played three games and i was as lit as a stick of kindling he led me down the hallway to the front door as if from thin air he produced a box of chocolates for my wife for the lady he said then he placed in my hand another larger box through bleary eyes i looked down and saw the image of rat fink the potbellied deviant rodent who had been a drag racing mascot in the late sixties its a model he told me help the girl make it she will enjoy this monster i smiled in recognition of the figure i had not seen since my teens big daddy roth he said and with this eased me out the door and gently closed it behind me although i had as my mission to uncover the mystery of malthusian my visit had made him more of an enigma i visited him twice more to play chess and on each of the occasions the scenario was much the same the only incident that verged on revelation was when lyda and i constructed the model and painted it rat shocker i remembered him telling me i had a momentary episode in which i envisioned myself salivating at the sound of a bell on the day that lyda brought me springs first crocus a pale violet specimen with an orange mouth malthusian was taken away in an ambulance i was very worried about him and enlisted susan since she was a nurse practitioner to use her connections in the hospitals to find out where he was she spent the better part of her friday evening making calls but came up with nothing days passed and i began to think that malthusian might have died then a week to the day after the ambulance had come for him i found a note in my mailbox all it said was chess tonight i waited for the appointed hour and after susan had given me a list of things to ask about the old mans condition and lyda a getwell drawing of a dancing zombie i set out for the house on the corner he did not answer the door so i opened it and called inside hello come he called from back in the kitchen i took the hallway and found him sitting at the chess table the wine was there and the cigarette case but there was no board what happened i said when i saw him malthusian looked yet more wrinkled and stooped sitting in his chair like a sack of old clothes his white hair had thinned considerably and turned a pale shade of yellow in his hands he clutched his cane which i had never seen him use before while in his house and that childish grin between malevolence and innocence had been replaced by the ill forced smile of rat fink no chess i asked as a way of masking my concern a game of a different order tonight he said and sighed i was about to ask again what had happened but he said drink a glass of wine and then you will listen we sat in silence as i poured and drank i had never noticed before but the blindfold on the ivory womans head did not completely cover her left eye she half stared at me as i did what i was told when the glass was empty and i had poured another he looked up and said now you must listen carefully i give you my confession and the last wish of a dying man i wanted to object but he brought the cane to his lips in order to silence me in september i was attending a conference of the american psychological association in washington dc a professor from princeton one julian jaynes gave a lecture there have you heard of him he asked i shook my head now you will he said the outrageous title of his address was the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind just the name of it led many to think it was pure snake oil when mr jaynes began to explain his theory they were sure of it individual consciousness as we know it today he said is a very recent development in the history of mankind before that like schizophrenics human beings listened to a voice that came from within their own heads and from this took their cues these were postice age huntergatherers for whom it was important to think with a single mind they heard the voice of some venerable elder of their tribe who had since perhaps passed on this was the muchtouted voice of god individual ego was virtually nonexistent you mean i said when the ancients refer to the word of the lord they were not speaking figuratively yes you follow he said and smiled lifting the wine glass to his lips with a trembling hand i could tell you that this phenomenon had to do with the right hemispherical language center of the brain and a particular zone called wernickes area when this area was stimulated in modern laboratory experiments the subjects very often heard authoritarian voices that either admonished or commanded but they were very distant voices the reason jaynes believed was that these auditory hallucinations were travelling from the right hemisphere to the left not through the corpus callosumthe shall we call it bridge that joins the hemispheresbut rather through another passageway the anterior commissure im hanging on by a thread now i said malthusian did not acknowledge my joke but closed his eyes momentarily and pressed on as if it would all soon become clear whereas jaynes gives many explanations for the growing faintness of the voice of godgenocide natural upheavals parental selection environmental demands requiring the wonderful plasticity of the human brain to enact these changesmy fellow researchers and i believed that the muting of the voice was a result of the rapid shrinking of the anterior commissure to its present state of no more than oneeighth of an inch across this we believed was the physiological change that fractured the group mind into individual consciousness father why have you forsaken me you see there is much more but that is the crux the survival of human beings depended upon this change i asked the complexity of civilization required diversification interesting was all i could manage as i said malthusian went on very few took jaynes seriously but i did his ideas were revolutionary but they were not unfounded here he took a cigarette from the silver case and lit it is that smart i asked nodding at the cigarette considering your health i have been conditioned by philip morris he said with a smile this theory is only the beginning i can tell i said very good professor he whispered as farid uddin attar might have writtenif this tale i am about to tell you were inscribed with needles upon the corner of the eye it would still serve as a lesson to the circumspect he lifted the bottle of wine and poured me another glass to begin with if you tell anyone what i am about to tell you you will be putting your family and yourself in great jeopardy understood i thought momentarily of malthusians photos with all those military personnel and his telling me that he had been employed by one of the more shadowed entities of the government a grim silence filled the room as those huge eyes of his focused on mine i thought of leaving but instead i slowly nodded i was part of a secret government project called dumbwaiter the title might have been humorous if not for the heinous nature of the work we were doing as psychologists we were assigned the task of creating dedicated assassins men devoid of personal volition who would do anythinganythingthat they were ordered to do mind control it is sometimes called the cia had for a short period thought that the drug lsd might be useful in this pursuit but instead of creating drones they spread cosmic consciousness once this failed the behaviorists were called in my lab was situated in a large old victorian house out in the woods no one would have suspected that some bizarre cold war experiment was taking place in its basement i had two partners and working off jayness theory through surgery and the implanting of pig arteries and chimpanzee neurons we widened and filled the anterior commissure in a test subjects brain in order to increase the volume of the auditory hallucination through conditioning my voice became the voice of god for our subject i was always in his head one verbal command from me and my order would remain with him inside his mind until the task was completed what else was i to think but that malthusian was pulling my leg do i look that gullible i said and laughed so hard i spilled a drop of my wine on the table the old man did not so much as smile we had created a zombie he said you laugh but you should be laughing at yourself you do not realize how without any of our work the human mind is so perfectly suggestible the words obedience and to listen share the same root in more than half a dozen languages with our experiment this man would do whatever he was told the results even surprised us i instructed him to learn fluent french in a week he did i instructed him to play a chopin nocturne on the piano after only hearing it once he did i instructed him to develop a photographic memory i commanded him to stop aging at times for the purpose of a particular assignment i might instruct him to become fatter thinner even shorter impossible i said nonsense said malthusian it has been known for some time now that the mere act of deep thought can change the physiological structure of the brain if only my colleagues and i could publish our findings others would also know that prolonged highly focused thought is capable of transforming the physiological structure of more than just the brain it was obvious to me at this time that malthusians illness had affected his mind i put on a serious face and pretended to follow along exhibiting a mixed sense of wonder and gravity why are you telling me all of this i asked why yes why he said and more astonishing than his tale tears began to form at the corners of his eyes the zombie had been useful please dont ask me specifically how but let us just say that his work resulted in the diminution of agitators against democracy but then with the end of the cold war our project was disbanded we were ordered to eliminate the zombie and set fire to the facility and were given large sums of cash to resume normal lifewith the threat that if we were to breathe a word about dumbwaiter to anyone we would be killed eliminate the zombie i said he nodded but i had pangs of conscience my own god was talking to me this man whom we had hollowed out and filled with my commands had been kidnapped just an average healthy citizen with a wife and a small child had been taken off the street one day by men in a long dark car his loved ones never knew what had become of him likewise i had made a deal to never see my own family again when i promised to work on dumbwaiter i disappeared after my parents and sister were brought to this country for me to contact them in any way would mean their demise i have missed them terribly through the years especially my sister with whom i had a strong bond after surviving the horrors of the old country for this reason i could not dispose of the zombie that would be murder i said and instantly regretted it it would have been murder either way said malthusian either i killed the subject or they killed us and our subject instead i took a chance and left to the ravages of the fire a cadaver we had on ice there for many years we hoped that no one was aware of it that if a body was found in the ashes that would be enough to suffice remember this is the government we are talking about we had worked for them long enough to know that their main priority was silence malthusian went silent himself nodding his head upon his chest i thought for a second that he had fallen asleep when i cleared my throat he reached for the wine but stopped he did the same with the cigarette case then he looked up at me im dying he said this very moment i asked soon very soon did they tell you that at the hospital im a doctor i know is there something you need me to do do you want me to contact your sister i asked no you must not mention any of this but there is something i want you to do he said call the ambulance i want you to take care of the zombie until the transformation is complete what are you talking about i said and smiled hes here with me in the house he has been with me all along since we burned the lab malthusian dropped the cane on the floor leaned forward on the table and reached for me with his left hand i pushed the chair back and stood away from the table to avoid his grasp ive been working with him trying to reverse the effects of the experiment the change has begun but it will take a little longer than i have left to complete it you must help me to return this poor man to his family so that he can enjoy what is left of his life he is beginning to remember a thing or two and the aging process is slowly starting to return him to his rightful maturity if i should die i require you to merely house him until he remembers where he is from it wont take very long now dr malthusian i said i think you need to rest you are not making any sense the old man slowly stood up you will wait he yelled at me holding his arm up and pointing with one finger i will get him i said nothing more but watched as malthusian precariously leaned over to retrieve his cane then he hobbled out of the room mumbling something to himself when i heard him mounting the stairs to the second floor i tiptoed out of the kitchen down the hall and out the front door i reached the street and started running like i was ten years old later in bed after locking all the doors and windows i woke susan up and told her everything that malthusian had said when i got to the part about the zombie she started laughing he wants you to babysit his zombie she asked its not funny i said he worked for some secret branch of the government thats the one all the kooks work for she said youre a man with way too much time on his hands he was pretty convincing i said now grinning myself what if i told you they were putting frankenstein together in the basement of the hospital if hes not crazy hes probably playing with your mind he seems to have a healthy measure of mischief about him that string tie is a good indicator i wasnt completely convinced but susan allayed my fears enough to allow me to get to sleep my dreams were punctuated by wideeyed stares and piano music i forced myself to believe that susan was right and that i had better ignore malthusian and get to work on my book the summer was quickly approaching and soon the autumn would send me back to teaching it would be a great embarrassment to return to work in september emptyhanded i picked up where i had left off months earlier on the manuscripta chapter concerning the facts in the case of m valdemar the return to work was what i needed to anchor me against the tide of malthusians weirdness but that particular story by the great american hoaxer second only to p t barnum had zombie written all over it one afternoon when i was about to leave the house to go to the local bookstore i looked out the front window and saw the old man slowly shuffling up the street i had neither seen nor heard from malthusian since the night i had abandoned him in his fit of madness two weeks prior it would have been a simple thing to leave the living room and hide in the kitchen but instead i quickly ducked down beneath the sill as i crouched there i wondered at the fear i had developed for my neighbor five minutes went by and when i thought he should have passed on to where the woods began at the end of the block i raised my head above the windowsill there he was standing at the curb hunched over staring directly at me like some grim and ghastly bird of yore i uttered a brief startled gasp and as if he could hear me he brought the top of his cane up and tapped it lightly against the brim of his tyrolean hat then he turned and moved off this little scene threw me into a panic i never went to the bookstore and when it was time for lyda to get out of school i drove over and picked her up instead of letting her take the bus which would have left her off at the corner my panic was shortlived for that evening at dinner as i was about to describe the event to susan we heard the ambulance it is sad to say but malthusians death was a relief to me lyda and i watched from a distance as they brought him out on the wheeled stretcher susan who was afraid of nothing least of all death went all the way to his house and spoke to the emts she was not there long when we saw her begin walking back massive heart attack she said as she approached shaking her head thats a shame i said lyda put her arm around my leg and hugged me the next morning while i was wandering around the house looking for inspiration to begin working on poe again i discovered that lyda had draped a silk purple flower plucked from susans diningroom table arrangement around the neck of rat fink the sight of this made me smile and as i reached out to touch the smooth illusion of the blossom i was interrupted by a knocking at the door i left my daughters room and went downstairs upon opening the front door i discovered that there was no one there as i stood looking out i heard the knocking sound again it took me a few long seconds to adjust to the fact that the sound was coming from the back of the house who knocks at the back door i said to myself as i made my way through the kitchen his eyes were the oval disks of japanese cartoon characters glassy and brimming with nothing like the whiteness of melvilles whale you could read anything into them and while lyda and i sat staring at him staring at the wall i projected my desires and frustrations into those mirrors with a will i doubt ahab could have mustered a blown easter egg said lyda breaking the silence and in the end she was right there was an exquisite emptiness about him his face was drawn his limbs thin but wiry with real muscle he looked like a fellow who might at one time have worked as a car mechanic or a ups delivery man i guessed his age to be somewhere in the late thirties but knew from what malthusian had suggested that his youth was merely compliance to a command i wondered how old he would become when the spell was broken perhaps like valdemar in poes story i thought he will eventually be reduced to a pool of putrescence we had been sitting with the zombie for over an hour when susan finally arrived home from work lyda got up from her seat and ran into the living room to tell her mother that we had a visitor guess who i heard her ask she led susan by the hand into the kitchen upon discovering our guest the first word out of her mouth was no it wasnt like the shriek of a heroine being accosted by a creature in the horror movies this was the no of derailed latenight amorous advances a response to lydas pleading to stay up till eleven on a school night lets be sensible about this i said what are we going to do call the police said susan are you crazy i said the very fact that he is here proves that what malthusian told me was all true wed be putting our lives in danger go play susan said to lyda can the zombie play she asked the zombie has to stay here i said and pointed toward the kitchen entrance when lyda was gone susan sat down at the table and she and i stared at him some more his breathing was very shallow and with the exception of this subtle movement of his chest he sat perfectly still there was something very relaxing about his presence this is crazy she said to me what are we going to do with him malthusian said he would soon remember where he was from and that we should take him to his home whenever the memory of it became clear to him cant we just drive him somewhere and let him out of the car asked susan well leave him off in the parking lot at the mall you wouldnt do that with a cat but you would abandon a human being i said she shook her head in exasperation well what does he do it doesnt look like much is becoming clear to him she said i turned to the zombie and said what is your name he didnt move susan reached over and snapped her fingers in front of his face hey mister zombie what should we call you wait a second i said he doesnt answer questions he responds to commands tell me your name susan said to him the zombie turned his head slightly toward her and began to slowly move his lips tom he said and the word sort of fell out of his mouth flat and dull as an old coin susan brought her hand up to cover a giggle tommy the zombie she said pathetic i said and couldnt suppress my own laughter even though there were shadowed entities at large in the world who might engineer our demise we had never had so unassuming a house guest tom was like that broom standing in the kitchen closet until you need it the novelty of performance upon command soon wore off sure we got a little mileage out of the stage hypnotist anticsbark like a dog act like a chicken i know it sounds a bit unfeeling but we did it i suppose simply because we could similar in spirit to the whim of the government that originally engineered the poor mans circumstance lyda put an end to this foolishness she lectured to us about how we should respect him we were embarrassed by her words but at the same time pleased that we had raised such a caring individual as it turned out she had a real affection for the zombie he was for lyda the puppy we would not let her have it was not difficult remembering to command him to go to the bathroom twice a day or to eat or shower what was truly hard was keeping him a secret we all swore to each other that we would tell no one susan and i were afraid that lyda so completely carried away by her new friend might not be able to contain herself at school think of the status one would reap in the third grade if it was known you had your own zombie at home throughout the ordeal she proved to be the most practical the most caring the most insightful of all of us the utter strangeness of the affair did not strike me until the next night when i woke from a bad dream with a dry mouth half in a daze i got out of bed and went to the kitchen for a glass of water i took my drink and going into the living room sat down on the couch for some reason i was thinking about poes the fall of the house of usher and how d h lawrence had described it as a story of vampirism i followed a thread of thought that looped in and out of that loopy story and ended with an image of the previously airy and lethargic madeline bursting out of her tomb to jump on old roderick then i happened to look to the left and jumped myself realizing that the zombie had been sitting next to me the entire time tom could make a great pot of coffee he vacuumed like a veteran chambermaid susan showed him how to do hospital corners when making the beds when he was not busy he would simply sit on the couch in the living room and stare directly across at the face of the grandfather clock it was clear that he had a conception of time because it was possible to set him like a vcr if we were going out we could tell him make and eat a bologna sandwich at one pm go to the bathroom at three somewhere in the second week of his asylum with us i got the notion to become more expansive in my commands i recalled malthusian telling me that he was capable of playing chopin after only listening to a piece once it became clear that the requests i had been making of him were penny ante i upped the stakes and instructed him to begin typing my handwritten notes for the poe book he flawlessly copied exactly what i had on the paper excited by this new breakthrough i then told him to read a grammar book and correct the text voil√† it became rapidly evident that we would have to get tom some new clothes since he continued to wear the same shortsleeved gray sears workshirt and pants day in and day out there was no question he would have worn them until they were reduced to shreds susan went to the store on her way home from work one night and bought him a few things the next day as an experiment we told him to get dressed choosing items from the pile of garments we laid before him he came out of the spare bedroom wearing a pair of loosefitting khakis and a black tshirt that had written in white block letters across it im with stupid we all got a charge out of this laugh tom said lyda the zombie opened wide his mouth and from way back in his throat came a highpitched ha ha the horror of it melted my smile and i began to wonder about his choice of shirts that is when i noticed that a distinct five oclock shadow had sprouted across his chin and sunken cheeks my god i thought without telling susan or lyda the aging process has begun when tom wasnt pulling his weight around the house lyda usually had him engaged in some game they played catch cards barbies and with those activities that were competitions lyda would tell him when it was his turn to winand he would for the most part though they drew pictures sitting at the kitchen table each with a pencil and a few sheets of paper they would create monsters lyda would have to tell tom what to draw now do the werewolf with a dress and a hat mrs werewolf she said that zombie could draw when he was done there was a startlingly wellrendered perfectly shadowed and shaded portrait of lon chaney in drag a veritable hirsute minnie pearl susan hung it with magnets on the refrigerator take a bow lyda told him and he bent gracefully at the waist in a perfect fortyfive degree angle my wife and daughter didnt notice that tom was changing but i did slowly over the course of mere days his hair had begun to thin out and crows feet formed at the corners of his eyes this transformation i was seeing the first signs of was astounding to me i wondered what it was that malthusian had done to offset the effects of the original surgery that had been performed on him perhaps it was a series of commands some kind of rigid behavioristic training i hated to think of the old man poking around in toms head in that checkerboard kitchen under the fluorescent lights what also puzzled me was how malthusian had transferred command of the zombie to myself and my family i began paying much closer attention to him waiting for a sign that he had begun to recollect himself i held the drawing out to lyda and asked her who did this she took it from me and upon seeing it smiled tom she said yesterday i told him to draw whatever he wanted its good dont you think i asked pretty good she said and turned back to the television show she had been watching the portrait i held in my hand was of a young woman with long dark hair this was no monster she was rendered with the same attention to detail as had been given to mrs werewolf but this girl whoever she was was beautiful i was especially drawn to the eyes which were luminous so full of warmth she wore an expression of amusementa very subtle grin and a selfconsciously dramatic arching of the eyebrows i went to the kitchen and called for tom to come in from the living room i told him to take his usual drawing seat and then i handed him the picture you will tell me who this is i commanded he stared for a moment at the portrait and then it happened a fleeting expression of pain crossed his face his hand trembled slightly for a moment you must tell me i said marta he said and although it was only a word i could have sworn there was a hint of emotion behind it you must tell me if this is your wife i said he slowly brought his left hand to his mouth like a robot programmed to enact the human response of awe tell me i said from behind his fingers he whispered my love it was a foolish thing to do but i applauded as if the sound of my clapping suddenly severed his cognizance he dropped his hand to his side and returned to the zombie state i sat down and studied him his hair had begun to go gray at the edges and his beard was now very noticeable those wrinkles i had detected the first sign of a few days earlier were now more prominent as was the loosening of the skin along his chin line invading his blank affect was a vague aura of weariness as impossible as it might sound he appeared to me as if he had shrunken a centimeter or two my love i said out loud these words were the most exciting shred of humanity to have surfaced not so much for their dramatic weight but more because he had failed to follow my instruction and definitively answer the question i left him alone for the time being seeing as how he seemed quite saddened by the experience of remembering but later when susan had returned home we cleared the kitchen table after dinner and tried to advance the experiment we conscripted lyda into the plot since it was when he was with her that he had created the portrait of marta tell him to draw a picture of his house i whispered to her she nodded and then susan and i left the kitchen and went into the living room to wait he looks terrible susan said to me the spell is slowly dissolving i said he is becoming what he should be the human mind is frightening she said the haunted palace i told her twenty minutes later lyda came in to us smiling carrying a picture look what he drew she said laughing he had created a selfportrait beneath the fulllength picture were the scrawled words tommy the zombie i pointed to the words and said well that didnt work as i had planned but this is rather interesting a sense of humor said susan no said lyda he is sad maybe we shouldnt push him i said wait said susan and sat forward suddenly tell him now to draw his home lyda nodded and was gone an hour passed and susan and i waited in silence for the results we could hear lyda in the kitchen talking to him as they worked she was telling him about this boy in her class in school who always bites the skin on his fingers when mrs brown asked harry why he bites his skin you know what he said asked lyda there was a moment of silence and then we heard the deep flat response what susan and i looked at each other harry told her said lyda he bites it because that way his father who is very old wont die a few minutes passed and then came a most disturbing sound like a moan from out of a nightmare susan and i leaped up and ran into the kitchen lyda was sitting there gaping at tom who was pressing on the pencil with a shaking hand writing as if trying to carve initials into a tree trunk there was sweat on his brow and tears in his eyes i went over behind him and looked over his shoulder there was a picture of a ranchstyle house with an old carport on its left side in the front window i could make out the figures of a black cat and a womans face he was scrawling numbers and letters across the bottom of the picture twentyfour griswold place i said aloud and when he finished and slumped back into his seat i saw the name of the town and spoke it falls park thats only an hour north of here said susan i patted tom on the back and told him youre going home but by then his consciousness had again receded the next morning i got up well before sunrise and ordered tom down the hall to the guest bedroom to change he set to the task a reluctant zombie his rapid aging causing him to shuffle along slightly bent over literally overnight his hair had lost more of its color and there was a new alarming sense of frailty about him while he was dressing i went in and kissed susan goodbye and told her i was taking him as we had planned good luck she said do you want to see him i asked no im going to go back to sleep so that when i wake up i will be able to discount the entire thing as a bad dream i hope i get him there before he croaks i told her hes older than ever today i settled tom in the backseat of the car and told him to buckle the belt then i got in and started driving it was still dark as i turned onto the road out of town of course i was taking a big chance by hoping that he might still know someone at the address he had written down decades had passed since he had been abducted but i didnt care think ill of me if you like but as with the lawyer in melvilles bartleby the scrivener who ends up finally abandoning the scribe which of you would have done as much as we did shadowed entities be damned it had to come to an end youre going home i said over my shoulder to him as i drove home yes he said and i took this for a good sign i looked into the rearview mirror and could only see the top of his head he seemed to have shrunk even more to prepare myself for a worstcase scenario i wondered what the bill would be to have a pool of putrescence steamcleaned from my backseat about halfway into the journey he started making some very odd soundscoughing and hushed choking this gave way to a kind of grumbling language that he carried on with for miles i couldnt make out what he was saying and to block it out i eventually turned on the radio even with the map the address and the drawing it took me an hour and fortyfive minutes to find the place the sun was just beginning to show itself on the horizon when i pulled up in front of griswold place it was remarkable how perfect his drawing had been go now and knock on that door i said pointing i was going to get out of the car and help him but before i could get my belt off i heard the back door open and close turning i saw his figure moving away from the car he was truly an old man now moving beneath the weight of those years that in the brief time of our trip had caught up and overtaken him i hoped that his metamorphosis had finally ended a great wave of sorrow passed through me and i couldnt let him go without saying goodbye i pressed the button for the window on his side when it had rolled down i called out good luck he stopped walking turned slowly to face me and then i knew that the transformation was complete his hair had gone completely white and his face was webbed with wrinkles it was malthusian he stood there staring at me and his eyes were no smaller because he did not wear glasses i shook with the anger of betrayal you bastard i yelled lets not let it ruin our game he said with a thick accent and then turned and went up the front steps i was so stunned i couldnt move he knocked on the door after a few moments a woman as old as he answered i heard her give a short scream and then she threw her arms around him youve returned she said in that same accent she ushered him into the house and then the door slammed closed marta malthusian the sister i said to myself and slammed the steering wheel i dont know how long i sat there staring blankly trying to sort out the tangled treachery and love of a mad man turning a zombie into a zombie of himself eventually i put the car in gear wiped the drool from my chin and started home beautiful stuff by susan palwick susan palwick is the author the novels flying in place the necessary beggar and shelter much of her short fictionwhich has appeared in asimovs science fiction amazing stories the magazine of fantasy science fiction and elsewherewas recently collected in the volume the fate of mice her work has been a finalist for the world fantasy locus and mythopoeic awards and flying in place won the crawford award for best first fantasy novel she is associate professor of english at the university of nevada reno and lives in the foothills of the sierra nevada with her husband and three cats this story came from palwicks rage at various political figures trying to use the victims of as campaign fodder or as a fuel for war i found myself wondering if all those dead people could come back what would they want us to do she says this story would seem to indicate that she doesnt think the dead would have the same agendas as the living rusty kerfuffle stood on a plastic tarp in an elegant downtown office the tarp had been spread over fine woolen carpet the walls were papered in soothing monochrome linen and the desk in front of rusty was gleaming hardwood there was a paperweight on the desk the paperweight was a crystal globe with a purple flower inside it in the sunlight from the window the crystal sparkled and the flower glowed rusty desired that paperweight with a love like starvation but the man sitting behind the desk wouldnt give it to him the man sitting behind the desk wore an expensive suit and a tense expression next to him an aide vomited into a bucket sir the aide said raising his head from the bucket long enough to gasp out a comment sir i think this is going to be a publicrelations disaster shut up said the man behind the desk and the aide resumed vomiting you do you understand what im asking for sure rusty said trying not to stare at the paperweight he knew how smooth and heavy it would feel in his hands he yearned to caress it it contained light and life in a precious sphere a little world rustys outfit had been a suit once now it was a rotting tangle of fibers his ear itched but if he scratched it it might fall off hed been dead for three months if his ear fell off in this fancy office the man behind the desk might not let him touch the paperweight the man behind the desk exhaled a sharp sound like the snort of a horse good you do what i need you to do and you get to walk around again for a day understand sure said rusty he also understood that the walking part came first the man behind the desk would have to rerevive rusty and all the others before they could do what had been asked of them once theyd been revived they got their day of walking whether they followed orders or not can i hold the paperweight now the man behind the desk smiled it wasnt a friendly smile no not yet you werent a very nice man when you were alive rusty thats true rusty said trying to ignore his itching ear his fingers itched too yearning for the paperweight i wasnt i know all about you i know you were cheating on your wife i know about the insider trading you were a morally bankrupt shithead rusty but youre a hero now arent you because youre dead your wife thinks you were a saint this was rusty reflected highly unlikely linda was as adept at running scams as hed ever been maybe more so if she was capitalizing on his death he couldnt blame her hed have done the same thing if shed been the one who had died he was glad to be past that the living were far too complicated he stared impassively at the man behind the desk whose tie was speckled with reflections from the paperweight the aide was still vomiting the man behind the desk gave another mean smile and said this is your chance to be a hero for real rusty do you understand that sure rusty said because that was what the man wanted to hear the sun had gone behind a cloud the paperweight shone less brightly now it was just as tantalizing as it had been before but in a more subdued way good because if you dont come through if you say the wrong thing ill tell your wife what you were really doing rusty ill tell her what a pathetic slimebag you were you wont be a hero anymore the aide had raised his head again he looked astonished he opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something but then he closed it rusty smiled at him i may have been a pathetic slimebag he thought but i never tried to blackmail a corpse even your cringing assistant can see how morally bankrupt that is the sun came out again and the paperweight resumed its sparkling got it rusty said happily the man behind the desk finally relaxed a little he sat back in his chair he became indulgent and expansive good rusty thats excellent youre going to do the right thing for once arent you youre going to help me convince all those cowards out there to stop sitting on their butts yes rusty said im going to do the right thing thank you for the opportunity sir this time he wasnt being ironic youre welcome rusty rusty felt himself about to wiggle like a puppy now can i hold the paperweight please okay rusty come and get it rusty stepped forward careful to stay on the tarp and picked up the paperweight it was as smooth and heavy and wonderful as he had known it would be he cradled it to his chest the glass pleasantly cool against his fingers and began swaying back and forth rusty had never understood the science behind corpse revival but he supposed it didnt matter here he was revived he did know that the technique was hideously expensive when it was first invented mourning families had forked over life savings taken out second mortgages gone into staggering debt simply to have another day with their lost loved ones that trend didnt last long the dead werent attractive the technique only worked on those who hadnt been embalmed or cremated because there had to be a moreorless intact moreorless chemically unaltered body to revive that meant it got used most often on accident and suicide victims the sudden dead the unexpected dead the dead who had gone without farewells the unlovely dead mangled and wounded the dead smelled and they were visibly decayed depending on the gap between when they had died and when they had been revived they shed fingers and noses they left behind pieces of themselves as mementos and they had very little interest in the machinations of the living other things drew them they loved flowers and animals they loved to play with food running faucets enchanted them the first dead person to be revived a mr otis magruder who had killed himself running into a tree while skiing spent his twentyfour hours of second life sitting in his driveway making mud pies while his wife and children told him how much they loved him each time one of his relations delivered another impassioned statement of devotion otis nodded and said uhhuh and then he ran his fingers through more mud and smiled at hour eighteen when his wife despairing asked if there was anything she could tell him anything she could give him he cocked his head and said do you have a plastic pail six hours later when otis was mercifully dead again his wife told reporters well otis was always kind of spacey thats why he ran into that tree i guess but it turned out that the other revived deadtycoons scientists gangsterswere spacey too the dead didnt care about the same things the living did these days the dead were revived only rarely usually to testify in criminal cases involving their death or civil cases involving the financial details of their estates they made bad witnesses they became distracted by brightly colored neckties by the reflection of the courtroom lights in the polished wood of the witness box by the gentle clicking of the clerks recording instrument it was very difficult to keep them on track to remind them what they were supposed to be thinking about on the other hand they had amazingly accurate memories once they could be cajoled into paying attention to the subject at hand bribes of balloons and small brightly colored toys worked well jurors became used to watching the dead weep in frustration while scolding lawyers held matchbox cars and neonhued stuffed animals just out of reach but once the dead gave the information the living sought they always told the truth no one had ever caught one of the dead lying no matter how dishonest the corpse might have been while it was still alive it had been very difficult for the man behind the desk to break through rustys fascination with the paperweight it had taken a lot to get rustys attention dirt about rustys affairs and insider deals hadnt done it none of that mattered anymore it was a set of extraneous details as distant as the moon and as abstract as ethics which also had no hold on rusty rustys passions and loyalties were much more basic now he stood in the elegant office rocking the paperweight as if it were a baby crooning to it sometimes holding it at arms length to admire it before bringing it back safely to his chest again he had another two hours of revival left this time the man behind the desk would revive him and the others again in a month for another twentyfour hours rusty fully intended to spend every minute of his current two hours in contemplation of the paperweight when he was revived again in a month hed fall in love with something else you idiot said the man who had been sitting behind the desk he wasnt behind a desk now he was in a refrigerated warehouse a month after that meeting with rusty he was yelling at his aide around him were the revived dead waiting to climb into refrigerated trucks to be taken to the rally site it was a lovely warm spring day and theyd smell less if they were kept cool for as long as possible i dont want them he waved at two of the dead more mangled than any of the others charred and lacerated and nearly unrecognizable as human bodies one was playing with a paperclip that had been lying on the floor the other opened and closed its hand trying to catch the dust motes that floated in the shafts of light from the window the aide was sweating despite the chill of the warehouse sir you said i know what i said you moron everyone who was there you said idiot the voice was very quiet now very dangerous idiot do you know why were doing this have you been paying attention sir the aide stuttered yes sir oh really because if youd been paying attention they wouldnt be here but prove to me that you understand said the dangerously quiet voice tell me why were doing this the aide gulped to remind people where their loyalties lie sir yes and where do their loyalties lie or where should their loyalties lie with innocent victims sir yes exactly and are those those things over therean impassioned hand waved at the two mangled corpsesare they innocent victims no sir no they arent theyre the monsters who were responsible for all these other innocent victims theyre the guilty ones arent they yes sir they deserve to be dead dont they yes sir the aide stood miserably twisting his hands the entire point of this rally is to demonstrate that some people deserve to be dead isnt it yes sir right so why in the name of everything thats holy were those monsters revived the aide coughed we were using the new technique sir the blanketrevival technique it works over a given geographical area they were mixed in with the others we couldnt be that precise fuck that said the quiet voice succinctly it would have been far too expensive to revive all of them individually the aide said the new technique saved us yes i know how much it saved us and i know how much were going to lose if this doesnt work get rid of them i dont want them on the truck i dont want them at the rally sir yes sir the aide once his boss had left set about correcting the situation he told the two unwanted corpses that they werent needed he tried to be polite about it it was difficult to get their attention away from the paperclip and the dust motes he had to distract them with a penlight and a koosh ball and that worked well enough except that some of the other corpses got distracted too and began crowding around the aide cooing and reaching for the koosh ball there were maybe twenty of them the ones who had been closest the others thank god were still off in their own little worlds but these twenty all wanted that koosh ball the aide felt like he was in a preschool in hell or possibly in a dovecote of extremely deformed and demented pigeons listen to me he said raising his voice over the cooing listen you two you with the paperclip and you with the dust motes we dont want you okay we just want everyone else you two do not get on the trucks have you got that yes is that a nod is that a yes yesh said the corpse with the paperclip and the one whod been entranced by the dust motes nodded all right then said the aide and tossed the koosh ball over their heads into a corner of the warehouse there was a chorus of happy shrieks and a stampede of corpses the aide took the opportunity to get out of there into fresh air his dramamine was wearing off he didnt know if the message had really gotten through or not but fuck it this whole thing was going to be a publicrelations disaster no matter who got on the trucks he no longer cared if he kept his job in fact he hoped he got fired because that way he could collect unemployment as soon as the rally was over hed go home and start working on his resum√© back in the warehouse rusty had a firm grip on the koosh ball he had purposefully stayed at the back of the crowd he knew what he had to do and he had been concentrating very hard on staying focused although it was difficult not to be distracted by all the wonderful things around him the aides tie a piece of torn newspaper on the floor the gleaming hubcaps of the trucks his mind wasnt working as well as it had been during his first revival and it took all his energy to concentrate he stayed at the back of the crowd and kept his eyes on the koosh ball and when the aide tossed it into the corner rusty was the first one there he had it he picked it up thrilling at its texture and did the hardest thing he had ever done he sacrificed the pleasure of the koosh ball he forced himself to let go of it for the greater good he tossed it into the back of the nearest truck and watched his twenty fellows rush in joy up the loading ramp were the two unwanted corpses there yes they were in the excitement they had forgotten their promise to the aide rusty ran to the truck he climbed inside with the others fighting his longing to join the exuberant scramble for the koosh ball but instead rusty kerfuffle who was not a hero and had not been a very nice man pulled something from his pocket he had a pocket because the man with the quiet voice had given him a new blue blazer to wear so hed be more presentable and inside the pocket was a glass paperweight with a purple flower inside rusty had been allowed to keep the paperweight last time because no one else wanted to touch it now it has fucking corpse germs all over it the man with the quiet voice had told him and rusty had trembled with joy he wouldnt have to fall in love with something else after all he could stay in love with this rusty used the paperweight now to distract the two unwanted corpses and several of the others closest to him from the koosh ball and then he started talking to themalthough it was very very hard for him to stay on track because all he wanted to do was fondle the paperweightand waited for the truck doors to be closed outside the warehouse it was spring a balmy fragrant season the refrigerated trucks rolled past medians filled with cheerful flowers past sidewalks where pedestrians strolled their faces lifted to the sun past parks where children on swings pumped themselves into the air in ecstasies of flight at last the convoy of trucks pulled into a larger park the park at the center of the city and along treelined roads to a bandstand in the very center of that park the man with the quiet voice stood at the bandstand podium his aide beside him one side of the audience consisted of people waving signs in support of the man with the quiet voice the other side consisted of people waving signs denouncing him both sides were peppered with reporters with cameras and microphones the man with the quiet voice stared stonily down the center aisle and read the speech prepared by his aide four months ago he said this city suffered a devastating attack hundreds of innocent people were killed those people were your husbands and wives your children your brothers and sisters your friends they were cut down in the prime of their lives by enemies to whom they had done no harm who wanted nothing more than to destroy them to destroy all of us they were cut down by pure evil the man with the quiet voice paused waiting for the crowd to stir it didnt the crowd waited watching him the only thing that stirred was the balmy spring wind moving the leaves the man at the podium cleared his throat as a result of that outrageous act of destruction the brave leaders of our great nation determined that we had to strike back we could not let this horror go unanswered and so we sent our courageous troops to address the evil to destroy the evil to stamp out the powers that had cut down our loved ones in their prime again he paused the audience stirred now a little bit someone on one side waved a sign that said we will never forget someone on the other side waved a sign that said an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind the cameras whirred the birds twittered the refrigerated trucks rolled up to the edge of the band shell and the man at the podium smiled i supported the courageous decision of our brave leaders he said his voice was less quiet now there was only one way to respond to this devastating grief this hideous loss this violation of all that we hold dear and sacred this was the principled stance taken by millions of people in our great nation but certain others among us among youhere he glared at the person who had waved the second signhave claimed that this makes me unworthy to continue to hold office unworthy to continue to be your leader if that is true then many of the leaders of this country are also unworthy his voice had risen to something like a crescendo the woman standing next to the man who had waved the second sign cupped her hands around her mouth and called out cheerfully no argument there boss a few people laughed a few people booed the cameras whirred the man at the podium glared and spoke again now not quietly at all but it is not true the leaders of this city of this state of this nation must be brave must be principled must be ready to fight wrong wherever they find it must be ready to send innocent young people to kill other innocent young people the same woman called back the booing was louder now the man at the podium smiled grimly let us remember who is truly innocent let us remember who was truly innocent four months ago if they could speak to us what would they say well you are about to find out i have brought them here today our beloved dead to speak to us to tell us what they would have us do he gave a signal the truck doors were opened the corpses shambled out blinking in the glorious sunshine gaping at trees and flowers and folding chairs and whirring cameras the crowd gave a gratifying gasp and several people began to sob others began to retch additional aides in the audience well prepared for all eventualities began handing out packets of tissues and barf bags both imprinted with campaign slogans rusty kerfuffle doggedly ignoring the trees and flowers and folding chairs and cameras doggedly ignoring the knowledge that his beloved paperweight was in his pocket moved toward the podium dragging the unwanted corpses with him in the van he had accomplished the very difficult task of removing certain items of clothing from other corpses and outfitting these two so maybe the man with the quiet voice wouldnt realize what he was doing and try to stop him at least for the moment it seemed to be working the man with the quiet voice was saying something about love and loss and outrage his aides were trying to corral wandering corpses more people in the audience were retching rusty holding an unwanted corpses hand in each of histhe three of them like small children crossing a street togethersquinted his eyes almost shut so he wouldnt see all the distracting things around him stay focused rusty get to the podium he got to the podium three steps up and he was on the podium the unwanted corpses beside him the man with the quiet voice turned and smiled at him and now ladies and gentlemen i give you rusty kerfuffle the heroic husband of linda kerfuffle whom youve all seen on television linda are you here darling gasped a woman in the crowd she ran toward the podium but was overtaken by retching halfway there rusty wondered how much she was being paid an aide patted linda on the back and handed her a barf bag the aide on the platform murmured publicrelations disaster too softly for the microphones the quiet man coughed and cleared his throat and poked rusty in the back rusty understood that this was his cue to do something hi linda said rusty he couldnt tell if the microphones had picked that up so he waved linda waved back took a few steps closer to the podium and was overcome with retching again the aide on the platform groaned and the man with the quiet voice forged grimly ahead i have brought back rusty and these other brave citizens and patriots your lost loved ones to tell you how important it is to fight evil to tell you about the waste and horror of their deaths to implore you to do the right thing since some of you have become misled by propaganda rusty had just caught a glimpse of a butterfly and it took every ounce of his will not to turn to run after it to walk up to the microphone instead but he did his duty he walked up to the microphone pulling his two companions hi he said im rusty wait you know that the crowd stared at him some still retching linda was wiping her mouth some people were walking away wait rusty called after them its really important it really is a few stopped and turned standing with their arms folded others kept walking rusty had to say something to make them stop wait he said this guys wrong i wasnt brave i wasnt patriotic i cheated on my wife linda i cheated on you but i think you knew that i think you were cheating on me too its okay it doesnt matter now i cheated on other stuff too i cheated on my taxes i was guilty of insider trading i was a morally bankrupt shithead he pointed at the man with the quiet voice thats his phrase not mine but it fits there now he couldnt be blackmailed most of the people whod been walking away had stopped now good the man with the quiet voice was hissing rusty what are you doing im doing what he wants me to do rusty said into the microphone im what was that word imploring you to do the right thing he stopped out of words and concentrated very hard on what he was going to say next he caught a flash of purple out of the corner of his left eye was that another butterfly he turned no it was a splendid purple bandana the aide on the platform was waving it at rusty rustys heart melted he fell in love with the bandana the bandana was the most exquisite thing he had ever seen who wouldnt covet the bandana and indeed one of his companions the one on the left was snatching at it rusty took a step toward the bandana and then forced himself to stop no the aide was trying to distract him the aide was cheating the bandana was a trick rusty still had his paperweight he didnt need the bandana heartsick nearly sobbing rusty turned back to the podium dragging the other corpse with him the other corpse whimpered but rusty prevailed he knew that this was very important it was as important as the paperweight in his pocket he could no longer remember why but he remembered that he had known once darling linda said running toward him darling i forgive you i love you dear rusty she was wearing a shiny barrette she never wore barrettes it was another trick rusty began to tremble linda he said into the microphone shut up shut up and go away linda i have to say something rustys other companion the one on his right let out a small squeal and tried to lurch toward linda towards the barrette no rusty said keeping desperate hold you stay here linda take that shiny thing off hide it linda darling she said and the righthand corpse broke away from rusty and hopped off the podium toward linda linda screamed and ran the corpse trotting after her rusty sighed the aide groaned again the quiet man cursed softly okay rusty said so heres what i have to tell you some of the people in the crowd whod turned to watch linda and her pursuer turned back toward rusty now but others didnt well he couldnt do anything about that he had to say this thing he could remember what he had to say but he couldnt remember why that was all right hed say it and then maybe hed remember what i have to tell you is dying hurts rusty said the crowd murmured dying hurts a lot it hurtseverybody hurts rusty struggled to remember why this mattered he dimly remembered dying remembered other people dying around him it hurts everybody it makes everybody the same this guy and that other one who ran away they hurt too this is ari that was ahmed they were the ones who planted the bomb they didnt get out in time they died too gasps some louder murmurs louder cursing from the man with the quiet voice rusty definitely had everyones attention now he prodded ari it hurt ari said and said rusty were sorry said ari ahmeds sorry too said rusty he told me hed have told you if he werent chasing lindas shiny hair thing if wed known we wouldnt have done it ari said because rusty said patiently we did it for the wrong reasons ari said we expected things to happen that didnt happen paradise and like virgins ari looked shyly down at his decaying feet im sorry more rusty said tell them more dying hurts said ari it wont make you happy it wont make anybody happy so please do the right thing said rusty dont kill anybody else the man with the quiet voice let out a howl and leaped toward rusty he grabbed rustys free arm the right one and pulled the arm came off and the man with the quiet voice started hitting rusty over the head with it you fucking incompetent you traitor you said youd tell them i said id do the right thing rusty said i never said my version of the right thing was the same as yours you lied no i didnt i misled you but i told the truth what are you going to do kill me he looked out at the crowd and said were the dead you loved some of us you hated others were the dead were here to tell you please dont kill anybody else everybody will be dead soon enough whether you kill them or not it hurts the crowd stared the cameras whirred none of the living there that day had ever heard such long speeches from the dead it was truly a historic occasion a group of aides had managed to drag away the man with the quiet voice who was still brandishing rustys arm rusty with his one arm stood at the podium with ari look rusty said he let go of aris hand and reached around to pull the paperweight out of his pocket he held it up in front of the crowd ari cooed and reached for it entranced but rusty held it above his head look at this look at the shiny glass look at the flower its beautiful you have all this stuff in your life all this beautiful stuff sunshine and grass and butterflies barrettes bandanas you dont have that when youre dead thats why dying hurts and rusty shivered and remembered he remembered dying knowing hed never see trees again never drink coffee never smell flowers or see buildings reflected in windows he remembered that pain the pain of knowing what he was losing only when it was too late and he knew that the living wouldnt understand couldnt understand or maybe some of them did but the others would only make fun of them he finished his speech lamely miserably knowing that everyone would say it was just a clich√© enjoy the beautiful stuff while you have it the woman who had heckled the man with the quiet voice was frowning youre advocating greed thats what gets people killed people murder each other for stuff no rusty said he was exhausted she didnt understand shed probably never understand unless she died and got revived just enjoy it look at it dont fight you dont get it do you no she said i dont rusty shrugged he was too tired he couldnt keep his focus anymore he no longer cared if the woman got it or not the man with the quiet voice had been taken away and rusty had done what he had wanted to do although it seemed much less important now than it had even a month ago when he was first revived he remembered dimly that no one had ever managed to teach the living anything much some of them might get it hed done what he could hed told them what mattered his attention wandered away from the woman away from the crowd he brought the paperweight back down to chest level and then he sat down on the edge of the platform and ari sat with him and they both stared at the paperweight touching it humming in happiness there in the sunshine the crowd watched them for a while and then it wandered away too the other corpses had already wandered the dead meandered through the beautiful budding park all of them in love one with a sparrow on the walk one with a silk scarf a woman in the audience had given him one with an empty semicrushed milk carton she had plucked out of a trash can the dead fell in love and they walked or they sat carrying what they loved or letting it hold them in place they loved their beautiful stuff for the rest of the day until the sun went down and then they lay down too their treasures beside them and slept again and this time did not wake sex death and starshine by clive barkerclive barker is probably best known as the writer and director of the hellraiser saga

love it when he slid his briefs off i love it i love it i love it shed go down on him with such unalloyed enthusiasm all he could do was watch the top of her ashblonde head bobbing at his groin and hope to god nobody chanced to walk into the dressingroom she was a married woman after all even if she was an actress he had a wife himself somewhere this t√™te√†t√™te would make some juicy copy for one of the local rags and here he was trying to garner a reputation as a seriousminded director no gimmicks no gossip just art then even thoughts of ambition would be dissolved on her tongue as she played havoc with his nerveendings she wasnt much of an actress but by god she was quite a performer faultless technique immaculate timing she knew either by instinct or by rehearsal just when to pick up the rhythm and bring the whole scene to a satisfying conclusion when shed finished milking the moment dry he almost wanted to applaud the whole cast of calloways production of twelfth night knew about the affair of course thered be the occasional snide comment passed if actress and director were both late for rehearsals or if she arrived looking full and he flushed he tried to persuade her to control the catwiththecream look that crept over her face but she just wasnt that good a deceiver which was rich considering her profession but then la duvall as edward insisted on calling her didnt need to be a great player she was famous so what if she spoke shakespeare like it was hiawatha dum de dum de dum de dum so what if her grasp of psychology was dubious her logic faulty her projection inadequate so what if she had as much sense of poetry as she did propriety she was a star and that meant business there was no taking that away from her her name was money the elysium theatre publicity announced her claim to fame in threeinch roman bold black on yellow diane duvall star of the love child the love child possibly the worst soap opera to cavort across the screens of the nation in the history of that genre two solid hours a week of underwritten characters and mindnumbing dialogue as a result of which it consistently drew high ratings and its performers became almost overnight brilliant stars in televisions rhinestone heaven glittering there the brightest of the bright was diane duvall maybe she wasnt born to play the classics but jesus was she good boxoffice and in this day and age with theatres deserted all that mattered was the number of punters on seats calloway had resigned himself to the fact that this would not be the definitive twelfth night but if the production were successful and with diane in the role of viola it had every chance it might open a few doors to him in the west end besides working with the everadoring everdemanding miss d duvall had its compensations calloway pulled up his serge trousers and looked down at her she was giving him that winsome smile of hers the one she used in the letter scene expression five in the duvall repertoire somewhere between virginal and motherly he acknowledged the smile with one from his own stock a small loving look that passed for genuine at a yards distance then he consulted his watch god were late sweetie she licked her lips did she really like the taste that much id better fix my hair she said standing up and glancing in the long mirror beside the shower yes are you ok couldnt be better he replied he kissed her lightly on the nose and left her to her teasing on his way to the stage he ducked into the mens dressing room to adjust his clothing and dowse his burning cheeks with cold water sex always induced a giveaway mottling on his face and upper chest bending to splash water on himself calloway studied his features critically in the mirror over the sink after thirtysix years of holding the signs of age at bay he was beginning to look the part he was no more the juvenile lead there was an indisputable puffiness beneath his eyes which was nothing to do with sleeplessness and there were lines too on his forehead and round his mouth he didnt look the wunderkind any longer the secrets of his debauchery were written all over his face the excess of sex booze and ambition the frustration of aspiring and just missing the main chance so many times what would he look like now he thought bitterly if hed been content to be some unenterprising nobody working in a minor rep guaranteed a house of ten aficionados every night and devoted to brecht face as smooth as a babys bottom probably most of the people in the socially committed theatre had that look vacant and content poor cows well you pays your money and you takes your choice he told himself he took one last look at the haggard cherub in the mirror reflecting that crows feet or not women still couldnt resist him and went out to face the trials and tribulations of act iii on stage there was a heated debate in progress the carpenter his name was jake had built two hedges for olivias garden they still had to be covered with leaves but they looked quite impressive running the depth of the stage to the cyclorama where the rest of the garden would be painted none of this symbolic stuff a garden was a garden green grass blue sky thats the way the audience liked it north of birmingham and terry had some sympathy for their plain tastes terry love eddie cunningham had him by the hand and elbow escorting him into the fray whats the problem terry love you cannot be serious about these fucking it came trippingly off the tongue fucking hedges tell uncle eddie youre not serious before i throw a fit eddie pointed towards the offending hedges i mean look at them as he spoke a thin plume of spittle fizzed in the air whats the problem terry asked again problem blocking love blocking think about it weve rehearsed this whole scene with me bobbing up and down like a march hare up right down leftbut it doesnt work if i havent got access round the back and look these fucking things are flush with the backdrop well they have to be for the illusion eddie i cant get round though terry you must see my point he appealed to the few others on stage the carpenters two technicians three actors i meantheres just not enough time eddie well reblock oh that took the wind out of his sails no um i mean it seems easiest doesnt it yes i just liked i know well needs must what about the croquet well cut that too all that business with the croquet mallets the bawdy stuff itll all have to go im sorry i havent thought this through i wasnt thinking straight eddie flounced thats all you ever do love think straight titters terry let it pass eddie had a genuine point of criticism he had failed to consider the problems of the hedgedesign im sorry about the business but theres no way we can accommodate it you wont be cutting anybody elses business im sure said eddie he threw a glance over calloways shoulder at diane then headed for the dressingroom exit enraged actor stage left calloway made no attempt to stop him it would have worsened the situation considerably to spoil his departure he just breathed out a quiet oh jesus and dragged a wide hand down over his face that was the fatal flaw of this profession actors will somebody fetch him back he said silence wheres ryan the stage manager showed his bespectacled face over the offending hedge sorry ryan lovewill you please take a cup of coffee to eddie and coax him back into the bosom of the family ryan pulled a face that said you offended him you fetch him but calloway had passed this particular buck before he was a past master at it he just stared at ryan defying him to contradict his request until the other man dropped his eyes and nodded his acquiescence sure he said glumly good man ryan cast him an accusatory look and disappeared in pursuit of ed cunningham no show without belch said calloway trying to warm up the atmosphere a little someone grunted and the small halfcircle of onlookers began to disperse show over ok ok said calloway picking up the pieces lets get to work well run through from the top of the scene diane are you ready yes ok shall we run it he turned away from olivias garden and the waiting actors just to gather his thoughts only the stage working lights were on the auditorium was in darkness it yawned at him insolently row upon row of empty seats defying him to entertain them ah the loneliness of the longdistance director there were days in this business when the thought of life as an accountant seemed a consummation devoutly to be wished to paraphrase the prince of denmark in the gods of the elysium somebody moved calloway looked up from his doubts and stared through the swarthy air had eddie taken residence on the very back row no surely not for one thing he hadnt had time to get all the way up there eddie calloway ventured capping his hand over his eyes is that you he could just make the figure out no not a figure figures two people edging their way along the back row making for the exit whoever it was it certainly wasnt eddie that isnt eddie is it said calloway turning back into the fake garden no someone replied it was eddie speaking he was back on stage leaning on one of the hedges cigarette clamped between his lips eddie its all right said the actor goodhumouredly dont grovel i cant bear to see a pretty man grovel well see if we can slot the malletbusiness in somewhere said calloway eager to be conciliatory eddie shook his head and flicked ash off his cigarette no need really it didnt work too well anyhow the grand circle door creaked a little as it closed behind the visitors calloway didnt bother to look round theyd gone whoever they were there was somebody in the house this afternoon hammersmith looked up from the sheets of figures he was poring over oh his eyebrows were eruptions of wirethick hair that seemed ambitious beyond their calling they were raised high above hammersmiths tiny eyes in patently fake surprise he plucked at his bottom lip with nicotinestained fingers any idea who it was he plucked on still staring up at the younger man undisguised contempt on his face is it a problem i just want to know who was in looking at the rehearsal thats all i think ive got a perfect right to ask perfect right said hammersmith nodding slightly and making his lips into a pale bow there was talk of somebody coming up from the national said calloway my agents were arranging something i just dont want somebody coming in without me knowing about it especially if theyre important hammersmith was already studying the figures again his voice was tired terry if theres someone in from the south bank to look your opus over i promise you youll be the first to be informed all right the inflexion was so bloody rude so runalonglittleboy calloway itched to hit him i dont want people watching rehearsals unless i authorize it hammersmith hear me and i want to know who was in today the manager sighed heavily believe me terry he said i dont know myself i suggest you ask tallulahshe was front of house this afternoon if somebody came in presumably she saw them he sighed again all right terry calloway left it at that he had his suspicions about hammersmith the man couldnt give a shit about theatre he never failed to make that absolutely plain he affected an exhausted tone whenever anything but money was mentioned as though matters of aesthetics were beneath his notice and he had a word loudly administered for actors and directors alike butterflies oneday wonders in hammersmiths world only money was forever and the elysium theatre stood on prime land land a wise man could turn a tidy profit on if he played his cards right calloway was certain hed sell off the place tomorrow if he could maneuver it a satellite town like redditch growing as birmingham grew didnt need theatres it needed offices hypermarkets warehouses it needed to quote the councilors growth through investment in new industry it also needed prime sites to build that industry upon no mere art could survive such pragmatism tallulah was not in the box nor in the foyer nor in the green room irritated both by hammersmiths incivility and tallulahs disappearance calloway went back into the auditorium to pick up his jacket and go to get drunk the rehearsal was over and the actors long gone the bare hedges looked somewhat small from the back row of the stalls maybe they needed an extra few inches he made a note on the back of a show bill he found in his pocket hedges bigger a footfall made him look up and a figure had appeared on stage a smooth entrance upstage centre where the hedges converged calloway didnt recognize the man mr calloway mr terence calloway yes the visitor walked down stage to where in an earlier age the footlights would have been and stood looking out into the auditorium my apologies for interrupting your train of thought no problem i wanted a word with me if you would calloway wandered down to the front of the stalls appraising the stranger he was dressed in shades of grey from head to foot a grey worsted suit grey shoes a grey cravat pisselegant was calloways first uncharitable summation but the man cut an impressive figure nevertheless his face beneath the shadow of his brim was difficult to discern allow me to introduce myself the voice was persuasive cultured ideal for advertisement voiceovers soap commercials maybe after hammersmiths bad manners the voice came as a breath of good breeding my name is lichfield not that i expect that means much to a man of your tender years tender years well well maybe there was still something of the wunderkind in his face are you a critic calloway inquired the laugh that emanated from beneath the immaculately swept brim was ripely ironical in the name of jesus no lichfield replied im sorry then you have me at a loss no need for an apology were you in the house this afternoon lichfield ignored the question i realize youre a busy man mr calloway and i dont want to waste your time the theatre is my business as it is yours i think we must consider ourselves allies though we have never met ah the great brotherhood it made calloway want to spit the familiar claims of sentiment when he thought of the number of socalled allies that had cheerfully stabbed him in the back and in return the playwrights whose work hed smilingly slanged the actors hed crushed with a casual quip brotherhood be damned it was dogeatdog same as any oversubscribed profession i have lichfield was saying an abiding interest in the elysium there was a curious emphasis on the word abiding it sounded positively funereal from lichfields lips abide with me oh yes ive spent many happy hours in this theatre down the years and frankly it pains me to carry this burden of news what news mr calloway i have to inform you that your twelfth night will be the last production the elysium will see the statement didnt come as much of a surprise but it still hurt and the internal wince must have registered on calloways face ah so you didnt know i thought not they always keep the artists in ignorance dont they its a satisfaction the apollonians will never relinquish the accountants revenge hammersmith said calloway hammersmith bastard his clan are never to be trusted but then i hardly need to tell you that are you sure about the closure certainly hed do it tomorrow if he could but why ive done stoppard here tennessee williamsalways played to good houses it doesnt make sense it makes admirable financial sense im afraid and if you think in figures as hammersmith does theres no riposte to simple arithmetic the elysiums getting old were all getting old we creak we feel our age in our joints our instinct is to lie down and be gone away gone away the voice became melodramatically thin a whisper of longing how do you know about this i was for many years a trustee of the theatre and since my retirement ive made it my business towhats the phrasekeep my ear to the ground its difficult in this day and age to evoke the triumph this stage has seen his voice trailed away in a reverie it seemed true not an effect then businesslike once more this theatre is about to die mr calloway you will be present at the last rites through no fault of your own i felt you ought to be warned thank you i appreciate that tell me were you ever an actor yourself what makes you think that the voice too rhetorical by half i know my curse im afraid i can scarcely ask for a cup of coffee without sounding like lear in the storm he laughed heartily at his own expense calloway began to warm to the fellow maybe he was a little archaiclooking perhaps even slightly absurd but there was a fullbloodedness about his manner that caught calloways imagination lichfield wasnt apologetic about his love of theatre like so many in the profession people who trod the boards as a secondbest their souls sold to the movies i have i will confess dabbled in the craft a little lichfield confided but i just dont have the stamina for it im afraid now my wife wife calloway was surprised lichfield had a heterosexual bone in his body my wife constantia has played here on a number of occasions and i may say very successfully before the war of course its a pity to close the place indeed but there are no lastact miracles to be performed im afraid the elysium will be rubble in six weeks time and theres an end to it i just wanted you to know that interests other than the crassly commercial are watching over this closing production think of us as guardian angels we wish you well terence we all wish you well it was a genuine sentiment simply stated calloway was touched by this mans concern and a little chastened by it it put his own steppingstone ambitions in an unflattering perspective lichfield went on we care to see this theatre end its days in suitable style then die a good death damn shame too late for regrets by a long chalk we should never have given up dionysus for apollo what sold ourselves to the accountants to legitimacy to the likes of mr hammersmith whose soul if he has one must be the size of my fingernail and grey as a louses back we should have had the courage of our depictions i think served poetry and lived under the stars calloway didnt quite follow the allusions but he got the general drift and respected the viewpoint off stage left dianes voice cut the solemn atmosphere like a plastic knife terry are you there the spell was broken calloway hadnt been aware how hypnotic lichfields presence was until that other voice came between them listening to him was like being rocked in familiar arms lichfield stepped to the edge of the stage lowering his voice to a conspiratorial rasp one last thing terence yes your viola she lacks if youll forgive my pointing it out the special qualities required for the role calloway hung fire i know lichfield continued personal loyalties prevent honesty in these matters no calloway replied youre right but shes popular so was bearbaiting terence a luminous smile spread beneath the brim hanging in the shadow like the grin of the cheshire cat im only joking said lichfield his rasp a chuckle now bears can be charming terry there you are diane appeared overdressed as usual from behind the tabs there was surely an embarrassing confrontation in the air but lichfield was walking away down the false perspective of the hedges towards the backdrop here i am said terry who are you talking to but lichfield had exited as smoothly and as quietly as he had entered diane hadnt even seen him go oh just an angel said calloway the first dress rehearsal wasnt all things considered as bad as calloway had anticipated it was immeasurably worse cues were lost props mislaid entrances missed the comic business seemed illcontrived and laborious the performances either hopelessly overwrought or trifling this was a twelfth night that seemed to last a year halfway through the third act calloway glanced at his watch and realized an uncut performance of macbeth with interval would now be over he sat in the stalls with his head buried in his hands contemplating the work that he still had to do if he was to bring this production up to scratch not for the first time on this show he felt helpless in the face of the casting problems cues could be tightened props rehearsed with entrances practised until they were engraved on the memory but a bad actor is a bad actor is a bad actor he could labour till doomsday neatening and sharpening but he could not make a silk purse of the sows ear that was diane duvall with all the skill of an acrobat she contrived to skirt every significance to ignore every opportunity to move the audience to avoid every nuance the playwright would insist on putting in her way it was a performance heroic in its ineptitude reducing the delicate characterization calloway had been at pains to create to a singlenote whine this viola was soapopera pap less human than the hedges and about as green the critics would slaughter her worse than that lichfield would be disappointed to his considerable surprise the impact of lichfields appearance hadnt dwindled calloway couldnt forget his actorly projection his posing his rhetoric it had moved him more deeply than he was prepared to admit and the thought of this twelfth night with this viola becoming the swansong of lichfields beloved elysium perturbed and embarrassed him it seemed somehow ungrateful hed been warned often enough about a directors burdens long before he became seriously embroiled in the profession his dear departed guru at the actors centre wellbeloved he of the glass eye had told calloway from the beginning a director is the loneliest creature on gods earth he knows whats good and bad in a show or he should if hes worth his salt and he has to carry that information around with him and keep smiling it hadnt seemed so difficult at the time this job isnt about succeeding wellbeloved used to say its about learning not to fall on your sodding face good advice as it turned out he could still see wellbeloved handing out that wisdom on a plate his bald head shiny his living eye glittering with cynical delight no man on earth calloway had thought loved theatre with more passion than wellbeloved and surely no man could have been more scathing about its pretensions it was almost one in the morning by the time theyd finished the wretched runthrough gone through the notes and separated glum and mutually resentful into the night calloway wanted none of their company tonight no late drinking in one or others digs no mutual egomassage he had a cloud of gloom all to himself and neither wine women nor song would disperse it he could barely bring himself to look diane in the face his notes to her broadcast in front of the rest of the cast had been acidic not that it would do much good in the foyer he met tallulah still spry though it was long after an old ladys bedtime are you locking up tonight he asked her more for something to say than because he was actually curious i always lock up she said she was well over seventy too old for her job in the box office and too tenacious to be easily removed but then that was all academic now wasnt it he wondered what her response would be when she heard the news of the closure it would probably break her brittle heart hadnt hammersmith once told him tallulah had been at the theatre since she was a girl of fifteen well goodnight tallulah she gave him a tiny nod as always then she reached out and took calloways arm yes mr lichfield she began what about mr lichfield he didnt like the rehearsal he was in tonight oh yes she replied as though calloway was an imbecile for thinking otherwise of course he was in i didnt see him well no matter he wasnt very pleased calloway tried to sound indifferent it cant be helped your show is very close to his heart i realize that said calloway avoiding tallulahs accusing looks he had quite enough to keep him awake tonight without her disappointed tones ringing in his ears he loosed his arm and made for the door tallulah made no attempt to stop him she just said you should have seen constantia constantia where had he heard that name of course lichfields wife she was a wonderful viola he was too tired for this mooning over dead actresses she was dead wasnt she he had said she was dead hadnt he wonderful said tallulah again goodnight tallulah ill see you tomorrow the old crone didnt answer if she was offended by his brusque manner then so be it he left her to her complaints and faced the street it was late november and chilly no balm in the nightair just the smell of tar from a freshly laid road and grit in the wind calloway pulled his jacket collar up around the back of his neck and hurried off to the questionable refuge of murphys bed and breakfast in the foyer tallulah turned her back on the cold and dark of the outside world and shuffled back into the temple of dreams it smelt so weary now stale with use and age like her own body it was time to let natural processes take their toll there was no point in letting things run beyond their allotted span that was as true of buildings as of people but the elysium had to die as it had lived in glory respectfully she drew back the red curtains that covered the portraits in the corridor that led from foyer to stalls barrymore irving great names and great actors stained and faded pictures perhaps but the memories were as sharp and as refreshing as spring water and in pride of place the last of the line to be unveiled a portrait of constantia lichfield a face of transcendent beauty a bone structure to make an anatomist weep she had been far too young for lichfield of course and that had been part of the tragedy of it lichfield the svengali a man twice her age had been capable of giving his brilliant beauty everything she desired fame money companionship everything but the gift she most required life itself shed died before she was yet twenty a cancer in the breast taken so suddenly it was still difficult to believe shed gone tears brimmed in tallulahs eyes as she remembered that lost and wasted genius so many parts constantia would have illuminated had she been spared cleopatra hedda rosalind electra but it wasnt to be shed gone extinguished like a candle in a hurricane and for those who were left behind life was a slow and joyless march through a cold land there were mornings now stirring to another dawn when she would turn over and pray to die in her sleep the tears were quite blinding her now she was awash and oh dear there was somebody behind her probably mr calloway back for something and here was she sobbing fit to burst behaving like the silly old woman she knew he thought her to be a young man like him what did he understand about the pain of the years the deep ache of irretrievable loss that wouldnt come to him for a while yet sooner than he thought but a while nevertheless tallie somebody said she knew who it was richard walden lichfield she turned round and he was standing no more than six feet from her as fine a figure of a man as ever she remembered him to be he must be twenty years older than she was but age didnt seem to bow him she felt ashamed of her tears tallie he said kindly i know its a little late but i felt youd surely want to say hello hello the tears were clearing and now she saw lichfields companion standing a respectful foot or two behind him partially obscured the figure stepped out of lichfields shadow and there was a luminous fineboned beauty tallulah recognized as easily as her own reflection time broke in pieces and reason deserted the world longedfor faces were suddenly back to fill the empty nights and offer fresh hope to a life grown weary why should she argue with the evidence of her eyes it was constantia the radiant constantia who was looping her arm through lichfields and nodding gravely at tallulah in greeting dear dead constantia the rehearsal was called for ninethirty the following morning diane duvall made an entrance her customary half hour late she looked as though she hadnt slept all night sorry im late she said her open vowels oozing down the aisle towards the stage calloway was in no mood for footkissing weve got an opening tomorrow he snapped and everybodys been kept waiting by you oh really she fluttered trying to be devastating it was too early in the morning and the effect fell on stony ground ok were going from the top calloway announced and everybody please have your copies and a pen ive got a list of cuts here and i want them rehearsed in by lunchtime ryan have you got the prompt copy there was a hurried exchange with the asm and an apologetic negative from ryan well get it and i dont want any complaints from anyone its too late in the day last nights run was a wake not a performance the cues took forever the business was ragged im going to cut and its not going to be very palatable it wasnt the complaints came warning or no the arguments the compromises the sour faces and muttered insults calloway would have rather been hanging by his toes from a trapeze than maneuvering fourteen highly strung people through a play twothirds of them scarcely understood and the other third couldnt give a monkeys about it was nervewracking it was made worse because all the time he had the prickly sense of being watched though the auditorium was empty from gods to front stalls maybe lichfield had a spyhole somewhere he thought then condemned the idea as the first signs of budding paranoia at last lunch calloway knew where hed find diane and he was prepared for the scene he had to play with her accusations tears reassurance tears again reconciliation standard format he knocked on the stars door who is it was she crying already or talking through a glass of something comforting its me oh can i come in yes she had a bottle of vodka good vodka and a glass no tears as yet im useless arent i she said almost as soon as hed closed the door her eyes begged for contradiction dont be silly he hedged i could never get the hang of shakespeare she pouted as though it were the bards fault all those bloody words the squall was on the horizon he could see it mustering its all right he lied putting his arm around her you just need a little time her face clouded we open tomorrow she said flatly the point was difficult to refute theyll tear me apart wont they he wanted to say no but his tongue had a fit of honesty yes unless ill never work again will i harry talked me into this that damn halfwitted jew good for my reputation he said bound to give me a bit more clout he said what does he know takes his ten bloody per cent and leaves me holding the baby im the one who looks the damn fool arent i at the thought of looking a fool the storm broke no light shower this it was a cloudburst or nothing he did what he could but it was difficult she was sobbing so loudly his pearls of wisdom were drowned out so he kissed her a little as any decent director was bound to do and miracle upon miracle that seemed to do the trick he applied the technique with a little more gusto his hands straying to her breasts ferreting under her blouse for her nipples and teasing them between thumb and forefinger it worked wonders there were hints of sun between the clouds now she sniffed and unbuckled his belt letting his heat dry out the last of the rain his fingers were finding the lacy edge of her panties and she was sighing as he investigated her gently but not too gently insistent but never too insistent somewhere along the line she knocked over the vodka bottle but neither of them cared to stop and right it so it sloshed on to the floor off the edge of the table counterpointing her instructions his gasps then the bloody door opened and a draught blew up between them cooling the point at issue calloway almost turned round then realized he was unbuckled and stared instead into the mirror behind diane to see the intruders face it was lichfield he was looking straight at calloway his face impassive im sorry i should have knocked his voice was as smooth as whipped cream betraying nary a tremor of embarrassment calloway wedged himself away buckled up his belt and turned to lichfield silently cursing his burning cheeks yes it would have been polite he said again my apologies i wanted a word with his eyes so deepset they were unfathomable were on diane your star he said calloway could practically feel dianes ego expand at the word the approach confounded him had lichfield undergone a volteface was he coming here the repentant admirer to kneel at the feet of greatness i would appreciate a word with the lady in private if that were possible the mellow voice went on well we were just of course diane interrupted just allow me a moment would you she was immediately on top of the situation tears forgotten ill be just outside said lichfield already taking his leave before he had closed the door behind him diane was in front of the mirror tissuewrapped finger skirting her eye to divert a rivulet of mascara well she was cooing how lovely to have a wellwisher do you know who he is his names lichfield calloway told her he used to be a trustee of the theatre maybe he wants to offer me something i doubt it oh dont be such a drag terence she snarled you just cant bear to have anyone else get any attention can you my mistake she peered at her eyes how do i look she asked fine im sorry about before before you know oh yes ill see you in the pub eh he was summarily dismissed apparently his function as lover or confidant no longer required in the chilly corridor outside the dressing room lichfield was waiting patiently though the lights were better here than on the illlit stage and he was closer now than hed been the night before calloway could still not quite make out the face under the wide brim there was somethingwhat was the idea buzzing in his headsomething artificial about lichfields features the flesh of his face didnt move as interlocking system of muscle and tendon it was too stiff too pink almost like scartissue shes not quite ready calloway told him shes a lovely woman lichfield purred yes i dont blame you um shes no actress though youre not going to interfere are you lichfield i wont let you perish the thought the voyeuristic pleasure lichfield had plainly taken in his embarrassment made calloway less respectful than hed been i wont have you upsetting her my interests are your interests terence all i want to do is see this production prosper believe me am i likely under those circumstances to alarm your leading lady ill be as meek as a lamb terence whatever you are came the testy reply youre no lamb the smile appeared again on lichfields face the tissue round his mouth barely stretching to accommodate his expression calloway retired to the pub with that predatory sickle of teeth fixed in his mind anxious for no reason he could focus upon in the mirrored cell of her dressingroom diane duvall was just about ready to play her scene you may come in now mr lichfield she announced he was in the doorway before the last syllable of his name had died on her lips miss duvall he bowed slightly in deference to her she smiled so courteous will you please forgive my blundering in earlier on she looked coy it always melted men mr calloway she began a very insistent young man i think yes not above pressing his attentions on his leading lady perhaps she frowned a little a dancing pucker where the plucked arches of her brows converged im afraid so most unprofessional of him lichfield said but forgive mean understandable ardor she moved upstage of him towards the lights of her mirror and turned knowing they would backlight her hair more flatteringly well mr lichfield what can i do for you this is frankly a delicate matter said lichfield the bitter fact ishow shall i put thisyour talents are not ideally suited to this production your style lacks delicacy there was a silence for two beats she sniffed thought about the inference of the remark and then moved out of centrestage towards the door she didnt like the way this scene had begun she was expecting an admirer and instead she had a critic on her hands get out she said her voice like slate miss duvall you heard me youre not comfortable as viola are you lichfield continued as though the star had said nothing none of your bloody business she spat back but it is i saw the rehearsals you were bland unpersuasive the comedy is flat the reunion sceneit should break our heartsis leaden i dont need your opinion thank you you have no style piss off no presence and no style im sure on the television you are radiance itself but the stage requires a special truth a soulfulness you frankly lack the scene was hotting up she wanted to hit him but she couldnt find the proper motivation she couldnt take this faded poseur seriously he was more musical comedy than melodrama with his neat grey gloves and his neat grey cravat stupid waspish queen what did he know about acting get out before i call the stage manager she said but he stepped between her and the door a rape scene was that what they were playing had he got the hots for her god forbid my wife he was saying has played viola good for her and she feels she could breathe a little more life into the role than you we open tomorrow she found herself replying as though defending her presence why the hell was she trying to reason with him barging in here and making these terrible remarks maybe because she was just a little afraid his breath close to her now smelt of expensive chocolate she knows the role by heart the parts mine and im doing it im doing it even if im the worst viola in theatrical history all right she was trying to keep her composure but it was difficult something about him made her nervous it wasnt violence she feared from him but she feared something im afraid i have already promised the part to my wife what she goggled at his arrogance and constantia will play the role she laughed at the name maybe this was high comedy after all something from sheridan or wilde arch catty stuff but he spoke with such absolute certainty constantia will play the role as if it was all cut and dried im not discussing this any longer buster so if your wife wants to play viola shell have to do it in the fucking street all right she opens tomorrow are you deaf or stupid or both control an inner voice told her youre overplaying losing your grip on the scene whatever scene this is he stepped towards her and the mirror lights caught the face beneath the brim full on she hadnt looked carefully enough when he first made his appearance now she saw the deeply etched lines the gougings around his eyes and his mouth it wasnt flesh she was sure of it he was wearing latex appliances and they were badly glued in place her hand all but twitched with the desire to snatch at it and uncover his real face of course that was it the scene she was playing the unmasking lets see what you look like she said and her hand was at his cheek before he could stop her his smile spreading wider as she attacked this is what he wants she thought but it was too late for regrets or apologies her fingertips had found the line of the mask at the edge of his eyesocket and curled round to take a better hold she yanked the thin veil of latex came away and his true physiognomy was exposed for the world to see diane tried to back away but his hand was in her hair all she could do was look up into that allbut fleshless face a few withered strands of muscle curled here and there and a hint of a beard hung from a leathery flap at his throat but all living tissue had long since decayed most of his face was simply bone stained and worn i was not said the skull embalmed unlike constantia the explanation escaped diane she made no sound of protest which the scene would surely have justified all she could summon was a whimper as his handhold tightened and he hauled her head back we must make a choice sooner or later said lichfield his breath smelling less like chocolate than profound putrescence between serving ourselves and serving our art she didnt quite understand the dead must choose more carefully than the living we cannot waste our breath if youll excuse the phrase on less than the purest delights you dont want art i think do you she shook her head hoping to god that was the expected response you want the life of the body not the life of the imagination and you may have it thank you if you want it enough you may have it suddenly his hand which had been pulling on her hair so painfully was cupped behind her head and bringing her lips up to meet his she would have screamed then as his rotting mouth fastened itself on to hers but his greeting was so insistent it quite took her breath away ryan found diane on the floor of her dressingroom a few minutes before two it was difficult to work out what had happened there was no sign of a wound of any kind on her head or body nor was she quite dead she seemed to be in a coma of some kind she had perhaps slipped and struck her head as she fell whatever the cause she was out for the count they were hours away from a final dress rehearsal and viola was in an ambulance being taken into intensive care the sooner they knock this place down the better said hammersmith hed been drinking during office hours something calloway had never seen him do before the whisky bottle stood on his desk beside a halffull glass there were glassmarks ringing his accounts and his hand had a bad dose of the shakes whats the news from the hospital shes a beautiful woman he said staring at the glass calloway could have sworn he was on the verge of tears hammersmith how is she shes in a coma but her condition is stable thats something i suppose hammersmith stared up at calloway his erupting brows knitted in anger you runt he said you were screwing her werent you fancy yourself like that dont you well let me tell you something diane duvall is worth a dozen of you a dozen is that why you let this last production go on hammersmith because youd seen her and you wanted to get your hot little hands on her you wouldnt understand youve got your brain in your pants he seemed genuinely offended by the interpretation calloway had put on his admiration for miss duvall all right have it your way we still have no viola thats why im canceling said hammersmith slowing down to savor the moment it had to come without diane duvall there would be no twelfth night and maybe it was better that way a knock on the door who the fucks that said hammersmith softly come it was lichfield calloway was almost glad to see that strange scarred face though he had a lot of questions to ask of lichfield about the state hed left diane in about their conversation together it wasnt an interview he was willing to conduct in front of hammersmith besides any halfformed accusations he might have had were countered by the mans presence here if lichfield had attempted violence on diane for whatever reason was it likely that he would come back so soon so smilingly who are you hammersmith demanded richard walden lichfield im none the wiser i used to be a trustee of the elysium oh i make it my business what do you want hammersmith broke in irritated by lichfields poise i hear the production is in jeopardy lichfield replied unruffled no jeopardy said hammersmith allowing himself a twitch at the corner of his mouth no jeopardy at all because theres no show its been cancelled oh lichfield looked at calloway is this with your consent he asked he has no say in the matter i have sole right of cancellation if circumstances dictate it its in his contract the theatre is closed as of today it will not reopen yes it will said lichfield what hammersmith stood up behind his desk and calloway realized hed never seen the man standing before he was very short we will play twelfth night as advertised lichfield purred my wife has kindly agreed to understudy the part of viola in place of miss duvall hammersmith laughed a coarse butchers laugh it died on his lips however as the office was suffused with lavender and constantia lichfield made her entrance shimmering in silk and fur she looked as perfect as the day she died even hammersmith held his breath and his silence at the sight of her our new viola lichfield announced after a moment hammersmith found his voice this woman cant step in at half a days notice why not said calloway not taking his eyes off the woman lichfield was a lucky man constantia was an extraordinary beauty he scarcely dared draw breath in her presence for fear shed vanish then she spoke the lines were from act v scene i if nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurpd attire do not embrace me till each circumstance of place time fortune do cohere and jump that i am viola the voice was light and musical but it seemed to resound in her body filling each phrase with an undercurrent of suppressed passion and that face it was wonderfully alive the features playing the story of her speech with delicate economy she was enchanting im sorry said hammersmith but there are rules and regulations about this sort of thing is she equity no said lichfield well you see its impossible the union strictly precludes this kind of thing theyd flay us alive whats it to you hammersmith said calloway what the fuck do you care youll never need set foot in a theatre again once this place is demolished my wife has watched the rehearsals she is word perfect it could be magic said calloway his enthusiasm firing up with every moment he looked at constantia youre risking the union calloway hammersmith chided ill take that risk as you say its nothing to me but if a little bird was to tell them youd have egg on your face hammersmith give her a chance give all of us a chance if equity blacks me thats my lookout hammersmith sat down again nobodyll come you know that dont you diane duvall was a star they would have sat through your turgid production to see her calloway but an unknown well its your funeral go ahead and do it i wash my hands of the whole thing its on your head calloway remember that i hope they flay you for it thank you said lichfield most kind hammersmith began to rearrange his desk to give more prominence to the bottle and the glass the interview was over he wasnt interested in these butterflies any longer go away he said just go away i have one or two requests to make lichfield told calloway as they left the office alterations to the production which would enhance my wifes performance what are they for constantias comfort i would ask that the lighting levels be taken down substantially shes simply not accustomed to performing under such hot bright lights very well id also request that we install a row of footlights footlights an odd requirement i realize but she feels much happier with footlights they tend to dazzle the actors said calloway it becomes difficult to see the audience nevertheless i have to stipulate their installation ok thirdlyi would ask that all scenes involving kissing embracing or otherwise touching constantia be redirected to remove every instance of physical contact whatsoever everything everything for gods sake why my wife needs no business to dramatize the working of the heart terence that curious intonation on the word heart working of the heart calloway caught constantias eye for the merest of moments it was like being blessed shall we introduce our new viola to the company lichfield suggested why not the trio went into the theatre the rearranging of the blocking and the business to exclude any physical contact was simple and though the rest of the cast were initially wary of their new colleague her unaffected manner and her natural grace soon had them at her feet besides her presence meant that the show would go on at six calloway called a break announcing that theyd begin the dress at eight and telling them to go out and enjoy themselves for an hour or so the company went their ways buzzing with a newfound enthusiasm for the production what had looked like a shambles half a day earlier now seemed to be shaping up quite well there were a thousand things to be sniped at of course technical shortcomings costumes that fitted badly directorial foibles all par for the course in fact the actors were happier than theyd been in a good while even ed cunningham was not above passing a compliment or two lichfield found tallulah in the green room tidying tonight yes sir you must not be afraid im not afraid tallulah replied what a thought as if there may be some pain which i regret for you indeed for all of us i understand of course you do you love the theatre as i love it you know the paradox of this profession to play life ah tallulah to play life what a curious thing it is sometimes i wonder you know how long i can keep up the illusion its a wonderful performance she said do you think so do you really think so he was encouraged by her favorable review it was so galling to have to pretend all the time to fake the flesh the breath the look of life grateful for tallulahs opinion he reached for her would you like to die tallulah does it hurt scarcely at all it would make me very happy and so it should his mouth covered her mouth and she was dead in less than a minute conceding happily to his inquiring tongue he laid her out on the threadbare couch and locked the door of the green room with her own key shed cool easily in the chill of the room and be up and about again by the time the audience arrived at sixfifteen diane duvall got out of a taxi at the front of the elysium it was well dark a windy november night but she felt fine nothing could depress tonight not the dark not the cold unseen she made her way past the posters that bore her face and name and through the empty auditorium to her dressingroom there smoking his way through a pack of cigarettes she found the object of her affection terry she posed in the doorway for a moment letting the fact of her reappearance sink in he went quite white at the sight of her so she pouted a little it wasnt easy to pout there was a stiffness in the muscles of her face but she carried off the effect to her satisfaction calloway was lost for words diane looked ill no two ways about it and if shed left the hospital to take up her part in the dress rehearsal he was going to have to convince her otherwise she was wearing no makeup and her ashblonde hair needed a wash what are you doing here he asked as she closed the door behind her unfinished business she said listen ive got something to tell you god this was going to be messy weve found a replacement in the show she looked at him blankly he hurried on tripping over his own words we thought you were out of commission i mean not permanently but you know for the opening at least dont worry she said his jaw dropped a little dont worry whats it to me you said you came back to finish he stopped she was unbuttoning the top of her dress shes not serious he thought she cant be serious sex now ive done a lot of thinking in the last few hours she said as she shimmied the crumpled dress over her hips let it fall and stepped out of it she was wearing a white bra which she tried unsuccessfully to unhook ive decided i dont care about the theatre help me will you she turned round and presented her back to him automatically he unhooked the bra not really analyzing whether he wanted this or not it seemed to be a fait accompli shed come back to finish what theyd been interrupted doing simple as that and despite the bizarre noises she was making in the back of her throat and the glassy look in her eyes she was still an attractive woman she turned again and calloway stared at the fullness of her breasts paler than hed remembered them but lovely his trousers were becoming uncomfortably tight and her performance was only worsening his situation the way she was grinding her hips like the rawest of soho strippers running her hands between her legs dont worry about me she said ive made up my mind all i really want she put her hands so recently at her groin on his face they were icy cold all i really want is you i cant have sex and the stage there comes a time in everyones life when decisions have to be made she licked her lips there was no film of moisture left on her mouth when her tongue had passed over it the accident made me think made me analyze what it is i really care about and frankly she was unbuckling his belt i dont give a shit now the zip about this or any other fucking play his trousers fell down ill show you what i care about she reached into his briefs and clasped him her cold hand somehow made the touch sexier he laughed closing his eyes as she pulled his briefs down to the middle of his thigh and knelt at his feet she was as expert as ever her throat open like a drain her mouth was somewhat drier than usual her tongue scouring him but the sensations drove him wild it was so good he scarcely noticed the ease with which she devoured him taking him deeper than shed ever managed previously using every trick she knew to goad him higher and higher slow and deep then picking up speed until he almost came then slowing again until the need passed he was completely at her mercy he opened his eyes to watch her at work she was skewering herself upon him face in rapture god he gasped that is so good oh yes oh yes her face didnt even flicker in response to his words she just continued to work at him soundlessly she wasnt making her usual noises the small grunts of satisfaction the heavy breathing through the nose she just ate his flesh in absolute silence he held his breath a moment while an idea was born in his belly the bobbing head bobbed on eyes closed lips clamped around his member utterly engrossed half a minute passed a minute a minute and a half and now his belly was full of terrors she wasnt breathing she was giving this matchless blowjob because she wasnt stopping even for a moment to inhale or exhale calloway felt his body go rigid while his erection wilted in her throat she didnt falter in her labor the relentless pumping continued at his groin even as his mind formed the unthinkable thought shes dead she has me in her mouth in her cold mouth and shes dead thats why shed come back got up off her mortuary slab and come back she was eager to finish what shed started no longer caring about the play or her usurper it was this act she valued this act alone shed chosen to perform it for eternity calloway could do nothing with the realization but stare down like a damn fool while this corpse gave him head then it seemed she sensed his horror she opened her eyes and looked up at him how could he ever have mistaken that dead stare for life gently she withdrew his shrunken manhood from between her lips what is it she asked her fluting voice still affecting life you youre not breathing her face fell she let him go oh darling she said letting all pretence to life disappear im not so good at playing the part am i her voice was a ghosts voice thin forlorn her skin which he had thought so flatteringly pale was on second view a waxen white you are dead he said im afraid so two hours ago in my sleep but i had to come terry so much unfinished business i made my choice you should be flattered you are flattered arent you she stood up and reached into her handbag which shed left beside the mirror calloway looked at the door trying to make his limbs work but they were inert besides he had his trousers round his ankles two steps and hed fall flat on his face she turned back on him with something silver and sharp in her hand try as he might he couldnt get a focus on it but whatever it was she meant it for him since the building of the new crematorium in one humiliation had come after another for the cemetery the tombs had been raided for lead coffinlinings the stones overturned and smashed it was fouled by dogs and graffiti very few mourners now came to tend the graves the generations had dwindled and the small number of people who might still have had a loved one buried there were too infirm to risk the throttled walkways or too tender to bear looking at such vandalism it had not always been so there were illustrious and influential families interred behind the marble facades of the victorian mausoleums founder fathers local industrialists and dignitaries any and all who had done the town proud by their efforts the body of the actress constantia lichfield had been buried here until the day break and the shadows flee away though her grave was almost unique in the attention some secret admirer still paid to it nobody was watching that night it was too bitter for lovers nobody saw charlotte hancock open the door of her sepulchre with the beating wings of pigeons applauding her vigour as she shambled out to meet the moon her husband gerard was with her he less fresh than she having been dead thirteen years longer joseph jardine en famille was not far behind the hancocks as was marriott fletcher and anne snell and the peacock brothers the list went on and on in one corner alfred crawshaw captain in the th lancers was helping his lovely wife emma from the rot of their bed everywhere faces pressed at the cracks of the tomblidswas that not kezia reynolds with her child whod lived just a day in her arms and martin van de linde the memory of the just is blessed whose wife had never been found rosa and selina goldfinch upstanding women both and thomas jerrey and too many names to mention too many states of decay to describe sufficient to say they rose their burial finery flyborn their faces stripped of all but the foundation of beauty still they came swinging open the back gate of the cemetery and threading their way across the wasteland towards the elysium in the distance the sound of traffic above a jet roared in to land one of the peacock brothers staring up at the winking giant as it passed over missed his footing and fell on his face shattering his jaw they picked him up fondly and escorted him on his way there was no harm done and what would a resurrection be without a few laughs so the show went on if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die calloway could not be found at curtain but ryan had instructions from hammersmith through the ubiquitous mr lichfield to take the show up with or without the director hell be upstairs in the gods said lichfield in fact i think i can see him from here is he smiling asked eddie grinning from ear to ear then hes pissed the actors laughed there was a good deal of laughter that night the show was running smoothly and though they couldnt see the audience over the glare of the newly installed footlights they could feel the waves of love and delight pouring out of the auditorium the actors were coming off stage elated theyre all sitting in the gods said eddie but your friends mr lichfield do an old ham good theyre quiet of course but such big smiles on their faces act i scene ii and the first entrance of constantia lichfield as viola was met with spontaneous applause such applause like the hollow roll of snare drums like the brittle beating of a thousand sticks on a thousand stretched skins lavish wanton applause and my god she rose to the occasion she began the play as she meant to go on giving her whole heart to the role not needing physicality to communicate the depth of her feelings but speaking the poetry with such intelligence and passion the merest flutter of her hand was worth more than a hundred grander gestures after that first scene her every entrance was met with the same applause from the audience followed by almost reverential silence backstage a kind of buoyant confidence had set in the whole company sniffed the success a success which had been snatched miraculously from the jaws of disaster there again applause applause in his office hammersmith dimly registered the brittle din of adulation through a haze of booze he was in the act of pouring his eighth drink when the door opened he glanced up for a moment and registered that the visitor was that upstart calloway come to gloat i daresay hammersmith thought come to tell me how wrong i was what do you want the punk didnt answer from the corner of his eye hammersmith had an impression of a broad bright smile on calloways face selfsatisfied halfwit coming in here when a man was in mourning i suppose youve heard the other grunted she died said hammersmith beginning to cry she died a few hours ago without regaining consciousness i havent told the actors didnt seem worth it calloway said nothing in reply to this news didnt the bastard care couldnt he see that this was the end of the world the woman was dead shed died in the bowels of the elysium thered be official enquiries made the insurance would be examined a postmortem an inquest it would reveal too much he drank deeply from his glass not bothering to look at calloway again your careerll take a dive after this son it wont just be me oh dear no still calloway kept his silence dont you care hammersmith demanded there was silence for a moment then calloway responded i dont give a shit jumped up little stagemanager thats all you are thats all any of you fucking directors are one good review and youre gods gift to art well let me set you straight about that he looked at calloway his eyes swimming in alcohol having difficulty focusing but he got there eventually calloway the dirty bugger was naked from the waist down he was wearing his shoes and his socks but no trousers or briefs his selfexposure would have been comical but for the expression on his face the man had gone mad his eyes were rolling around uncontrollably saliva and snot ran from mouth and nose his tongue hung out like the tongue of a panting dog hammersmith put his glass down on his blotting pad and looked at the worst part there was blood on calloways shirt a trail of it which led up his neck to his left ear from which protruded the end of diane duvals nailfile it had been driven deep into calloways brain the man was surely dead but he stood spoke walked from the theatre there rose another round of applause muted by distance it wasnt a real sound somehow it came from another world a place where emotions ruled it was a world hammersmith had always felt excluded from hed never been much of an actor though god knows hed tried and the two plays hed penned were he knew execrable bookkeeping was his forte and hed used it to stay as close to the stage as he could hating his own lack of art as much as he resented that skill in others the applause died and as if taking a cue from an unseen prompter calloway came at him the mask he wore was neither comic nor tragic it was blood and laughter together cowering hammersmith was cornered behind his desk calloway leapt on to it he looked so ridiculous shirttails and balls flipflapping and seized hammersmith by the tie philistine said calloway never now to know hammersmiths heart and broke the mans necksnapwhile below the applause began again do not embrace me till each circumstance of place time fortune do cohere and jump that i am viola from constantias mouth the lines were a revelation it was almost as though this twelfth night were a new play and the part of viola had been written for constantia lichfield alone the actors who shared the stage with her felt their egos shriveling in the face of such a gift the last act continued to its bittersweet conclusion the audience as enthralled as ever to judge by their breathless attention the duke spoke give me thy hand and let me see thee in thy womans weeds in the rehearsal the invitation in the line had been ignored noone was to touch this viola much less take her hand but in the heat of the performance such taboos were forgotten possessed by the passion of the moment the actor reached for constantia she forgetting the taboo in her turn reached to answer his touch in the wings lichfield breathed no under his breath but his order wasnt heard the duke grasped violas hand in his life and death holding court together under this painted sky it was a chilly hand a hand without blood in its veins or a blush in its skin but here it was as good as alive they were equals the living and the dead and nobody could find just cause to part them in the wings lichfield sighed and allowed himself a smile hed feared that touch feared it would break the spell but dionysus was with them tonight all would be well he felt it in his bones the act drew to a close and malvolio still trumpeting his threats even in defeat was carted off one by one the company exited leaving the clown to wrap up the play a great while ago the world began with hey ho the wind and the rain but thats all one our play is done and well strive to please you every day the scene darkened to blackout and the curtain descended from the gods rapturous applause erupted that same rattling hollow applause the company their faces shining with the success of the dress rehearsal formed behind the curtain for the bow the curtain rose the applause mounted in the wings calloway joined lichfield he was dressed now and hed washed the blood off his neck well we have a brilliant success said the skull it does seem a pity that this company should be dissolved so soon it does said the corpse the actors were shouting into the wings now calling for calloway to join them they were applauding him encouraging him to show his face he put a hand on lichfields shoulder well go together sir he said no no i couldnt you must its your triumph as much as mine lichfield nodded and they went out together to take their bows beside the company in the wings tallulah was at work she felt restored after her sleep in the green room so much unpleasantness had gone taken with her life she no longer suffered the aches in her hip or the creeping neuralgia in her scalp there was no longer the necessity to draw breath through pipes encrusted with seventy years muck or to rub the backs of her hands to get the circulation going not even the need to blink she laid the fires with a new strength pressing the detritus of past productions into use old backdrops props costuming when she had enough combustibles heaped she struck a match and set the flame to them the elysium began to burn over the applause somebody was shouting marvelous sweethearts marvelous it was dianes voice they all recognized it even though they couldnt quite see her she was staggering down the centre aisle towards the stage making quite a fool of herself silly bitch said eddie whoops said calloway she was at the edge of the stage now haranguing him got all you wanted now have you this your new ladylove is it is it she was trying to clamber up her hands gripping the hot metal hoods of the footlights her skin began to singe the fat was well and truly in the fire for gods sake somebody stop her said eddie but she didnt seem to feel the searing of her hands she just laughed in his face the smell of burning flesh wafted up from the footlights the company broke rank triumph forgotten somebody yelled kill the lights a beat and then the stage lights were extinguished diane fell back her hands smoking one of the cast fainted another ran into the wings to be sick somewhere behind them they could hear the faint crackle of flames but they had other calls on their attention with the footlights gone they could see the auditorium more clearly the stalls were empty but the balcony and the gods were full to bursting with eager admirers every row was packed and every available inch of aisle space thronged with audience somebody up there started clapping again alone for a few moments before the wave of applause began afresh but now few of the company took pride in it even from the stage even with exhausted and lightdazzled eyes it was obvious that no man woman or child in that adoring crowd was alive they waved fine silk handkerchiefs at the players in rotted fists some of them beat a tattoo on the seats in front of them most just clapped bone on bone calloway smiled bowed deeply and received their admiration with gratitude in all his fifteen years of work in the theatre he had never found an audience so appreciative bathing in the love of their admirers constantia and richard lichfield joined hands and walked downstage to take another bow while the living actors retreated in horror they began to yell and pray they let out howls they ran about like discovered adulterers in a farce but like the farce there was no way out of the situation there were bright flames tickling the roofjoists and billows of canvas cascaded down to right and left as the flies caught fire in front the dead behind death smoke was beginning to thicken the air it was impossible to see where one was going somebody was wearing a toga of burning canvas and reciting screams someone else was wielding a fire extinguisher against the inferno all useless all tired business badly managed as the roof began to give lethal falls of timber and girder silenced most in the gods the audience had more or less departed they were ambling back to their graves long before the fire department appeared their cerements and their faces lit by the glow of the fire as they glanced over their shoulders to watch the elysium perish it had been a fine show and they were happy to go home content for another while to gossip in the dark the fire burned through the night despite the never less than gallant efforts of the fire department to put it out by four in the morning the fight was given up as lost and the conflagration allowed its head it had done with the elysium by dawn in the ruins the remains of several persons were discovered most of the bodies in states that defied easy identification dental records were consulted and one corpse was found to be that of giles hammersmith administrator another that of ryan xavier stage manager and most shockingly a third that of diane duvall star of the love child burned to death read the tabloids she was forgotten in a week there were no survivors several bodies were simply never found they stood at the side of the motorway and watched the cars careering through the night lichfield was there of course and constantia radiant as ever calloway had chosen to go with them so had eddie and tallulah three or four others had also joined the troupe it was the first night of their freedom and here they were on the open road traveling players the smoke alone had killed eddie but there were a few more serious injuries amongst their number sustained in the fire burned bodies broken limbs but the audience they would play for in the future would forgive them their petty mutilations there are lives lived for love said lichfield to his new company and lives lived for art we happy band have chosen the latter persuasion there was a ripple of applause amongst the actors to you who have never died may i say welcome to the world laughter further applause the lights of the cars racing north along the motorway threw the company into silhouette they looked to all intents and purposes like living men and women but then wasnt that the trick of their craft to imitate life so well the illusion was indistinguishable from the real thing and their new public awaiting them in mortuaries churchyards and chapels of rest would appreciate the skill more than most who better to applaud the sham of passion and pain they would perform than the dead who had experienced such feelings and thrown them off at last the dead they needed entertainment no less than the living and they were a sorely neglected market not that this company would perform for money they would play for the love of their art lichfield had made that clear from the outset no more service would be done to apollo now he said which road shall we take north or south north said eddie my mothers buried in glasgow she died before i ever played professionally id like her to see me north it is then said lichfield shall we go and find ourselves some transport he led the way towards the motorway restaurant its neon flickering fitfully keeping the night at lights length the colors were theatrically bright scarlet lime cobalt and a wash of white that splashed out of the windows on to the car park where they stood the automatic doors hissed as a traveler emerged bearing gifts of hamburgers and cake to the child in the back of his car surely some friendly driver will find a niche for us said lichfield all of us said calloway a truck will do beggars cant be too demanding said lichfield and we are beggars now subject to the whim of our patrons we can always steal a car said tallulah no need for theft except in extremity lichfield said constantia and i will go ahead and find a chauffeur he took his wifes hand nobody refuses beauty he said what do we do if anyone asks us what were doing here asked eddie nervously he wasnt used to this role he needed reassurance lichfield turned towards the company his voice booming in the night what do you do he said play life of course and smile stockholm syndrome by david tallermandavid tallermans stories have appeared in a variety of publications such as flash fiction online andromeda spaceways inflight magazine and pseudopod hes also sold work to aoifes kiss the anthology barren worlds and the british comic futurequake he is a graduate of york university where he specialized in the literary history of witchcraft stockholm syndrome follows an unnamed protagonist who has survived the beginning of the zombie apocalypse but at the cost of his family his home his whole way of life while hes not a bad guy hes not really a good guy either tallerman says stuck on his own with no one to talk to and not much to do he has to confront that for maybe the first time in his life he sees some uncomfortable similarities between himself and the walking corpses out in the streets which has to be a harsh awakening for anybody tallerman argues that facing a single zombie is usually just funny but if you get a hundred of them or a thousand then suddenly they dont seem so funny anymore on the other hand its easy to forget the threat of a lone zombie he says at least until hes chomping on your guts one of them i called him billyhe was more whatd you call it more animated than the rest mostly they just wander about occasionally theyll pick things up and then get bored and put them down and go back to wandering again they dont make much noise i guess they know that therere people around for a few days at the start they bashed at the boards up over the windows and tried to push against the doors they cant climb and they aint got much in the way of strength so eventually they gave that up and after that they just shambled about or sometimes just lay there its funny how sometimes they look like people and sometimes they dont the first ones the ones who came up out of the ground or wherever they were guess what youd call the first generationsome of them are pretty normal looking but the way they walk that lumbering slowly like theyre taking babysteps and watching their feet all the time thats what makes them so different course the other ones the ones that the first generation got to some of those are real messed up bits hanging off and big messy wounds sometimes their faces are half off theyre just like dead people whore up and walking about theyre easier to deal with i guess even though its pretty crazy to see them like that but at least you know where you stand so anyway i was talking about billy billy he was first generation through and through i dont know what his story was but when he turned up about two weeks ago he was wearing a suit a real nice suit he even still had a carnation in his buttonhole i dont know maybe they was burying him when it happened youve got to wonder what theyd have thought when they was burying him and he got up like that anyway he cut quite a figure when he walked up of main street in that suit well not walked yknow i guess he shambled as much as the rest of them but somehow he seemed kind of smarter than the othersmore alert and in that suit he reminded me of my kid when we buried him thats why i named him billy billy made himself at home pretty quick it didnt take him long to figure that there were just two houses with people in mine and the place over the road both of us had boarded ourselves in pretty good actually i shouldnt go taking the credit for thatwhen i got here after my car came off the freeway a couple of miles up i found this place pretty much like it is now theyd got in through a window and it was still left opena couple of them had got in and then i figure the other two mustve been the ones whose house it was fours about as many as you could handle up close like thati had my old revolver still on me i guess i was lucky though getting them before they got me guess it could have easily gone the other way i hauled the bodies out the window and boarded it up again before the others figured out whatd gone on all in all i was real luckythere was a rifle here with one of those telescopic sights and a whole load of tins all sorts of things they was all set to wait it out and then they just must have got careless it can happen it aint easy to keep concentrating all the time not with things the way they are ive tried not to mess with their property too muchit wouldnt be decent that gun and the foods all i really need but im getting off the subject againthis is billys story it aint mine and the thing was as soon as hed walked into town like that you could see that something was different i guess i should have known that he meant trouble but you get bored with nothing to do all day and the radio and tv giving out nothing but static i should have just shot him right then at first yknow you take every shot you can getbut after a while you get to realizing that theres always gonna be more of them than you got bullets however many bullets you got therell always be more of them so maybe thats what i was thinking when i didnt take my shot on billy or maybe it was because hed looked so much like my kid when he was walking up main street or maybe it was just that i was bored and here was something happening i suppose it dont matter much either way you could see that he was a bit smarter that he wasnt just gonna settle down to blundering about with the rest of them first off he walked all round the house across the road and every so often hed bang on a board or something like he was testing the place then when he got done with that he came and did the same to minei could hear him scratching on that window where id got in i got to say i was impressed you get sick of the stupid way they act theyre like dumb lazy children and it starts to grate on your nerves after a while it was nice to see one of them showing a bit of initiative even if it did look like it was gonna spell trouble i wasnt too worried for myselfi checked the boards every morning and every so often id hammer up another couple more for something to do than anything cause like i said theyd pretty much given up on trying to get in but i didnt know about the family across the road i didnt know whether they were taking precautions or not the place looked okay from the outside sounds kind of stupid now but i didnt like to pry too much i knew that there were four of them i figured they were a husband and wife and two kids but that was as far as id got its a wide street i couldnt see much without the sight and that just felt too much likei dont knowlike i was some kind of pervert even with everything all screwed up like this people have got to have some right to privacy havent they there wasnt any way we could talk to each other if the phones had been working then i could have just looked them up in the book i guess or maybe i couldve put a sign up but i didnt know if theyd have any way to read it so i just tried to leave them alone as much as i could billy obviously got it into his head that they were a better bet because after the first day he didnt bother with me too much but i kept my eye on him cause he was interestingleast he was compared with the others and because they were everywhere as far as you could see they were about all there was to look at it was the same for them they were curious as much as they could bewho was this walking around like he had some kind of an agenda or something in the meanwhile billy had taken a project on himselfthe second day after he walked into town he picked himself out a particular window round on the righthand side of the familys house just after where the porch ended even with the scope i could barely make him out there there was the porch and a big old tree in the way and i could just about see him moving around but that was it course i could guess what hed be up tohe must have decided that there was a weak spot he thought maybe if he kept going at it hed be able to get in sooner or later i didnt give much for his chances there was no way they wouldnt have heard him there and if they thought there was any chance of him getting through theyd be hammering up two new boards for every one he managed to get offleast that was what id of been doing probably hed get bored after a day or two and go to sitting and wandering like the rest of them that thought made me kind of sad somehow i mean god knows it wasnt like i wanted him to succeed or nothingi just didnt want to have to watch him give up either shit i dont know maybe it was like i wanted to see him make something of himself i didnt want him to wind up like my billy did yeah it sounds pretty stupid i know that i guess i dont know what i was thinkingjust seemed like it would of been a shame is all when i got up the next day he was still at it but it wasnt just thathed gathered himself an audience as well a lot of the othersmaybe there was a hundred maybe even morehad gathered about on the lawn some of them were standing but a lot were just sitting around like he was putting on a performance for them or something i still couldnt make out exactly what billy himself was up to it got to be frustratingwhat could he be doing to get all of their attentions like that after a while i started hunting around for a better view and then i remembered there was a ladder to the attic and sure enough once i got up there there was a big window looking out over the street the room had been converted looked like it was a kids room but then the kid had left and the parents hadnt wanted to change it any the window was so big that i could sit up on the ledge and from there sure enough i could see billy pretty clear it was quite a shock i aint ever seen one of them go at anything the way he was at those plankstearing at them with his hands over and over his fingers were all bloody with the sight i reckoned i could make out bits of bone where hed torn the ends clean off he was a mess but that wasnt slowing him anyi guess he wasnt even feeling it he just kept tearing at the planks not paying any attention to anything else hed got a couple down already they were lying on the grass next to him i didnt figure it was gonna do him any good thoughthe family would put up more on the inside and if he started on those theyd just have to put up some more even if he was a bit stronger and a bit smarter than the rest he still wasnt about to keep up still the way he was going at it it was hard to take your eyes off apart from a break at lunchtime i watched billy all day til it started to get too dark the last i saw he was about halfway there on the outside planks he was still at it when i left himi suppose the dark didnt bother him too much i got up early the next day and shifted all my supplies up into the attic room along with a gas stove id found it was like hed become the center of my life all of a suddeni remember thinking how i was just like those other dumb bastards who were sitting out there on the lawn with him watching him like he was the star attraction in a freak show only when i got up to my perch on the sill they werent sitting anymore they were in a big mass now with billy right there in the center in that nice suit of his and every single one of them was after getting into that window maybe twenty of them were clawing at the planks all together and i could tell straight away that whatever the family was doing on the inside there wasnt anything that could stop thatthe sheer weight of all those bodies all together sure enough it was only about a minute after i got up there that the whole thing caved in planks and bodies all falling in togetheri remember some crazy part of my brain thinking it was like billy had been waiting for me as if he liked that hed got an audience i didnt do anything what wouldve been the point if the family had been on the other side and i figured they mustve been then theyd have been dead about the moment those planks gave up i wasnt feeling much eitherlike maybe i was in shock they kept on climbing through the window all of them fighting each other to get in like it was the only thing thatd ever mattered to them even once the room was full they kept on going til there were just a few left on the lawn and even they were still pushing and shoving it was quiet a weird kind of quiet considering whatd just happened but i didnt even notice it until the screaming started and then it seemed strange there being a noise cause id gotten so used to it being quiet all the time i had to put down the rifle for a second just so i could look to see where it was coming from it was up on the second floor on the far side from where theyd got inthe little daughter maybe she was about twelve years old they mustve locked her in there thinking shed be safer maybe she was hanging half out of the window and she was screamingshe wasnt looking at me i dont know if she knew i was there if she was screaming for somebody to help her or just screaming there wasnt a thing that i couldve done for her if shed gotten out onto the porch and down to the road maybe then i couldve done something but there was no way to tell her that i picked up the rifle again i dont know why whether i was thinking to get some of them before they got to her or whether i thought id make it easier on her thats what i shouldve done i guessi dont know if i even thought of it then its a hard thing to think and yknow i think id guessed that it was going to be billy that got to her first least i wasnt a bit surprised when he appeared the girl didnt even realize he was there she was so caught up with her screaming it was a long double window and there were a couple of feet between them still billy was shuffling up like he had all the time in the world and i had a good clean shot would have taken his head right off i squeezed on the triggerand then i stopped all i could think about was how id been happier since billy had walked up of main street about how much hed looked like my kid maybe he was one of them but he was smart and did i have the right to kill him and somewhere there was a voice in my head saying you cant get them all there just aint the bullets one of thems going to get her and why shouldnt it be billy i knew that i was wrongif i could buy her a bit more time then maybe shed wake up and get out onto the porch i went to take the shot again but by then it was too late billy lurched forward and he got hold of her head with those bloody stumps of hands that he had left and he bit down hard into her cheek then he just stayed like that with his mouth covering half of her facealmost like he was kissing her except for the blood streaming down between them pouring out all over his nice suit i could see his jaw moving through the sight suddenly he didnt look like my kid no more he just looked like a monster i pulled the triggerand for a couple of seconds his head was just a red cloud with the blood raining down over everything when it cleared he was still standing there and even though there wasnt anything to hold it up his face was still clamped over hers i pulled the trigger again and then they both crumpled down i knew she was dead any way but that didnt make it feel any better so thats the end of billys story and i guess its the end of mine as well yesterday i found this old tape recorder and i just wanted to talk it all through i suppose get it out in the open probably no ones ever going to hear it but maybe therell be a day when this is all over and maybe theres something we could learn from it maybe everyone will try to forget as quick as they can when theyd be better off remembering cause what ive been thinking is the worst thing that theyve done to us it aint killing us its making us like themmaking us so we cant feel anything whether they get to you or not you start to getting a little less human every day you get deader inside or i dont know maybe i was always like this i havent ever cried for barbara and my little girl not once even though i miss them so bad it hurtssomething in me just cant do it but then i didnt cry for billy eitherseeing them put him in the ground i was just angry and wondering why he had to do a stupid selfish thing like that shit i know i wasnt a good father to him but if hed just talked to me then theres got to have been something i couldve said but i guess that i understand billy a little better nowi wish he was here and i could tell him that instead of talking to this dumb machine one of the policemen said to me billy didnt really know what he was doing cause nobody shoots themselves in the chestin the mouth he said with the barrel facing upwards thats the best way itd be hell to do with that rifle but i was lucky therere a couple of bullets left in the revolverand ill only need the one i guess what i was trying to say before what theyve taught usits that being alive aint the same thing as living and me i figure that im already dead at least now

bobby conroy is a romance he says the real romance on display here though is my twentyyear love affair with the zombie movies of george romero bobby didnt know her at first she was wounded like him the first thirty to arrive all got wounds tom savini put them on himself her face was a silvery blue her eyes sunken into darkened hollows and where her right ear had been was a raggededged hole a gaping place that revealed a lump of wet red bone they sat a yard apart on the stone wall around the fountain which was switched off she had her pages balanced on one kneethree pages in all stapled togetherand was looking them over frowning with concentration bobby had read his while he was waiting in line to go into makeup her jeans reminded him of harriet rutherford there were patches all over them patches that looked as if they had been made out of kerchiefs squares of red and dark blue with paisley patterns printed on them harriet was always wearing jeans like that patches sewn into the butt of a girls levis still turned bobby on his gaze followed the bend of her legs down to where her blue jeans flared at the ankle then on to her bare feet she had kicked her sandals off and was twisting the toes of one foot into the toes of the other when he saw this he felt his heart lunge with a kind of painfulsweet shock harriet he said is that little harriet rutherford who i used to write love poems to she peered at him sideways over her shoulder she didnt need to answer he knew it was her she stared for a long measuring time and then her eyes opened a little wider they were a vivid very undead green and for an instant he saw them brighten with recognition and unmistakable excitement but she turned her head away went back to perusing her pages no one ever wrote me love poems in high school she said id remember i wouldve died of happiness in detention remember we got two weeks after the cooking show skit you had a cucumber carved like a dick you said it needed to stew for an hour and stuck it in your pants it was the finest moment in the history of the die laughing comedy collective no i have a good memory and i dont recall this comedy troupe she looked back down at the pages balanced on her knee do you remember any details about these supposed poems how do you mean a line maybe if you could remember something about one of these poemsone line of heartrending verseit would all come flooding back to me he didnt know if he could at first stared at her blankly his tongue pressed to his lower lip trying to call something back and his mind stubbornly blank then he opened his mouth and began to speak remembering as he went along i love to watch you in the shower i hope thats not obscene but when i see you soap your boobs i get sticky in my jeans harriet cried turning her body towards him bobby conroy goddamn come here and hug me without screwing up my makeup he leaned into her and put his arms around her narrow back he shut his eyes and squeezed feeling absurdly happy maybe the happiest he had felt since moving back in with his parents he had not spent a day in monroeville when he didnt think about seeing her he was depressed he daydreamed about her stories that began with exactly this momentor not exactly this moment he had not imagined them both madeup like partially decomposed corpses but close enough when he woke every morning in his bedroom over his parents garage he felt flat and listless hed lie on his lumpy mattress and stare at the skylights overhead the skylights were milky with dust and through them every sky appeared the same a bland formless white nothing in him wanted to get up what made it worse was he still remembered what it felt like to wake in that same bed with a teenagers sense of his own limitless possibilities to wake charged with enthusiasm for the day if he daydreamed about meeting harriet again and falling into their old friendshipand if these early morning daydreams sometimes turned explicitly sexual if he remembered being with her in her fathers shed her back on the stained cement her tooskinny legs pulled open her socks still onthen at least it was something to stir his blood a little get him going all his other daydreams had thorns on them handling them always threatened a sudden sharp prick of pain they were still holding each other when a boy spoke close by mom who are you hugging bobby conroy opened his eyes shifted his gaze to the right a little bluefaced dead boy with limp black hair was staring at them he wore a hooded sweatshirt the hood pulled up harriets grip on bobby relaxed then slowly her arms slid away bobby regarded the boy for an instant longerthe kid was no older than sixand then dropped to harriets hand the wedding band on her ring finger bobby looked back at the kid forced a smile bobby had been to more than seven hundred auditions during his years in new york city and he had a whole catalog of phony smiles hey chumley bobby said im bobby conroy your mom and me are old buddies from way back when mastodons walked the earth bobby is my name too the boy said do you know a lot about dinosaurs im a big dinosaur guy myself bobby felt a sick pang that seemed to go right through the middle of him he glanced at her facedidnt want to couldnt help himselfand found harriet watching him her smile was anxious and compressed my husband picked it she said she was for some reason patting his leg after a yankee hes from albany originally i know about mastodons bobby said to the boy surprised to find his voice sounded just the same as it ever did big hairy elephants the size of school buses they once roamed the entire pennsylvanian plateau and left mountainous mastodon poops everywhere one of which later became pittsburgh the kid grinned and threw a quick glance at his mother perhaps to appraise what she made of this offhand reference to poop she smiled indulgently bobby saw the kids hand and recoiled ugh wow thats the best wound ive seen all day what is that a fake hand three fingers were missing from the boys left hand bobby grabbed it and yanked on it expecting it to come off but it was warm and fleshy under the blue makeup and the kid pulled it out of bobbys grip no he said its just my hand thats the way it is bobby blushed so intensely his ears stung and was grateful for his makeup harriet touched bobbys wrist he really doesnt have those fingers she said bobby looked at her struggling to frame an apology her smile was a little fretful now but she wasnt visibly angry with him and the hand on his arm was a good sign i stuck them into the tablesaw but i dont remember because i was so little the boy explained dean is in lumber harriet said is dean staggering around here somewhere bobby asked craning his head and making a show of looking around although of course he had no idea what harriets dean might look like both floors of the atrium at the center of the mall were crowded with other people like them madeup to look like the recent dead they sat together on benches or stood together in groups chatting laughing at each others wounds or looking over the mimeographed pages they had been given of the screenplay the mall was closedsteel gates pulled down in front of the entrances to the storesno one in the place but the film crew and the undead no he dropped us off and went in to work on a sunday he owns his own yard it was as good a setup for a punch line as he had ever heard and he paused searching for just the right one and then it came to him that making wisecracks about deans choice of work to deans wife in front of deans fiveyearold might be illadvised and never mind that he and harriet had once been best friends and the royal couple of the die laughing comedy collective their senior year in high school bobby said he does good for him i like the big gross tear in your face the little kid said pointing at bobbys brow bobby had a nasty scalp wound the skin laid open to the lumpy bone didnt you think the guy who made us into dead people was cool bobby had actually been a little creeped out by tom savini who kept referring to an open book of autopsy photographs while applying bobbys makeup the people in those pictures with their maimed flesh and slack unhappy faces were really dead not getting up later to have a cup of coffee at the craft services table savini studied their wounds with a quiet appreciation the same as any painter surveying the subject of his art but bobby could see what the kid meant about how he was cool with his black leather jacket motorcycle boots black beard and memorable eyebrowsthick black eyebrows that arched sharply upward like dr spock or bela lugosihe looked like a death metal rock god someone was clapping their hands bobby glanced around the director george romero stood close to the bottom of the escalators a bearish man well over six feet tall with a thick brown beard bobby had noticed that many of the men working on the crew had beards a lot of them had shoulder length hair too and wore armynavy castoffs and motorcycle boots like savini so that they resembled a band of counterculture revolutionaries bobby and harriet and little bob gathered with the other extras to hear what romero had to say he had a booming confident voice and when he grinned his cheeks dimpled visible in spite of the beard he asked if anyone present knew anything about making movies a few people bobby included raised their hands romero said thank god someone in this place does and everyone laughed he said he wanted to welcome them all to the world of bigbudget hollywood filmmaking and everyone laughed at that too because george romero only made pictures in pennsylvania and everyone knew dawn of the dead was lower than low budget it was a halfstep above nobudget he said he was grateful to them all for coming out today and that for ten hours of grueling work which would test them body and soul they would be paid in cash a sum so colossal he dare not say the number aloud he could only show it he held aloft a dollar bill and there was more laughter then tom savini up on the second floor leaned over the railing and shouted dont laugh thats more than most of us are getting paid to work on this turkey lots of people are in this film as a labor of love george romero said tom is in it because he likes squirting pus on people some in the crowd moaned fake pus fake pus romero cried you hope it was fake pus savini intoned from somewhere above but he was already moving away from the railing out of sight more laughter bobby knew a thing or two about comic patter and had a suspicion that this bit of the speech was rehearsed and had been issued just this way more than once romero talked for a while about the plot the recently dead were coming back to life they liked to eat people in the face of the crisis the government had collapsed four young heroes had sought shelter in this mall bobbys attention wandered and he found himself looking down at the other bobby at harriets boy little bob had a long solemn face dark chocolate eyes and lots of thick black hair limp and disheveled in fact the kid bore a passing resemblance to bobby himself who also had brown eyes a slim face and a thick untidy mass of black hair on his head bobby wondered if dean looked like him the thought made his blood race strangely what if dean dropped in to see how harriet and little bobby were doing and the man turned out to be his exact twin the thought was so alarming it made him feel briefly weakbut then he remembered he was madeup like a corpse blueface scalp wound even if they looked exactly alike they wouldnt look anything alike romero delivered some final instructions on how to walk like a zombiehe demonstrated by allowing his eyes to roll back in his head and his face to go slackand then promised theyd be ready to roll on the first shot in a few minutes harriet pivoted on her heel turned to face him her fist on her hip eyelids fluttering theatrically he turned at the same time and they almost bumped into each other she opened her mouth to speak but nothing came out they were standing too close to each other and the unexpected physical proximity seemed to throw her he didnt know what to say either all thought suddenly wiped from his mind she laughed and shook her head a reaction that struck him as artificial an expression of anxiety not happiness lets set pardner she said he remembered that when a skit wasnt going well and she got rattled she sometimes slipped into a big drawling john wayne impersonation on stage a nervous habit he had hated then and that he found in this moment endearing are we going to have something to do soon little bob asked soon she said why dont you practice being a zombie go on lurch around for a while bobby and harriet sat down at the edge of the fountain again her hands were small bony fists on her thighs she stared into her lap her eyes blank gaze directed inward she was digging the toes of one bare foot into the toes of the other again he spoke one of them had to say something i cant believe youre married and you have a kid he said in the same tone of happy astonishment he reserved for friends who had just told him they had been cast in a part he himself had auditioned for i love this kid youre dragging around with you hes so cute but then who can resist a little kid who looks halfrotted she seemed to come back from wherever she had been smiled at himalmost shyly he went on and you better be ready to tell me everything about this dean guy hes coming by later hes going to take us out to lunch you should come that could be fun bobby cried and made a mental note to take his enthusiasm down a notch he can be really shy the first time he meets someone so dont expect too much bobby waved a hand in the air pishposh its going to be great well have lots to talk about ive always been fascinated with lumber yards andplywood this was taking a chance joshing her about the husband he didnt know but she smirked and said everything you ever wanted to know about twobyfours but were afraid to ask and for a moment they were both smiling a little foolishly knees almost touching they had never really figured out how to talk to each other they were always halfonstage trying to use whatever the other person said to set up the next punchline that much anyway hadnt changed god i cant believe running into you here she said ive wondered about you ive thought about you a lot you have i figured youd be famous by now she said hey that makes two of us bobby said and winked immediately he wished he could take the wink back it was fake and he didnt want to be fake with her he hurried on answering a question she hadnt asked im settling in been back for three months im staying with my parents for a while kind of readapting to monroeville she nodded still regarding him steadily with a seriousness that made him uncomfortable hows it going im making a life bobby lied in between setups bobby and harriet and little bob told stories about how they had died i was a comedian in new york city bobby said fingering his scalp wound something tragic happened when i went on stage yeah harriet said your act something that had never happened before what people laughed i was my usual brilliant self people were rolling on the floor convulsions of agony and then as i was taking my final bowa terrible accident a stagehand up in the rafters dropped a forty pound sandbag right on my head but at least i died to the sound of applause they were applauding the stagehand harriet said the little boy looked seriously up into bobbys face and took his hand im sorry you got hit in the head his lips grazed bobbys knuckles with a dry kiss bobby stared down at him his hand tingled where little bobs mouth had touched it hes always been the kissiest huggiest kid you ever met harriet said hes got all this pentup affection at the slightest sign of weakness hes ready to slobber on you as she said this she ruffled little bobbys hair what killed you squirt he held up his hand waggled his stumps my fingers got cut off on dads tablesaw and i bled to death harriet went on smiling but her eyes seemed to film over slightly she fished around in her pocket and found a quarter go get a gumball bud he snatched it and ran people must think were the most careless parents she said staring expressionlessly after her son but it was no ones fault about his fingers im sure the table saw was unplugged and he wasnt even two he never plugged anything in before we didnt know he knew how dean was right there with him it just happened so fast do you know how many things had to go wrong all at the same time for that to happen dean thinks the sound of the saw coming on scared him and he reached up to try and shut it off he thought hed be in trouble she was briefly silent watching her son work the gumball machine then said i always thought about my kidthis is the one part of my life im going to get right no indiscriminate fuckups about this i was planning how when he was fifteen hed make love to the most beautiful girl in school howd he be able to play five instruments and hed blow everyone away with all his talent howd he be the funny kid who seems to know everyone she paused again and then added hell be the funny kid now the funny kid always has something wrong with him thats why hes funnyto shift peoples attention to something else in the silence that followed this statement bobby had several thoughts in rapid succession the first was that he had been the funny kid when he was in school did harriet think there had been something wrong with him he had been covering for then he remembered they were both the funny kids and thought what was wrong with us it had to be something otherwise theyd be together now and the boy at the gumball machine would be theirs the thought which crossed his mind next was that if little bobby was their little bobby hed still have ten fingers he felt a seething dislike of dean the lumber man an ignorant squarehead whose idea of spending togethertime with his kid probably meant taking him to the fair to watch a truckpull an assistant director started clapping her hands and hollering down for the undead to get into their positions little bob trotted back to them mom he said the gumball in his cheek you didnt say how you died he was looking at her tornoff ear i know bobby said she ran into this old friend at the mall and they got talking you know and i mean they really got talking hours of blab finally her old friend said hey i dont want to chew your ear off here and your mom said aw dont worry about it a great man once said lend me your ears harriet said she smacked the palm of her hand hard against her forehead why did i listen to him except for the dark hair dean didnt look anything like him dean was short bobby wasnt prepared for how short he was shorter than harriet who was herself not much over five and a half feet tall when they kissed dean had to stretch his neck he was compact and solidly built broad at the shoulders deep through the chest narrow at the hips he wore thick glasses with gray plastic frames the eyes behind them the color of unpolished pewter they were shy eyeshis gaze met bobbys when harriet introduced them darted away returned and darted away againnot to mention old at the corners of them the skin was creased in a web of finely etched laugh lines he was older than harriet maybe by as much as ten years they had only just been introduced when dean cried suddenly oh youre that bobby youre funny bobby you know we almost didnt name our kid bobby because of you ive had it drilled into me if i ever run into you im supposed to reassure you that naming him bobby was my idea cause of bobby murcer ever since i was old enough to imagine having kids of my own i always thought im funny harriets son interrupted dean caught him under the armpits and lofted him into the air you sure are bobby wasnt positive he wanted to have lunch with them but harriet looped her arm through his and marched him toward the doors out to the parking lot and her shoulderwarm and barewas leaning against his so there was really no choice bobby didnt notice the other people in the diner staring at them and forgot they were in makeup until the waitress approached she was hardly out of her teens with a head of frizzy yellow hair that bounced as she walked were dead little bobby announced gotcha the girl said nodding and pointing her ballpoint pen at them im guessing you either all work on the horror movie or you already tried the special which is it dean laughed dry bawling laughter dean was as easy a laugh as bobby had ever met dean laughed at almost everything harriet said and most of what bobby himself said sometimes he laughed so hard the people at the next table started in alarm once he had control of himself he would apologize with unmistakable earnestness his face flushed a delicate shade of rose eyes gleaming and wet that was when bobby began to see at least one possible answer to the question that had been on his mind ever since learning she was married to dean whoownedhisownlumberyard why him wellhe was a willing audience there was that so i thought you were acting in new york city dean said at last what brings you back failure bobby said ohim sorry to hear that what are you up to now are you doing some comedy locally you could say that only around here they call it substitute teaching oh youre teaching how do you like it its great i always planned to work either in film or television or junior high that i should finally make it so big subbing eighth grade gymits a dream come true dean laughed and chunks of pulverized chickenfried steak flew out of his mouth im sorry this is awful he said food everywhere you must think im a total pig no its okay can i have the waitress bring you something a glass of water a trough dean bent so his forehead was almost touching his plate his laughter wheezy asthmatic stop really bobby stopped but not because dean said for the first time he had noticed harriets knee was knocking his under the table he wondered if this was intentional and the first chance he got he leaned back and looked no not intentional she had kicked her sandals off and was digging the toes of one foot into the other so fiercely that sometimes her right knee swung out and banged his wow i wouldve loved to have a teacher like you someone who can make kids laugh dean said bobby chewed and chewed but couldnt tell what he was eating it didnt have any taste dean let out a shaky sigh wiped the corners of his eyes again of course im not funny i cant even remember knockknock jokes im not good for much else except working and harriet is so funny sometimes she puts on shows for bobby and me with these dirty socks on her hands we get laughing so hard we cant breathe she calls it the trailer park muppet show sponsored by pabst blue ribbon he started laughing and thumping the table again harriet stared intently into her lap dean said id love to see her do that on carson this iswhat do you call them routinesthis could be a classic routine sure sounds it bobby said im surprised ed mcmahon hasnt already called to see if shes available when dean dropped them back at the mall and left for the lumber yard the mood was different harriet seemed distant it was hard to draw her into any kind of conversationnot that bobby felt like trying very hard he was suddenly irritable all the fun seemed to have gone out of playing a dead person for the day it was mostly waitingwaiting for the gaffers to get the lights just so for tom savini to touch up a wound that was starting to look a little too much like latex not enough like ragged fleshand bobby was sick of it the sight of other people having a good time annoyed him several zombies stood in a group playing hackysack with a quivering red spleen and laughing it made a juicy splat every time it hit the floor bobby wanted to snarl at them for being so merry hadnt any of them heard of method acting stanislavsky they should all be sitting apart from one another moaning unhappily and fondling giblets he heard himself moan aloud an angry frustrated sound and little bobby asked what was wrong he said he was just practicing little bob went to watch the hackysack game harriet said without looking at him that was a good lunch wasnt it sensational bobby said thinking better be careful he was restless charged with an energy he didnt know how to displace i feel like i really hit it off with dean he reminds me of my grandfather i had this great grandfather who could wiggle his ears and who thought my name was evan hed give me a quarter to stack wood for him fifty cents if id do it with my shirt off say how old is dean they had been walking together now harriet stiffened stopped her head swiveled in his direction but her hair was in front of her eyes making it hard to read the expression in them hes nine years older than me so what so nothing im just glad youre happy i am happy harriet said her voice a halfoctave too high did he get down on one knee when he proposed harriet nodded her mouth crimped suspicious did you have to help him up afterwards bobby asked his own voice was sounding a little offkey too and he thought stop now it was like a cartoon he saw wile e coyote strapped to the front of a steam engine jamming his feet down on the rails to try to brake the train smoke boiling up from his heels feet swelling glowing red oh you prick she said im sorry he grinned holding his hands palmsup in front of him kidding kidding funny bobby you know i cant help myself she hesitatedhad been about to turn awaynot sure whether she should believe him or not bobby wiped his mouth with the palm of his hand so we know what you do to make dean laugh whats he do to make you laugh oh thats right he isnt funny well whats he do to make your heart race besides kiss you with his dentures out leave me alone bobby she said she turned away but he came around to get back in front of her keep her from walking off no stop cant he said and suddenly he understood he was angry with her if he isnt funny he must be something i need to know what patient she said patient bobby repeated it stunned himthat this could be her answer with me with you he said with robert patient bobby said then he couldnt say anything more for a moment because he was outofbreath he felt suddenly that his makeup was itching on his face he wished that when he started to press she had just walked away from him or told him to fuck off or hit him even wished she had responded with anything but patient he swallowed thats not good enough knowing he couldnt stop now the train was going into the canyon wile e coyotes eyes bugging three feet out of his head in terror i wanted to meet whoever you were with and feel sick with jealousy but instead i just feel sick i wanted you to fall in love with someone goodlooking and creative and brilliant a novelist a playwright someone with a sense of humor and a fourteeninch dong not a guy with a buzz cut and a lumber yard who thinks erotic massage involves a tube of ben gay she smeared at the tears dribbling down her face with the backs of her hands i knew youd hate him but i didnt think youd be mean its not that i hate him whats to hate hes not doing anything any other guy in his position wouldnt do if i was two feet tall and geriatric id leap at the chance to have a piece of ass like you you bet hes patient he better be he ought to be down on his fucking knees every night bathing your feet in sacramental oils that youd give him the time of day you had your chance she said she was struggling not to let her crying slip out of control the muscles in her face quivered with the effort pulling her expression into a grimace its not about what chances i had its about what chances you had this time when she pivoted away from him he let her go she put her hands over her face her shoulders were jerking and she was making choked little sounds as she went he watched her walk to the wall around the fountain where they had met earlier in the day then he remembered the boy and turned to look his heart drumming hard wondering what little bobby mightve seen or heard but the kid was running down the broad concourse kicking the spleen in front of him which had now collected a mass of dust bunnies around it two other dead children were trying to kick it away from him bobby watched them play for a while a pass went wide and the spleen skidded past him he put a foot on it to stop it it flexed unpleasantly beneath the sole of his shoe the boys stopped three yards off stood there breathing hard awaiting him he scooped it up go out he said and lobbed it to little bobby who made a basket catch and hauled away with his head down and the other kids in pursuit when he turned to peek at harriet he saw her watching him her palms pressed hard against her knees he waited for her to look away but she didnt and finally he took her steady gaze as an invitation to approach he crossed to the fountain sat down beside her he was still working out how to begin his apology when she spoke i wrote you you stopped writing back she said her bare feet were wrestling with each other again i hate how overbearing your right foot is he said why cant it give the left foot a little space but she wasnt listening to him it didnt matter she said her voice was congested and hoarse the makeup was oilbased and in spite of her tears hadnt streaked i wasnt mad i knew we couldnt have a relationship just seeing each other when you came home for christmas she swallowed thickly i really thought someone would put you in their sitcom every time i thought about thatabout seeing you on tv and hearing people laugh when you said thingsid get this big stupid smile on my face i could float through a whole afternoon thinking about it i dont understand what in the world couldve made you come back to monroeville but he had already said what in the world drew him back to his parents and his bedroom over the garage dean had asked in the diner and bobby had answered him truthfully one thursday night only last spring he had gone on early in a club in the village he did his twenty minutes earned a steady ifnotpreciselyoverwhelming murmur of laughter and a spatter of applause when he came off he found a place at the bar to hear some of the other acts he was just about to slide off his stool and go home when robin williams leaped on stage he was in town for snl cruising the clubs testing material bobby quickly shifted his weight back onto his stool and sat listening his pulse thudding heavily in his throat he couldnt explain to harriet the import of what he had seen then bobby saw a man clutching the edge of a table with one hand his dates thigh with the other grabbing both so hard his knuckles were drained of all color he was bent over with tears dripping off his face and his laughter was high and shrill and convulsive more animal than human the sound of a dingo or something he was shaking his head from side to side and waving a hand in the air stop please dont do this to me it was hilarity to the point of distress robin williams saw the desperate man broke away from a discourse on jerking off pointed at him and shouted you yes you frantic hyenaman you get a free pass to every show i do for the rest of my motherfucking life and then there was a sound rising in the crowd more than laughter or applause although it included both it was a low thunderous rumble of uncontained delight a sound so immense it was felt as much as heard a thing that caused the bones in bobbys chest to hum bobby himself didnt laugh once and when he left his stomach was churning his feet fell strangely heavily against the sidewalk and for some time he did not know his way home when at last he was in his apartment he sat on the edge of his bed his suspenders pulled off and his shirt unbuttoned and for the first time felt things were hopeless he saw something flash in harriets hand she was jiggling some quarters going to call someone he asked dean she said for a ride dont im not staying i cant stay he watched her tormented feet toes struggling together and finally nodded they stood at the same time they were once again standing uncomfortably close see you then she said see you he said he wanted to reach for her hand but didnt wanted to say something but couldnt think what are there a couple people around here who want to volunteer to get shot george romero asked from less than three feet away its a guaranteed closeup in the finished film bobby and harriet put their hands up at the same time me bobby said me said harriet stepping on bobbys foot as she moved forward to get george romeros attention me its going to be a great picture mr romero bobby said they were standing shoulder to shoulder making small talk waiting for savini to finish wiring harriet with her squiba condom partially filled with cane syrup and food coloring that would explode to look like a bullet hit bobby was already wired in more than one sense of the word someday everyone in pittsburgh is going to claim they walked dead in this movie you kiss ass like a pro romero said do you have a showbiz background six years offbroadway bobby said plus i played most of the comedy clubs ah but now youre back in greater pittsburgh good career move kid stick around here youll be a star in no time harriet skipped over to bobby her hair flouncing im going to get my tit blown off magnificent bobby said people just have to keep on going because you never know when something wonderful is going to happen george romero led them to their marks and walked them through what he wanted from them lights pointed into silver spangly umbrellas casting an even white glow and a dry heat over a tenfoot stretch of floor a lumpy striped mattress rested on the tiles just to one side of a square pillar harriet would get hit first in the chest she was supposed to jerk back then keep coming forward showing as little reaction to the shot as she could muster bobby would take the next bullet in the head and it would bring him down the squib was hidden under one latex fold of his scalp wound the wires that would cause the trojan to explode were threaded through his hair you can slump first and slide down and to the side george romero said drop to one knee if you want and then spill yourself out of the frame if youre feeling a bit more acrobatic you can fall straight back just be sure you hit the mattress no one needs to get hurt it was just bobby and harriet in the shot which would picture them from the waist up the other extras lined the walls of the shopping mall corridor watching them their stares their steady murmuring induced in bobby a pleasurable burst of adrenaline tom savini knelt on the floor just outside the framed shot with a handheld metal box in hand wires snaking across the floor toward bobby and harriet little bob sat next to him his hands cupped under his chin squeezing the spleen his eyes shiny with anticipation savini had told little bob all about what was going to happen preparing the kid for the sight of blood bursting from his mothers chest but little bob wasnt worried ive been seeing gross stuff all day it isnt scary i like it savini was letting him keep the spleen as a souvenir roll romero said bobby twitchedwhat they were rolling already he only just gave them their marks christ romero was still standing in front of the cameraand for an instant bobby grabbed harriets hand she squeezed his fingers let go romero eased himself out of the shot action bobby rolled his eyes back in his head rolled them back so far he couldnt see where he was going he let his face hang slack he took a plodding step forward shoot the girl romero said bobby didnt see her squib go off because he was a step ahead of her but he heard it a loud ringing crack that echoed and he smelled it a sudden pungent whiff of gunpowder harriet grunted softly annnd romero said now the other one it was like a gunshot going off next to his head the bang of the blasting cap was so loud it immediately deafened his eardrums he snapped backward spinning on his heel his shoulder slammed into something just behind him he didnt see what he caught a blurred glimpse of the square pillar next to the mattress and in that instant was seized with a jolt of inspiration he smashed his forehead into it on his way down and as he reeled away saw he had left a crimson flower on the white plaster he hit the mattress the cushion springy enough to provide a little bounce he blinked his eyes were watering creating a visual distortion a subtle warping of things the air above him was filled with blue smoke the center of his head stung his face was splattered with cool sticky fluid as the ringing in his ears faded he simultaneously became aware of two things the first was the sound a low subterranean bellow a distant steady rumble of applause the sound filled him like breath george romero was moving toward them also clapping smiling in that way that made dimples in his beard the second thing he noticed was harriet curled against him her hand on his chest did i knock you down he asked fraid so she said i knew it was only a matter of time before i got you in bed with me he said harried smiled an easy contented smile like he hadnt seen at any other time the whole day her blooddrenched bosom rose and fell against his side little bob ran to the edge of the mattress and leaped onto it with them harriet got an arm underneath him scooped him up and rolled him into the narrow space between her and bobby little bob grinned and put his thumb in his mouth his face was close to the boys head and suddenly he was aware of the smell of little bobs shampoo a melonflavored scent harriet watched him steadily across her son still with that same smile on her face his gaze drifted toward the ceiling the banks of skylights the crisp blue sky beyond nothing in him wanted to get up wanted to move past the next few moments he wondered what harriet did with herself when dean was at work and little bobby was at school tomorrow was a monday he didnt know if he would be teaching or free he hoped free the work week stretched ahead of him empty of responsibilities or concerns limitless in its possibilities the three of them bobby and the boy and harriet lay on the mattress their bodies pressed close together and there was no movement but for their breathing george romero turned back to them shaking his head that was great when you hit the pillar and you left that big streak of gore we should do it again just the same way this time you could leave some brains behind what do you two kids say either one of you feel like a doover me bobby said me said harriet me yes please said little bobby around the thumb in his mouth i guess its unanimous bobby said everyone wants a doover those who seek forgiveness by laurell k hamiltonlaurell k

bradleys fantasy magazine and in the sword and sorceress series of anthologies those who seek forgiveness is the first story hamilton wrote about her iconic character anita blake in her collection strange candy hamilton says that the cemetery in this story is based on the cemetery where her mother is buried it was a place i knew very well because my grandmother who raised me took me often she says i guess it was inevitable that i would write about the dead my childhood was haunted by death not real ghosts but the ghosts of memory and loss death is a very serious matter mrs fiske people who go through it are never the same the woman leaned forward cradling her face in her hands her slim shoulders shook quietly for a few minutes i passed another box of tissues her way she groped for them blindly and then looked up i know you cant bring him back exactly she wiped at two tears which escaped and rolled down flawless cheekbones the purse she clutched so tightly was reptile at least two hundred dollars her accessorieslapel pin high heels hat and gloveswere all black as her purse her suit was gray neither color suited her but they emphasized her pale skin and hollow eyes she was the sort of woman that made me feel too short too dark and gave me the strange desire to lose ten more pounds if she hadnt been so genuinely griefstricken i could have disliked her i have to talk to arthur thats my husband was my husband she took a deep breath and tried again arthur died suddenly a massive coronary she blew delicately into a tissue his family did have a history of heart disease but he always took such good care of himself she finished with a watery hiccup i want to say goodbye to him miss blake i smiled reassuringly we all have things left unsaid when death comes suddenly but it isnt always best to raise the dead and say it her blue eyes stared intently through a film of tears i was going to discourage her as i discourage every one of my clients but this one would do it there was a certain set to the eyes that said serious there are certain limitations to the process my boss didnt allow us to show slides or pictures or give graphic descriptions but we were supposed to tell the truth one good picture of a decaying zombie would have sent most of my clients screaming limitations yes we can bring him back you came to us promptly that helps hes been buried only three days but as a zombie your husband will only have limited use of his body and mind and as the days go by that will grow worse not better she stood up very straight tears drying on her face i was hoping you could bring him back as a vampire i kept my face carefully blank vampires are illegal mrs fiske a friend told me that you could get that done here she finished in a rush searching my face i smiled my best professional smile we do not do vampires and even if we did you cant make an ordinary corpse into a vampire ordinary very few people who came to us had even a remote idea of how rare vampires were or why the deceased would have to have been bitten by a werewolf vampire or other supernatural creature while alive being buried in unconsecrated ground would help your husband arthur was never bitten by a vampire while alive was he no she half laughed he was bitten by my yorkshire terrier once i smiled encouraging her turn of spirits that wont quite do it your husband can come back as a zombie or not at all ill take it she said quietly all serious and very still i will warn you that most families find it advisable to lay the zombie to rest after a time why why i saw the happy family embracing their lost loved one i saw the family sick horrified bringing the decaying corpse to be put down the smiling relative reduced to a shambling horror what exactly do you want arthur to do when he arises she looked down and shredded another tissue i want to say goodbye to him yes mrs fiske but what do you want him to do she was silent for several minutes i decided to prompt her for instance a woman came in wanting her husband raised so he could take out life insurance i told her most insurance companies wont insure the walking dead she grinned at that and that is what arthur will come back asthe walking dead her smile faltered and tears came again i want arthur to forgive me she hid her face in her hands and sobbed i had an affair for several months he found out had a heart attack and died she seemed to gain strength from the words and the tears slowed you see that i have to talk to him one last time i have to tell him i love him only him i want arthur to forgive me can he do that as a zombie ive found that the dead are very forgiving of the living when they die of natural causes your husband will have ample brainpower to speak he will be himself at first as the days progress he will lose memory he will begin to decay first mentally then physically decay yes slowly but after all he is dead the relatives didnt really believe that a fresh zombie wasnt alive knowing intellectually that someone smiling and talking is the walking dead is one thing emotionally it is very different but they believed as time passed and as he or she began to look like a walking corpse its temporary then not exactly i came from behind the desk and sat next to her he could stay a zombie possibly forever but his physical and mental state would deteriorate until he was not much better than an automaton in tattered flesh tattered flesh she whispered i touched her hand i know its a hard choice but that is the reality tattered flesh didnt really touch the white sheen of bone through rotting flesh but it was a term our boss allowed she gripped my hand and smiled thank you for telling me the truth i still want to bring arthur back even if its just long enough to say a few words so she was going to do it as i had known she would so you dont want him for weeks or days only long enough to talk i think so i dont mean to rush you mrs fiske but i need to know before we set up an appointment you see it takes more time and energy to raise and then lay to rest one right after another if she laid and raised quickly enough mrs fiske might be able to remember arthur at his best oh of course if possible i would like to talk for several hours then its best if you take him home for at least the evening we can schedule putting him back for tomorrow night i would push for a quick laying to rest i didnt think mrs fiske could take watching her husband rot before her eyes that sounds good she took a deep breath i knew what she was going to say she looked so brave and resolute i want to be there when you bring him back your presence is required mrs fiske you see a zombie has no real will of its own your husband should be able to think on his own at first but as time wears on the zombie finds it very difficult to decide things the person or persons who raised it will have control over it you and i yes she paled even more her grip tightening mrs fiske i got her a glass of water sip it slowly when she seemed better i asked are you sure youre up to this tonight is there anything i need to bring a suit of your husbands clothes would be nice maybe a favorite object hat trophy to help him orient himself the rest ill supply i hesitated because some of the color had crept into her face but she needed to be prepared there will be blood at the ceremony blood her voice was a breathy whisper chicken ill bring it there will also be some ointment to spread over our faces and hands it glows faintly and smells fairly strange but not unpleasant her next question would be the usual what do we do with the blood i gave the usual answer we sprinkle some on the grave and some on us she swallowed very carefully looking slightly gray you can back out now but not later once youve paid your deposit it cant be refunded and once the ceremony begins to break the circle is very dangerous she looked down thinking i liked that most who agreed right away were afraid later the brave ones took time to answer yes she sounded very convinced to make peace with arthur i can do it good for you how is tonight about midnight she added hopefully i smiled everyone thought midnight was the perfect time for raising the dead all that was required was darkness some people did put a great deal of stock in certain phases of the moon but i had never found it necessary no how about nine oclock nine if that will be all right i have two other appointments tonight and nine was left open she smiled that will be fine her hand shook as she signed the check for half the fee the other half to be delivered after the raising we shook hands and she said call me carla im anita ill see you at nine tonight at wellington cemetery i continued for her between two large trees and across from the only hill yes thank you she flashed a watery smile and was gone i buzzed our receptionist area mary im booked up for this week and wont be seeing any more clients until at least next tuesday ill see to it anita i leaned back in my chair and soaked up the silence three animations a night was my limit tonight they were all routine or almost i was bringing back my first research scientist his three colleagues couldnt figure out his notes and their deadline or rather grant was running close so dear dr richard norris was coming back from the dead to help them out they were scheduled for midnight at three this next morning i would meet the widowed mrs stiener she wanted her husband to clear up some nasty details with his will being an animator meant very little nightlife no pun intended afternoons were spent interviewing clients and evenings raising the dead though we few were very popular at a certain kind of partythe sort where the host likes to brag about how many celebrities he knows or worse yet the kind who simply want to stare i dont like being on display and refuse to go to parties unless forced our boss likes to keep us in the public eye to dispel rumors that we are witches or hobgoblins its pretty pitiful at parties all the animators huddled talking shop like a bunch of doctors but doctors dont get called witch monster zombie queen very few people remember to call us animators for most we are a dark joke this is anita she makes zombies and i dont mean the drink then there would be laughter all around and i would smile politely and know id be going home early tonight there was no party to worry over just work work was power magic a strange dark impulse to raise more than what you were paid for tonight would be cloudless moonlit and starred i could feel it we were different drawn to the night unafraid of death and its many forms because we had a sympathy for it tonight i would raise the dead wellington cemetery was new all the tombstones were nearly the same size square or rectangle and set off into the night in nearperfect rows young trees and perfectly clipped evergreen shrubs lined the gravel driveway the moon rode strong and high bathing the scene clearly if mysteriously in silver and black a handful of huge trees dotted the grounds they looked out of place among all this newness as carla had said only two of them grew close together the drive spilled into the open and encircled the hill the mound of grasscovered earth was obviously manmade so round short and domed three other drives centered on it a short way down the west drive stood two large trees as my car crunched over gravel i could see someone dressed in white a flare of orange was a match and the reddish pinpoint of a cigarette sprang to life i stopped the car blocking the drive but few people on honest business visit cemeteries at night carla had beaten me here very unusual most clients want to spend as little time as possible near the grave after dark i walked over to her before unloading equipment there was a litter of burnedout cigarettes like stubby white bugs about her feet she must have been here in the dark for hours waiting to raise a zombie she either was punishing herself or enjoyed the idea there was no way of knowing which her dress shoes even hose were white earrings of silver flashed in the moonlight as she turned to me she was leaning against one of the trees and its black trunk emphasized her whiteness she only turned her head as i came up to her her eyes looked silvergray in the light i couldnt decipher the look on her face it wasnt grief its a beautiful night isnt it i agreed that it was carla are you all right she stared at me terribly calm im feeling much better than i did this afternoon im very glad to hear that did you remember to bring his clothes and a memento she motioned to a dark bundle by the tree good ill unload the car she didnt offer to help which was not unusual most of the time it was fear that prevented it i realized my omega was the only car in sight i called softly but sound carries on summer nights how did you get here i dont see a car i hired a cab its waiting at the gate a cab i would love to have seen the drivers face when he dropped her off at the cemetery gates the three black chickens clucked from their cage in the backseat they didnt have to be black but it was the only color i could get for tonight i was beginning to think our poultry supplier had a sense of humor arthur fiske was only recently dead so from the box in the trunk i took only a jar of homemade ointment and a machete the ointment was pale offwhite with flecks of greenish light in it the glowing flecks were graveyard mold you wouldnt find it in this cemetery it only grew in graveyards that had stood for at least a hundred years the ointment also contained the obligatory spider webs and other noisome things plus herbs and spices to hide the smell and aid the magic if it was magic i smeared the tombstone with it and called carla over its your turn now carla she stubbed out her cigarette and came to stand before me i smeared her face and hands and told her you stand just behind the tombstone throughout the raising she took her place without a word while i placed ointment on myself the pine scent of rosemary for memory cinnamon and cloves for preservation sage for wisdom and lemon thyme to bind it all together seemed to soak through the skin itself i picked the largest chicken and tucked it under my arm carla stood where i had left her staring down at the grave there was an art to beheading a chicken with only two hands i stood at the foot of the grave to kill the chicken its first artery blood splashed onto the grave it splattered over the fading chrysanthemums roses and carnations a spire of white gladioli turned dark i walked a circle sprinkling blood as i went tracing a circle of steel with a bloody machete carla shut her eyes as the blood rained upon her i smeared blood on myself and placed the stilltwitching body upon the flower mound then i stood once again at the foot of the grave we were cut off now inside the blood circle alone with the night and our thoughts carlas eyes flashed white at me as i began the chant hear me arthur fiske i call you from the grave by blood magic and steel i call you arise arthur come to us come to me arthur fiske carla joined me as she was supposed to come to us arthur come to us arthur arthur arise we called his name in everrising voices the flowers shuddered the mound heaved upward and the chicken slid to the side a hand clawed free ghostly pale a second hand and carlas voice failed her she began moving round the gravestone to kneel to the left of the heaving mound there was such wonder even awe in her face as i called arthur fiske from the grave the arms were free the top of a darkhaired head was in sight but the top was almost all there was the mortician had done his best but arthurs had been a closedcasket funeral the right side of his face was gone blasted away clean white bone shone at jaw and skull and silver bits of wire where the bone had been strung together it still wasnt a face the nose was empty holes bare and white the skin was shredded and snipped short to look neater the left eye rolled wildly in the bare socket i could see the tongue moving between the broken teeth arthur fiske struggled from the grave i tried to remain calm it could be a mistake is that arthur her hoarse whisper came to me yes that is not a heart attack no her voice was calm now incredibly normal no i shot him at close range you killed him and had me bring him back arthur was having some trouble freeing his legs and i ran to carla i tried to help her to her feet but she wouldnt move get up get up damn it hell kill you her next words were very quiet if thats what he wants god help me a suicide i forced her to look at me instead of the thing in the grave carla a murdered zombie always kills his murderer first always no forgiveness that is a rule i cant control him until after he has killed you you have to run now she saw me understood i think but said this is the only way to be free of guilt if he forgives me ill be free youll be dead arthur freed himself and was sitting on the crushed earthstrewn flowers it would take him a little while to organize but not too long carla he will kill you there will be no forgiveness her eyes had wandered back to the zombie and i slapped her twice very hard carla you will die out here and for what arthur is dead really dead you dont want to die arthur slid off the flowers and stood uncertainly his eye rolling around in its socket finally spotted us though he didnt have much to show expression with i could see joy on his shattered face there was a twitch of a smile as he shambled toward us and i began dragging her away she didnt fight me but she was a dead awkward weight it is very hard to drag someone away if they dont want to go i let her sink back to the ground i looked at the clumsy but determined zombie and decided to try i stood in front of him blocking him from carla i called upon whatever power i possessed and talked to him arthur fiske hear me listen only to me he stopped moving and stared down at me it was working against all the rules it was working it was carla who spoiled it her voice saying arthur arthur forgive me he was distracted and tried to move toward her voice i stopped him with a hand on his chest arthur i command you do not move i who raised you command you she called one more time that was all he needed he flung me away absentmindedly my head hit the tombstone it wasnt much of a blow no blood like on television but it took everything out of me for a minute i lay in the flowers and it seemed very important to hear myself breathe arthur reached down for her slowly his face twitched and his tongue made small sounds that might have been carla the clumsy hands stroked her hair he halffell halfknelt by her she drew back at that afraid i started crawling over the flowers toward them she was not going to commit suicide with my help the hands stroked her face and she backed away just a few inches the thing crawled after her she backpedaled faster but he came on surprisingly quick he pinned her under his body and she started screaming i halfcrawled halffell across the zombies back the hands crept up her body touching her shoulders her eyes rolled back to me help me i tried i tugged at him trying to pull him off her zombies do not have supernatural strength no matter what the media would like you to think but arthur had been a large muscular man if he could have felt pain i might have pulled him off but there was no real way to distract him anita please the hands settled on her neck and squeezed i found the machete where it had dropped to the ground it was sharp and did damage but he couldnt feel it i chopped at his head and back he ignored me even decapitated he would keep coming his hands were the problem i knelt and sighted at his lower arm i didnt dare try it any closer to her face the blade flashed silver i brought it down with all the strength in my back and arms but it took five blows to break the bone the separated hand kept squeezing as if it were still attached i threw the machete down and began prying one finger at a time from her neck it was time consuming carla stopped struggling i screamed my rage and helplessness at him and kept prying up the fingers the strong hands squeezed until there was a cracking sound not a sharp pencilbreak like a leg or an arm but a crackling as the bones crushed together arthur seemed satisfied he stood up from the body all expression left him he was empty waiting for a command i fell back into the flowers not sure whether to cry or scream or just run i just sat there and shook but i had to do something about the zombie i couldnt just leave him to wander around i tried to tell him to stay but my voice wouldnt come his eye followed me as i stumbled to the car i came back with a handful of salt in the other hand i scooped the fresh grave dirt arthur watched me without expression i stood at the outer edge of the circle i give you back to the earth from which you came i threw the dirt upon him he turned to face me with salt i bind you to your grave the salt sounded like sleet on his suit i made the sign of a cross with the machete with steel i give you back i realized that i had begun the ceremony without getting another chicken i bent and retrieved the dead one and slit it open i drew stillwarm and bloody entrails free they glistened in the moonlight with flesh and blood i command you arthur return to your grave and walk no more he lay down upon the grave it was as if he had lain in quicksand it just swallowed him up with a last shifting of flowers the grave was as before almost i threw the gutted chicken to the ground and knelt beside the womans body her neck flopped at an angle just slightly wrong i got up and shut the trunk of my car the sound seemed to echo too loud wind seemed to roar in the tall trees the leaves rustled and whispered the trees all looked like flat black shadows nothing had any depth to it all noises were too loud the world had become a onedimensional cardboard thing i was in shock it would keep me numb and safe for a little while would i dream about carla tonight would i try to save her again and again i hoped not somewhere up above nighthawks flitted their cries came thin and eerie echoing loud i looked at the body by the grave the whiteness of it stained now with dirt so much for the other half of my fee i got in the car smearing blood over the steering wheel and key there were phone calls to make to my boss to the police and to cancel the rest of my appointments i would be raising no more dead tonight there was a taxi to send away i wondered how much the meter had run up my thoughts ran in dull frightened circles i began to shake hands trembling tears came hot and violent i sobbed and screamed in the privacy of my car when i could breathe without choking and my hand was steady i put the car in gear i would definitely be seeing carla tonight and arthur whats one more nightmare i left carla there alone with arthurs forgiveness one leg lost in the flowers of his grave in beauty like the night by norman partridgenorman partridge is

cemeteries as neighbors partridge says realizing that a nasty little idea began to nibble at the corners of my imagination i couldnt help but wonder what would happen if the dead folks in those cemeteries clawed their way out of their graves and came shuffling across the road to pay us a little visit which sounds to me like the origin of many zombie tales if not this one in particular the beach was deserted somehow they knew enough to stay out of the sun nathan grimes rested his elbows on the balcony and peered through his binoculars as he adjusted the focus knob the smooth feminine mounds that bordered the crescentshaped beach became nets of purslane and morning glory and the green blur that lay beyond sharpened to a crazy quilt of distinct colorsemerald charcoal glimpses of scarleta dark panorama of manchineel trees sea grapes and coconut palms nathan scanned the shadows until he found the goldenbronze color of her skin naked just out of reach of the suns rays she leaned against the gentle curve of a coconut palm curling a strand of singed blonde hair around the single finger that remained on her left hand her fingertip was redwith nail polish not bloodand she thrust it into her mouth and licked both finger and hair finally releasing a spit curl that fought the humid caribbean breeze for a moment and then drooped in defeat kara north miss december nathan remembered meeting kara at the new orleans mansion the previous august shed posed in front of a bountifully trimmed christmas tree for teddy chings centerfold shot and nathanfresh off a plane from the los angeles offices of grimesgirl magazinehad walked in on the proceedings joking that the holiday decorations made him feel like hed done a rip van winkle in the friendly skies nathan smiled at the memory there were several elegantly wrapped packages under the tree that august day but each one was empty just a prop for teddys photo shoot kara had discovered that sad fact almost immediately and theyd all had a good laugh about her mercenary attitude while teddy shot her with a little red santa cap on her head and sassy red stockings on her feet and nothing but goldenbronze flesh in between empty boxes nathan shook his head hed seen the hunger in karas eyes when the shoot was over a quick study that one right off shed known that he alone could fill those boxes in a fingersnap and now she knew enough to stay out of the sun they all did nathan had been watching them for two days ever since the morning after the accident he wasnt worried about them breaking into the house for his caribbean sanctuary was a moorish palace surrounded by high brokenbottleencrusted walls that were intended to fend off everyone from prying paparazzi to antiporn assassins no the thing that worried him about the dead grimesgirls was that they didnt act at all like the zombies hed seen on television most of those miserable gutbuckets had crawled out of the grave and werent very mobile in fact nathan couldnt remember seeing any zombies on the tube that bore much of a resemblance to their living brethren but that could simply be chalked up to the journalistic penchant for photographing the most grotesque members of any enemy group it was an old trick just as theyd focused attention on the most outrageous members of the sds and the black panthers in order to turn viewers against those groups way back when in the sixties the media would now focus on the most bizarre specimens of this current uprising uprising it was an odd word to chooseonce such a hopeful word for nathans generationbut it seemed somehow appropriate now stirring images not of demonstration but of reanimation cemeteries pitted with open graves shrouds blowing across empty boulevards midnight glimpses of a shadow army driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh nathan wondered what the network anchors would make of kara north all theories about media manipulation aside he doubted that there were many other suntanned zombies besides last years miss december stateside the victims of an accident such as the one that had occurred on grimes island would have been devoured by predator zombies before reanimation could occur that hadnt happened here because there werent any predator zombies on the island when kara and the others had perished so something different had happened here maybe something that hadnt happened before anywhere kara raised her good hand in what might have been a feeble wave freaks nathan whispered unable to fight off his signature wry smile zombie freaks he set down the binocularsan expensive german product for nathan grimes demanded the best in everythingand picked up his pistol a heckler koch pm also german also expensive the sun inched lower in the sky the waves became silver mirrors glinting in nathans eyes he put on sunglasses and the glare flattened to a soft pearly glow as the horizon melted electric blue and the shadows thickened beneath the coconut palms kara north miss december shambled toward the glassencrusted walls of nathans beachfront palace again she curled a lock of blonde hair around her finger again she sucked the burned strands wet strange that she could focus on her hair and ignore her mutilated hand nathan thought as he loaded the heckler his gut told him that her behavior was more than simple instinct and he wondered just how far her intelligence extended did she know that she was dead was she capable of posing such a question could she think the curl drooped uncoiled and again kara went to sucking it nathan remembered a christmas that had come in august complete with the holiday smells of hot buttered rum and monterey pine the sounds of the airconditioner running on high cool and seasoned oak crackling in the fireplace he recalled karas dreams and the way she kissed and her red nails slashing through wrapping paper as she opened gifts hed originally intended for ronnie and then when he was fully ready to surrender to his memories the shifting july winds brushed back across grimes island carrying the very real stink of scorched metal and charred rubber the scent of destruction nathan covered his nose and raised the pistol two days ago nathan had the situation under control certainly considering the circumstances the arrangements for evacuating the grimesgirls from the united states had been maddening certainly such arrangements would have been completely impossible if nathan hadnt had the luxury of satellite communications but such perks went hand in hand with network ownership two days ago he was in short a completely satisfied man after all the foresight which some had dubbed paranoia was paying off and his contingency plan to end all contingency plans was taking shape he had his own island fortress adequate provisions and a plan to sit out the current difficulties in the company of twelve beautiful centerfold models so two days ago he didnt worry as the hands of his rolex crossed past the appointed hour of the grimesgirls arrival for the dangerous part of the evacuation operation had already been carried out with military precision in rapid succession a trio of bell jetranger choppers had touched down on the roof of the new orleans mansion and the grimesgirls had been transported without incident to a suburban airfield where a private security force was guarding nathans gulfstream iv needless to say takeoff had been immediate of course the operation was costly but nathan considered it a wise investment he expected that there would be a real shortage of attractive female flesh by the time the government got things under control the public as always would have an immediate need for his services and he figured that the people he laughingly referred to as his readers wouldnt mind looking at last seasons models at least until the competition got into gear if there was any competition left nathan got himself a tequilahalf listening for the gulfstream half watching the latest parade of gutbuckets on cnnand soon he was imagining his chief competitors as walking corpses one with gold chains circling his broken neck and an expensive toupee covering the gnaw marks on his skull the other with his trademark pipe jammed between rotted lips gasping unable to fill his lungs with enough oxygen to kindle a blaze in the tarstained brier nathan grinned certain that hed never suffer such a humiliating end he was a survivor he had plans and he would get started on them right now while he waited he found a yellow legal pad and started brainstorming titles grimesgirls our island year no too much fun in that one grimesgirls from hell to paradise better hed have to search for the right tone to stifle those who would accuse him of exploitation and teddy chings pictures would have to match hopefully teddy had shot lots of nice stuff during the evacuationdecaying faces mashed against the windows of the mansion the french quarter streets clogged with zombiesshots that stank of danger pictures like that would make a perfect contrast to the spreads theyd do on the island grimesgirls national treasures saved nathan stared at what hed written and smiled patriotic proud words as pretty as dollar signs wind from the open door caught the paper and nathan trapped it against the table for the first time he noticed the darkness the suffocating gray shroud that had come long before sunset the plane was horribly late hed been so caught up in planning the magazine that hed lost track of time jesus the gulfstream could be trapped inside the storm fighting it low on fuel the storm rustled over the coconut palms with a sound like a giant broom sweeping the island clean rainwater guttered off the tile roof it was only five oclock but the darkness seemed impenetrable nathan sent buck and pablo to the landing strip armed with flares he put on a coat and paced on the balcony of his suite until the thrashing sounds of the approaching gulfstream drove him inside he stared into the darkness imagining that it was as thick as pudding and he was truly startled when the explosion bloomed in the distance ronnie miss october three years past tried to embrace him but he pushed her away and rushed from the room it was much later after the rain had diminished to a drizzling mist that he stepped outside and smelled the wreck for the first time buck and pablo didnt return the night passed and then the morning nathan didnt go looking for the boys he was afraid that they might be looking for him he hid his pistol and the keys to his jeep and he slapped ronnie when she called him a coward after that she was quiet and when shed been quiet for a very long time he played at being magnanimous he opened the wall safe and left her alone with a peace offering downstairs he hid the yellow legal pad in a desk drawer that he rarely opened he closed the drawer carefully slowly without a sound that was how it began two days ago on grimes island since then the living had moved quietly listening for the footsteps of the dead the heckler was warm and as nathan reloaded it he wished that his talents as a marksman were worthy of such a fine weapon he set the pistol on his dresser and went downstairs fighting the memory of the purplegray mess that kara norths forehead had become when one of his shotsthe fifth or the sixthfinally found the mark that wasnt the way he wanted to remember her he wanted to remember miss december no gunshots only teddys camera clicking no blood only a red santa cap sassy red socks and nothing but goldenbronze flesh in between nathan took a bottle of cuervo gold from beneath the bar when it came to tequila he preferred chinaco but hed finished the last bottle on the night of the crash and now the cheaper brand would have to do i saw what you did ronnie confronted him the way a paperback detective would sliding the heckler across the mahogany bar marring the wood with a long ugly scratch you should have asked kara in for a drink made it a little easier on the poor girl that was a damn rude way to say goodbye nate nathan filled a glass with ice refusing to meet ronnies patented withering stare but that didnt stop her words she looked so cute too worshiping you from a distance with those big blue eyes of hers did you see the way she tried to curl her hair ronnie clicked her tongue against her teeth its a shame what a little humidity can do to a really nice coiffure nathan said nothing slicing a lime now and ronnie giggled strong and silent huh cmon nate youre the one who blew off the top of her head tell me how it felt nathan stared at the tip of ronnies nose avoiding her eyes once shed been an autumnal vision with hair the color of fallen leaves miss october shed had the look of practiced ease skin the color of brandy and large chocolate eyes that made every man in america long for a cold night but nathan had learned all too well the october power of those eyes the way they could chill a man with a single frosty glance he pocketed the heckler hed have to be more careful about leaving the gun where she could get at it coke freaks could get crazy he poured cuervo gold into his glass and then drank pretending that the only thing bothering him was the quality of the tequila then he risked a quick glance at her eyes still chocolatebrown but now sticky with a yellow sheen that even teddy ching couldnt airbrush away ronnie picked up a cocktail napkin and shredded its corners why her whyd you shoot kara and not the others she was the first one that came into range nathan swirled his drink with a swizzle stick shaped like the cartoon grimesgirl that ran on the last page of every issue it was weird when i looked into karas eyes i had the feeling that she was relieved to see me relieved then i raised the gun and it was as if she suddenly realized ronnie tore the napkin in half then quarters they dont realize nate they dont think theyre not like those things on tv ronnie you noticed the way she looked at me christ she actually waved at me today im not saying that theyre geniuses but theres something there something i dont like bits of purple paper dotted the mahogany bar ronnie fingered them one by one lazily reassembling the napkin nathan sensed her disapproval he knew that she wanted him to strap on his pistol and go gunning for the grimesgirls as if he were lee van cleef in some outr√© spaghetti western look ronnie its not like theyre acting normal beating down our walls like the things on tv do we just have to be a little careful is all there are eleven of them now and sooner or later theyll all wander close to the gate the same way that kara did then i can nail them with no problem and then we can go out again itll be safe dont be so sure he made the mistake of sighing and her voice rose angrily they didnt fly in by themselves you know there was a pilot a copilot maybe even a few guards and teddy thats at least five or six more people now it was her turn to sigh not to mention buck and pablo you might be right but who knows the others might be so crippled up that they cant get over to this side of the island fast or at all or they could have been incinerated in the explosion maybe thats what happened to buck and pablo nathan looked at her not wanting to say that the boys might have been someones dinner and she pursed her lips which was a hard thing for her to do because they were full and pouty hell maybe the boys got away he said realizing that he was grasping at straws took a boat or something i cant see the docks from here so i cant be sure it could be that they reasoned with the girls tricked them somehow are you really saying that zombies can think thats crazy if theyre dead theyre hungry thats itthats what they say on tv and kara north sucking a little spit curl doesnt convince me otherwise nathan cut another slice of lime and sucked it appreciating the sharp tang it was the last lime on the island and he was determined to enjoy it maybe the whole thing has something to do with the crash he said taking another tack i cant figure it i saw the explosion but all the girls seem to be in pretty good shape kara was missing a few fingers and her hair was singed and a few of the others are kind of wracked up but none of them is badly burned like youd expect we could drive out to the plane and see what happened for ourselves ronnie offered they cant catch us in the jeep she touched his hand lightly tentatively we might be able to salvage some stuff from the wreck someone might have had a rifle maybe even one with a scope and that would be a much better weapon than your pistol nathan considered her argument then jerked his hand away as soon as he realized what lay behind it who was bringing it in for you cmon ronnie you know what im talking about who was your mule this trip she tried to look hurt did a good job of it you think youre quite a detective dont you well round up the usual suspects ronnies a coke freak waiting on a mule buck and pablo pulled a houdini or maybe they had a powwow with kara and her pals the worlds first intellectual gutbuckets cmon nate put it together for me but do it before those things out there turn nasty and come after us she grabbed the remnants of the napkin and flung purple confetti at his face wake up boss the partys over me youve got figured but them theyre dead and theyre hungry and thats that she let the words hang there for a minute then she rose and walked to the stairs gracefully like brandy pouring from a bottle with fluid elegance he thought wryly he watched her calves flex enjoyed the way she swung her ass for him eagerly he ran his thumb over the little plastic breasts on the cartooninspired swizzle stick me youve got figured she did the measured overtheshoulder glance that shed used three years ago in her grimesgirl centerfold then turned and ran long fingers over her naked breasts along her narrow hips nathans thumb traveled over the cute swizzlestick ass he pressed down without realizing it and the plastic snapped in two ronnie laughed climbing the stairs not looking back after hed come nathan kicked off the satin sheets and opened the wall safe he cut three lines on a vanity mirror and presented them to ronnie then hurried downstairs because he hated the sound of her snorting in the kitchen he popped open a pepsi and took a box of banquet fried chicken out of the freezer he chose two breasts and three thighs placed them on a sheet of reynolds wrap and fired the oven while he waited for the chicken he turned on the television and fiddled with the satellite controls until he found something besides snow immediately he recognized the capitol dome in the upper righthand corner of the screen just below the cnn logo it was a favorite camera setup of washington correspondents but there was no reporter standing in frame there wasnt a voiceover either a gutbucket in a hospital gown staggered into view then lurched away from the light another followed this one naked fleshless nathan watched fascinated it was only a matter of time before one of the zombies knocked over the camera or smashed the lights why didnt the network cut away he couldnt figure it out unless hed tuned in some kind of study unless the camera had been set up to record the zombies bolted down protected that kind of thing but to send it out on the satellite it didnt make any sense then nathan remembered that all satellite broadcasts werent intended for public consumption he might be picking up a direct feed to cnn instead of a broadcast from cnn in the past hed enjoyed searching for just such feeds with his satellite dishon a location to network feed you could pick up all the nasty remarks that reporters made about the government gobbledygook they fed to the american public and you could find out what really went on during the commercial breaks at any number of live events nathan stared at the cnn logo superimposed in the corner of the screen was that added at the network or would a technician in a mobile unit add it from location he wished he knew enough about the technical end of broadcasting to decide he switched channels searching for another broadcast when he was sure hed exhausted all possibilities he tried to return to the cnn transmission he couldnt find it it wasnt there anymore a blank hiss filled the room nathan hit the mute button on the remote control a few minutes passed before he noticed the burning chicken but he couldnt bring himself to do anything about it didnt want to look at it images coiled like angry snakes in his mind ready to strike ready to poison him the explosion the fleshless zombie on tv kara norths mutilated hand the snakes struck and nathan lurched to the sink and vomited pepsi first he heard her shouts and he was up off the couch and almost to the stairs before he remembered that hed left the gun on the kitchen sink he pivoted too quickly at the foot of the stairway lurched against the wall and then ran to the gun ronnies insistent cries still filling his ears he returned to the staircase just as she began her descent he was calling me she said her eyes wild unfocused outside i heard him i went out onto the balcony but i couldnt see but i talked to him and he answered me christ weve got to let him in you mean someones alive out there ronnie nodded naked shivering her hair a sweaty tangle nathan didnt like what he saw any better than what hed heard maybe she was just strung out maybe shed been dreaming sure one of the gutbuckets had pounded on the gate and shed imagined the rest or maybe someone had indeed survived the crash were not opening up until i check things out nathan said just stay here dont move he squeezed her shoulders to reinforce the order upstairs he punched several buttons on the bedroom wall before stepping onto the balcony deadwhite light spilled across the compound glittering eerily over the glassencrusted walls and illuminating the beach a man wearing a blue uniform stood near the gate either the pilot or the copilot his complexion was sallow in the artificial light and his chin was bruised a deep purple he stared up at nathan and his brow creased as if he hadnt expected to see nathan at all the pilots mouth opened in the distance a wave washed over the beach ronnie ive come to see ronnie jesus nathan lowered the heckler what happened out there the explosion how did you ronnie ronnie ive come to see ron neeeee ive come the muscles in nathans forearms quivered in revulsion he forced himself to raise the heckler and aim he fired missed muddy gray eyes stared into the frosty light wide frantic the thing waved its hands wildly signaling nathan to stop he fired again but the shot whizzed over the zombies shoulder hurriedly it backed off ripping at its coat and the sweatstained shirt beneath nathans third shot clipped the things ear just as it ripped open its shirt im expected it screeched expected and ive come to see nathan swore stunned by the sight of a halfdozen plastic bags filled with cocaine secured to the zombies chest with strips of medical tape ronnies mule two days dead and still trying to complete its deal the thing moved forward it was smiling now sure that nathan finally understood nathan took aimnathan stopbut black lights exploded in his head before he could squeeze off another shot youre crazy nathan he hit the balcony floor cutting his left eyebrow on the uneven tile and his mind had barely processed that information and recognized ronnies voice when he realized that the heckler was being pried from his fingers hes alive and you tried to kill him he tried to rise and this time he glimpsed the heavy german binoculars arcing towards him he had just managed to close his eyes when the binoculars smashed into his bloody brow screaming god she was screaming she must have realized the truth nathan struggled to his feet just as ronnies cries were punctuated by gunshots he leaned against the balcony and tried to focus on what was happening on the beach but they werent on the beach the big gate stood open and the dead pilot was inside the compound backing ronnie across a patch of stunted grass she fired the heckler and cocaine puffed from one of the packets taped to the things chest she got off three more shots that destroyed the zombies left shoulder its left arm came loose slithered through its shirtsleeve and dropped silently to the grass the thing stared down at its severed limb confused by the sudden amputation ronnie retreated under the jutting balcony the zombie followed her into the house nathan stumbled through the bedroom doorway ronnie wasnt screaming anymore that sound had been replaced by subtler but no less horrifying noises the heckler clicking empty the zombie whispering ronnies name dizzily nathan reached the top of the stairway just as ronnie mounted the first stair he tried to grab her but the pilot got hold of her first and tugged her away it stared at her for a moment still pleading as if it only wanted her to take delivery but as it pulled her closer its expression changed its nostrils flared it pushed her down onto the stairs and held her there its mouth widened but no words were left there its eyes were wild suddenly gleaming hungry dry teeth clamped ronnies left breast she squealed and pulled away but the thing punched its fingers through her left thigh holding her down an urge had been triggered and suddenly the gutbucket was insatiable its teeth ripped ronnies flesh it swallowed without chewing it was a shark in the grip of a feeding frenzy nathan backed away staring at the zombie glancing at the empty pistol on the hallway floor another gutbucket shambled forward from the shadowy bar this one had something in its hand a machete and nathan was suddenly glad that he was going to die because he didnt think he could bear living in a world where you couldnt tell the living from the dead where fucking corpses could talk could remember could fool you right up to the moment when they started to bite and tear and swallow the rusty machete cleaved the pilots head from his shoulders the dead thing collapsed on top of ronnie the holder of the machete stared up at him and nathan froze like a deer trapped by a pair of headlights christ boss dont worry im alive buck taylor said and then he went to close the gate buck said he couldnt eat or drink so soon after cleaning up the remains of ronnie and the gutbucket pilot instead he talked nathan tried not to drink too much cuervo gold tried to listen but his thoughts turned inexorably to the puzzle of the pilots strange behavior so the storm was coming down in buckets splattering every damn inch of soil pablo was drinking coffee and id had so much that i just had to take a piss but it was really coming down the rusty machete lay before buck on the oak tabletop his fingers danced over the blade as he spoke he had once been a center for the raidersgood old number had never missed a game in seven seasons of playbut nathan couldnt imagine that hed ever looked this bad not even after the most desperate contest imaginable his bald pate was knotted with bruises and every time he touched them he looked wistful like he was wishing hed had a helmet so i hacked my way into the forest and got under a tree that kind with leaves like big pancakes and i started to piss and just then i heard the engines holy christ i got zipped up quick and the twin sixes on bucks football jersey were smeared with slimy black stains there was a primitive splint on his left arm held in place with strips torn from a silverandblack bandana the massive biceps swelling between the damp strips of wood was an ugly color much worse than the bluegreen of a natural bruise it reminded nathan of rotten cantaloupe a sickly gray color and the smell coming from the other side of the table was pissed all over my leg i aint ashamed to say it because the left wing tore off just then and i thought i was dead for sure with the plane heading straight for me so i dived quickly the pilot had been able to think quickly hed ripped off his shirt to show nathan the cocaine hed gotten ronnie to open the gate and even though hed lost an arm to ronnies gunfire hed acted as if he believed that he was still alive until he got close to her the first live human hed encountered since reanimating that confrontation had triggered his horrible second thoughts but there wasnt time the broken wing flipped around in midair like a piece of balsa wood no telling where it was gonna end up then the stream slammed sideways into a big stand of palm trees that bounced it right back onto the landing strip it rolled and the other wing twisted off and the wing that was still in the air came down on the machete bucks fingers did nathan watched them and he slid away from the table eased away from number i could see pablo in the van even through the storm i saw him trying to find a place to set his coffee and then the wing hit the van and the damn thing just exploded so the van had exploded that was why the zombies hadnt been burned the plane hadnt even caught fireits fuel tanks were probably near empty after fighting the storm but the van had had a full tank im ashamed about that but there was really nothing i could do the fire was so intense even the zombies didnt go near it and by the time it burned itself out there wasnt anything left of the van or pablo nathans fingers closed around the pistol he remembered the pilot ripping open his shirt he remembered the pilot grabbing ronnie the momentary confusion in his muddy eyes the excited gleam as he surrendered to the feeding frenzy buck was in control now surely he was but what would happen when he came close to his boss nathan raised the heckler buck grinned like he didnt quite understand nathan looked at bucks wounds at the untouched glass of beer in front of him good old number wasnt drinking and he hadnt wanted any fried chicken maybe he didnt want fried chicken anymore maybe he didnt realize that yet just like he didnt remember what had killed him buck i want you to go back outside back out with them nathan said speaking as he would speak to a child you see risking temptation is the dangerous part itll make you lose whats left of your mind boss are you okay maybe you should get some sleep stop thinking about ronnie for a while maybe you should oh they were smart getting smarter every minute you cant fool me buck you can fool yourself but you cant fool me nathan aimed and buck jolted backward out of his chair scrambling now the first bullet exploded his left biceps shattering the makeshift splint as it exited but buck didnt slow because football instincts die hard he sprang to his feet tucked his head and charged across the kitchen his eyes shone with vitality but nathan was certain that it was the vitality of death not life buck launched himself in a flying tackle and together they crashed to the floor nathan raised the heckler and buck couldnt fight him off because the wound in his left arm was too severe so he fought back the only way he could he bit nathans shoulder set his teeth and tore nathan screamed white blotches of pain danced before his eyes nathans finger tightened on the trigger a bullet shattered the skull of good old number nathan saw it this way the crash had killed them instantly all of them and when they opened their eyes they found themselves on grimes island just where they were supposed to be and they imagined themselves survivors they wandered through the lush forest across the coral beaches finding nothing to tempt them nothing to trigger the horrible hunger trapped in a transition period between death and rebirth they retained different levels of intelligence but were limited by overwhelming instincts instinctively they knew enough to stay out of the sun it was a simple matter of selfpreservation for the tropical sun could speed their decay the instinct to devour the living was strong in them as well but only when they were exposed to temptation nathan was sure of that after his experiences with buck and the pilot he was also certain that as long as temptation was absent up to the very point that the feeding frenzy took control the dead of grimes island could still function at a level that separated them from the gutbuckets oh they functioned at different sublevels as hed seen with kara north the pilot and buck but in some cases they functioned just as well as the living perhaps something in human flesh once devoured triggered the change in behavior maybe something in the blood or perhaps it was the very act of cannibalism nathan didnt know the cause didnt much care his wounded shoulder was scarletpurple and swollen five days had passed since buck had attacked him and he couldnt decide if the bite was worse or better just to be safe hed injected himself with antibiotics but he didnt know if his first aid made the slightest difference he didnt know if he was alive or dead or somewhere in between to clarify his thoughts he noted his symptoms on the legal pad hed hidden in his desk after the plane crash many were perplexing he wished that he could consult with a scientist or a doctor but his first attempt at stateside communications had proved fruitless and soon he was afraid to communicate with anyone he didnt relish the idea of ending up as a science project in some lab and he didnt want an extermination squad invading grimes island either the thing that bothered him most was that his heart was still beating he couldnt understand how that was possible until he remembered that bucks heart had been beating when hed shot himnathan had felt it pounding against his own chest as they wrestled on the floorand he was certain that buck had been dead looking at his wounded shoulder remembering the fire in bucks eyes when hed attacked nathan was positive of that there were other symptoms as well he couldnt eat every evening he cooked some fried chicken even though the smell made him gag and the oily feel of it made him shiver last night hed forced himself to eat two breasts and a thigh and hed spent the next five hours coiled in a cramped ball on the kitchen floor before finally surrendering to the urge to vomit and he couldnt keep down pepsi or jose cuervo either the cuervo gold was especially bad it burned his throat and made him miserable for hours he did suck ice cubes but only to keep his throat comfortable and hed started snorting the cocaine that ronnies mule had brought in but only because he was afraid to sleep cocaine maybe that was the problem they said that cocaine killed the appetite didnt they and hed started using the stuff at about the same time that hed stopped eating but five days without food god that was a long time so it had to be more than just the cocaine didnt it he closed his eyes and thought about hunger about food he tried to picture the most appetizing banquet imaginable nothing came to him for the longest time then he saw kara norths mangled hand the pilots severed arm bucks ruined head his gut roiled he opened his eyes the facts seemed irrefutable but somehow nathan couldnt bring himself to leave the compound or conversely let the grimesgirls enter they were on the beach every night enjoying themselves tempting him miss november and miss february sang love songs serenading nathan from the wrong side of the glassencrusted walls he watched them smiling his wry smile on the outside inside despising his cowardice he was bored but he didnt risk watching television either if the networks had returned to the airwaves he would certainly find himself looking straight into the eyes of living breathing people and while he seriously doubted that such a stimulus could trigger the feeding frenzy he didnt want to expose himself just to be on the safe side he didnt want to lose what he had so he snorted cocaine and wrote during the day at night he watched them they all came to the beach now even teddy ching he had no legs thats why hed taken so long to cross the island but teddy didnt let that stop him he dragged himself along eagerly pursuing the grimesgirls his exposed spine wiggling as happily and uncontrollably as a puppys tail three cameras were strung around his neck and he often propped himself against the base of a manchineel tree and photographed the girls as they frolicked on the beach below more than anything nathan wished that he could develop those pictures his grimesgirls were still beautiful miss july her stomach so firm so empty above a perfect heartshaped trim miss may her skinless forehead camouflaged with a wreath of bougainvillea and orchids the rounded breasts of miss april sunset bruised and shadowed the nipples so swollen the sunken yellow hollows beneath miss augusts eyes hot dry circles twin suns peering from her face with all the power of that wonderful month twin suns in the middle of the night she walks in beauty like the night in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all thats best of dark and bright and all thats best of dark and bright nathan couldnt remember the rest of it he wrote the words on his yellow pad over and over but he couldnt remember he closed his eyes and when he opened them the sea was hard with the flat light of morning he hurried inside long before the sunshine kissed the balcony the beach was deserted prairie by brian evensonbrian evenson is the author of the books altmanns tongue contagion dark property and father of lies among others in his collection the wavering knife won the

after being shipwrecked and werner herzogs movie aguirre the wrath of god which evenson says has a brilliant mad ending he says he was interested too in thinking about how certain places seem to have a dark but magical quality to them how zombies entered into it is a mystery however i early evening still distant from the prairie we encountered a man with skin flayed halffree of his back he allowed us to inspect that portion of him and we saw the underskin purpled and creased with folds that in their convolution resembled the human brain the runds off his back he had tanned and twisted into a belt which he wore and which our captain tried unsuccessfully to purchase of him when our physician inquired after the particulars of his persecutor the man answered by unfurling from his rucksack a flapping sheet of skin with a large and hardened callous aswash at one end of it which upon formal inspection proved an empty flavid face ii our paroch of late has taken to baptizing all we encounter tallying their particulars on wound scrolls before they are slaughtered as we walk he counts the names phrases aloud before us the petitions he will employ before the church as spreading forth his lists of converts he renders plea for sainthood iii the air is fumid choking near midday we were greeted by a man who made claim to raise the dead our captain bared his weapon and lopped the head from rusk with whom he has been at odds throughout the voyage and then bade the man have at his task the selfappointed jesus sewed rusks head back onto the frame and then with shaking fingers uttered his shallow pronouncements after ample wait the captain ordered this fellows head struck from his shoulders as well we carried the heads spikeshafted and passed onward nearing the prairie they began to mumble at which we sandsunk their shafts abandoned them iv we have reached the prairie the dead progressing in droves through shackle and quaking grass we captured one and he was drawn forth with little struggle falling nearly insensate once raised from the ground his flesh was dark and stinking we examined his armature the way his mouth had been resewn and mandibled avelling the membrane lining the chest we found the internal organs neatly removed the lower orifices stoppered with a sleight pressure of his palm our physician sloughed away the skin that remnanted to the skull then exposed the upper portion of the braincase by means of a racksaw the brain had been removed the emptied interior case showing in its blotchwork signs of siriasis or as it is commonly called sideration our physician made severe notes and when done asked for the sake of experiment that the body be released we lowered it to the earth and watched it come animate stumble away v during the night latour harnessed a dead woman for we have been long on the road devoid of resilience she came too rapidly asunder beneath his hips even with eyes gritted shut he could gain no satisfaction the paroch refused his confession vi at times one discovers the living hidden among the dead the which can be discerned by the color manifest in their flesh the sentience of their regard they crouch to the center of a drove allowing the dead to sweep them along one we managed to capture when he made pretense of death the physician pierced him with his instruments until the man could not but grow bloody and roar we jointed his limbs packed them in salt his eyes shuttered and then opened again his torso regaining a torpid motion we watched his body struggle out and away from us his boxed limbs thumped against the lid grinding the salt vii we have consumed the remaining provisions we eat the living when we ferret them out and have eaten the horses as well still the prairie continues without cease the dead prove too festered and rizzared to consume instead we encircle them and employ them as mounts we tie them by twos front to back and lop free the heads sitting on the planed necks and shoulders we goad them to motion by prodding the forward remnant of the brains root viii the prairie is subdued in dust and sand footing given way the dead are sparser and often balsamated their armature careful and fresh there is no sign of who has prepared them this morning we saw approaching at some distance a lone figure with a purposiveness that proved him still alive when he came closer he was seen to be slung with a large sack groaning beneath its weight he attempted flight but mounted athwart the dead we soon rode him down dropping the sack he murdered latour and broch before being killed himself we struck a fire and ate what we could of the newly dead then slit back the sack inside were two gray and curled women who stumbled away when released we rode them down and coupled them severally later we directed their movement by ropes slung about their necks later still we ate their fleshly portions ix there is no water no matter how deep we dig all provision is gone the dead here shot through with venom so that upon consuming them we die ourselves our paroch is mad and wandering our physician is dead and all the others dead too but for five of us the physician pursues us with a sentience we have hitherto disallowed the dead we awoke last morning to find him astraddle the captain whom he had killed consuming the fellows face we dragged the physician off breaking his legs and plucking free his eyes to hinder further pursuit on his behalf we broke the captains legs as well there is some discouragement among the men who remain yet i have urged them to push forward and for the instant they comply x this midday a glister at some distance and the movement of far figures like lice we rode forward and found there what i must deem a templature for preparing the corpse hastily abandoned the heaped organs on its surface still spongy with blood i have examined the apparatus at length but can make nothing of it nor of its functioning though it has in my awkwardness contrived to lay bare my palm to the bone the others seeing my fate destroyed the device before i could query it further xi my injured palm swells i am without water food save myself the remainder of the party have returned hoping to reach the edge of the prairie before dying i have opted to continue hoping to strive to the center and whatever is established there if center there be there is no satisfaction anywhere i wander among the dead awaiting the moment when i shall pass imperceptibly from the stumbling of the living into the stumbling of the dead avaunt everything is better with zombies by hannah wolf bowenhannah wolf bowens fiction has appeared in lady churchills rosebud wristlet polyphony fantasy magazine strange horizons abyss apex ideomancer the fortean bureau and alchemy she is also currently one of the fiction editors of chiaroscuro a webzine devoted to dark fiction everything is better with zombies began as a joke i had a list of things that everything was better with bowen says monkeys was on the list also pirates one day in the summer of i was in a chatroom with several writer friends and i said for reasons not clear to me now everything is better with zombies and then thought hmm one of those writer friends i believe challenged me to make a story out of it and so i did the story deals with the idea of loyalty and with the question of what you do when what seems like the loyal faithful thing conflicts with whats the right thing for you but when it came to researching the story bowen just googled a bunch of zombie facts and played a lot of resident evil everything would be better with zombies take my junior high school graduation everything would have been better if zombies had shuffled in to pomp and circumstance they would have lurched into the gym devoured the principals brains and shuffled out again there were no zombies at graduation we walked in line we took our seats living dead ive long suspected that i might be a zombie if i were a zombie how would i know i study scary and notscary movies i read books i play the relevant video games until my thumbs ache and my eyes grow tired and dry my best friend lionel says that he would know youd walk he says and demonstrates shambling gait and arms draped in the air he lists left which helps to make it work but lions walked badly for a while now hes not doing it for effect and youd go braaains and everyone would run away lion scowls and sits down beside me on the crumbly step he picks at the grass growing up through the cracks he would be out of luck if it came to running from the zombies besides hes described half the town if i were a zombie i dont believe lion would know there are lots of ways to end up with a zombie you can start with a dead person or you can start with a live one or you can start with a live one and turn him undead thats part of what makes it so confusing i know what a zombie is supposed to be like but i could be wrong i spend my days reading up at the library instead of packing for the move late afternoon i ride my bike past the stoplight to the hardware store where lion works he fetches his bike from the alley and we pedal not talking up the road across the tracks and out of town if we lived other than where we do maybe we could explore turn left instead of right ride a little further than ever before or keep going through the cornfield thats grown up tall bumpitybump to the other side with the wind around us like the sea but we live where we live and we have all our lives up until now and the other side of the cornfield looks a lot like this one so we stand on the pedals and creak up salt hill then over the spraypainted bridge to graveltopped strawberry road which curves sharp to the left and down and if youre not careful youll fly off into the air with the creek down below i almost did the first times that we came this way and then some other times later when i thought i knew how to ride it but was wrong i have it now i lean and the bike swings left beneath me and lion yells but his words are shredded by the wind i coast all the way down to the cemetery and there i stop you can make a zombie with a disease you can make a zombie with a potion you can make a zombie with the right chants and voodoo charms you may be able to make a zombie in other ways too its hard to be sure what we can be sure of is that some of the graves in the cemetery arent as neat as they ought to be the town isnt all that big youd expect that wed know everyone and youd be right but sometimes we find headstones we havent found before and lion lingers to read them over and over aloud i head down to the creek because the cemetery is a lot like the town and barring unexpected headstones i know every corner by heart so i sit on the muddy bank on a rock or on a fallen log and listen to the creek go splishsplashity by i see the footprint there im still studying it when lion comes up muttering emily fitzhugh towhats that he spots the footprint right away its hard to miss the water is edged in mud speckled with raccoon fingerprints but this print is in a smooth empty spot and clear as if id stamped it there just now one left footprint deeper at the ball of the foot and the toes like she stepped down from the grassy treeshaded bank dropped and sank pushed off against the yielding muck and landed her right foot in the creek or on a stepping stone not me i say do you think its emily but my name is emily too lion gives me a hand up long chilly fingers wrapping my wrist i kick off my sneakers and pick my way through the mud to the stepping stones cool and rough beneath my toes i crouch down teetering to examine the others ahead theres another print imperfect rubber stamp in need of ink and on the far bank grass a smudge of mud on a flattened dandelion i stand and wave to lion she went this way you dont know that shes a zombie lion says as we walk our bikes back up salt hill the side that sweeps down to the cemetery is steep and weve no momentum to carry us up instead well trudge to the top of the hill and remount there she could be a ghoul or a ghost or a skeleton we couldve made her up you saw the footprint i remind him we didnt make her up wed followed the trail to the highway wed paced along the shoulder searching for the spot where shed stepped back off the road we hadnt found anything but even lion had agreed that the print by the creek was beautifully clear and if shed been a skeleton it would have just been bone and ghosts wouldnt leave any prints at all they might lion says if they were acting out their deaths i shrug but a ghoul you dont know shes a zombie you dont know shes dead at all i blink up at lion and into the sun its sinking now behind the top of the hill though itll be above us still on the way down interrupting is an unlionlike thing to do and hes scowling staring hard ahead and so im thrown yeah i agree at last but what kind of freak goes barefoot in a cemetery lion slants a glance at my sneakers where they hang laces bound to the handlebars i shrug again and he laughs jokes may not be better with zombies the problem about jokes with zombies is that they all have the same punch line it all comes down to brains sometimes i wish the rest of life was more like jokes about zombies but maybe it is lion went up to see his doctors today and so i skip amandas endofthesummer party sit out on the porch and count fireflies and pretend not to hear my dad saying well have to hit the road soon to get me to my moms new place before school starts up there later theres bike tire whir on pavement lion coasts to a stop in the porchlight panting hard i offer him my lemonade and ask what do zombies want with brains maybe theyre jealous but he says it like hes not quite paying attention and its been i guess a notsogood day when youre a zombie he begins do you remember who you were i take my lemonade glass back and set it with a thunk down on the porch steps i fetch my bike and my pack from the side of the house we ride slowly down the street and my pack lies close against my back and even coasting where i can my shirt grows sticky with sweat over the tracks and out of town and up the hill we dont have much momentum lion seems tired we dismount and walk the bikes towards the top youre quiet he says so are you yeah but im always quiet i think i say that if i was a zombie i wouldnt want to remember who i was its not like i could go back i sneak a glance at him through the gloom but this is a new moon night and its dark out here in the way that it never is in town he plows on up the hill throws back when im a zombie will you want to see me lion i start but were at the top of the hill climbing back onto our bikes and i dont know what id meant to say zombies will kill anyone theyll eat anybodys brains it doesnt matter if the brains belong to their dad or their daughter or their best friend i dont know if this means that they dont remember or that they do and if we find the other emily it wont prove anything but ive never seen a zombie before however hard ive looked probably its best to start with one that i dont know lion beats me down the hill he doesnt do that often but tonight hes pushing hard and besides i rode my brakes i leave him alone when i get there dropping my pack to the grass and digging for the flashlight but lion says dont dark pools like water at the base of the hill the creek shivers by and a cricket chirsqueaks and i spook drop the flashlight before i realize that its only lion whos caught my other hand dont do that hes not listening hes staring hard into the night into the shadows under the trees we could see every star if it wasnt cloudy but this is illinois and its always cloudy here when you could use a little light night washes the color out of lions face out of his bright hair and his red shirt he could already be dead if lion were a zombie how would i know someone locks the cemetery gates at night i dont know who it doesnt matter the fence is barely waisthigh and we hop it iron slick under sweaty palms as we lift ourselves across lion steps deftly around headstones that i cant even see i thump a knee twice into stone fall back and follow instead the grass is on the long side of short tended but ambivalently so it hides rocks and holes and things to trip me up i keep one eye on lion one on the ground i reach out as we skirt the headstone where the grey of grass gives way to the grey of turnedover earth and dip the tips of my fingers into the carven e lion i say do you think shes scared he stops abrupt and we almost collide i skip sideways sinking my shoes into the soft heavy soil of emilys grave i imagine the shiver of bodies moving the strong twiggy fingerbone grasp on my ankle but this patch of ground is already disturbed and not only by worms the zombies cant grab you if the zombies have already gone when youre a zombie lion says you shouldnt have to be scared i dont think of lion as scared hes too steady too serious lion my friend hes braver about dead things than anyone i know i guess hed have to be you dont have to run from zombies you just have to walk at a brisk pace and maybe zigzag once in a while you dont have to run to catch them either theyre not that fast but lion isnt waiting or even walking ive never seen him like this this isnt the first time that weve chased a zombie i keep a list in a notebook that lives in my backpack and lion keeps one in his head we cant be sure that every disturbed grave has a zombie in it probably there are ghouls and ghosts and skeletons like he said probably there are vampires possibly there are mummies too youd have to go out of your way to mummify anyone here which isnt to say that it couldnt be done but most of them are zombies if theyre anything at all you can tell from the prints from the shuffling gait you can tell from the town if we were mostly beset by vampires i think wed be paler colder lonelier instead we move slow and try not to think i never thought lion cared hes a smart kid reads a lot might have been skipped up a grade if he hadnt missed so much school but hes never seemed to mind the town or to mind not leaving it he thinks the zombies are kind of neat but hes only ever chased them because i do but tonight im not so much chasing as stumbling along behind as he tracks like a hound we splash through the creek no time for stepping stones or for taking off shoes the bank on the other side is steep the hill above is steeper i grab onto slender trees for balance and to pull myself up i lunge and my right shoelace swings with my stride sticks soggy to my ankle at the top it levels out and opens up the ditch is filled with fireflies and theres the highway empty except when the semis pass swallowing the miles and spitting out exhaust they say it runs clear to colorado two lanes each direction with reflectors in the stripes ive ridden along it going into the city or with lion to see a movie or a band or going to see my moms new place in the city by the new high school thats supposed to be mine ive ridden along it up until now back again this is where we lost her trail before tonight he doesnt pause he lopes across the highway crashing into the cornfield and i lose him hear stalks bending breaking but the wind is in the corn and so am i i stop i can see where the corns been pushed down where lion passed or the zombie girl or a deer i can hear the rattle of the stalks and a weird nocricket stillness and then the wind as it kicks up again i step deeper into the field and flattened stalks crunch underfoot like so many bones id left my backpack in the cemetery i hadnt expected wed just take off like this what would i do if i found the zombie or if the zombie found me i could i think just walk slowly carefully back to town but i have to be sure that i dont get grabbed in this field in the dark i cant know where she is or if shes still here at all something moves off to my left heavier than the wind and i whisper lion because it didnt matter if its the zombie she probably already knows that im here i hold my breath and let it out explosive yelp as lion yells more like a scream ragged and sharp i turn blindly into the corn plow through to the tractor path between fields and lion i yell another creek ahead path of least resistance and you cant see color in the dark but movement yes i run i stop at the top of the bank lion in a heap below and behind me a sound a staggering heavy tread and a retreating break of corn i gather myself to turn to chase and then i dont i couldnt leave lion behind endings may not be better with zombies you cant have a happy ending and zombies both even if the hero survives even if her friends do and lets face it they dont i skid down the bank on stones and loose dirt catching an old tree to halt my slide its cooler down here heat rises fog settles in lowslung spots and lion shivers hands around a twisted ankle dirty face streaked and smudged not that hed admit to tears not that i want him to but i know i cant ask are you okay and so try did you see her instead he doesnt answer he doesnt seem to hear also did she see him she shambled away and left us here i dont know what that means maybe he wasnt the only one who could follow a trail maybe the zombie girl could too then things would change thered be riots martial law boardedup doors and baseball bats id have to stay theyd need me here but thats the other problem about endings with zombies you only win if you cheat you can run away if theres only one you can dodge around two or smash them with a bat but there are never just one or two zombies instead theres three or four or lots shambling in cornfields or down the street and it never really works holing up and hiding out i wouldnt bet against a zombie not on my life only its a long walk back and an ankles a bad thing to hurt and so even if we get that far lion wont be able to bike did she bite you i ask and he shakes his head not yet without any more tears just that sidekicks resolve in his eye i swallow hard i pull him to his feet and i hug him fierce say into his chest im going to miss you zombies pretend to be about how there are worse things than death it isnt true being one is an inbetween state and the way out is pretty much what youd expect zombies are about how there are worse things than life lions taller than i am and heavier still but he leans on my shoulder and limps more than usual until were back by the highway again we know where were going have purpose and brains i think we beat the zombie girl there i break a low branch from a tree at the edge of the fields and lion takes it from my hands its the best that we can do he tries a few practice swings and maybe baseball players know about zombies too you dont drop the bat unless youre going to run but you do run in the end thats how you get away from zombies you back away a couple of steps you say goodbye and then you turn you run you dont look over your shoulder you dont zig because one too many zags puts you back where you began you run because zombies are slow but inevitable and also because theyre right there are worse things than life and zombies are better with everything home delivery by stephen kingstephen king is the bestselling awardwinning author of innumerable classics including the shining carrie cujo and the dead zone each of those books has been adapted to film as have many of kings other novels and stories other projects include editing best american short stories and his recent collaboration on a musical with rocker john mellencamp called ghost brothers of darkland countykings latest novel duma key was published in early a new short fiction collection just after sunset is due out in november although king is probably the worlds foremost horror writer he hasnt frequently explored the subject of zombies in his fiction his recent novel cell however is about zombies and of course theres this story also of possible zombie relevance is kings novel pet sematary if not zombies per se it certainly contains zombielike things this story first appeared in book of the dead as with much of kings fiction it takes place in a small town in maine and using that point of view examines a menacing supernatural horror and as with much of kings fiction it manages to at once be both horrific and affecting considering that it was probably the end of the world maddie pace thought she was doing a good job hell of a good job she thought in fact that she just might be coping with the end of everything better than anyone else on earth and she was positive she was coping better than any other pregnant woman on earth coping maddie pace of all people maddie pace who sometimes couldnt sleep if after a visit from reverend johnson she spied a single speck of dust under the diningroom table maddie pace who as maddie sullivan used to drive her fianc√© jack crazy when she froze over a menu debating entrees sometimes for as long as half an hour maddie why dont you just flip a coin hed asked her once after she had managed to narrow it down to a choice between the braised veal and the lamb chops and then could get no further ive had five bottles of this goddam german beer already and if you dont make up ymind pretty damn quick theres gonna be a drunk lobsterman under the table before we ever get any food on it so she had smiled nervously ordered the braised veal and spent most of the ride home wondering if the chops might not have been tastier and therefore a better bargain despite their slightly higher price shed had no trouble coping with jacks proposal of marriage however shed accepted itand himquickly and with tremendous relief following the death of her father maddie and her mother had lived an aimless cloudy sort of life on little tall island off the coast of maine if i wasnt around to tell them women where to squat and lean against the wheel george sullivan had been fond of saying while in his cups and among his friends at fudgys tavern or in the back room of prouts barber shop i dont know whatn hell theyd do when her father died of a massive coronary maddie was nineteen and minding the town library weekday evenings at a salary of a week her mother minded the houseor did that was when george reminded her sometimes with a good hard shot to the ear that she had a house which needed minding when the news of his death came the two women had looked at each other with silent panicky dismay two pairs of eyes asking the same question what do we do now neither of them knew but they both feltfelt stronglythat he had been right in his assessment of them they needed him they were just women and they needed him to tell them not just what to do but how to do it as well they didnt speak of it because it embarrassed them but there it wasthey hadnt the slightest clue as to what came next and the idea that they were prisoners of george sullivans narrow ideas and expectations did not so much as cross their minds they were not stupid women either of them but they were island women money wasnt the problem george had believed passionately in insurance and when he dropped down dead during the tiebreaker frame of the league bowloffs at big dukes big ten in machias his wife had come into better than a hundred thousand dollars and island life was cheap if you owned your place and kept your garden tended and knew how to put by your own vegetables come fall the problem was having nothing to focus on the problem was how the center seemed to have dropped out of their lives when george went facedown in his island amoco bowling shirt just over the foul line of lane nineteen and goddam if he hadnt picked up the spare his team had needed to win too with george gone their lives had become an eerie sort of blur its like being lost in a heavy fog maddie thought sometimes only instead of looking for the road or a house or the village or just some landmark like that lightningstruck pine out on the point i am looking for the wheel if i can ever find it maybe i can tell myself to squat and lean my shoulder to it at last she found her wheel it turned out to be jack pace women marry their fathers and men their mothers some say and while such a broad statement can hardly be true all of the time it was close enough for government work in maddies case her father had been looked upon by his peers with fear and admirationdont fool with george sullivan dear theyd say hell knock the nose off your face if you so much as look at him wrong it was true at home too hed been domineering and sometimes physically abusive but hed also known things to want and work for like the ford pickup the chainsaw or those two acres that bounded their place to the south pop cooks land george sullivan had been known to refer to pop cook as one armpitstinky old bastid but the old mans aroma didnt change the fact that there was quite a lot of good hardwood left on those two acres pop didnt know it because he had gone to living across the reach in when his arthritis really went to town on him and george let it be known on little tall that what that bastid pop cook didnt know wouldnt hurt him none and furthermore he would disjoint the man or woman that let light into the darkness of pops ignorance no one did and eventually the sullivans got the land and the hardwood on it of course the good wood was all logged off inside of three years but george said that didnt matter a tinkers damn land always paid for itself in the end that was what george said and they believed him believed in him and they worked all three of them he said you got to put your shoulder to this wheel and push the bitch you got to push haad because she dont move easy so that was what they did in those days maddies mother had kept a produce stand on the road from east head and there were always plenty of tourists who bought the vegetables she grew which were the ones george told her to grow of course and even though they were never exactly what her mother called the gotrocks family they made out even in years when lobstering was bad and they had to stretch their finances even further in order to keep paying off what they owed the bank on pop cooks two acres they made out jack pace was a sweetertempered man than george sullivan had ever thought of being but his sweet temper only stretched so far even so maddie suspected that he might get around to what was sometimes called home correctionthe twisted arm when supper was cold the occasional slap or downright paddlingin time when the bloom was off the rose so as to speak there was even a part of her that seemed to expect and look forward to that the womens magazines said marriages where the man ruled the roost were a thing of the past and that a man who put a hard hand on a woman should be arrested for assault even if the man in question was the woman in questions lawful wedded husband maddie sometimes read articles of this sort down at the beauty shop but doubted if the women who wrote them had the slightest idea that places like the outer islands even existed little tall had produced one writer as a matter of factselena st georgebut she wrote mostly about politics and hadnt been back to the island except for a single thanksgiving dinner in years im not going to be a lobsterman all my life maddie jack told her the week before they were married and she believed him a year before when he had asked her out for the first time shed said yes almost before all the words could get out of his mouth and she had blushed to the roots of her hair at the sound of her own naked eagerness he would have said i aint going to be a lobsterman all my life a small change but all the difference in the world he had been going to night school three evenings a week taking the old island princess over and back he would be dogtired after a day of pulling pots but off hed go just the same pausing only long enough to shower off the powerful smells of lobster and brine and to gulp two no doz with hot coffee after a while when she saw he really meant to stick to it maddie began putting up hot soup for him to drink on the ferryride over otherwise he would have had nothing but one of those nasty red hotdogs they sold in the princesss snackbar she remembered agonizing over the canned soups in the storethere were so many would he want tomato some people didnt like tomato soup in fact some people hated tomato soup even if you made it with milk instead of water vegetable soup turkey cream of chicken her helpless eyes roved the shelf display for nearly ten minutes before charlene nedeau asked if she could help her with somethingonly charlene said it in a sarcastic way and maddie guessed she would tell all her friends at high school tomorrow and they would giggle about it in the girls room knowing exactly what was wrong with herpoor mousy little maddie sullivan unable to make up her mind over so simple a thing as a can of soup how she had ever been able to decide to accept jack paces proposal was a wonder and a marvel to all of them but of course they didnt know about the wheel you had to find and about how once you found it you had to have someone to tell you when to stoop and where exactly to push the damned thing maddie had left the store with no soup and a throbbing headache when she worked up nerve enough to ask jack what his favorite soup was he had said chicken noodle kind that comes in the can were there any others he specially liked the answer was no just chicken noodlethe kind that came in the can that was all the soup jack pace needed in his life and all the answer on that particular subject at least that maddie needed in hers light of step and cheerful of heart maddie climbed the warped wooden steps of the store the next day and bought the four cans of chicken noodle soup that were on the shelf when she asked bob nedeau if he had any more he said he had a whole damn case of the stuff out back she bought the entire case and left him so flabbergasted that he actually carried the carton out to the truck for her and forgot all about asking why she wanted so mucha lapse for which his longnosed wife and daughter took him sharply to task that evening you just better believe it and never forget jack had said that time not long before they tied the knot she had believed it and had never forgotten more than a lobsterman my dad says im full of shit he says if draggin pots was good enough for his old man and his old mans old man and all the way back to the friggin garden of eden to hear him tell it it ought to be good enough for me but it aintisnt i meanand im going to do better his eye fell on her and it was a stern eye full of resolve but it was a loving eye full of hope and confidence too more than a lobsterman is what i mean to be and more than a lobstermans wife is what i intend for you to be youre going to have a house on the mainland yes jack and im not going to have any friggin chevrolet he drew in a deep breath and took her hands in his im going to have an oldsmobile he looked her dead in the eye as if daring her to scoff at this wildly upscale ambition she did no such thing of course she said yes jack for the third or fourth time that evening she had said it to him thousands of times over the year they had spent courting and she confidently expected to say it a million times before death ended their marriage by taking one of themor better both of them together yes jack had there ever in the history of the world been two words which made such beautiful music when laid side by side more than a friggin lobsterman no matter what my old man thinks or how much he laughs he pronounced this last word in the deeply downeast way loffs im going to do it and do you know whos going to help me yes maddie had responded calmly i am he had laughed and swept her into his arms youre damned tooting my little sweetheart hed told her and so they were wed as the fairytales usually put it and for maddie those first few monthsmonths when they were greeted almost everywhere with jovial cries of heres the newlywedswere a fairytale she had jack to lean on jack to help her make decisions and that was the best of it the most difficult household choice thrust upon her that first year was which curtains would look best in the living roomthere were so many in the catalogue to choose from and her mother was certainly no help maddies mother had a hard time deciding between different brands of toilet paper otherwise that year consisted mostly of joy and securitythe joy of loving jack in their deep bed while the winter wind scraped over the island like the blade of a knife across a breadboard the security of having jack to tell her what it was they wanted and how they were going to get it the loving was goodso good that sometimes when she thought of him during the days her knees would feel weak and her stomach flutterybut his way of knowing things and her growing trust in his instincts were even better so for awhile it was a fairytale yes then jack died and things started getting weird not just for maddie either for everybody just before the world slid into its incomprehensible nightmare maddie discovered she was what her mother had always called preg a curt word that was like the sound you made when you had to rasp up a throatful of snot that at least was how it had always sounded to maddie by then she and jack had moved next to the pulsifers on gennesault island which was known simply as jenny by its residents and those of nearby little tall shed had one of her agonizing interior debates when she missed her second period and after four sleepless nights she made an appointment with dr mcelwain on the mainland looking back she was glad if shed waited to see if she was going to miss a third period jack would not have had even one month of joy and she would have missed the concerns and little kindnesses he had showered upon her looking backnow that she was copingher indecision seemed ludicrous but her deeper heart knew that going to have the test had taken tremendous courage she had wanted to be more convincingly sick in the mornings so she could be surer she had longed for nausea to drag her from her dreams she made the appointment when jack was out at work and she went while he was out but there was no such thing as sneaking over to the mainland on the ferry too many people from both islands saw you someone would mention casually to jack that he or she had seen his wife on the princess tother day and then jack would want to know what it was all about and if shed made a mistake he would look at her like she was a goose but it hadnt been a mistake she was with child and never mind that word that sounded like someone with a bad cold trying to clear his throat and jack pace had had exactly twentyseven days to look forward to his first child before a bad swell had caught him and knocked him over the side of my ladylove the lobster boat he had inherited from his uncle mike jack could swim and he had popped to the surface like a cork dave eamons had told her miserably but just as he did another heavy swell came slewing the boat directly into him and although dave would say no more maddie had been born and brought up an island girl and she knew could in fact hear the hollow thud as the boat with its treacherous name smashed its way into her husbands head letting out blood and hair and bone and perhaps the part of his brain that had made him say her name over and over again in the dark of night when he came into her dressed in a heavy hooded parka and downfilled pants and boots jack pace had sunk like a stone they had buried an empty casket in the little cemetery at the north end of jenny island and the reverend johnson on jenny and little tall you had your choice when it came to religion you could be a methodist or if that didnt suit you you could be a lapsed methodist had presided over this empty coffin as he had so many others the service ended and at the age of twentytwo maddie had found herself a widow with a bun in the oven and no one to tell her where the wheel was let alone when to put her shoulder to it or how far to push it she thought at first shed go back to little tall back to her mother to wait her time but a year with jack had given her a little perspective and she knew her mother was as lostmaybe even more lostthan she was herself and that made her wonder if going back would be the right thing to do maddie jack told her again and again he was dead in the world but not it seemed inside her head inside her head he was as lively as any dead man could possibly get or so she had thought then the only thing you can ever decide on is not to decide nor was her mother any better they talked on the phone and maddie waited and hoped for her mother to just tell her to come back home but mrs sullivan could tell no one over the age of ten anything maybe you ought to come on back over here she had said once in a tentative way and maddie couldnt tell if that meant please come home or please dont take me up on an offer which was really just made for forms sake she spent long sleepless nights trying to decide which it had been and succeeded only in confusing herself more then the weirdness started and the greatest mercy was that there was only the one small graveyard on jenny and so many of the graves filled with those empty coffinsa thing which had once seemed pitiful to her now seemed another blessing a grace there were two on little tall both fairly large and so it began to seem so much safer to stay on jenny and wait she would wait and see if the world lived or died if it lived she would wait for the baby and now she was after a life of passive obedience and vague resolves that usually passed like dreams an hour or two after she got out of bed finally coping she knew that part of this was nothing more than the effect of being slammed with one massive shock after another beginning with the death of her husband and ending with one of the last broadcasts the pulsifers hightech satellite dish had picked up a horrified young boy who had been pressed into service as a cnn reporter saying that it seemed certain that the president of the united states the first lady the secretary of state the honorable senior senator from oregon and the emir of kuwait had been eaten alive in the white house east room by zombies i want to repeat this the accidental reporter had said the firespots of his acne standing out on his forehead and chin like stigmata his mouth and cheeks had begun to twitch his hands shook spastically i want to repeat that a bunch of corpses have just lunched up on the president and his wife and a whole lot of other political hotshots who were at the white house to eat poached salmon and cherries jubilee then the kid had begun to laugh maniacally and to scream go yale boolaboola at the top of his voice at last he bolted out of the frame leaving a cnn newsdesk untenanted for the first time in maddies memory she and the pulsifers sat in dismayed silence as the newsdesk disappeared and an ad for boxcar willie recordsnot available in any store you could get this amazing collection only by dialing the number currently appearing on the bottom of your screencame on one of little cheyne pulsifers crayons was on the end table beside the chair maddie was sitting in and for some crazy reason she picked it up and wrote the number down on a sheet of scrap paper before mr pulsifer got up and turned off the tv without a single word maddie told them good night and thanked them for sharing their tv and their jiffy pop are you sure youre all right maddie dear candi pulsifer asked her for the fifth time that night and maddie said she was fine for the fifth time that night that she was coping and candi said she knew she was but she was welcome to the upstairs bedroom that used to be brians anytime she wanted maddie hugged candi kissed her cheek declined with the most graceful thanks she could find and was at last allowed to escape she had walked the windy half mile back to her own house and was in her own kitchen before she realized that she still had the scrap of paper on which she had jotted the number she had dialed it and there was nothing no recorded voice telling her all circuits were currently busy or that the number was out of service no wailing siren sound that indicated a line interruption no boops or beeps or clicks or clacks just smooth silence that was when maddie knew for sure that the end had either come or was coming when you could no longer call the number and order the boxcar willie records that were not available in any store when there were for the first time in her living memory no operators standing by the end of the world was a foregone conclusion she felt her rounding stomach as she stood there by the phone on the wall in the kitchen and said it out loud for the first time unaware that she had spoken it will have to be a home delivery but thats all right as long as you get ready and stay ready kiddo you have to remember that there just isnt any other way it has to be a home delivery she waited for fear and none came i can cope with this just fine she said and this time she heard herself and was comforted by the sureness of her own words a baby when the baby came the end of the world would itself end eden she said and smiled her smile was sweet the smile of a madonna it didnt matter how many rotting dead people maybe boxcar willie among them for all she knew were shambling around the face of the earth she would have a baby she would accomplish her home delivery and the possibility of eden would remain the first reports came from an australian hamlet on the edge of the outback a place with the memorable name of fiddle dee the name of the first american town where the walking dead were reported was perhaps even more memorable thumper florida the first story appeared in americas favorite supermarket tabloid inside view dead come to life in small florida town the headline screamed the story began with a recap of a film called night of the living dead which maddie had never seen and went on to mention anothermacumba lovewhich she had also never seen the article was accompanied by three photos one was a still from night of the living dead showing what appeared to be a bunch of escapees from a loonybin standing outside an isolated farmhouse at night one was from macumba love showing a blonde whose bikini top appeared to be holding breasts the size of prizewinning gourds the blonde was holding up her hands and screaming in horror at what could have been a black man in a mask the third purported to be a picture taken in thumper florida it was a blurred grainy shot of a person of indeterminate sex standing in front of a video arcade the article described the figure as being wrapped in the cerements of the grave but it could have been someone in a dirty sheet no big deal bigfoot rapes choir boy last week dead people coming back to life this week the dwarf mass murderer next week no big deal at least until they started to come out in other places as well no big deal until the first news film you may want to ask your children to leave the room tom brokaw introduced gravely showed up on network tv decayed monsters with naked bone showing through their dried skin traffic accident victims the morticians concealing makeup sloughed away so that the ripped faces and bashedin skulls showed women with their hair teased into dirtclogged beehives where worms and beetles still squirmed and crawled their faces alternately vacuous and informed with a kind of calculating idiotic intelligence no big deal until the first horrible stills in an issue of people magazine that had been sealed in shrinkwrap and sold with an orange sticker that read not for sale to minors then it was a big deal when you saw a decaying man still dressed in the mudstreaked remnants of the brooks brothers suit in which he had been buried tearing at the throat of a screaming woman in a teeshirt that read property of the houston oilers you suddenly realized it might be a very big deal indeed that was when the accusations and saber rattling had started and for three weeks the entire world had been diverted from the creatures escaping their graves like grotesque moths escaping diseased cocoons by the spectacle of the two great nuclear powers on what appeared to be an undivertible collision course there were no zombies in the united states communist chinese television commentators declared this was a selfserving lie to camouflage an unforgivable act of chemical warfare against the peoples republic of china a more horrible and deliberate version of what had happened in bhopal india reprisals would follow if the dead comrades coming out of their graves did not fall down decently dead within ten days all us diplomatic people were expelled from the mother country and there were several incidents of american tourists being beaten to death the president who would not long after become a zombie blue plate special himself responded by becoming a pot which he had come to resemble having put on at least fifty pounds since his secondterm election calling a kettle black the us government he told the american people had incontrovertible evidence that the only walkingdead people in china had been set loose deliberately and while the head panda might stand there with his slantyeyed face hanging out claiming there were over eight thousand lively corpses striding around in search of the ultimate collectivism we had definite proof that there were less than forty it was the chinese who had committed an acta heinous actof chemical warfare bringing loyal americans back to life with no urge to consume anything but other loyal americans and if these americanssome of whom had been good democratsdid not lie down decently dead within the next five days red china was going to be one large slag pit norad was at defcon when a british astronomer named humphrey dagbolt spotted the satellite or the spaceship or the creature or whatever in hells name it was dagbolt was not even a professional astronomer but only an amateur stargazer from the west of englandno one in particular you would have saidand yet he almost certainly saved the world from some sort of thermonuclear exchange if not flatout atomic war all in all not a bad weeks work for a man with a deviated septum and a bad case of psoriasis at first it seemed that the two nosetonose political systems did not want to believe in what dagbolt had found even after the royal observatory in london had pronounced his photographs and data authentic finally however the missile silos closed and telescopes all over the world homed in almost grudgingly on star wormwood the joint americanchinese space mission to investigate the unwelcome newcomer lifted off from the lanzhou heights less than three weeks after the first photographs had appeared in the guardian and everyones favorite amateur astronomer was aboard deviated septum and all in truth it would have been hard to have kept dagbolt off the missionhe had become a worldwide hero the most renowned briton since winston churchill when asked by a reporter on the day before liftoff if he was frightened dagbolt had brayed his oddly endearing robert morley laugh rubbed the side of his truly enormous nose and exclaimed petrified dear boy utterly pettrified as it turned out he had every reason to be petrified they all did the final sixtyone seconds of received transmission from the xiaopingtruman were considered too horrible for release by all three governments involved and so no formal communiqu√© was ever issued it didnt matter of course nearly twenty thousand ham operators had been monitoring the craft and it seemed that at least nineteen thousand of them had been rolling tape when the craft had beenwell was there really any other word for itinvaded chinese voice worms it appears to be a massive ball of american voice christ look out its coming for us dagbolt some sort of extrusion is occurring the portside window is chinese voice breach breach to your suits my friends indecipherable gabble american voiceand appears to be eating its way in female chinese voice chingling soong oh stop it stop the eyes sound of an explosion dagbolt explosive decompression has occurred i see threeer fourdead and there are worms everywhere there are worms american voice faceplate faceplate faceplate screaming chinese voice where is my mamma oh dear where is my mamma screams sounds like a toothless old man sucking up mashed potatoes dagbolt the cabin is full of wormswhat appear to be worms at any ratewhich is to say that they really are worms one realizesthat have apparently extruded themselves from the main satellitewhat we took to bewhich is to say one meansthe cabin is full of floating body parts these spaceworms apparently excrete some sort of acid booster rockets fired at this point duration of the burn is seconds this may have been an attempt to escape or possibly to ram the central object in either case the maneuver did not work it seems likely that the blastchambers themselves were clogged with worms and captain lin yangor whichever officer was then in chargebelieved an explosion of the fuel tanks themselves to be imminent as a result of the clog hence the shutdown american voice oh my christ theyre in my head theyre eating my fuckin br static dagbolt i believe that prudence dictates a strategic retreat to the aft storage compartment the rest of the crew is dead no question about that pity brave bunch even that fat american who kept rooting around in his nose but in another sense i dont think static dagboltdead after all because chingling soongor rather chingling soongs severed head one means to sayjust floated past me and her eyes were open and blinking she appeared to recognize me and to static dagboltkeep you explosion static dagboltaround me i repeat all around me squirming things theyi say does anyone know if dagbolt screaming and cursing then just screaming sounds of toothless old man again transmission ends the xiaopingtruman exploded three seconds later the extrusion from the rough ball nicknamed star wormwood had been observed from better than three hundred telescopes earthside during the short and rather pitiful conflict as the final sixtyone seconds of transmission began the craft began to be obscured by something that certainly looked like worms by the end of the final transmission the craft itself could not be seen at allonly the squirming mass of things that had attached themselves to it moments after the final explosion a weather satellite snapped a single picture of floating debris some of which was almost certainly chunks of the wormthings a severed human leg clad in a chinese space suit floating among them was a good deal easier to identify and in a way none of it even mattered the scientists and political leaders of both countries knew exactly where star wormwood was located above the expanding hole in earths ozone layer it was sending something down from there and it was not flowers by wire missiles came next star wormwood jigged easily out of their way and then returned to its place over the hole on the pulsifers satelliteassisted tv more dead people got up and walked but now there was a crucial change in the beginning the zombies had only bitten living people who got too close but in the weeks before the pulsifers hightech sony started showing only broad bands of snow the dead folks started trying to get close to the living folks they had it seemed decided they liked what they were biting the final effort to destroy the thing was made by the united states the president approved an attempt to destroy star wormwood with a number of orbiting nukes stalwartly ignoring his previous statements that america had never put atomic sdi weapons in orbit and never would everyone else ignored them as well perhaps they were too busy praying for success it was a good idea but not unfortunately a workable one not a single missile from a single sdi orbiter fired this was a total of twentyfour flatout failures so much for modern technology and then after all these shocks on earth and in heaven there was the business of the one little graveyard right here on jenny but even that didnt seem to count much for maddie because after all she had not been there with the end of civilization now clearly at hand and the island cut offthankfully cut off in the opinion of the residentsfrom the rest of the world old ways had reasserted themselves with unspoken but inarguable force by then they all knew what was going to happen it was only a question of when that and being ready when it did women were excluded it was bob daggett of course who drew up the watch roster that was only right since bob had been head selectman on jenny for about a thousand years the day after the death of the president the thought of him and the first lady wandering witlessly through the streets of washington dc gnawing on human arms and legs like people eating chicken legs at a picnic was not mentioned it was a little much to bear even if the bastid and his blonde wife were democrats bob daggett called the first menonly town meeting on jenny since sometime before the civil war maddie wasnt there but she heard dave eamons told her all she needed to know you men all know the situation bob said he looked as yellow as a man with jaundice and people remembered his daughter the one still living at home on the island was only one of four the other three were other places which was to say on the mainland but hell if it came down to that they all had folks on the mainland we got one boneyard here on jenny bob continued and nothin aint happened there yet but that dont mean nothin will nothin aint happened yet lots of places but it seems like once it starts nothin turns to somethin pretty goddam quick there was a rumble of assent from the men gathered in the grammarschool gymnasium which was the only place big enough to hold them there were about seventy of them in all ranging in age from johnny crane who had just turned eighteen to bobs greatuncle frank who was eighty had a glass eye and chewed tobacco there was no spittoon in the gym of course so frank daggett had brought an empty mayonnaise jar to spit his juice into he did so now git down to where the cheese binds bobby he said you aint got no office to run for and times awastin there was another rumble of agreement and bob daggett flushed somehow his greatuncle always managed to make him look like an ineffectual fool and if there was anything in the world he hated worse than looking like an ineffectual fool it was being called bobby he owned property for chrissake and he supported the old fartbought him his goddam chew but these were not things he could say old franks eyes were like pieces of flint okay bob said curtly here it is we want twelve men to a watch im gonna set a roster in just a couple minutes fourhour shifts i can stand watch a helluva lot longern four hours matt arsenault spoke up and davey told maddie that bob said after the meeting that no welfareslacker like matt arsenault would have had the nerve to speak up like that in a meeting of his betters if that old man hadnt called him bobby like he was a kid instead of a man three months shy of his fiftieth birthday in front of all the island men maybe you can n maybe you cant bob said but we got plenty of warm bodies and nobodys gonna fall asleep on sentry duty i aint gonna i didnt say you bob said but the way his eyes rested on matt arsenault suggested that he might have meant him this is no kids game sit down and shut up matt arsenault opened his mouth to say something more then looked around at the other menincluding old frank daggettand wisely held his peace if you got a rifle bring it when its your trick bob continued he felt a little better with arsenault more or less back in his place unless its a twentytwo that is if you aint got somethin biggern that come n get one here i didnt know the school kep a supply of em handy cal partridge said and there was a ripple of laughter it dont now but it will bob said because every man jack of you with more than one rifle bigger than a twentytwo is gonna bring it here he looked at john wirley the school principal okay if we keep em in your office john wirley nodded beside him reverend johnson was drywashing his hands in a distraught way shit on that orrin campbell said i got a wife and two kids at home am i sposed to leave em with nothin to defend themselves with if a bunch of cawpses come for an early thanksgiving dinner while im on watch if we do our job at the boneyard none will bob replied stonily some of you got handguns we dont want none of those figure out which women can shoot and which cant and give em the pistols well put em together in bunches they can play beano old frank cackled and bob smiled too that was more like it by the christ nights were gonna want trucks posted around so we got plenty of light he looked over at sonny dotson who ran island amoco the only gas station on jenny sonnys main business wasnt gassing cars and trucksshit there was no place much on the island to drive and you could get your go ten cents cheaper on the mainlandbut filling up lobster boats and the motorboats he ran out of his jackleg marina in the summer you gonna supply the gas sonny am i gonna get cash slips youre gonna get your ass saved bob said when things get back to normalif they ever doi guess youll get what you got coming sonny looked around saw only hard eyes and shrugged he looked a bit sullen but in truth he looked more confused than anything davey told maddie the next day aint got nmoren four hunnert gallons of gas he said mostly diesel theres five generators on the island burt dorfman said when burt spoke everyone listened as the only jew on the island he was regarded as a creature both quixotic and fearsome like an oracle that works about half the time they all run on diesel i can rig lights if i have to low murmurs if burt said he could do it he could he was a jewish electrician and there was a feeling on the outer islands unarticulated but powerful that that was the best kind were gonna light that graveyard up like a friggin stage bob said andy kingsbury stood up i heard on the news that sometimes you can shoot one of them things in the head and itll stay down and sometimes it wont weve got chainsaws bob said stonily and what wont stay dead why we can make sure it wont move too far alive and except for making out the duty roster that was pretty much that six days and nights passed and the sentries posted around the little graveyard on jenny were starting to feel a wee bit silly i dunno if im standin guard or pullin my pud orrin campbell said one afternoon as a dozen men stood around the cemetery gate playing liars poker when it happened and when it happened it happened fast dave told maddie that he heard a sound like the wind wailing in the chimney on a gusty night and then the gravestone marking the final resting place of mr and mrs fourniers boy michael who had died of leukemia at seventeen bad go that had been him being their only child and them being such nice people and all fell over a moment later a shredded hand with a mosscaked yarmouth academy class ring on one finger rose out of the ground shoving through the tough grass the third finger had been torn off in the process the ground heaved like like the belly of a pregnant woman getting ready to drop her load dave almost said and hastily reconsidered a big wave rolling into a close cove and then the boy himself sat up only he wasnt anything you could really recognize not after almost two years in the ground there were little splinters of wood sticking out of what was left of his face davey said and pieces of shiny blue cloth in the draggles of his hair that was coffinlinin davey told her looking down at his restlessly twining hands i know that as wells i know mown name he paused then added thank christ mikes dad dint have that trick maddie had nodded the men on guard bullshitscared as well as revolted opened fire on the reanimated corpse of the former highschool chess champion and allstar second baseman tearing him to shreds other shots fired in wild panic blew chips off his marble gravestone and it was just luck that the armed men had been loosely grouped together when the festivities commenced if they had been divided up into two wings as bob daggett had originally intended they would very likely have slaughtered each other as it was not a single islander was hurt although bud meechum found a rather suspiciouslooking hole torn in the sleeve of his shirt the next day probly waant nothin but a blackberry thorn just the same he said theres an almighty lot of em out at that end of the island you know no one would dispute that but the black smudges around the hole made his frightened wife think that his shirt had been torn by a thorn with a pretty large caliber the fournier kid fell back most of him lying still other parts of him still twitching but by then the whole graveyard seemed to be rippling as if an earthquake were going on therebut only there noplace else just about an hour before dusk this had happened burt dorfman had rigged up a siren to a tractor battery and bob daggett flipped the switch within twenty minutes most of the men in town were at the island cemetery goddam good thing too dave eamons said because a few of the deaders almost got away old frank daggett still two hours from the heart attack that would carry him off just as the excitement was dying down organized the new men so they wouldnt shoot each other either and for the final ten minutes the jenny boneyard sounded like bull run by the end of the festivities the powder smoke was so thick that some men choked on it the sour smell of vomit was almost heavier than the smell of gunsmoke it was sharper too and lingered longer and still some of them wriggled and squirmed like snakes with broken backsthe fresher ones for the most part burt frank daggett said you got them chainsaws i got em burt said and then a long buzzing sound came out of his mouth a sound like a cicada burrowing its way into tree bark as he dryheaved he could not take his eyes from the squirming corpses the overturned gravestones the yawning pits from which the dead had come in the truck gassed up blue veins stood out on franks ancient hairless skull yeah burts hand was over his mouth im sorry work yfuckin gut all you want frank said briskly but toddle off n get them saws while you do and you you you you the last you was his grandnephew bob i cant uncle frank bob said sickly he looked around and saw five or six of his friends and neighbors lying crumpled in the tall grass they had not died they had swooned most of them had seen their own relatives rise out of the ground buck harkness over there lying by an aspen tree had been part of the crossfire that had cut his late wife to ribbons he had fainted after observing her decayed wormriddled brains exploding from the back of her head in a grisly gray splash i cant i c franks hand twisted with arthritis but as hard as stone cracked across his face you can and you will chummy he said bob went with the rest of the men frank daggett watched them grimly and rubbed his chest which had begun to send cramped throbs of pain all the way down his left arm to the elbow he was old but he wasnt stupid and he had a pretty good idea what those pains were and what they meant he told me he thought he was gonna have a blowout and he tapped his chest when he said it dave went on and placed his hand on the swell of muscle over his own left nipple to demonstrate maddie nodded to show she understood he said if anything happens to me before this mess is cleaned up davey you and burt and orrin take over bobbys a good boy but i think he may have lost his guts for at least a little while and you know sometimes when a man loses his guts they dont come back maddie nodded again thinking how grateful she washow very very gratefulthat she was not a man so then we did it dave said we cleaned up the mess maddie nodded a third time but this time she must have made some sound because dave told her he would stop if she couldnt bear it he would gladly stop i can bear it she said quietly you might be surprised how much i can bear davey he looked at her quickly curiously when she said that but maddie had averted her eyes before he could see the secret in them dave didnt know the secret because no one on jenny knew that was the way maddie wanted it and the way she intended to keep it there had been a time when she had perhaps in the blue darkness of her shock pretended to be coping and then something happened that made her cope four days before the island cemetery vomited up its corpses maddie pace was faced with a simple choice cope or die she had been sitting in the living room drinking a glass of the blueberry wine she and jack had put up during august of the previous yeara time that now seemed impossibly distantand doing something so trite it was laughable she was knitting little things booties in fact but what else was there to do it seemed that no one would be going across the reach to the wee folks store at the ellsworth mall for quite some time something had thumped against the window a bat she thought looking up her needles paused in her hands though it seemed that something bigger had moved jerkily out there in the windy dark the oil lamp was turned up high and kicking too much reflection off the panes for her to be sure she reached to turn it down and the thump came again the panes shivered she heard a little pattering of dried putty falling on the sash jack had been planning to reglaze all the windows this fall she remembered and then thought maybe thats what he came back for that was crazy he was on the bottom of the ocean but she sat with her head cocked to one side her knitting now motionless in her hands a little pink bootie she had already made a blue set all of a sudden it seemed she could hear so much the wind the faint thunder of surf on cricket ledge the house making little groaning sounds like an elderly woman making herself comfortable in bed the tick of the clock in the hallway jack she asked the silent night that was now no longer silent is it you dear then the livingroom window burst inward and what came through was not really jack but a skeleton with a few mouldering strings of flesh hanging from it his compass was still around his neck it had grown a beard of moss the wind flapped the curtains in a cloud above him as he sprawled then got up on his hands and knees and looked at her from black sockets in which barnacles had grown he made grunting sounds his fleshless mouth opened and the teeth chomped down he was hungry but this time chicken noodle soup would not serve not even the kind that came in the can gray stuff hung and swung beyond those dark barnacleencrusted holes and she realized she was looking at whatever remained of jacks brain she sat where she was frozen as he got up and came toward her leaving black kelpy tracks on the carpet fingers reaching he stank of salt and fathoms his hands stretched his teeth chomped mechanically up and down maddie saw he was wearing the remains of the blackandredchecked shirt she had bought him at l l beans last christmas it had cost the earth but he had said again and again how warm it was and look how well it had lasted how much of it was left even after being under water all this time the cold cobwebs of bone which were all that remained of his fingers touched her throat before the baby kicked in her stomachfor the first timeand her shocked horror which she had believed to be calmness fled and she drove one of the knitting needles into the things eye making horrid thick choking noises that sounded like the suck of a swill pump he staggered backward clawing at the needle while the halfmade pink bootie swung in front of the cavity where his nose had been she watched as a sea slug squirmed from that nasal cavity and onto the bootie leaving a trail of slime behind it jack fell over the end table shed gotten at a yard sale just after they had been marriedshe hadnt been able to make her mind up about it had been in agonies about it until jack finally said either she was going to buy it for their living room or he was going to give the biddy running the sale twice what she was asking for the goddam thing and then bust it up into firewood with with the he struck the floor and there was a brittle cracking sound as his febrile fragile form broke in two the right hand tore the knitting needle slimed with decaying brain tissue from his eyesocket and tossed it aside his top half crawled toward her his teeth gnashed steadily together she thought he was trying to grin and then the baby kicked again and she remembered how uncharacteristically tired and out of sorts hed sounded at mabel hanrattys yardsale that day buy it maddie for chrissake im tired want to go home and get mdinner if you dont get a move on ill give the old bat twice what she wants and bust it up for firewood with my cold dank hand clutching her ankle polluted teeth poised to bite to kill her and kill the baby she tore loose leaving him with only her slipper which he chewed on and then spat out when she came back from the entry he was crawling mindlessly into the kitchenat least the top half of him waswith the compass dragging on the tiles he looked up at the sound of her and there seemed to be some idiot question in those black eyesockets before she brought the ax whistling down cleaving his skull as he had threatened to cleave the end table his head fell in two pieces brains dribbling across the tile like spoiled oatmeal brains that squirmed with slugs and gelatinous sea worms brains that smelled like a woodchuck exploded with gassy decay in a highsummer meadow still his hands clashed and clittered on the kitchen tiles making a sound like beetles she chopped chopped chopped at last there was no more movement a sharp pain rippled across her midsection and for a moment she was gripped by terrible panic is it a miscarriage am i going to have a miscarriage but the pain left and the baby kicked again more strongly than before she went back into the living room carrying an ax that now smelled like tripe his legs had somehow managed to stand jack i loved you so much she said but this isnt you she brought the ax down in a whistling arc that split him at the pelvis sliced the carpet and drove deep into the solid oak floor beneath the legs separated trembled wildly for almost five minutes and then began to grow quiet at last even the toes stopped twitching she carried him down to the cellar piece by piece wearing her oven gloves and wrapping each piece with the insulating blankets jack had kept in the shed and which she had never thrown awayhe and the crew threw them over the pots on cold days so the lobsters wouldnt freeze once a severed hand closed upon her wrist she stood still and waited her heart drumming heavily in her chest and at last it loosened again and that was the end of it the end of him there was an unused cistern polluted below the housejack had been meaning to fill it in maddie slid the heavy concrete cover aside so that its shadow lay on the earthen floor like a partial eclipse and then threw the pieces of him down listening to the splashes when everything was gone she worked the heavy cover back into place rest in peace she whispered and an interior voice whispered back that her husband was resting in pieces and then she began to cry and her cries turned to hysterical shrieks and she pulled at her hair and tore at her breasts until they were bloody and she thought i am insane this is what its like to be insa but before the thought could be completed she had fallen down in a faint and the faint became a deep sleep and the next morning she felt all right she would never tell though never i can bear it she told dave eamons again thrusting aside the image of the knitting needle with the bootie swinging from the end of it jutting out of the kelpslimed eyesocket of the thing which had once been her husband and cocreator of the child in her womb really so he told her perhaps because he had to tell someone or go mad but he glossed over the worst parts he told her that they had chainsawed the corpses that absolutely refused to return to the land of the dead but he did not tell her that some parts had continued to squirmhands with no arms attached to them clutching mindlessly feet divorced from their legs digging at the bulletchewed earth of the graveyard as if trying to run awayand that these parts had been doused with diesel fuel and set afire maddie did not have to be told this part she had seen the pyre from the house later gennesault islands one firetruck had turned its hose on the dying blaze although there wasnt much chance of the fire spreading with a brisk easterly blowing the sparks off jennys seaward edge when there was nothing left but a stinking tallowy lump and still there were occasional bulges in this mass like twitches in a tired muscle matt arsenault fired up his old d caterpillarabove the nicked

fainted but frank never did try to get up and walk frank daggett had meant to stay dead and that was just what he did once dave started that story he had to go on with it and so he cursed himself for ever starting hed been right the first time it was no story for a pregnant woman but maddie had kissed him and told him she thought he had done wonderfully and that frank daggett had done wonderfully too dave went out feeling a little dazed as if he had just been kissed on the cheek by a woman he had never met before in a very real sense that was true she watched him go down the path to the dirt track that was one of jennys two roads and turn left he was weaving a little in the moonlight weaving with tiredness she thought but reeling with shock as well her heart went out to him to all of them she had wanted to tell dave she loved him and kiss him squarely on the mouth instead of just skimming his cheek with her lips but he might have taken the wrong meaning from something like that even though he was boneweary and she was almost five months pregnant but she did love him loved all of them because they had gone through hell in order to make this little lick of land forty miles out in the atlantic safe for her and safe for her baby it will be a home delivery she said softly as dave went out of sight behind the dark hulk of the pulsifers satellite dish her eyes rose to the moon it will be a home delivery and it will be fine sparks fly upward by lisa mortonlisa morton is a horror author and screenwriter her short fiction has appeared in a number of anthologies including mondo

anthology literary and historical writings over the centuries morton feels that many writers who have tackled the theme of zombies have fallen into a trap trying to outtaboo each other with extreme sex so when it came time to write a zombie story of her own she asked herself what taboos were left that could be dealt with in a zombie tale my answer was political ones morton said its hard to imagine a more heated political topic than abortion and when i thought of combining that with a tale of survivors carefully rationing out their resources it all fell into place my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me job blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection revelations june tomorrow marks one year ago that the colony was begun here and i think just about everyone is busy preparing for a big celebration we just had our first real harvest two weeks ago so therell be plenty of good things to eat and as for drinkwell the product of georges still is a little extreme for most tastes so tom and a few of the boys made a foray outside yesterday for some real liquor of course i was worried when tom told me he was going and not even for something really vital just booze but he said it wasnt so bad the road was almost totally clear for the first five miles after they left the safety of the colony and even most of philipsville the pintsized town where they raided a liquor store was deserted tom said he shot one in the liquor store cellar when he went down there to check on the good wines it was an old woman probably the onetime shopkeepers wife locked away unfortunately shed clawed most of the good bottles off to smash on the floor tom took what was left and an unopened case of good burgundy he found untouched in a corner there are adults in the colony and he figured hed have a bottle for every two on anniversary day its been two weeks since any of the deadheads have been spotted near the colony walls and pedro quintero our top marksman picked that one off with one shot straight through the head from the east tower it would be easy to fool ourselves into thinking the situation is finally mending easy and dangerous because its not the lack of deadheads seen around here lately proves only one thing that doc freeman was right in picking this location away from the cities and highways of course doc freeman was righthes right about everything he said we should go this far north because the south would only keep getting hotter and sure enough its been in the s here for over a week now i dont want to think what it is down in la nowprobably and thats in the shade tomorrow will be a tribute to doc freeman as much as an anniversary celebration if it hadnt been for him well i suppose tom and little jessie and i would be wandering around out there with the rest of them right now dead for a year but still hungry always hungry its funny but before all the shit came down doc freeman was just an eccentric old college professor teaching agricultural sciences and preaching survival tom always believed freeman had been thinking about cutting out anyway even before the whole zombie thing because of the rising temperatures he told his students that agriculture in most parts of the us was already a thing of the past and it would all be moving up to canada soon when the deadheads came doc freeman argued as did a lot of other environmentalists that they were caused by the holes in the ozone layer too it was the most natural thing in the world i guess for him to assemble a band of followers and head north hed chosen the site for the colony set up policy and government designed the layout of fields houses and fences and even assigned each of us a job according to what we were best at it had all been scary at first of courseespecially with yearold jessiebut we all kind of fell into place i even discovered i was a talented horticulturistdoc says the best after himand in some ways this new life is better than the old one of course there are a lot of things we all missice cream uncalloused hands tv del still scans the shortwave radio hoping hell pick something up on it in a year he has only once and that transmission ended with the sound of gunshots so we accept our place in the worldand the fact that it may be the last place tomorrow we do more than accept it we celebrate it i wish i knew exactly how to feel june well the big day has come and gone tom is beside me snoring in a blissful alcoholic oblivion tomorrow hell be in the fields again so hes earned this jessie is in her room next door exhausted from all the games she played and sweets she ate tom actually let me use a precious hour of videotape to record her today and yet i wasnt the only one crying when doc freeman got up and made his speech about how his projections show that if we continue at our present excellent rate well be able to expand the colony in three years expand it carefully he added meaning that in three years therell be probably forty or fifty coupleslike tom and ibegging for the precious right to increase our family i know doc is right that we must remember the lessons of the old world and not outgrow our capacity to produce to sustain that new growth but somehow it seems wrong to deny new life when were surrounded by so much death especially when the new life is in me june ive missed two now and so i felt certain enough to go see dale oldfield he examined me as best he could hes an excellent gp but his equipment is still limited and he concluded id guessed right i am pregnant between the two of us we figured it at about six weeks along dale thanked me for not trying to hide it then told me he would have to report it to doc freeman i asked only that tom and i be allowed to be there when he did he agreed and we decided on tomorrow afternoon i went home and told tom at first he was thrilledand then he remembered where we were i told tom wed be seeing doc freeman tomorrow about it and he became obsessed with the idea that hed somehow convince doc to let us have the baby i couldnt stand to hear him torture himself that way so i read stories to jessie and held her until we both fell asleep in her narrow childsized bed june we saw doc freeman today dale oldfield confirmed the situation then gracefully excused himself saying hed be in his little shackcumoffice when we needed him doc freeman poured all three of us a shot of his private stock of jim beam then he began the apologies tom tried to argue him out of it saying a birth would be good for morale and we could certainly handle just one more in the colony but doc told him quietly that unlike many of the young couples we already had a child and couldnt expect special treatment tom finally gave in admitting doc was rightand id never loved him more than i did then seeing his pain and regret he went with me to tell dale wed be needing his services next week and dale just nodded his head hung low not meeting our eyes afterwards in our own bungalow tom and i argued for hours we both got crazy talking about leaving the colony building our own little fortress somewhere even overthrowing doc freeman but i think we both knew it was all fantasy doc freeman had been right againwe did have jessie and maybe in a few more years the time would be right for another child but not now july tomorrow is the day set for us to do it god i wish there was another way unfortunately even after performing a dc three times in the last year dale still has never had the clinics equipment moved to the colony its ironic that we can send out an expedition for booze but not one for medical equipment doc freeman says thats because the equipment is a lot bigger than the booze and the colonys only truck has been down basically since we got here so tomorrow tom dale and i will make the mile drive to silver creek the nearest town big enough to have had a family planning clinic dale who has keys to the clinic assures me the only dangerous part will be getting from the car to the doors of the clinic they cant get inside he tells me so well be safeuntil we have to leave again that is funny when hes telling me about danger he only talks about deadheads he never mentions the abortion july i didnt sleep much last night tom held me but even he dozed off for a while its morning as i write this and i hear jessie starting to awaken after i get her up ill try to tell her mommy and daddy have to leave for a while and nice mrs oldfield will watch her shell cry but hopefully not because she understands whats really going on its later nowjessies taken care of and dales got the jeep ready to go tom and i check our supplies again an automatic with full magazine an uzi with extra clips a hunting rifle with scope and plenty of ammo three machetes and the little wooden box dales also got his shotgun and a walther ppk that he says makes him feel like james bond everyone teases him about it telling him things like the difference is that bonds villains were all alive to begin with dale always glowers and shuts up its time to go we climbed into the jeep tom asked why i was bringing you diary along and i told him it was my security blanket and rabbits foot he shut up and dale gunned the engine we had to stop three times on the way out to exchange hugs and good luck wishes with people who ran up from the fields when we went by were about miles out now and its been the way tom saidquiet after the gates swung open and we pulled onto the dusty road it mustve been minutes before we saw the first deadhead it was lumbering slowly across a sere field still fifty yards from the road as we whipped by a few miles later there was a small pack of three in the road but they were spaced wide apart dale drove around two of them they clawed in vain at the jeep but we were doing and they just scraped their fingers the third one was harder to drive aroundthere were car wrecks on either side of the roadso dale just whomped into him he flew over the welded cage at the front of the jeep and landed somewhere off to the side of the road we barely felt it wed just reached the outskirts of silver creek when dale slowed down and cleared his throat then he said listen sarah theres something you ought to know about the clinic he asked me if id talked to any of the others hed already escorted out here of course i had but they had only assured me of dales skilled painless technique and that theyd be there if i needed to talk none of them had said much about the clinic itself i said this to dale and he asked me something strange he asked if i was religious tom and i looked at each other then tom asked dale what he was getting at dale stammered through something about how the deadheads tend to go back to places that were important to them like their homes or shopping malls or schools we noddedeveryone knew thatand dale asked if wed ever heard of operation soulsave i swear i literally tasted something bad in my mouth how could i forget the fundamentalists who used to stand around outside abortion clinics and shout insults and threats at people who went in i was with a friend oncea very young friendwhen it happened to her then i realized what he was saying i couldnt believe it i tried to ask him but my words just tripped all over each other he nodded and told us theyre still here most of silver creek was empty we saw some of them inside dusty old storefronts gazing at us stupidly as we drove by but they probably hadnt fed in well over a year and were pretty sluggish either that or theyd just been that way in lifestaring slackjawed as it passed them by that wasnt the case however with the group before the clinic there must have been of them massed solidly before the locked doors as we drove towards them i saw their clothes once prim and starched now stained will all those fluids theyd long ago feared or detested one still held up a sign i realized a few seconds later he had taped it to his wrist as he died which read operation soulsavesave a soul for christ several sported the obligatory abortion is murder tshirts now tattered and discolored their leader was the priest i remembered him from before when hed been on all the news programs spouting his vicious rhetoric while his flock chanted behind him of course he looked different nowsomebody had snacked on his trapezius so his roman collar was covered in dried gore and hung askew and his head he was also missing a considerable patch of scalp on that same side canted strangely at an odd angle i saw dale eyeing them and muttering something under his breath i asked him what it was so i could write it down yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward he said it was from the bible i was surprised i didnt know dale read the bible tom responded with a quote from one of the more contemporary prophets i used to be disgusted now i try to be amused then he asked dale what we were going to do dale who was practiced in this said hed drive around the building once which would draw most of them away from the front long enough for us to get in they wouldnt bother the jeep when we werent in it dale headed for the next corner tom pulled the and held it and i remembered i was thinking about the time i had to go to a different clinic with my friend julie it was before i started you diary in fact i started you about the time julie disappeared with most of the rest of the world so ive never written any of this down before julie had gotten pregnant from her boyfriend sean who split when she told him abortions were legal then this was a long time ago but could be costly and julie who was still going to college as i was had no money she went to her parents but they threw her out of the house she thought about having the baby and putting it up for adoption but she had no health insurance wouldnt be able to afford the actual birth and regarded overpopulation as the end of the world this obviously was before the deadheads arrived and clarified that issue so id lent her the money and agreed to go with her to the clinic she made the appointment worried about it so much she didnt sleep the night before almost backed out twice on the drive thereand all so she could be confronted by the fine christian citizens of operation soulsave they had seated themselves on either side of the walkway leading into the clinic even though it was in another state and time they wore the same tshirts and held the same signs they were mainly male or women in clothes so tight they seemed lifethreatening they all had vacuous smiles on their faces that gave way to cruel snarls of contempt whenever anyone went into or out of the clinic doors julie took one look at them and didnt want to leave the car i told her wed be late and she said it didnt matter wed talked about the morality of abortion already and had agreed that it was obvious that the unformed early fetus was only an extension of the mothers body and as such each woman had the right to make her own decision i reminded julie of this as she sat shivering in the car and shed said that wasnt why she didnt want to go past them she was afraid of them she said they seemed like a mindless horde capable of any violence they were directed to commit shed had no idea how right she was we drove slowly around one corner sure enough they stumbled after us then dale threw it into fourth and we screeched the rest of the way around the block when we got back to the main entrance there were only five or six still there not including one that dragged itself around on two partially eaten legs tom handed me the uzi while he took the and cradled the box dale opted for a machete i didnt want to have to see him use it minutes before he operated on me we sprinted from car to door tom shot two right between the eyes i raised the uzi forgetting its rapidfire design and ripped one of them completely apart i felt my stomach turn over as i saw some stale gray stuff splatter the doors dale just kept running shouldering the last two aside one rebounded and grabbed his left arm he whirled and brought the machete down severing the things hand then kicking it away he pried the dead hand from his arm threw it aside and told us to cover him while he unlocked the door as he fiddled with the keys tom shot the two dale had barreled through then the jammed he began to fieldstrip it and i looked nervously down the street where the ones wed tricked were shambling back led by the gruesome priest suddenly i felt something on my ankle i looked down to see the legless one had dragged itself up the steps and was bringing its gaping maw to bear on my lower calf i freaked out and grabbed the walther from dales holster i think i was screaming as i fired into the zombies peeling head it died and let go thick brown liquid draining onto its save a soulclose a clinic tshirt then dale had the doors open and we were in later tom told me he had to pry the pistol from my fingers while dale started up the generator and got things ready then before i knew it dale was there in gloves and mask saying he was ready i dont remember much of the actual operation except that i asked tom to wait outsideand the sound the horrible sound the whole time we were in there them pounding on the doors slow heavy thuds relentless unmerciful dale was as ive said before an excellent doctor and it was over soon he made sure i didnt see what he put into the tiny wooden box tom had carried in and i didnt ask the box which had been beautifully crafted by rudy v would be taken back to the colony and buried there there was one thing i had to ask though as morbid a thought as it was i had to know ifi had to be sure dale hadgod i cant even write it but he knew what i was asking and as he stripped off the gloves he told me i didnt have to worry none of the ones aborted had ever come back the rest of us had to be cremated or have the brain destroyed upon death or wed resurrect how ironic i thought that this was how we would finally lay to rest the great debate they werent human enough to come back abortion isnt murder getting out would be harder than getting in but dale had it all down tom would crawl out a side window drawing them away from dale and me dale would lock the front door while tom and i covered him then wed all head for the jeep i was of course still weak and tom didnt want to leave my side but dale told him it was the safest way and hed be sure i was okay tom reluctantly agreed it went down without mishap they were slow and easily confused and by the time they saw two of us on the stoop and one by the jeep they didnt know which way to turn tom shot a couple who were in our way once dale had the doors locked he pocketed the keys took the uzi from me and i carried the little coffin as we ran for the jeep once we were inside dale started it up and pulled away they were already hammering on the sides clawing the welded cage drooling a yellowish bile one wouldnt let go as we drove off and it got dragged fifty feet before its fingers tore off tom actually shouted something at it dale was ready to speed out of town when i asked him to stop the jeep and go back he stopped then both he and tom turned to stare at me as openmouthed as any deadhead they asked why and i just handed tom our box took the rifle got out and started walking back they ran up on either side of me tom saying i was still delirious from the operation dale arguing i could start hemorrhaging seriously i ignored them both as i saw the deadheads at the end of the street staggering forward now i had to wipe tears out of my eyesi didnt even know i was cryingas i raised the rifle and sighted on the first one i fired and saw it flung backwards to lie unmoving in the street truly finally dead tom and dale both tried to take the rifle from me but i shrugged them off and fired again tom argued we were done here and there was no point in wasting ammo on these fuckers but i told him i had to then i told himtold them bothwhy after that they left me alone until all the deadheads were gone but onethe priest my arms were shaking so bad i almost couldnt hold the gun steady but he was closethirty feet away nowand hard to miss my first shot blew part of his neckand whatever was left of the collaraway but the last one brought him down i dropped the gun and tom and dale had to carry me back to the jeep but now im at home in bed and dale says im physically okay i miss the child ill never know a pain which far outweighs the physical discomfort but jessie is here and she hugs me a long time before tom sends her to bed now im smiling as i think of that street and write this because i know that none of the women who come after me will have to endure more than the horror of giving up part of themselves meathouse man by george r r martingeorge r r martin is the bestselling author of the song of ice and fire epic fantasy series and a range of other novels including fevre dream the armageddon rag dying of the light and hunters run with daniel abraham and gardner dozois he is a prolific author of short stories which have garnered numerous nominations and wins for the fields major awards including the hugo nebula stoker and world fantasy awards his short work was recently collected in the mammoth twovolume dreamsongs in which martin relates the story of how meathouse man came to be published it first appeared in damon knights orbit but was originally intended for harlan ellisons the last dangerous visions ellison however rejected it and challenged martin to tear the guts out of the story and rewrite the whole thing from page one so martin did that and opened a vein as well while writing the story martin was emotionally in a lot of pain so he poured all of it into meathouse man and even now almost thirty years later he finds it a painful one to reread i in the meathouse they came straight from the orefields that first time trager with the others the older boys the almostmen who worked their corpses next to his cox was the oldest of the group and hed been around the most and he said that trager had to come even if he didnt want to then one of the others laughed and said that trager wouldnt even know what to do but cox the kindof leader shoved him until he was quiet and when payday came trager trailed the rest to the meathouse scared but somehow eager and he paid his money to a man downstairs and got a room key he came into the dim room trembling nervous the others had gone to other rooms had left him alone with her no it not her but it he reminded himself and promptly forgot again in a shabby gray cubicle with a single smoky light he stank of sweat and sulfur like all who walked the streets of skrakky but there was no help for that it would be better if he could bathe first but the room did not have a bath just a sink double bed with sheets that looked dirty even in the dimness a corpse she lay there naked staring at nothing breathing shallow breaths her legs were spread ready was she always that way trager wondered or had the man before him arranged her like that he didnt know he knew how to do it he did he did hed read the books cox gave him and there were films you could see and all sorts of things but he didnt know much of anything else except maybe how to handle corpses that he was good at the youngest handler on skrakky but he had to be they had forced him into the handlers school when his mother died and they made him learn so that was the thing he did this this he had never done but he knew how yes yes he did it was his first time he came to the bed slowly and sat to a chorus of creaking springs he touched her and the flesh was warm of course she was not a corpse not really no the body was alive enough a heartbeat under the heavy white breasts she breathed only the brain was gone ripped from her replaced with a deadmans synthabrain she was meat now an extra body for a corpsehandler to control just like the crew he worked each day under sulfur skies she was not a woman so it did not matter that trager was just a boy a jowly frogfaced boy who smelled of skrakky she no it remember would not care could not care emboldened aroused and hard the boy stripped off his corpsehandlers clothing and climbed in bed with the female meat he was very excited his hands shook as he stroked her studied her her skin was very white her hair dark and long but even the boy could not call her pretty her face was too flat and wide her mouth hung open and her limbs were loose and sagging with fat on her huge breasts all around the fat dark nipples the last customer had left toothmarks where hed chewed her trager touched the marks tentatively traced them with a finger then sheepish about his hesitations he grabbed one breast squeezed it hard pinched the nipple until he imagined a real girl would squeal with pain the corpse did not move still squeezing he rolled over on her and took the other breast into his mouth and the corpse responded she thrust up at him hard and meaty arms wrapped around his pimpled back to pull him to her trager groaned and reached down between her legs she was hot wet excited he trembled how did they do that could she really get excited without a mind or did they have lubricating tubes stuck into her or what then he stopped caring he fumbled found his penis put it into her thrust the corpse hooked her legs around him and thrust back it felt good real good better than anything hed ever done to himself and in some obscure way he felt proud that she was so wet and excited it only took a few strokes he was too new too young too eager to last long a few strokes was all he neededbut it was all she needed too they came together a red flush washing over her skin as she arched against him and shook soundlessly afterwards she lay again like a corpse trager was drained and satisfied but he had more time left and he was determined to get his moneys worth he explored her thoroughly sticking his fingers everywhere they would go touching her everywhere rolling it over looking at everything the corpse moved like dead meat he left her as hed found her lying face up on the bed with her legs apart meathouse courtesy the horizon was a wall of factories all factories vast belching factories that sent red shadows to flick against the sulfurdark skies the boy saw but hardly noticed he was strapped in place high atop his automill two stories up on a monster machine of corroding yellowpainted metal with savage teeth of diamond and duralloy and his eyes were blurred with triple images clear and strong and hard he saw the control panel before him the wheel the fuelfeed the bright handle of the orescoops the banks of light that would tell of trouble in the refinery under his feet the brake and emergency brake but that was not all he saw dimly faintly there were echoes overlaid images of two other control cabs almost identical to his where corpse hands moved clumsily over the instruments trager moved those hands slow and careful while another part of his mind held his own hands his real hands very still the corpse controller hummed thinly on his belt on either side of him the other two automills moved into flanking positions the corpse hands squeezed the brakes the machines rumbled to a halt on the edge of the great sloping pit they stood in a row shabby pitted juggernauts ready to descend into the gloom the pit was growing steadily larger each day new layers of rock and ore were stripped away once a mountain range had stood here but trager did not remember that the rest was easy the automills were aligned now to move the crew in unison was a cinch any decent handler could do that it was only when you had to keep several corpses busy at several different tasks that things got tricky but a good corpsehandler could do that too eightcrews were not unknown to veterans eight bodies linked to a single corpse controller moved by a single mind and eight synthabrains the deadmen were each tuned to one controller and only one the handler who wore that controller and thought corpsethoughts in its proximity field could move those deadmen like secondary bodies or like his own body if he was good enough trager checked his filtermask and earplugs quickly then touched the fuelfeed engaged flicked on the laserknives and the drills his corpses echoed his moves and pulses of light spit through the twilight of skrakky even through his plugs he could hear the awful whine as the orescoops revved up and lowered the rockeating maw of an automill was even wider than the machine was tall rumbling and screeching in perfect formation trager and his corpse crew descended into the pit before they reached the factories on the far side of the plain tons of metal would have been torn from the earth melted and refined and processed while the worthless rock was reduced to powder and blown out into the already unbreathable air he would deliver finished steel at dusk on the horizon he was a good handler trager thought as the automills started down but the handler in the meathousenow she must be an artist he imagined her down in the cellar somewhere watching each of her corpses through holos and psi circuits humping them all to please her patrons was it just a fluke then that his fuck had been so perfect or was she always that good but how how to move a dozen corpses without even being near them to have them doing different things to keep them all excited to match the needs and rhythm of each customer so exactly the air behind him was black and choked by rockdust his ears were full of screams and the far horizon was a glowering red wall beneath which yellow ants crawled and ate rock but trager kept his hardon all across the plain as the automill shook beneath him the corpses were companyowned they stayed in the company deadman depot but trager had a room a slice of the space that was his own in a steelandconcrete warehouse with a thousand other slices he only knew a handful of his neighbors but he knew all of them too they were corpsehandlers it was a world of silent shadowed corridors and endless closed doors the lobbylounge all air and plastic was a dusty deserted place where none of the tenants ever gathered the evenings were long there the nights eternal trager had bought extra lightpanels for his particular cube and when all of them were on they burned so bright that his infrequent visitors blinked and complained about the glare but always there came a time when he could read no more and then he had to turn them out and the darkness returned once more his father long gone and barely remembered had left a wealth of books and tapes and trager kept them still the room was lined with them and others stood in great piles against the foot of the bed and on either side of the bathroom door infrequently he went on with cox and the others to drink and joke and prowl for real women he imitated them as best he could but he always felt out of place so most of his nights were spent at home reading and listening to the music remembering and thinking that week he thought long after hed faded his light panels into black and his thoughts were a frightened jumble payday was coming again and cox would be after him to return to the meathouse and yes yes he wanted to it had been good exciting for once he had felt confident and virile but it was so easy cheap dirty there had to be more didnt there love whatever that was it had to be better with a real woman had to and he wouldnt find one of those in a meathouse hed never found one outside either but then hed never really had the courage to try but he had to try had to or what sort of life would he ever have beneath the covers he masturbated hardly thinking of it while he resolved not to return to the meathouse but a few days later cox laughed at him and he had to go along somehow he felt it would prove something a different room this time a different corpse fat and black with bright orange hair less attractive than his first if that was possible but trager came to her ready and eager and this time he lasted longer again the performance was superb her rhythm matched his stroke for stroke she came with him she seemed to know exactly what he wanted other visits two of them four six he was a regular now at the meathouse along with the others and he had stopped worrying about it cox and the others accepted him in a strange halfhearted way but his dislike of them had grown if anything he was better than they were he thought he could hold his own in a meathouse he could run his corpses and his automills as good as any of them and he still thought and dreamed in time hed leave them all behind leave skrakky be something they would be meathouse men as long as they would live but trager knew he could do better he believed he would find love he found none in the meathouse but the sex got better and better though it was perfect to begin with in bed with the corpses trager was never dissatisfied he did everything hed ever read about heard about dreamt about the corpses knew his needs before he did when he needed it slow they were slow when he wanted to have it hard and quick and brutal then they gave it to him that way perfectly he used every orifice they had they always knew which one to present to him his admiration of the meathouse handler grew steadily for months until it was almost worship perhaps somehow he could meet her he thought at last still a boy still hopelessly naive he was sure he would love her then he would take her away from the meathouse to a clean corpseless world where they could be happy together one day in a moment of weakness he told cox and the others cox looked at him shook his head grinned somebody else snickered then they all began to laugh what an ass you are trager cox said at last there is no fucking handler dont tell me you never heard of a feedback circuit he explained it all to laughter explained how each corpse was tuned to a controller built into its bed explained how each customer handled his own meat explained why nonhandlers found meathouse women dead and still and the boy realized suddenly why the sex was always perfect he was a better handler than even he had thought that night alone in his room with all the lights burning white and hot trager faced himself and turned away sickened he was good at his job he was proud of that but the rest it was the meathouse he decided there was a trap there in the meathouse a trap that could ruin him destroy life and dream and hope he would not go back it was too easy he would show cox show all of them he could take the hard way take the risks feel the pain if he had to and maybe the joy maybe the love hed gone the other way too long trager did not go back to the meathouse feeling strong and decisive and superior he went back to his room there as years passed he read and dreamed and waited for life to begin when i was oneandtwenty josie was the first she was beautiful had always been beautiful knew she was beautiful all that had shaped her made her what she was she was a free spirit she was aggressive confident conquering like trager she was only twenty when they met but she had lived more than he had and she seemed to have the answers he loved her from the first and trager trager before josie but years beyond the meathouse he was taller now broad and heavy with both muscle and fat often moody silent and selfcontained he ran a full fivecrew in the ore fields more than cox more than any of them at night he read books sometimes in his room sometimes in the lobby he had long since forgotten that he went there to meet someone stable solid unemotional that was trager he touched no one and no one touched him even the tortures had stopped though the scars remained inside trager hardly knew they were there he never looked at them he fit in well now with his corpses yetnot completely inside the dream something believed something hungered something yearned it was strong enough to keep him away from the meathouse from the vegetable life the others had all chosen and sometimes on bleak lonely nights it would grow stronger still then trager would rise from his empty bed dress and walk the corridors for hours with his hands shoved deep into his pockets while something twisted clawed and whimpered in his gut always before his walks were over he would resolve to do something to change his life tomorrow but when tomorrow came the silent gray corridors were halfforgotten the demons had faded and he had six roaring shaking automills to drive across the pit he would lose himself in routine and it would be long months before the feelings came again then josie they met like this it was a new field rich and unmined a vast expanse of broken rock and rubble that filled the plain low hills a few weeks ago but the company skimmers had leveled the area with systematic nuclear blast mining and now the automills were moving in tragers fivecrew had been one of the first and the change had been exhilarating at first the old pit had been just about worked out here there was a new terrain to contend with boulders and jagged rock fragments baseballsized fists of stone that came shrieking at you on the dusty wind it all seemed exciting dangerous trager wearing a leather jacket and filtermask and goggles and earplugs drove his six machines and six bodies with a fierce pride reducing boulders to powder clearing a path for the later machines fighting his way yard by yard to get whatever ore he could and one day suddenly one of the eye echoes suddenly caught his attention a light flashed red on a corpsedriven automill trager reached with his hands with his mind with five sets of corpsehands six machines stopped but still another light went red then another and another then the whole board all twelve one of his automills was out cursing he looked across the rock field towards the machine in question used his corpse to give it a kick the lights stayed red he beamed out for a tech by the time she got therein a oneman skimmer that looked like a teardrop of pitted black metaltrager had unstrapped climbed down the metal rings on the side of the automill walked across the rocks to where the dead machine stopped he was just starting to climb up when josie arrived they met at the foot of the yellowmetal mountain in the shadow of its treads she was fieldwise he knew at once she wore a handlers coverall earplugs heavy goggles and her face was smeared with grease to prevent dust abrasions but still she was beautiful her hair was short light brown cut in a shag that was jumbled by the wind her eyes when she lifted the goggles were bright green she took charge immediately all business she introduced herself asked him a few questions then opened a repair bay and crawled inside into the guts of the drive and the oresmelt and the refinery it didnt take her long ten minutes maybe and she was back outside dont go in there she said tossing her hair from in front of her goggles with a flick of her head youve got a damper failure the nukes are running away oh said trager his mind was hardly on the automill but he had to make an impression made to say something intelligent is it going to blow up he asked and as soon as he said it he knew that that hadnt been intelligent at all of course it wasnt going to blow up runaway nuclear reactors didnt work that way he knew that but josie seemed amused she smiledthe first time he saw her distinctive flashing grinand seemed to see him him trager not just a corpsehandler no she said it will just melt itself down wont even get hot out here since youve got shields built into the walls just dont go in there all right pause what could he say now what do i do work the rest of your crew i guess this machinell have to be scrapped it should have been overhauled a long time ago from the looks of it theres been a lot of patching done in the past stupid it breaks down it breaks down it breaks down and they keep sending it out should realize that something is wrong after that many failures its sheer selfdelusion to think the things going to work right next time out i guess trager said josie smiled at him again sealed up the panel and started to turn wait he said it came out before he could stop it almost in spite of him josie turned cocked her head looked at him questioningly and trager drew a sudden strength from the steel and the stone and the wind under sulfur skies his dreams seemed less impossible maybe he thought maybe uh im greg trager will i see you again josie grinned sure come tonight she gave him the address he climbed back into his automill after she had left exulting in his six strong bodies all fire and life and he chewed up rock with something near to joy the dark red glow in the distance looked almost like a sunrise when he got to josies he found four other people there friends of hers it was a party of sorts josie threw a lot of parties and tragerfrom that night onwent to all of them josie talked to him laughed with him liked him and suddenly his life was no longer the same with josie he saw parts of skrakky he had never seen before did things he had never done he stood with her in the crowds that gathered on the streets at night stood in the dusty wind and sickly yellow light between the windowless concrete buildings stood and bet and cheered himself hoarse while greasestained mechs raced yellow rumbly tractortrucks up and down and down and up he walked with her through the strangely silent and white and clean underground offices and sealed airconditioned corridors where offworlders and papershufflers and company executives lived and worked he prowled the recmalls with her those huge low buildings so like a warehouse from the outside but full of colored lights and game rooms and cafeterias and tape shops and endless bars where handlers made their rounds he went with her to dormitory gyms where they watched handlers less skillful than himself send their corpses against each other with clumsy fists he sat with her and her friends and they woke dark quiet taverns with their talk and with their laughter and once trager saw someone looking much like cox staring at him from across the room and he smiled and leaned a bit closer to josie he hardly noticed the other people the crowds that josie surrounded herself with when they went out on one of her wild jaunts six of them or eight or ten trager would tell himself that he and josie were going out and that some others had come along with them once in a great while things would work out so they were alone together at her place or his then they would talk of distant worlds of politics of corpses and life on skrakky of the books they both consumed of sports or games or friends they had in common they shared a good deal trager talked a lot with josie and never said a word he loved her of course he suspected it the first month and soon he was convinced of it he loved her this was the real thing the thing he had been waiting for and it had happened just as he knew it would but with his love agony he could not tell her a dozen times he tried the words would never come what if she did not love him back his nights were still alone in the small room with the white lights and the books and the pain he was more alone than ever now the peace of his routine of his halflife with his corpses was gone stripped from him by day he rode the great automills moved his corpses smashed rock and melted ore and in his head rehearsed the words hed say to josie and dreamed of those that shed speak back she was trapped too he thought shed had men of course but she didnt love them she loved him but she couldnt tell him any more than he could tell her when he broke through when he found the words and the courage then everything would be all right each day he said that to himself and dug swift and deep into the earth but back home the sureness faded then with awful despair he knew that he was kidding himself he was a friend to her nothing more never would be more why did he lie to himself hed had hints enough they had never been lovers never would be on the few times hed worked up the courage to touch her she would smile move away on some pretext so he was never quite sure that he was being rejected but he got the idea and in the dark it tore at him he walked the corridors weekly now sullen desperate wanting to talk to someone without knowing how and all the old scars woke up to bleed again until the next day when he would return to his machines and believe again he must believe in himself he knew that he shouted it out loud he must stop feeling sorry for himself he must do something he must tell josie he would and she would love him cried the day and she would laugh the nights replied trager chased her for a year a year of pain and promise the first year that he had ever lived on that the nightfears and the dayvoice agreed he was alive now he would never return to the emptiness of his time before josie he would never go back to the meathouse that far at least he had come he could change and someday he would be strong enough to tell her josie and two friends dropped by his room that night but the friends had to leave early for an hour or so they were alone talking about nothing finally she had to go trager said hed walk her home he kept his arm around her down the long corridors and he watched her face watched the play of light and shadow on her cheeks as they walked from light to darkness josie he started he felt so fine so good so warm and it came out i love you and she stopped pulled away from him stepped back her mouth opened just a little and something flickered in her eyes oh greg she said softly sadly no greg no dont dont and she shook her head trembling slightly mouthing silent words trager held out his hand josie did not take it he touched her cheek gently and wordless she spun away from him then for the first time ever trager shook and the tears came josie took him to her room there sitting across from each other on the floor never touching they talked j known it for a long time tried to discourage you greg but i didnt just want to come right out and i never wanted to hurt you a good person dont worry t knew it all along that it would never lied to myself wanted to believe even if it wasnt true im sorry josie im sorry im sorry im sorryimsorryimsorry j afraid you would go back to what you were dont greg promise me cant give up have to believe t why j stop believing then you have nothing dead you can do better a good handler get off skrakky find something no life here someone you will you will just believe keep on believing t you love you forever josie forever how can i find someone never anyone like you never special j oh greg lots of people just look open t laughter open first time i ever talked to anyone j talk to me again if you have to i can talk to you had enough lovers everyone wants to get to bed with me better just to be friends t friends laughter tears ii promises of someday the fire had burned out long ago and stevens and the forester had retired but trager and donelly still sat around the ashes on the edges of the clear zone they talked softly so as not to wake the others yet their words hung long in the restless night air the uncut forest standing dark behind them was dead still the wildlife of vendalia had all fled the noise that the fleet of buzztrucks made during the day a full sixcrew running buzztrucks i know enough to know thats not easy donelly was saying he was a pale timid youth likeable but selfconscious about everything he did trager heard echoes of himself in donellys stiff words youd do well in the arena trager nodded thoughtful his eyes on the ashes as he moved them with a stick i came to vendalia with that in mind went to the gladiatorial once only once that was enough to change my mind i could take them i guess but the whole idea made me sick out here well the money doesnt even match what i was getting on skrakky but the work is well clean you know sort of said donelly still you know it isnt like they were real people out there in the arena only meat all you can do is make the bodies as dead as the minds thats the logical way to look at it trager chuckled youre too logical don you ought to feel more listen next time youre in gidyon go to the gladiatorials and take a look its ugly ugly corpses stumbling around with axes and swords and morningstars hacking and hewing at each other butchery thats all it is and the audience the way they cheer at each blow and laugh they laugh don no he shook his head sharply no donelly never abandoned an argument but why not i dont understand greg youd be good at it the best ive seen the way you work your crew trager looked up studied donelly briefly while the youth sat quietly waiting josies words came back open be open the old trager the trager who lived friendless and alone and closed inside a skrakky handlers dorm was gone he had grown changed there was a girl he said slowly with measured words opening back on skrakky don there was a girl i loved it well it didnt work out thats why im here i guess im looking for someone else for something better thats all part of it you see he stopped paused tried to think his words out this girl josie i wanted her to love me you know the words came hard admire me all that stuff now yeah sure i could do good running corpses in the arena but josie could never love someone who had a job like that shes gone now of course but still the kind of person im looking for i couldnt find them as an arena corpsemaster he stood up abruptly i dont know thats whats important though to me josie somebody like her someday soon i hope donelly sat quiet in the moonlight chewing his lip not looking at trager his logic suddenly useless while trager his corridors long gone walked off alone into the woods they had a tightknit group three handlers a forester thirteen corpses each day they drove the forest back with trager in the forefront against the vendalian wilderness against the blackbriars and the hard gray ironspike trees and the bulbous rubbery snaplimbs against the tangled hostile forest he would throw his sixcrew and their buzztrucks smaller than the automills hed run on skrakky fast and airborne complex and demanding those were buzztrucks trager ran six of them with corpse hands a seventh with his own before his screaming blades and laser knives the wall of wilderness fell each day donelly came behind him pushing three of the mountainsized rolling mills to turn the fallen trees into lumber for gidyon and other cities of vendalia then stevens the third handler with a flamecannon to burn down stumps and melt rocks and the soilpumps that would ready the fresh clear land for farming the forester was their foreman the procedure was a science clean hard demanding work trager thrived on it by day he grew lean almost athletic the lines of his face tightened and tanned he grew steadily browner under vendalias hot bright sun his corpses were almost part of him so easily did he move them fly their buzztrucks as an ordinary man might move a hand a foot sometimes his control grew so firm the echoes so clear and strong that trager felt he was not a handler working a crew at all but rather a man with seven bodies seven strong bodies that rode the sultry forest winds he exulted in their sweat and the evenings after work ceased they were good too trager found a sort of peace there a sense of belonging he had never known on skrakky the vendalian foresters rotated back and forth from gidyon were decent enough and friendly stevens was a hearty slab of a man who seldom stopped joking long enough to talk about anything serious trager always found him amusing and donelly the selfconscious youth the quiet logical voice he became a friend he was a good listener empathetic compassionate and the new open trager was a good talker something close to envy shone in donellys eyes when trager spoke of josie and exorcised his soul and trager knew or thought he knew that donelly was himself the old trager the one before josie who could not find the words in time though after days and weeks of talking donelly found his words then trager listened and shared anothers pain and he felt good about it he was helping he was lending strength he was needed each night around the ashes the two men traded dreams and wove a hopeful tapestry of promises and lies yet still the nights would come those were the worst times as always those were the hours of tragers long lonely walks if josie had given trager much she had taken something too she had taken the curious deadness he had once had the trick of notthinking the painblotter of his mind on skrakky he had walked the corridors infrequently the forest knew him far more often after the talking all had stopped after donelly had gone to bed that was when it would happen when josie would come to him in the loneliness of his tent a thousand nights he lay there with his hands hooked behind his head staring at the plastic tent film while he relived the night hed told her a thousand times he touched her cheek and saw her spin away he would think of it and fight it and lose then restless he would rise and go outside he would walk across the clear area into the silent looming forest brushing aside low branches and tripping on the underbrush he would walk until he found water then he would sit down by a scumchoked lake or a gurgling stream that ran swift and oily in the moonlight he would fling rocks into the water hurl them hard and flat into the night to hear them when they splashed he would sit for hours throwing rocks and thinking till finally he could convince himself the sun would rise gidyon the city the heart of vendalia and through it of slagg and skrakky and new pittsburg and all the other corpseworlds the harsh ugly places where men would not work and corpses had to great towers of black and silver metal floating aerial sculpture that flashed in the sunlight and shone softly at night the vast bustling spaceport where freighters rose and fell on invisible firewands malls where the pavement was polished ironspike wood that gleamed a gentle gray gidyon the city with the rot the corpse city the meatmart for the freighters carried cargoes of men criminals and derelicts and troublemakers from a dozen worlds bought with hard vendalian cash and there were darker rumors of liners that had vanished mysteriously on routine tourist hops and the soaring towers were hospitals and corpseyards where men and women died and deadmen were born to walk anew and all along the ironspike boardwalks were corpsesellers shops and meathouses the meathouses of vendalia were farfamed the corpses were guaranteed beautiful trager sat across from one on the other side of the wide gray avenue under the umbrella of an outdoor cafe he sipped a bittersweet wine thought about how his leave had evaporated too quickly and tried to keep his eyes from wandering across the street the wine was warm on his tongue and his eyes were very restless up and down the avenue between him and the meathouse strangers moved darkfaced corpsehandlers from vendalia skrakky slagg pudgy merchants gawking tourists from the clean worlds like old earth and zephyr and dozens of question marks whose names and occupations and errands trager would never know sitting there drinking his wine and watching trager felt utterly cut off he could not touch these people could not reach them he didnt know how it wasnt possible it wouldnt work he could rise and walk out into the street and grab one and still they would not touch the stranger would only pull free and run all his leave like that all of it hed run through all the bars of gidyon forced a thousand contacts and nothing had clicked his wine was gone trager looked at the glass dully turning it in his hands blinking then abruptly he stood up and paid his bill his hands trembled it had been so many years he thought as he started across the street josie he thought forgive me trager returned to the wilderness camp and his corpses flew their buzztrucks like men gone wild but he was strangely silent around the campfire and he did not talk to donelly at night until finally hurt and puzzled donelly followed him into the forest and found him by a languid deathdark stream sitting on the bank with a pile of throwing stones at his feet t went in after all i said all i promised still i went in d nothing to worry remember what you told me keep on believing t did believe did no difficulties josie d you say i shouldnt give up you better not repeat everything you told me everything josie told you everybody finds someone if they keep looking give up dead all you need openness courage to look stop feeling sorry for yourself told me that a hundred times t fucking lot easier to tell you than do it myself d greg not a meathouse man a dreamer better than they are t sighing yeah hard though why do i do this to myself d rather be like you were not hurting not living like me t no no youre right the pilgrim up and down her name was laurel she was nothing like josie save in one thing alone trager loved her pretty trager didnt think so not at first she was too tall a halffoot taller than he was and she was a bit on the heavy side and more than a bit on the awkward side her hair was her best feature her hair that was redbrown in winter and glowing blond in summer that fell long and straight down past her shoulders and did wild beautiful things in the wind but she was not beautiful not the way josie had been beautiful although oddly she grew more beautiful with time and maybe that was because she was losing weight and maybe that was because trager was falling in love with her and seeing her through kinder eyes and maybe that was because he told her she was pretty and the very telling made it so just as laurel told him he was wise and her belief gave him wisdom whatever the reason laurel was very beautiful indeed after he had known her for a time she was five years younger than he cleanscrubbed and innocent shy where josie had been assertive she was intelligent romantic a dreamer she was wondrously fresh and eager she was painfully insecure and full of hungry need she was new to gidyon fresh from the vendalian outback a student forester trager on leave again was visiting the forestry college to say hello to a teacher whod once worked with his crew they met in the teachers office trager had two weeks free in a city of strangers and meathouses laurel was alone he showed her the glittering decadence of gidyon feeling smooth and sophisticated and she was suitably impressed two weeks went quickly they came to the last night trager suddenly afraid took her to the park by the river that ran through gidyon and they sat together on the low stone wall by the waters edge close not touching time runs too fast he said he had a stone in his hand he flicked it out over the water flat and hard thoughtfully he watched it splash and sink then he looked at her im nervous he said laughing ilaurel i dont want to leave her face was unreadable wary the city is nice she agreed trager shook his head violently no no not the city you laurel i think i well laurel smiled for him her eyes were bright very happy i know she said trager could hardly believe it he reached out touched her cheek she turned her head and kissed his hand they smiled at each other he flew back to the forest camp to quit don don youve got to meet her he shouted see you can do it i did it just keep believing keep trying i feel so goddamn good its obscene donelly stiff and logical smiled for him at a loss as how to handle such a flood of happiness what will you do he asked a little awkwardly the arena trager laughed hardly you know how i feel but something like that theres a theatre near the spaceport puts on pantomime with corpse actors ive got a job there the pay is rotten but ill be near laurel thats all that matters they hardly slept at night instead they talked and cuddled and made love the lovemaking was a joy a game a glorious discovery never as good technically as the meathouse but trager hardly cared he taught her to be open he told her every secret he had and wished he had more secrets poor josie laurel would often say at night her body warm against his she doesnt know what she missed im lucky there couldnt be anyone else like you no said trager im lucky they would argue about it laughing donelly came to gidyon and joined the theatre without trager the forest work had been no fun he said the three of them spent a lot of time together and trager glowed he wanted to share his friends with laurel and hed already mentioned donelly a lot and he wanted donelly to see how happy hed become to see what belief could accomplish i like her donelly said smiling the first night after laurel had left good trager replied nodding no said donelly greg i really like her they spent a lot of time together greg laurel said one night in bed i think that don is well after me you know trager rolled over and propped his head up on his elbow god he said he sounded concerned i dont know how to handle it carefully trager said hes very vulnerable youre probably the first woman hes ever been interested in dont be too hard on him he shouldnt have to go through the stuff i went through you know the sex was never as good as a meathouse and after a while laurel began to close more and more nights now she went to sleep after they made love the days when they talked till dawn were gone perhaps they had nothing left to say trager had noticed that she had a tendency to finish his stories for him it was nearly impossible to come up with one he hadnt already told her he said that trager got out of bed turned on a light and sat down frowning laurel pulled the covers up to her chin well what did you say she hesitated i cant tell you its between don and me he said it wasnt fair the way i turn around and tell you everything that goes on between us and hes right right but i tell you everything dont you remember what we i know but trager shook his head his voice lost some of its anger whats going on laurel huh im scared all of a sudden i love you remember how can everything change so fast her face softened she sat up and held out her arms and the covers fell back from full soft breasts oh greg she said dont worry i love you i always will but its just that i love him too i guess you know trager mollified came into her arms and kissed her with fervor then suddenly he broke off hey he said with mock sternness to hide the trembling in his voice who do you love more you of course always you smiling he returned to the kiss i know you know donelly said i guess we have to talk about it trager nodded they were backstage in the theatre three of his corpses walked up behind him and stood arms crossed like a guard all right he looked straight at donelly and his facesmiling until the others wordswas suddenly stern laurel asked me to pretend i didnt know anything she said you felt guilty but pretending was quite a strain don i guess its time we got everything out in the open donellys pale blue eyes shifted to the floor and he stuck his hands into his pockets i dont want to hurt you he said then dont but im not going to pretend im dead either im not i love her too youre supposed to be my friend don love someone else youre just going to get yourself hurt this way i have more in common with her than you do trager just stared donelly looked up at him then abashed back down again i dont know oh greg she loves you more anyway she said so i never should have expected anything else i feel like ive stabbed you in the back i trager watched him finally he laughed softly oh shit i cant take this look don you havent stabbed me cmon dont talk like that i guess if you love her this is the way its got to be you know i just hope everything comes out all right later that night in bed with laurel im worried about him he told her his face once tanned now ashen laurel he said not believing i dont love you anymore im sorry i dont it seemed real at the time but now its almost like a dream i dont even know if i ever loved you really don he said woodenly laurel flushed dont say anything bad about don im tired of hearing you run him down he never says anything except good about you oh laurel dont you remember the things we said the way we felt im the same person you said those words to but ive grown laurel said hard and tearless tossing her redgold hair i remember perfectly well but i just dont feel that way anymore dont he said he reached for her she stepped back keep your hands off me i told you greg its over you have to leave now don is coming by it was worse than josie a thousand times worse iii wanderings he tried to keep on at the theatre he enjoyed the work he had friends there but it was impossible donelly was there every day smiling and being friendly and sometimes laurel came to meet him after the days show and they went off together arm in arm trager would stand and watch try not to notice while the twisted thing inside him shrieked and clawed he quit he would not see them again he would keep his pride the sky was bright with the lights of gidyon and full of laughter but it was dark and quiet in the park trager stood stiff against a tree his eyes on the river his hands folded tightly against his chest he was a statue he hardly seemed to breathe not even his eyes moved kneeling near the low wall the corpse pounded until the stone was slick with blood and its hands were mangled clots of torn meat the sounds of the blows were dull and wet but for the infrequent scraping of bone against rock they made him pay first before he could even enter the booth then he sat there for an hour while they found her and punched through finally though finally josie greg she said grinning her distinctive grin i should have known who else would call all the way from vendalia how are you he told her her grin vanished oh greg she said im sorry but dont let it get to you keep going the next one will work out better they always do her words didnt satisfy him josie he said how are things back there you miss me oh sure things are pretty good its still skrakky though stay where you are youre better off she looked offscreen then back i should go before your bill gets enormous glad you called love josie trager started but the screen was already dark sometimes at night he couldnt help himself he would move to his home screen and ring laurel invariably her eyes would narrow when she saw who it was then she would hang up and trager would sit in a dark room and recall how once the sound of his voice made her so very very happy the streets of gidyon are not the best of places for lonely midnight walks they are brightly lit even in the darkest hours and jammed with men and deadmen and there are meathouses all up and down the boulevards and the ironspike boardwalks josies words had lost their power in the meathouses trager abandoned dreams and found cheap solace the sensuous evenings with laurel and the fumbling sex of his boyhood were things of yesterday trager took his meatmates hard and quick almost brutally fucked them with a wordless savage power to the inevitable perfect orgasm sometimes remembering the theatre he would have them act out short erotic playlets to get him in the mood in the night agony he was in the corridors again the low dim corridors of the corpsehandlers dorm on skrakky but now the corridors were twisted and torturous and trager had long since lost his way the air was thick with a rotting gray haze and growing thicker soon he feared he would be all but blind around and around he walked up and down but always there was more corridor and all of them led nowhere the doors were grim black rectangles knobless locked to him forever he passed them by without thinking most of them once or twice though he paused before doors where light leaked around the frame he would listen and inside there were sounds and then he would begin to knock wildly but no one ever answered so he would move on through the haze that got darker and thicker and seemed to burn his skin past door after door after door until he was weeping and his feet were tired and bloody and then off a ways down a long long corridor that loomed straight before him he would see an open door from it came light so hot and white it hurt the eyes and music bright and joyful and the sounds of people laughing then trager would run though his feet were raw bundles of pain and his lungs burned with the haze he was breathing he would run and run until he reached the room with the open door only when he got there it was his room and it was empty once in the middle of their brief time together theyd gone out into the wilderness and made love under the stars afterwards she had snuggled hard against him and he stroked her gently what are you thinking he asked about us laurel said she shivered the wind was brisk and cold sometimes i get scared greg im so afraid something will happen to us something that will ruin it i dont ever want you to leave me dont worry he told her i wont now each night before sleep came he tortured himself with her words the good memories left him with ashes and tears the bad ones with a wordless rage he slept with a ghost beside him a supernaturally beautiful ghost the husk of a dead dream he woke to her each morning he hated them he hated himself for hating duvaliers dream her name does not matter her looks are not important all that counts is that she was that trager tried again that he forced himself on and made himself believe and didnt give up he tried but something was missing magic the words were the same how many times can you speak them trager wondered speak them and believe them like you believed them the first time you said them once twice three times maybe or a hundred and the people who say it a hundred times are they really so much better at loving or only at fooling themselves arent they really people who long ago abandoned the dream who use its name for something else he said the words holding her cradling her and kissing her he said the words with a knowledge that was surer and heavier and more dead than any belief he said the words and tried but no longer could he mean them and she said the words back and trager realized that they meant nothing to him over and over again they said the things each wanted to hear and both of them knew they were pretending they tried hard but when he reached out like an actor caught in his role doomed to play out the same part over and over again when he reached out his hand and touched her cheekthe skin was smooth and soft and lovely and wet with tears iv echoes i dont want to hurt you said donelly shuffling and looking guilty until trager felt ashamed for having hurt a friend he touched her cheek and she spun away from him i never wanted to hurt you josie said and trager was sad she had given him so much hed only made her guilty yes he was hurt but a stronger man would never have let her know he touched her cheek and she kissed his hand im sorry i dont laurel said and trager was lost what had he done where was his fault how had he ruined it she had been so sure they had had so much he touched her cheek and she wept how many times can you speak them his voice echoed speak them and believe them like you believed them the first time you said them the wind was dark and dust heavy the sky throbbed painfully with flickering scarlet flame in the pit in the darkness stood a young woman with goggles and a filtermask and short brown hair and answers it breaks down it breaks down it breaks down and they keep sending it out she said should realize that something is wrong after that many failures its sheer selfdelusion to think the things going to work right next time out the enemy corpse is huge and black its torso rippling with muscle a product of months of exercise the biggest thing that trager has ever faced it advances across the sawdust in a slow clumsy crouch holding the gleaming broadsword in one hand trager watches it come from his chair atop one end of the fighting arena the other corpsemaster is careful cautious his own deadman a wiry blond stands and waits a morningstar trailing down in the bloodsoaked arena dust trager will move him fast enough and well enough when the time is right the enemy knows it and the crowd the black corpse suddenly lifts its broadsword and scrambles forward in a run hoping to use reach and speed to get its kill but tragers corpse is no longer there when the enemys measured blow cuts the air where he had been sitting comfortably above the fighting pitdown in the arena his feet grimy with blood and sawdusttragerthe corpsesnaps the commandswings the morningstarand the great studded ball drifts up and around almost lazily almost gracefully into the back of the enemys head as he tries to recover and turn a flower of blood and brain blooms swift and sudden and the crowd cheers trager walks his corpse from the arena then stands to receive applause it is his tenth kill soon the championship will be his he is building such a record that they can no longer deny him a match she is beautiful his lady his love her hair is short and blond her body very slim graceful almost athletic with trim legs and small hard breasts her eyes are bright green and they always welcome him and there is a strange erotic innocence in her smile she waits for him in bed waits for his return from the arena waits for him eager and playful and loving when he enters she is sitting up smiling for him the covers bunched around her waist from the door he admires her nipples aware of his eyes shy she covers her breasts and blushes trager knows it is all false modesty all playing he moves to the bedside sits reaches out to stroke her cheek her skin is very soft she nuzzles against his hand as it brushes her then trager draws her hands aside plants one gentle kiss on each breast and a notsogentle kiss on her mouth she kisses back with ardor their tongues dance they make love he and she slow and sensuous locked together in a loving embrace that goes on and on two bodies move flawlessly in perfect rhythm each knowing the others needs trager thrusts and his other body meets the thrusts he reaches and her hand is there they come together always always both orgasms triggered by the handlers brain and a bright red flush burns on her breasts and earlobes they kiss afterwards he talks to her his love his lady you should always talk afterwards he learned that long ago youre lucky he tells her sometimes and she snuggles up to him and plants tiny kisses all across his chest very lucky they lie to you out there love they teach you a silly shining dream and they tell you to believe and chase it and they tell you that for you for everyone there is someone but its all wrong the universe isnt fair it never has been so why do they tell you so you run after the phantom and lose and they tell you next time but its all rot all empty rot nobody ever finds the dream at all they just kid themselves trick themselves so they can go on believing its just a clutching lie that desperate people tell each other hoping to convince themselves but then he cant talk anymore for her kisses have gone lower and lower and now she takes him in her mouth and trager smiles at his love and gently strokes her

with dead folks and his cultclassic novel dead in the west lansdale says that this story features lots of flashing teeth and blazing six guns and boy is he right the storywhich features the guntoting reverend from dead in the westjumped into his head fullblown when he encountered a sign while traveling that read simply dead mans road the evening sun had rolled down and blown out in a bloody wad and the white full moon had rolled up like an enormous ball of tightly wrapped twine as he rode the reverend jebidiah rains watched it glow above the tall pines all about it stars were sprinkled whitehot in the deadblack heavens the trail he rode on was a thin one and the trees on either side of it crept toward the path as if they might block the way and close up behind him the weary horse on which he was riding moved forward with its head down and jebidiah too weak to fight it let his mount droop and take its lead jebidiah was too tired to know much at that moment but he knew one thing he was a man of the lord and he hated god hated the sonofabitch with all his heart and he knew god knew and didnt care because he knew jebidiah was his messenger not one of the new testament but one of the old testament harsh and mean and certain vengeful and without compromise a man who would have shot a leg out from under moses and spat in the face of the holy ghost and scalped him tossing his celestial hair to the wild four winds it was not a legacy jebidiah would have preferred being the bad man messenger of god but it was his and he had earned it through sin and no matter how hard he tried to lay it down and leave it be he could not he knew that to give in and abandon his godgiven curse was to burn in hell forever and to continue was to do as the lord prescribed no matter what his feelings toward his mean master might be his lord was not a forgiving lord nor was he one who cared for your love all he cared for was obedience servitude and humiliation it was why god had invented the human race amusement as he thought on these matters the trail turned and widened and off to one side amongst tree stumps was a fairly large clearing and in its center was a small log house and out to the side a somewhat larger log barn in the curtained window of the cabin was a light that burned orange behind the floursack curtains jebidiah feeling tired and hungry and thirsty and weary of soul made for it stopping a short distance from the cabin jebidiah leaned forward on his horse and called out hello the cabin he waited for a time called again and was halfway through calling when the door opened and a man about fivefoot two with a large droopy hat holding a rifle stuck himself part of the way out of the cabin said who is it calling you got a voice like a bullfrog reverend jebidiah rains you aint come to preach none have you no sir i find it does no good im here to beg for a place in your barn a night under its roof something for my horse something for myself if its available most anything as long as water is involved well said the man this seems to be the gathering place tonight done got two others and we just sat asses down to eat i got enough you want it some hot beans and some old bread i would be most obliged sir jebidiah said oblige all you want in the meantime climb down from that nag put it in the barn and come in and chow they call me old timer but i aint that old its cause most of my teeth are gone and im crippled in a foot a horse stepped on theres a lantern just inside the barn door light that up and put it out when you finish come on back to the house when jebidiah finished grooming and feeding his horse with grain in the barn watering him he came into the cabin made a show of pushing his long black coat back so that it revealed his ivoryhandled cartridgeconverted revolvers they were set so that they leaned forward in their holsters strapped close to the hips not draped low like punks wore them jebidiah liked to wear them close to the natural swing of his hands when he pulled them it was a movement quick as the flick of a hummingbirds wings the hammers clicking from the cock of his thumb the guns barking spewing lead with amazing accuracy he had practiced enough to drive a cork into a bottle at about a hundred paces and he could do it in bad light he chose to reveal his guns that way to show he was ready for any attempted ambush he reached up and pushed his widebrimmed black hat back on his head showing black hair gone graytipped he thought having his hat tipped made him look casual it did not his eyes always seemed aflame in an angry face inside the cabin was bright with kerosene lamp light and the kerosene smelled and there were curls of black smoke twisting about mixing with gray smoke from the pipe of old timer and the cigarette of a young man with a badge pinned to his shirt beside him sitting on a chopping log by the fireplace which was too hot for the time of year but was being used to heat up a pot of beans was a middleaged man with a slight paunch and a face that looked like it attracted thrown objects he had his hat pushed up a bit and a shock of wheatcolored sweaty hair hung on his forehead there was a cigarette in his mouth half of it ash he twisted on the chopping log and jebidiah saw that his hands were manacled together i heard you say you was a preacher said the manacled man as he tossed the last of his smoke into the fireplace this here sure aint gods country worse thing is said jebidiah its exactly gods country the manacled man gave out with a snort and grinned preacher said the younger man my name is jim taylor im a deputy for sheriff spradley out of nacogdoches im taking this man there for a trial and most likely a hanging he killed a fella for a rifle and a horse i see you tote guns old style guns but good ones way you tote them im suspecting you know how to use them ive been known to hit what i aim at jebidiah said and sat in a rickety chair at an equally rickety table old timer put some tin plates on the table scratched his ass with a long wooden spoon then grabbed a rag and used it as a pot holder lifted the hot bean pot to the table he popped the lid off the pot used the assscratching spoon to scoop a heap of beans onto plates he brought over some wooden cups and poured them full from a pitcher of water thing is the deputy said i could use some help i dont know i can get back safe with this fella havin not slept good in a day or two was wondering you and old timer here could watch my back till morning wouldnt even mind if you rode along with me tomorrow as sort of a backup i could use a gun hand sheriff might even give you a dollar for it old timer as if this conversation had not been going on brought over a bowl with some moldy biscuits in it placed them on the table made them a week ago theyve gotten a bit ripe but you can scratch around the mold ill warn you though theyre tough enough you could toss one hard and kill a chicken on the run so mind your teeth that how you lost yours old timer the manacled man said probably part of them old timer said what you say preacher the deputy said you let me get some sleep my problem lies in the fact that i need sleep jebidiah said ive been busy and im what could be referred to as tuckered guess im the only one that feels spry said the manacled man no said old timer i feel right fresh myself then its you and me old timer the manacled man said and grinned as if this meant something you give me cause fella ill blow a hole in you and tell god you got in a nest of termites the manacled man gave his snort of a laugh again he seemed to be having a good old time me and old timer can work shifts jebidiah said that okay with you old timer peachy old timer said and took another plate from the table and filled it with beans he gave this one to the manacled man who said lifting his bound hands to take it what do i eat it with your mouth aint got no extra spoons and i aint giving you a knife the manacled man thought on this for a moment grinned lifted the plate and put his face close to the edge of it sort of poured the beans toward his mouth he lowered the plate and chewed reckon they taste scorched with or without a spoon jebidiah reached inside his coat took out and opened up a pocket knife used it to spear one of the biscuits and to scrape the beans toward him you come to the table young fella old timer said to the deputy ill get my shotgun he makes a move that aint eatin ill blast him and the beans inside him into that fireplace there old timer sat with a double barrel shotgun resting on his leg pointed in the general direction of the manacled man the deputy told all that his prisoner had done while he ate murdered women and children shot a dog and a horse and just for the hell of it shot a cat off a fence and set fire to an outhouse with a woman in it he had also raped women stuck a stick up a sheriffs ass and killed him and most likely shot other animals that might have been some good to somebody overall he was tough on human beings and equally as tough on livestock i never did like animals the manacled man said carry fleas and that woman in the outhouse stunk to high heaven she ought to eat better she needed burning shut up the deputy said this fella and he nodded toward the prisoner his name is bill barrett and hes the worst of the worst thing is well im not just tired im a little wounded he and i had a tussle i hadnt surprised him wouldnt be here today i got a bullet graze in my hip we had quite a dust up i finally got him down by putting a gun barrel to his noggin half a dozen times or so im not hurt so bad but i lost blood for a couple days weakened me youd ride along with me reverend id appreciate it ill consider it jebidiah said but im about my business who you gonna preach to along here sides us the deputy said dont even think about it old timer said just thinking about that jesus foolishness makes my ass tired preaching makes me want to kill the preacher and cut my own throat being at a preachin is like being tied down in a nest red bitin ants at this point in my life jebidiah said i agree there was a moment of silence in response to jebidiah then the deputy turned his attention to old timer whats the fastest route to nacogdoches well now old timer said you can keep going like you been going following the road out front and in time youll run into a road say thirty miles from here and it goes left that should take you right near nacogdoches which is another ten miles though youll have to make a turn somewhere up in there near the end of the trip aint exactly sure where unless im looking at it whole trip traveling at an even pace ought to take you two day you could go with us the deputy said make sure i find that road could said old timer but i wont i dont ride so good anymore my balls ache i ride a horse for too long last time i rode a pretty good piece i had to squat over a pan of warm water and salt soak my taters for an hour or so just so theyd fit back in my pants my balls ache just listening to you the prisoner said thing is though them swollen up like that was probably the first time in your life you had mansized balls you old fart you should have left them swollen old timer cocked back the hammers on the double barrel this here could go off bill just grinned leaned his back against the fireplace then jumped forward for a moment it looked as if old timer might cut him in half but he realized what had happened oh yeah old timer said that theres hot stupid why they call it a fire place bill readjusted himself so that his back wasnt against the stones he said im gonna cut this deputys pecker off come back here make you fry it up and eat it youre gonna shit and fall back in it old timer said thats all youre gonna do when things had calmed down again the deputy said to old timer theres no faster route old timer thought for a moment none youd want to take whats that mean the deputy said old timer slowly lowered the hammers on the shotgun smiling at bill all the while when he had them lowered he turned his head looked at the deputy well theres deadmans road whats wrong with that the deputy asked all manner of things used to be called cemetery road couple years back that changed jebidiahs interest was aroused tell us about it old timer now i aint one to believe in hogwash but theres a story about the road and i got it from someone you might say was the horses mouth a ghost story thats choice said bill how much time would the road cut off going to nacogdoches the deputy asked near a day old timer said damn then thats the way i got to go the deputy said turn off for it aint far from here but i wouldnt recommend it old timer said i aint much for jesus but i believe in haints things like that living out here in this thicket you see some strange things theres gods aint got nothing to do with jesus or moses or any of that bunch theres older gods than that indians talk about them im not afraid of any indian gods the deputy said maybe not old timer said but these gods even the indians aint fond of them they aint their gods these gods are older than the indian folk their ownselfs indians try not to stir them up they worship their own and why would this road be different than any other jebidiah asked what does it have to do with ancient gods old timer grinned youre just wanting to challenge it aint you reverend prove how strong your god is you werent no preacher youd be a gunfighter i reckon or maybe you are just that a gunfighter preacher im not that fond of my god jebidiah said but i have been given a duty drive out evil evil as my god sees it if these gods are evil and theyre in my path then i have to confront them theyre evil all right old timer said tell us about them jebidiah said gil gimet was a bee keeper old timer said he raised honey and lived off of deadmans road known then as cemetery road thats cause there was a graveyard down there it had some old spanish graves in it some said conquistadores who tromped through here but didnt tromp out i know there was some indians buried there early christian indians i reckon certainly there were stones and crosses up and indian names on the crosses maybe mixed breeds lots of intermarrying around here anyway there were all manner people buried up there the dead ground dont care what color you are when you go in cause in the end were all gonna be the color of dirt hell bill said youre already the color of dirt and you smell like some pretty old dirt at that you gonna keep on mister old timer said and youre gonna wind up having the undertaker wipe your ass old timer cocked back the hammers on the shotgun again this here gun could go off accidently could happen and who here is gonna argue it didnt not me the deputy said it would be easier on me you were dead bill bill looked at the reverend yeah but that wouldnt set right with the reverend would it reverend actually i wouldnt care one way or another im not a man of peace and im not a forgiver even if what you did wasnt done to me i think were all rich and deep in sin maybe none of us are worthy of forgiveness bill sunk a little at his seat no one was even remotely on his side old timer continued with his story this here bee keeper gimet he wasnt known as much of a man meanhearted is how he was thunk of i knowed him and i didnt like him i seen him snatch up a little dog once and cut the tail off of it with his knife just cause he thought it was funny boy who owned the dog tried to fight back and gimet he cut the boy on the arm no one did nothin about it aint no real law in these parts you see and wasnt nobody brave enough to do nothin me included and he did lots of other mean things even killed a couple of men and claimed selfdefense might have been but gimet was always into something and whatever he was into always turned out with someone dead or hurt or humiliated bill here sounds like he could be gimets brother the deputy said oh no old timer said shaking his head this here scumlicker aint a bump on the mean old ass of gimet gimet lived in a little shack off cemetery road he raised bees and brought in honey to sell at the community up the road guess you could even call it a town schow is the way the place is known on account of a fella used to live up there was named schow he died and got ate up by pigs right there in his own pen just keeled over slopping the hogs and then they slopped him all over that place a store got built on top of where schow got et up and thats how the place come by the name gimet took his honey in there to the store and sold it and even though he was a turd he had some of the best honey you ever smacked your mouth around wish i had me some now it was dark and rich and sweeter than any sugar think thats one reason he got away with things people dont like killing and such but they damn sure like their honey this story got a point bill said you dont like way im telling it old timer said why dont you think about how that ropes gonna fit around your neck that ought to keep your thoughts occupied right smart bill made a grunting noise turned on his block of wood as if to show he wasnt interested well now honey or not sweet tooth or not everything has an end to it and thing was he took to a little gal mary lynn twoshoe she was a part indian gal a real looker hair black as the bottom of a well eyes the same color and she was just as fine in the features as them pictures you see of them stage actresses she wasnt five feet tall and that hair of hers went all the way down her back her daddy was dead the pox got him and her mama wasnt too well off being sickly and all she made brooms out of straw and branches she trimmed down sold a few of them raised a little garden and a hog when all this happened mary lynn was probably thirteen maybe fourteen wasnt no older than that if youre gonna tell a tale bill said least dont wander all over the place so youre interested old timer said what else i got to do bill said go on jebidiah said tell us about mary lynn old timer nodded gimet took to her seen her around bringing the brooms her mama made into the store he waited on her grabbed her and just throwed her across his saddle kickin and screamin like hed bought a sack of flour and was ridin it to the house mack collins store owner came out and tried to stop him well he said something to him about how he shouldnt do it least thats the way i heard it he didnt push much and i cant blame him didnt do good to cross gimet anyway gimet just said back to mack give her mama a big jar of honey tell her thats for her daughter ill even make her another jar or two if the meat heres as sweet as im expecting with that he slapped mary lynn on the ass and rode off with her sounds like my kind of guy bill said i have become irritated with you now jebidiah said might i suggest you shut your mouth before i pistol whip you bill glared at jebidiah but the reverends gaze was as dead and menacing as the barrels of old timers shotgun rest of the story is kind of grim old timer said gimet took her off to his house and had his way with her so many times he damn near killed her and then he turned her loose or got so drunk she was able to get loose time she walked down cemetery road made it back to town well she was bleeding so bad from having been used so rough she collapsed she lived a day and died from loss of blood her mother out of her sick bed rode a mule out there to the cemetery on cemetery road i told you she was indian and she knew some indian ways and she knew about them old gods that wasnt none of the gods of her people but she still knew about them she knew some signs to draw in cemetery dirt i dont know the whole of it but she did some things and she did it on some old grave out there and the last thing she did was she cut her own throat died right there her blood running on top of that grave and them pictures she drawed in the dirt dont see how that done her no good the deputy said maybe it didnt but folks think it did old timer said community that had been pushed around by gimet finally had enough went out there in mass to hang his ass shoot him whatever it took got to his cabin they found gimet dead outside his shack his eyes had been torn out or blown out is how they looked skin was peeled off his head just leaving the skull and a few hairs his chest was ripped open and his insides was gone exceptin the bones in there and them bees of his had nested in the hole in his chest had done gone about making honey was buzzing out of that hole his mouth empty eyes nose or where his nose used to be i figure theyd rolled him over tore off his pants theyd have been coming out of his asshole how come you werent out there with them bill said how come this is all stuff you heard because i was a coward when it come to gimet old timer said thats why told myself wouldnt never be a coward again no matter what i should have been with them didnt matter no how he was done good and dead them bees all in him what was done then is the crowd got kind of loco tore off his clothes hooked his feet up to a horse and dragged him through a blackberry patch them bees just burstin out and hummin all around him all that aint right but i think id been with them knowing who he was and all the things hed done i might have been loco too they dumped him out on the cemetery to let him rot took that girls mother home to be buried some place better wasnt no more than a few nights later that folks started seeing gimet they said he walked at night when the moon was at least half or full like it is now number of folks seen him said he loped alongside the road following their horses grabbing hold of the tail if he could trying to pull horse and rider down or pull himself up on the back of their mounts said them bees was still in him bees black as flies and angry whirling all about him and coming from inside him worse there was a larger number of folks took that road that wasnt never seen again it was figured gimet got them horse shit the deputy said no disrespect old timer youve treated me all right thats for sure but a ghost chasing folks down i dont buy that dont have to buy it old timer said i aint trying to sell it to you none dont have to believe it and i dont think its no ghost anyway i think that girls mother she done something to let them old gods out for a while sicked them on that bastard used her own life as a sacrifice thats what i think and them gods them things from somewhere else they ripped him up like that them bees is part of that too they aint no regular honey bee theyre some other kind of bees some kind of fitting death for a bee raiser is my guess thats silly the deputy said i dont know jebidiah said the indian woman may only have succeeded in killing him in this life she may not have understood all that she did didnt know she was giving him an opportunity to live again or maybe that is the curse though there are plenty others have to suffer for it like the folks didnt do nothing when gimet was alive old timer said folks like me that let what went on go on jebidiah nodded maybe the deputy looked at jebidiah not you too reverend you should know better than that there aint but one true god and aint none of that hoodoo business got a drop of truth to it if theres one god jebidiah said there can be many they are at war with one another thats how it works or so i think ive seen some things that have shook my faith in the one true god the one im servant to and what is our god but hoodoo its all hoodoo my friend okay what things have you seen reverend the deputy asked no use describing it to you young man jebidiah said you wouldnt believe me but ive recently come from mud creek it had an infestation of a sort that town burned down and i had a hand in it mud creek old timer said i been there only thing there now jebidiah said is some charred wood aint the first time its burned down old timer said some fool always rebuilds it and with it always comes some kind of ugliness ill tell you straight i dont doubt your word at all reverend thing is the deputy said i dont believe in no haints thats the shortest road and its the road im gonna take i wouldnt old timer said thanks for the advice but no one goes with me or does thats the road im taking provided it cuts a day off my trip im going with you jebidiah said my job is striking at evil not to walk around it id go during the day old timer said aint no one seen gimet in the day or when the moon is thin or not at all but way it is now its full and will be again tomorrow night id ride hard tomorrow youre determined to go get there as soon as you can before dark im for getting there the deputy said im for getting back to nacogdoches and getting this bastard in a cell ill go with you jebidiah said but i want to be there at night i want to take deadmans road at that time i want to see if gimet is there and if he is send him to his final death defy those dark gods the girls mother called up defy them and loose my god on him what id suggest is you get some rest deputy old timer here can watch a bit then ill take over that way we all get some rest we can chain this fellow to a tree outside we have to we should both get slept up to the gills then leave here midday after a good dinner head out for deadmans road long as were there by nightfall that ought to bring you right on it old timer said you take deadmans road when you get to the fork where the road ends you go right aint no one ever seen gimet beyond that spot or in front of where the road begins hes tied to that stretch way i heard it good enough the deputy said i find this all foolish but if i can get some rest and have you ride along with me reverend then im game and ill be fine with getting there at night next morning they slept late and had an early lunch beans and hard biscuits again a bit of stewed squirrel old timer had shot the rodent that morning while jebidiah watched bill sit on his ass his hands chained around a tree in the front yard inside the cabin the deputy had continued to sleep but now they all sat outside eating except for bill what about me bill asked tugging at his chained hands when we finish old timer said dont know if any of the squirrel will be left but we got them biscuits for you i can promise you some of them i might even let you rub one of them around in my plate sop up some squirrel gravy those biscuits are awful bill said aint they old timer said bill turned his attention to jebidiah preacher you ought to just go on and leave me and the boy here alone aint smart for you to ride along cause i get loose aint just the deputy thats gonna pay ill put you on the list after what ive seen in this life jebidiah said you are nothing to me an insect so add me to your list lets feed him the deputy said nodding at bill and get to moving im feeling rested and want to get this ball started the moon had begun to rise when they rode in sight of deadmans road the white cross road sign was sticking up beside the road trees and brush had grown up around it and between the limbs and the shadows the crudely painted words on the sign were halfway readable in the waning light the wind had picked up and was grabbing at leaves plucking them from the ground tumbling them about tearing them from trees and tossing them across the narrow clay road with a sound like mice scuttling in straw fall always depresses me the deputy said halting his horse taking a swig from his canteen life is a cycle jebidiah said youre born you suffer then youre punished the deputy turned in his saddle to look at jebidiah you aint much on that resurrection and reward are you no im not i dont know about you the deputy said but i wish we hadnt gotten here so late id rather have gone through in the day thought you werent a believer in spooks bill said and made with his now familiar snort you said it didnt matter to you the deputy didnt look at bill when he spoke i wasnt here then place has a look i dont like and i dont enjoy temptin things even if i dont believe in them thats the silliest thing i ever heard bill said wanted me with you jebidiah said you had to wait you mean to see something dont you preacher bill said if there is something to see jebidiah said you believe old timers story the deputy said i mean really perhaps jebidiah clucked to his horse and took the lead when they turned onto deadmans road jebidiah paused and removed a small fat bible from his saddlebag the deputy paused too forcing bill to pause as well you aint as ornery as i thought the deputy said you want the peace of the bible just like anyone else there is no peace in this book jebidiah said thats a real confusion bible isnt anything but a book of terror and thats how god is terrible but the book has power and we might need it i dont know what to think about you reverend the deputy said aint nothin you can think about a man thats gone loco bill said i dont want to stay with no man thats loco you get an idea to run bill i can shoot you off your horse the deputy said close range with my revolver far range with my rifle you dont want to try it its still a long way to nacogdoches bill said the road was narrow and of red clay it stretched far ahead like a band of blood turned sharply to the right around a wooded curve where it was as dark as the bottom of jonahs whale the blowing leaves seemed especially intense on the road scrapping dryly about winding in the air like giant hornets the trees which grew thick bent in the wind from right to left this naturally led the trio to take to the left side of the road the farther they went down the road the darker it became by the time they got to the curve the woods were so thick and the thunderous skies had grown so dark the moon was barely visible its light was as weak as a sick babys grip when they had traveled for some time the deputy said obviously feeling good about it there aint nothing out here sides what you would expect a possum maybe the wind good for you then jebidiah said good for us all you sound disappointed to me the deputy said my line of work isnt far from yours deputy i look for bad guys of a sort and try and send them to hell or in some cases back to hell and then almost simultaneous with a flash of lightning something crossed the road not far in front of them what the hell was that bill said coming out of what had been a near stupor it looked like a man the deputy said could have been jebidiah said could have been what do you think it was you dont want to know i do gimet jebidiah said the sky let the moon loose for a moment and its light spread through the trees and across the road in the light there were insects a large wad of them buzzing about in the air bees bill said damn if them aint bees and at night that aint right you an expert on bees the deputy asked hes right jebidiah said and look theyre gone now flew off the deputy said no no they didnt bill said i was watching and they didnt fly nowhere theyre just gone one moment they were there then they was gone and thats all there is to it theyre like ghosts you done gone crazy the deputy said they are not insects of this earth jebidiah said they are familiars what bill said they assist evil or evil beings jebidiah said in this case gimet theyre like a witchs black cat familiar familiars take on animal shapes insects that sort of thing thats ridiculous the deputy said that dont make no kind of sense at all whatever you say jebidiah said but i would keep my eyes alert and my senses raw wouldnt hurt to keep your revolvers loose in their holsters you could well need them though come to think of it your revolvers wont be much use what the hell does that mean bill said jebidiah didnt answer he continued to urge his horse on something that was becoming a bit more difficult as they went all of the horses snorted and turned their heads left and right tugged at their bits their ears went back and their eyes went wide holy hell bill said whats that jebidiah and the deputy turned to look at him bill was turned in the saddle looking back they looked too just in time to see something that looked pale blue in the moonlight dive into the brush on the other side of the road black dots followed swarmed in the moonlight then darted into the bushes behind the pale blue thing like a load of buckshot what was that the deputy said his voice sounded as if it had been pistol whipped already told you jebidiah said that couldnt have been nothing human the deputy said dont you get it bill said thats what the preacher is trying to tell you its gimet and he aint nowhere alive his skin was blue and hes all messed up i seen more than you did i got a good look and them bees we ought to break out and ride hard do as you choose the reverend said i dont intend to and why not bill said that isnt my job well i aint got no job deputy aint you supposed to make sure i get to nacogdoches to get hung aint that your job it is then we ought to ride on not bother with this fool he wants to fight some grave crawler then let him aint nothing we ought to get into we made a pact to ride together the deputy said so we will i didnt make no pact bill said your word your needs theyre nothing to me the deputy said at that moment something began to move through the woods on their left something moving quick and heavy not bothering with stealth jebidiah looked in the direction of the sounds saw someone or something moving through the underbrush snapping limbs aside like they were rotten sticks he could hear the buzz of the bees loud and angry without really meaning to he urged the horse to a trot the deputy and bill joined in with their own mounts keeping pace with the reverends horse they came to a place off the side of the road where the brush thinned and out in the distance they could see what looked like bursting white waves frozen against the dark but they soon realized it was tombstones and there were crosses a graveyard the graveyard old timer had told them about the sky had cleared now the wind had ceased to blow hard they had a fine view of the cemetery and as they watched the thing that had been in the brush moved out of it and went up the little rise where the graves were climbed up on one of the stones and sat a black cloud formed around its head and the sound of buzzing could be heard all the way out to the road the thing sat there like a king on a throne even from that distance it was easy to see it was nude and male and his skin was grayblue in the moonlightand the head looked misshapen moon glow slipped through cracks in the back of the horrors head and poked out of fresh cracks at the front of its skull and speared out of the empty eye sockets the bees nest visible through the wound in its chest was nestled between the ribs it pulsed with a yellowhoney glow from time to time little black dots moved around the glow and flew up and were temporarily pinned in the moonlight above the creatures head jesus said the deputy jesus wont help a bit jebidiah said its gimet aint it he it really is dead the deputy said undead jebidiah said i believe hes toying with us waiting for when he plans to strike strike bill said why because that is his purpose jebidiah said as it is mine to strike back gird your loins men you will soon be fighting for your life how about we just ride like hell bill said in that moment jebidiahs words became prophetic the thing was gone from the grave stone shadows had gathered at the edge of the woods balled up become solid and when the shadows leaped from the even darker shadows of the trees it was the shape of the thing they had seen on the stone cool blue in the moonlight a disaster of a face and the teeth they were long and sharp gimet leaped in such a way that his back foot hit the rear of jebidiahs animal allowing him to spring over the deputys horse to land hard and heavy on bill bill let out a howl and was knocked off his mount when he hit the road his hat flying gimet grabbed him by his bushy head of strawcolored hair and dragged him off as easily as if he were a kitten gimet went into the trees tugging bill after him gimet blended with the darkness there the last of bill was a scream the raising of his cuffed hands the cuffs catching the moonlight for a quick blink of silver then there was a rustle of leaves and a slapping of branches and bill was gone my god the deputy said my god did you see that thing jebidiah dismounted moved to the edge of the road leading his horse his gun drawn the deputy did not dismount he pulled his pistol and held it his hands trembling did you see that he said again and again my eyes are as good as your own jebidiah said i saw it well have to go in and get him get him the deputy said why in the name of everything thats holy would we do that why would we want to be near that thing hes probably done what hes done already damn reverend bill hes a killer this is just as good as i might want i say while the old boy is doing whatever hes doing to that bastard we ride like the goddamn wind get on out on the far end of this road where it forks gimet is supposed to be only able to go on this stretch aint he thats what old timer said you do as you want im going in after him why you dont even know him its not about him jebidiah said ah hell i aint gonna be shamed the deputy swung down from his horse pointed at the place where gimet had disappeared with bill can we get the horses through there think we will have to go around a bit i discern a path over there discern recognize come on time is wasting they went back up the road a pace found a trail that led through the trees the moon was strong now as all the clouds that had covered it had rolled away like wind blown pollen the air smelled fresh but as they moved forward that changed there was a stench in the air a putrid smell both sweet and sour and it floated up and spoiled the freshness something dead the deputy said something long dead jebidiah said finally the brush grew so thick they had to tie the horses leave them they pushed their way through briars and limbs there aint no path the deputy said you dont know he come through this way jebidiah reached out and plucked a piece of cloth from a limb held it up so that the moon dropped rays on it this is part of bills shirt am i right the deputy nodded but how could gimet get through here how could he get bill through here what we pursue has little interest in the things that bother man limbs briars its nothing to the living dead they went on for a while vines got in their way the vines were wet they were long thick vines and sticky and finally they realized they were not vines at all but guts strewn about and draped like decorations fresh the deputy said bill i reckon you reckon right jebidiah said they pushed on a little farther and the trail widened making the going easier they found more pieces of bill as they went along the stomach fingers pants with one leg in them a heart which looked as if it has been bitten into and sucked on jebidiah was curious enough to pick it up and examine it finished he tossed it in the dirt wiped his hands on bills pants the one with the leg still in it said gimet just saved you a lot of bother and the state of texas the trouble of a hanging heavens the deputy said watching jebidiah wipe blood on the legfilled pants jebidiah looked up at the deputy he wont mind i get blood on his pants jebidiah said hes got more important things to worry about like dancing in the fires of hell and by the way yonder sports his head jebidiah pointed the deputy looked bills head had been pushed onto a broken limb of a tree the sharp end of the limb being forced through the rear of the skull and out the left eye the spinal cord dangled from the back of the head like a bell rope the deputy puked in the bushes oh god i dont want no more of this go back i wont think the less of you cause i dont think that much of you to begin with take his head for evidence and ride on just leave me my horse the deputy adjusted his hat dont need the head and if it comes to it youll be glad im here i aint no weak sister dont talk me to death on the matter show me what you got boy the trail was slick with bills blood they went along it and up a rise guns drawn at the top of the hill they saw a field grown up and not far away a sagging shack with a fallen down chimney they went that direction came to the shacks door jebidiah kicked it with the toe of his boot and it sagged open once inside jebidiah struck a match and waved it about nothing but cobwebs and dust must have been gimets place jebidiah said jebidiah moved the match before him until he found a lantern full of coal oil he lit it and placed the lantern on the table should we do that the deputy asked have a light wont he find us in case you have forgotten thats the idea out the back window which had long lost its grease paper covering they could see tombstones and wooden crosses in the distance another view of the graveyard jebidiah said that would be where the girls mother killed herself no sooner had jebidiah said that then he saw a shadowy shape move on the hill flitting between stones and crosses the shape moved quickly and awkwardly move to the center of the room jebidiah said the deputy did as he was told and jebidiah moved the lamp there as well he sat it in the center of the floor found a bench and dragged it next to the lantern then he reached in his coat pocket and took out the bible he dropped to one knee and held the bible close to the lantern light and tore out certain pages he wadded them up and began placing them all around the bench on the floor placing the crumpled pages about six feet out from the bench and in a circle with each wad two feet apart the deputy said nothing he sat on the bench and watched jebidiahs curious work jebidiah sat on the bench beside the deputy rested one of his pistols on his knee you got a dont you yeah i got a converted cartridge pistol just like you give me your revolver the deputy complied jebidiah opened the cylinders and let the bullets fall out on the floor what in hell are you doing jebidiah didnt answer he dug into his gun belt and came up with six silvertipped bullets loaded the weapon and gave it back to the deputy silver jebidiah said sometimes it wards off evil sometimes be quiet now and wait i feel like a staked goat the deputy said after a while jebidiah rose from the bench and looked out the window then he sat down promptly and blew out the lantern somewhere in the distance a night bird called crickets sawed and a large frog bleated they sat there on the bench near each other facing in opposite directions their silverloaded pistols on their knees neither spoke suddenly the bird ceased to call and the crickets went silent and no more was heard from the frog jebidiah whispered to the deputy he comes the deputy shivered slightly took a deep breath jebidiah realized he too was breathing deeply be silent and be alert jebidiah said all right said the deputy and he locked his eyes on the open window at the back of the shack jebidiah faced the door which stood halfway open and sagging on its rusty hinges for a long time there was nothing not a sound then jebidiah saw a shadow move at the doorway and heard the door creak slightly as it moved he could see a hand on what appeared to be an impossibly long arm reaching out to grab at the edge of the door the hand clutched there for a long time not moving then it was gone taking its shadow with it time crawled by its at the window the deputy said and his voice was so soft it took jebidiah a moment to decipher the words jebidiah turned carefully for a look it sat on the window sill crouched there like a bird of prey a halo of bees circling around its head the hive pulsed and glowed in its chest and in that glow they could see more bees so thick they appeared to be a sort of humming smoke gimets head sprouted a few springs of hair like withering grass fighting its way through stone a slight turn of its head allowed the moon to flow through the back of its cracked skull and out of its empty eyes then the head turned and the face was full of shadows again the room was silent except for the sound of buzzing bees courage jebidiah said his mouth close to the deputys ear keep your place the thing climbed into the room quickly like a spider dropping from a limb and when it hit the floor it stayed low allowing the darkness to lay over it like a cloak jebidiah had turned completely on the bench now facing the window he heard a scratching sound against the floor he narrowed his eyes saw what looked like a shadow but was in fact the thing coming out from under the table jebidiah felt the deputy move perhaps to bolt he grabbed his arm and held him courage he said the thing kept crawling it came within three feet of the circle made by the crumpled bible pages the way the moonlight spilled through the window and onto the floor near the circle jebidiah had made it gave gimet a kind of eerie glow his satellite bees circling his head in that moment every aspect of the thing locked itself in jebidiahs mind the empty eyes the sharp wet teeth the long cracked nails blackened from grime clacking against the wooden floor as it moved to cross between two wads of scripture the pages burst into flames and a line of crackling blue fulmination moved between the wadded pages and made the circle light up fully all the way around like ezekiels wheel gimet gave out with a hoarse cry scuttled back clacking nails and knees against the floor when he moved he moved so quickly there seemed to be missing spaces between one moment and the next the buzzing of gimets bees was ferocious jebidiah grabbed the lantern struck a match and lit it gimet was scuttling along the wall like a cockroach racing to the edge of the window jebidiah leaped forward tossed the lit lantern hit the beast full in the back as it fled through the window the lantern burst into flames and soaked gimlets back causing a wave of fire to climb from the things waist to the top of its head scorching a horde of bees dropping them from the sky like exhausted meteors jebidiah drew his revolver snapped off a shot there was a howl of agony and then the thing was gone jebidiah raced out of the protective circle and the deputy followed they stood at the open window watched as gimet flamewrapped streaked through the night in the direction of the graveyard i panicked a little jebidiah said i should have been more resolute now hes escaped i never even got off a shot the deputy said god but youre fast what a draw look you stay here if you like im going after him but i tell you now the circle of power has played out the deputy glanced back at it the pages had burned out and there was nothing now but a black ring on the floor what in hell caused them to catch fire in the first place evil jebidiah said when he got close the pages broke into flames gave us the protection of god unfortunately as with most of gods blessings it doesnt last long i stay here youd have to put down more pages ill be taking the bible with me i might need it then i guess ill be sticking they climbed out the window and moved up the hill they could smell the odor of fire and rotted flesh in the air the night was as cool and silent as the graves on the hill moments later they moved amongst the stones and wooden crosses until they came to a long wide hole in the earth jebidiah could see that there was a burrow at one end of the grave that dipped down deeper into the ground jebidiah paused there hes made this old grave his den dug it out and dug deeper how do you know the deputy asked experience and it smells of smoke and burned skin he crawled down there to hide i think we surprised him a little jebidiah looked up at the sky there was the faintest streak of pink on the horizon hes running out of daylight and soon hell be out of moon for a while he damn sure surprised me why dont we let him hide you could come back when the moon isnt full or even half full back in the daylight get him then im here now and its my job thats one hell of a job you got mister im going to climb down for a better look help yourself jebidiah struck a match and dropped himself into the grave moved the match around at the mouth of the burrow got down on his knees and stuck the match and his head into the opening very large he said pulling his head out i can smell him im going to have to go in what about me you keep guard at the lip of the grave jebidiah said standing he may have another hole somewhere he could come out behind you for all i know he could come out of that hole even as we speak thats wonderful jebidiah dropped the now dead match on the ground i will tell you this i cant guarantee success i lose hell come for you you can bet on that and you better shoot those silvers as straight as william tells arrows im not really that good a shot im sorry jebidiah said and struck another match along the length of his pants seam then with his free hand drew one of his revolvers he got down on his hands and knees again stuck the match in the hole and looked around when the match was near done he blew it out aint you gonna need some light the deputy said a match aint nothin ill have it jebidiah removed the remains of the bible from his pocket tore it in half along the spine pushed one half in his coat pushed the other half before him into the darkness of the burrow the moment it entered the hole it flamed aint your pocket gonna catch inside that hole the deputy asked as long as i hold it or its on my person it wont harm me but the minute i let go of it and the aura of evil touches it itll blaze i got to hurry boy with that jebidiah wiggled inside the burrow in the burrow jebidiah used the tip of his pistol to push the bible pages forward they glowed brightly but jebidiah knew the light would be brief it would burn longer than writing paper but still it would not last long after a goodly distance jebidiah discovered the burrow dropped off he found himself inside a fairly large cavern he could hear the sound of bats and smell bat guano which in fact greased his path as he slid along on his elbows until he could stand inside the higher cavern and look about the last flames of the bible burned itself out with a puff of blue light and a sound like an old man breathing his last jebidiah listened in the dark for a long moment he could hear the bats squeaking moving about the fact that they had given up the night sky let jebidiah know daylight was not far off jebidiahs ears caught a sound rocks shifting against the cave floor something was moving in the darkness and he didnt think it was the bats it scuttled and jebidiah felt certain it was close to the floor and by the sound of it moving his way at a creeping pace the hair on the back of jebidiahs neck bristled like porcupine quills he felt his flesh bump up and crawl the air became stiffer with the stench of burnt and rotting flesh jebidiahs knees trembled he reached cautiously inside his coat pocket produced a match struck it on his pants leg held it up at that very moment the thing stood up and was brightly lit in the glow of the match the bees circling its skinstripped skull it snarled and darted forward jebidiah felt its rotten claws on his shirt front as he fired the revolver the blaze from the bullet gave a brief bright flare and was gone at the same time the match was knocked out of his hand and jebidiah was knocked backwards onto his back the things claws at his throat the monsters bees stung him the stings felt like redhot pokers entering his flesh he stuck the revolver into the creatures body and fired once twice three times a fourth then the hammer clicked empty he realized he had already fired two other shots six dead silver soldiers were in his cylinders and the thing still had hold of him he tried to draw his other gun but before he could the thing released him and jebidiah could hear it crawling away in the dark the bats fluttered and screeched confused jebidiah drew the pistol managed to get to his feet he waited listening his fresh revolver pointing into the darkness jebidiah found another match struck it the thing lay with its back draped over a rise of rock jebidiah eased toward it the silver loads had torn into the hive it oozed a dark odiferous trail of death and decaying honey bees began to drop to the cavern floor the hive in gimets chest sizzled and pulsed like a large black knot gimet opened his mouth snarled but otherwise didnt move couldnt move jebidiah guided by the last wisps of his match raised the pistol stuck it against the black knot and pulled the trigger the knot exploded gimet let out with a shriek so sharp and loud it startled the bats to flight drove them out of the cave through the burrow out into the remains of the night gimets clawlike hands dug hard at the stones around him then he was still and jebidiahs match went out jebidiah found the remains of the bible in his pocket and as he removed it tossed it on the ground it burst into flames using the two pistol barrels like large tweezers he lifted the burning pages and dropped them into gimets open chest the body caught on fire immediately crackled and popped dryly and was soon nothing more than a blaze it lit the cavern up bright as day jebidiah watched the corpse being consumed by the biblical fire for a moment then headed toward the burrow bent down squirmed through it came up in the grave he looked for the deputy and didnt see him he climbed out of the grave and looked around jebidiah smiled if the deputy had lasted until the bats charged out that was most likely the last straw and he had bolted jebidiah looked back at the open grave smoke wisped out of the hole and out of the grave and climbed up to the sky the moon was fading and the pink on the horizon was widening gimet was truly dead now the road was safe his job was done at least for one brief moment jebidiah walked down the hill found his horse tied in the brush near the road where he had left it the deputys horse was gone of course the deputy most likely having already finished out deadmans road at a high gallop on his way to nacogdoches perhaps to have a long drink of whisky and turn in his badge the skullfaced boy by david barr kirtleydavid barr kirtley is the author of dozens of short stories his work frequently appears in realms of fantasy and he has also sold fiction to the magazines weird tales and intergalactic medicine show the podcasts escape pod and pseudopod and the anthologies new voices in science fiction and the dragon done it his story save me plz was selected for inclusion in fantasy the best of the year edition kirtley wrote this story during the summer of when he was on a horrorwriting kick and wanted to try a zombie story i tend to identify with individuals who are looked down on and mistreated because theyre different he says so it was natural for me to start thinking about telling my story from the point of view of a zombie the other inspiration was a falling out kirtley had with one of his best friends a few months before he wrote the story i felt he was really mistreating his girlfriend and was just generally acting like a complete jerk kirtley says and all of our friends were mindlessly going along with whatever he did and repeating whatever he said like the zombies in this story it was past midnight and jack and dustin were driving along a twisted path through the woods jack was at the wheel he was arguing with dustin over ashley jack had always thought she had a pretty facethin arching eyebrows a slightly upturned nose a delicate chin shed dated dustin in college for six months until he got possessive and she got restless now jack thought maybe she was interested in him but dustin insisted shell give me another chance someday not according to her jack said with a pointed look he turned his eyes back to the road and in the light of the high beams he saw a man stumble into the path of the car without thinking jack swerved the car bounced violently and then its left front side smashed into a tree the steering column surged forward like an ocean wave and crushed jacks stomach dustin wasnt wearing a seatbelt he flew facefirst through the windshield rolled across the hood and tumbled off onto the ground jack awoke disoriented a man was pounding on the side of the car just beyond the drivers side window which was cracked and foggy and opaque jack pushed at the door which creaked open just enough for him to make out the mans face the man stared at jack then turned and started to walk off jack shouted call for help but the man didnt respond he wandered toward the woods hey jack screamed he brushed aside a blanket of shattered glass and released his seatbelt he pushed his seat backward slowly extricating his bleeding stomach from the steering column then dragged himself out the door and onto the ground and he crawled after the man who continued to walk away finally jack found the strength to stand he lurched to his feet grabbed the man by the shirtfront shoved him back against a tree and demanded whats wrong with you get help jack glanced about desperately and added i have to find my friend the man gave a long and wordless moan jack stared at him the man was very pale with disheveled hair his face was encrusted with dirt and his teeth were twisted and rotten his eyes were oozing suddenly dustins voice burst out hes dead jack turned dustin stood there his nose and cheeks torn away two giant white eyeballs filled the sockets of his freakishly visible skull scraps of flesh hung from his jaw jack screamed dustin stumbled over to the wrecked car to where one of its sideview mirrors hung loosely he tore off the mirror and stared into it for a long time he neither moved nor spoke finally he called out that man has come back from the dead look at him jack hes dead and so am i jack shuddered and backed away from the man dustins eyeballs fixed on jacks stomach apprehensive jack looked down he lifted his blooddrenched shirt to expose the mangled mess beneath and so are you dustin said jack and dustin set out on foot they climbed to the top of a high bluff and watched the bodies of dead men stumble through the grassy fields below dustin sat with his back turned so that his ruined face was lost in shadows he said its everyone everyone who died is coming back the dead man who had caused the accident was following them he stumbled from the trees and regarded jack vacantly jack approached the man and said can you talk the man paused a moment as if trying to focus then gave another inarticulate groan he wandered away jack said to dustin why is he like that and we arent dustin said he dug himself out of the ground hes been dead a long timerotted flesh rotted brains are there others like us jack said i dont know dustin leapt to his feet and called out to the valley below hey can you hear me can you understand what im saying the warm and fetid air carried back only wails dustin shrugged he and jack followed the road until they came to a small house with its lights on jack suggested we can call for help what help dustin said were past that but he followed jack toward the house whose front door was open wide they paused on the porch they could see into the kitchen where a woman stood clenching a baseball bat a dead boy had backed her into a corner and he shambled across the yellow linoleum toward her dry dirt tumbled from his sleeves and fell in a winding trail behind him he spoke in a faint and quavering way mom help me stay back she warned her voice cracking stay away from me youre dead i know youre dead jack started forward but dustin held out an arm to stop him mom the boy said whats wrong dont hurt me stop it the woman shrieked but her arms shuddered and she collapsed sobbing the boy fell upon her he clawed at her hair and she thrashed he tore at her scalp with his teeth jack cringed and turned away the woman screamed then gurgled then was silent when jack looked again he saw that dustin was regarding the gruesome scene with fascination jack growled whats wrong with you we couldve stopped it were dead now dustin said we help the dead not them he gestured at the woman youre crazy jack said dustin ignored him i want to see this you jack stopped as the woman rose her head a cracked and bloody mess she stepped clumsily forward she moaned youd be like her dustin whispered mindless hungry if that first one had gotten into the car chewed up your head before you rose jack strode into the kitchen eased around the woman the boy and the bloodsplattered floor and stepped toward the phone im calling home jack said lifting the receiver i have to call my dad tell him im what dustin said darkly all right jack hesitated dustin said jack youre dead youre lost to him hell never take you in jack paused a moment then began to dial dustin turned and stepped out into the night the phone rang once and instantly someone answered jack it was his fathers voice im coming home jack said i cant stay on the line he hung up he snatched some keys off the counter and slipped from the house he spotted dustin who had walked out into the fields among the great crowds of the dead and was shouting to them can you understand me if you can hear me step forward if you understand just that much jack circled the house to where a car was parked he took the car and drove north for an hour along interstate toward waterville he stared at his reflection in the rearview mirror his face was jaundiced discolored and sickly but if he covered his gaping stomach then in dim light he might pass for living he pulled up in front of his house and got out of the car in the front yard lay a dead man whose forehead had a bullet through it jack shuddered and circled around back the old wood steps creaked as he stepped onto the back porch and knocked he hung back in the shadows a curtain was drawn aside and faces peered out from inside the house someone called jack its jack the door opened and jacks father stood there clutching a rifle he stared then gasped and dropped back raising the gun jack cowered and said quickly dad listen please im not like the others the rifle was now aimed straight at jacks forehead and jack stared into the depths of its barrel then the barrel slowly sank as his father lowered the gun finally his father said come inside son jack stepped into the house his father chained him to the rusty pipe that ran out of the side of the garage and into the ground and said im sorry its only for the night its the only way theyll let you stay here nine people were holed up in the housejacks father had taken in some vacationers jack whispered sadly i understand his father went back inside the moon was bright and the garage cast a thick black shadow over jack all across the neighborhood dogs were barking the night seemed to go on forever and jack never slept he supposed that he would never sleep again days passed several large groups arrived jack stayed out of sight and most of the visitors departed headed south those who stayed would sometimes let jack inside but they kept their distance from him and always had weapons ready during the day the men went out scavenging for food and ammunition and at night they told stories of the dead men theyd destroyed then they would glance at jack and fall silent he was chained up each night weeks of that one day at dusk jack was sitting on a sofa in the living room when gunshots crackled outside the residents brandished their weapons and took up positions by the windows someone pounded on the front door a gruff voice outside hollered let us in for gods sake let us in theyre coming jacks father rifle at the ready leapt forward and threw open the door two tall men in hunting gear rushed into the house each of them carrying several guns jacks father slammed the door behind them one of the newcomers gasped we heard about this house they said youd take us in weve got almost no bullets left jacks father said its my house and youre then the newcomer spotted jack and lurched wildly falling back against the front wall and violently cocking a shotgun the man screamed theyre in the house and raised his weapon jacks father leapt in front of the gun and yelled dont shoot thats my son he wont hurt you the guns barrel wove in tight circles as the newcomer sought a clear shot jack called out please its all right the newcomer glanced at his companion who was now hunched in the corner and moaning oh shit oh shit its in here with us jacks father said firmly you can leave if you want there was a long tense silence finally the newcomer lowered his gun and said all right well let it alone he glared at jack and added but you stay the hell away from me the newcomer was named sam and his companion was todd sam was bigger and louder and leader of the two after things had settled down todd explained we joined up with a militia to hold portland but the dead they he stopped and stared at the floor sam said flatly its not good down there not good at all jacks father said where did you hear about this house in freeport todd said some people had stayed here there was a girl too she had a note for your son todd fished an envelope out of his vest pocket he glanced uneasily at jack and said i guess thats him sam grumbled maybe thats not such a good idea jacks father scowled and said let him have it todd shrugged and tossed the note out onto the table jack scooped up the note and opened it it was from ashley letting him know that she was all right and that he should join her if he wasnt safe she gave the address where she was jack stuck the note into his pocket sams voice was shaky south of here theres this dead kid with no face people call him the skullfaced boy hes smart he can talk like that one there sam nodded at jack jack murmured dustin todd said sharply what jack said he hurt his face like that i saw it sam stared horrified you know him jack realized that hed said something wrong dustin was a friend from school jacks father explained he was with jack the night this all started todds voice was almost hysterical sam this is crazy hes one of them one of the skullfaced boys shut up sam growled just shut up there was a long silence jacks father said come on son lets go outside jack was chained up again then he crouched there in the shadow of the garage and listened to the voices that drifted out through the bright cracks in the boardedup windows first came jacks fathers voice whats this all about todd replied anxiously we lost portland because of the skullfaced boy hes organized the dead down south into some sort of army sam broke in hes trained them they go after people they knowfamily friends the dead act like they have feelings people hesitate wont fight then its too late jacks father said whats that got to do with us dont you get it it was todd again jack is part of this hes friends with the skullfaced boy hes pretending to be nice just waiting for his chance to strike hes dangerous sam added he knows about this house and now the one in freeport too what else does he know hes got to be destroyed no jacks father said todd pressed him hes not your son anymore your son is dead and gone now its just a thing a thing in your sons body using your own love against you sam added people have a right to protect themselves if one of these folks here went out one night and shot that thing you keep in the backyard i wouldnt blame them one of the other residents hissed keep your voice down he might hear after that the voices fell to a low incomprehensible murmur jack waited for hours then he watched as the back door swung open a shadowy figure with a gun crept across the yard toward him was it sam or todd or one of the others in the darkness jack couldnt tell it was his father who stepped from the shadows then bent to unlock the chains and said its not safe for you here anymore im sorry im sorry too jack whispered rising to his feet he hugged his father then escaped into the night jack found dustins army standing in a great field north of portland the thousands of dead milled about in loose formations and watched jack with their empty eyes their groans filled the night jack moved among them and shouted dustin im looking for dustin dustin can you hear me finally a voice responded hey hey you what do you want jack stopped and turned a balding dead man in olive fatigues was approaching jack said im looking for the skullfaced boy the commander you mean the man replied hell want to see you too we can use someone like you the man led jack through the crowds up to a low hill where a small crowd of dead men conversed in hushed tones dustin stood at the peak of the hill and his back was turned standing like that he seemed normal familiar jack called out dustin dustin glanced backward so that one white eye showed in his eerie skeletal profile he wore a ratty army jacket he said youve come back then he turned away so that again all that was visible was the back of his head and said where have you been up north jack said dustin asked did you encounter any of the living any armed groups no jack lied well be headed that way dustin continued north along toward waterville your hometown he waited for a reaction jack said nothing finally dustin added anyway its time for training he walked out to the edge of the hill and regarded the hordes below then shouted dont shoot they moaned back dont shoot its me dustin yelled you know me the voices of the dead drifted up toward the sky its me you know me please help me dustin shouted please help me they wailed dustin nodded with satisfaction and turned away from the crowds thats our strategy jack my soldiers possess determination but not much else a resemblance to loved ones is one of our few assets jack said what are you doing what do you think youre going to accomplish peace dustin said then added the living want to destroy us all of us our only chance is to convert them to make them like us jack stared at the lines of moaning dead they stretched as far as he could see dustin added and were winning thanks to my plan i got the idea from that boy who converted his mother you remember that first night we saw him to hell with your plan jack said angrily i lost my home because of your plan instantly dustin turned to face jack and said so you did go home that menacing skullface leaned in close are people hiding there jack turned away at your house dustin pressed is that where they are my armys fragile jack theyre slow and clumsy and stupid a nest of armed resistance even a small one can wreak havoc i have to know about it jack said leave them alone leave my father alone were headed north jack dustin said the plan is already in motion dont jack insisted then added just for now they wont bother you push east toward freeport freeport dustin was dismissive whats there jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the note he answered in a low voice ashley later that night dustin said to jack shell have to be converted its the only way jack said killed you mean i want her with us dustin said shes in danger now any random dead person might get to her damage her minddestroy what makes her special shell be safer this way jack wondered why did i do it why betray ashley to protect his father yes but the truthhe wanted to see her again would she accept him if they were the same if she were dead too jack said it wont be easy no dustin agreed thats why i need you with me my soldiers follow orders mostly i tell them where to march who to attack what to say but i cant stop them from feeding jack which means that most of my new recruits arrive as damaged goods theres not much officer material around here jack was skeptical you want to make me an officer dustin answered i cant use regular troops for this theres too much risk to ashley i have to use officersmen i can trust not to damage herand ive got few enough of those some of the dumb moaning ones wandered past and jack imagined them ripping at ashleys soft forehead with their teeth ill go jack said then for ashley to make sure nothing happens to her for ashley dustin agreed dustin called a meeting of his officers and held up a photograph that showed him and ashley standing beside a campfire and embracing dustin said this is her make sure shes not damaged the army marched east thousands of groaning dead shambling along the interstate dustin moved among them shouting orders when we reach the town seek out places you know people you know remember what to say dont shoot you know me help me the mumbled replies echoed through the trees dont shoot you know me help me dustin had a dozen officersdead men armed with rifles and pistolswho stayed close by his side dustin himself carried a shotgun and kept a combat knife tucked in his boot jack followed along behind them and held his rifle limply and stared down at the damp pine needles that passed beneath his feet he was full of foreboding dustin lowered his voice and said to his officers theyve probably never fought dead men like us beforefast smart armed that surprise will be our biggest advantage one of the officers grumbled theyve spent weeks boarding up this house how are we going to get in jack called out i can get us in dustin turned and studied him then nodded the house was a sprawling victorian that sat in the middle of a grove of white cedars dustin led the squad forward they all crouched low and scurried across the lawn in a tight column their weapons held ready jack and dustin hurried up the front steps while the others ducked behind the porch railing or dropped into the long grass jack hammered on the door and shouted let us in its sam for gods sake let us in theyre coming after a few moments he heard the bolt snap out of place the door opened a crack dustin rammed the barrel of his shotgun into the opening and pulled the trigger blood exploded through the gap splattering crimson across the porch then dustin kicked open the door the officers sprang up firearms bristling and charged into the house gunfire rang out all around jack was swept along into the foyer which was already littered with bodies a staircase led up to the second floor cover the stairs dustin ordered jack make sure no one comes down jack aimed his gun up toward the second floor landing the other officers poured off into the side rooms and sounds of violence shook the house suddenly a doorway under the stairs flew open jack swung his rifle to cover it but then a muzzle flashed and a bullet caught him in the chest and he stumbled back against a small table and knocked over a lamp which shattered on the floor dustin shouted the basement theyre in the basement three of the officers stormed down the basement steps beneath jacks feet the floorboards rattled and horrible screams filtered up from below jack stuck a finger into his chest and rooted out the bullet another officer jogged up to stand at dustins side and said sir weve got your girl shes in the study bleeding dustin nodded i want to be with her when she rises finish this yes sir the officer walked to the open front door and called out come here come on now jack watched horrified as crowds of moaning dead men stumbled in through the door and began to gorge on the newly fallen corpses jack grabbed dustins arm and said what are you doing we can use these people dustin said theyll try to shoot us as soon as they rise its better this way jack cast one last grim look at the feeding dead then followed dustin through several doorways and into a study ashley lay in an overstuffed chair flanked by officers her pretty face was still a trickle of blood flowed from a single bullet hole in the center of her chest one of the officers said shes not breathing it wont be long dustin ordered i want to be alone with her the officers herded jack from the room he paced down a long lonely hallway then out the front door and into the yard where he sat leaning back against a tall white cedar and waiting for ashley to appear finally she did framed in the light of the doorway her figure was slender her hair long and lustrous but her beautiful face had been carved away until there was nothing left but eyeballs and bone dustin came and stood beside her and their twin skull faces regarded each other later that night as jack and dustin stood together in the yard jack said bitterly i cant believe you did that she was beautiful to which dustin replied ashley will always be beautiful to me you loved her face i love her who deserves her more i want to talk to her jack said no youll stay away dustins voice held a nasty edge or ill tell her that you led us here that you betrayed her jack flinched and dustin strode away calling over his shoulder im the only one who understands her now understands what shes going through for hours jack wandered aimlessly among the dead among the masses of rotting flesh their awfulness their stupidity was overwhelming and made him want to gag then through the clusters of corpses he caught a glimpse of white skull he walked away he wound a path through the dead and sneaked an occasional backward glance the skull was there it gained on him finally it caught him ashley said jack it is you she leaned her horrible skullface toward him and her exposed eyeballs studied him she said dustin didnt tell me you were here say something do you recognize me jack do you understand he didnt answer then she was suspicious did you have anything to do with this did you help him do this jack turned away and stumbled off into the hordes in that moment he envied themtheir lack of thought of remorse he couldnt bear to confront ashley now there was only one thing he could do that might deceive her that might make her leave him alone dont hurt me he groaned loudly desperately please help me the age of sorrow by nancy

being the only human survivor in a world overrun by zombies would she do anything differently than a man would would she be blasting zombies right left and center kilpatrick asks ive never been a proponent of the helpless female standing and shrieking as the zombies come for her i dont know any women like that grief had taken hold of her long ago long before the cataclysm long before everything had disintegrated the planet its people her life hope for the future she crouched at the top of the hill turning her head slowly from side to side seeing only what the uv aviator goggles allowed her to view scanning degrees of verdant landscape watching always watching this valley had once been prime farmland teeming with crops and quietly nestled in it twin villages alive with quaint houses one school that catered to the children of the entire population a church each for the two big branches of christianity a synagogue and a mosque the two church steeples poked above the foliage their crosses glinting in the afternoon sun and she remembered reading what joseph campbell had said you can tell what a culture values by its tallest buildings she wondered if that applied to the beings who now dwelled in the villages there must still be fields for soccer and softball the hospital the shops that the populace had supported although she hadnt visited the villages in months and couldnt be certain here and there a house was partially visibleshe could just make out the pastel clapboard walls splotches of color on this ohsogreen canvas of life that now flowed down the hills like lava over the last few years the plants had grown at an unnatural pace devouring everything in their wake the homes the fields the people no not the people they had managed anyway for a while despite it all she could not view this land so far from the place of her birth as anything but lush the green vibrant shades ranging from yellowtinged to near black the sun despite the thick layer of ozone which trapped its rays managed to give the plants what they needed they werent suffering from any greenhouse effect but seemed to flourish and propagate it was just humanity that had fared badly in all this she knew she should head back even if a freak storm didnt crop up sunset wasnt far off and there was plenty to do always the crops she tended religiously that provided her only fresh food needed watering she should examine that weakness in the fence figure out the strongest repair possible with the materials she had on hand so that she didnt need to go to either of the villages there were fruits and vegetables to harvest cook and put up which meant gathering wood that had to be gotten out here where it wasnt safe when darkness set in her life had become all work everything geared towards survival of the fittest she said aloud for some reason her voice sounding odd the words ringing strangely in her ears it had been so long since shed heard herself speak but inertia had hold of her she knew she was about midcycle her most fertile time halfway between periodsscant though they were now energy was not especially low during ovulation just not high and she felt a lack of focus that would change within two weeks when the flow began but that would be later today she just wanted to sit and stare into the infinity of the horizon slouching towards menopause she had written in her journal now slouching lounging slacking off literally or figuratively all of that was a rarity in her life there was too much to do all the time every day and in the night the neverending battle with loneliness and despair and terror she pulled the glasses down for a second hoping the hat brim could protect her eyes but she could not help a quick glance at the sun a brilliant orange heading down the hazy sky and tried to recall its precise color when it had been yellow she could not it was as if the sun had always been the color of a pumpkin as if everything in nature had always been this way she fixed the glasses back over her eyes and willed herself to stand to get moving but her body refused to be pushed just a few more minutes ive got a few minutes to spare she assured herself suddenly the bells at one of the churches began to ring just as they did automatically every sunday morning afternoon and evening then the bells of the other church answered the two playing back and forth the sound reverberated around the valley through her washing away worries and fear leaving her mellow and remembering church bells had rung the morning she and gary married a happy sound full of the promise of a history yet to be lived i was so young she thought so na√Øve now it seemed as if she had always been her current age forty but then on that day at twenty and gary twentyone she had trusted him with her future had trusted him to not betray her to not betray them the house the bills a pregnancy that ended in an abortion because they were too young he said and she had agreed yes they were too young with plenty of time ahead a job that held her interest while she finished law school then clerking at a prestigious firm until they hired her and she moved up the ranks of corporate law a job she ultimately detested now that she was honest with herself on a fulltime basis but back then she tolerated it all even the loss of the child she had not birthed she tolerated it because of gary in the name of their love a lot of good that did her now gary her profession her childless life and now it was too late for children not chronologically although forty pushed it but in all the other ways that made conceiving impossible especially the circumstances of her life the choices we make she thought grimly as the last bell tolled those roads not taken one road leads to another and that to another and eventually those choices have moved you down a path of no return why hadnt someone told her why hadnt her mother said this is how it is before she died decide here now and go this way or that some choices are irreversible but her mother was a liberal thinker an early feminist someone who believed possibilities defined life and allowed it to constantly evolve and her father she had never gotten a fix on him and after her parents divorced he became a ghost the man whose sperm had helped form her was friendly enough he bought her things paid for her education walked her down the aisle but if she went blind she couldnt pick him out of a crowd not his voice his scent his touch all the wrong choices she thought me gary my parents everybody on the planet the earth reeked with wrong choices and now there were just two choices live or die her gloomy reverie broke when she caught movement in the distance she pulled the goggles down to her neck the sun had set the sky had grayed fast without her noticing startled she jumped to her feet staring to the west watching the figure that looked male coming through the trees quickly she spun in a circle and saw movement in most directions nearly surrounded she had to hurry she raced down the mound tearing through the high green towards the compound a bootlace untying en route she ripped off her gloves and threw them aside so she could get to the key hanging around her neck and pulled the rope over her head as she ran tonight they were moving swiftly and she had just reached the gate when she heard rustling behind her she didnt dare take the time to look her hand trembled as she forced the large key into the huge padlock yanked it open pulled it from the bar and got herself inside and the door locked just as the first of them reached the gate the stench of rot forced her back the solar yard light that increased illumination with the darkness allowed her to see this one all too clearly a face no longer recognizable living decay his bloated blue fingers pushed their way through the chain links reaching out for her all around the compound they gathered aligning their dull eyes the light of life missing with the openings of the links her stomach lurched and her heart hammered three years and she had not gotten used to the sight of them and imagined she never would what flesh had not thoroughly corrupted or fallen away was bilious and left her gagging they made sounds low moany noises that reminded her of sick or hurt animals at one time when it all began she had felt sorry for them imagining they were in pain but that was early on back when she did not could not believe that they wanted her dead but now she believed she forced herself to turn commanded herself to not look at any of them the fence needing repair filled her thoughts but she knew it could not be breeched not tonight not next week it was just her constant worrying something to focus on how she had to be always alert never able to rest the price of survival despite the sounds that filled the air with their groans and shufflings and the squishy noises of flesh no longer alive pressing against other dead flesh or metal or grass underfoot she managed to walk to the well and with trembling hands began lowering the metal bucket it dropped down into the water with a splash and although it was too dark now to see to the bottom through the rope she held she could feel the bucket submerge she turned the crank to hoist it up when the pail reached the top she grabbed it to the ledge untied it locked the carbon filter on top and hauled it water sloshed over the sides to the vegetable garden where she moistened one row of plants above her the sky had turned slate and no stars shown through the thick cloud cover the moon goddess is not making her presence known tonight she thought artemis the huntress nothing worth hunting anymore the numbers of them had grown until they were two and three deep around the fence in places every day she thanked whatever deities still cared about this poor planet for the fact that this disease first rotted the brain of the inflicted otherwise they would long ago have taken to using tools and breeching her barrier tonight their presence seemed to turn the air from warm to hot or at least she felt hot a flash memory the day one of them touched her putrid flesh clamping onto her shoulder cool puffy fingers curling around her grabbing on trying to hold her back trying to absorb her warm life through her tshirt panicked she broke free and ran as fast as she could snagging a shovel for protection as she went racing until the breath burned her lungs and her vision blurred and still it pursued her until she found safety in an abandoned store bolting the door watching it pawing the glass to get at her unable to think clearly enough to shatter the glass which told her a lot the news had declared this outbreak another super bug spread by physical contact unresponsive to antibiotics not to worry the man on channel said a serum was being developed all would be well but she had felt its touch through thin fabric watched its face close up all through the night until the first rays of the sun forced it to take refuge from the impending light which must hurt its rotting skin by morning she knew that all would not be well things would never be right again after that experience she had changed fueled by mounting terror she booked a flight just wanting to get as far away from the horrors as possible an article had identified a few spots on the planet as trouble free the more isolated the scientist said the better he named new zealand as the safest place on earth he was wrong muscles trembling she hefted another pail of water to the garden the lettuce looked wilty so she gave each plant extra liquid hoping they would perk up the growing season here extended all year although last summer the heat had been almost unbearable and much of her crop burned she lost forty pounds over four months and had been forced to go into the villages and raid gardens and cupboards for tinned food and stock up on all the vitamins she could get her hands on now she took a handful of those plus the brown seaweed extract shed been swallowing for the last half decade to detoxify her body of radiation fallout one good thing about no more humans on the planet no more politicians dropping bombs on one another the garden had been like so much in the last few years a learning experience come this summer she planned to add a uv filter to the shade over the plants for the hottest part of the day thank god the well was artesian and would theoretically last forever not that she would and there were no heirs to take her place fortunately the things outside the gate continued to moan and groan and produce squishy sounds sometimes she thought she heard her name but that couldnt be they were no longer living beings not living in the way she was flesh and organs and bone decomposing they moved by instinct and the instinct the nearly dead seemed to possess directed them towards the living of which she was to her knowledge the last in this region perhaps in this country the world she had no way of knowing she finished the watering sprayed organic pesticide on the plants and then did a final visual check of the compound everything in order an acre was not too much to manage and from the front yard she could see every inch of the property but for what lay behind the mound she had macheted the vines and scrub that grew wildly and regularly mowed the grass with an old hand mower shed found on one of the farms flattening everything but the garden facing the mound she walked to her right stopping two feet from the fence and at her approach the sounds from the cool bodies increased in volume like insects swarming she could see one side of the back fence none of them were at that corner where repairs were needed she reminded herself that the damage wasnt urgent still knowing that a weakness existed made her nervous not nervous enough to go there in the darkness of night which would draw attention to that area and to her she couldnt do anything to fix it now and a sudden pain as her ovary struggled to expel an egg into her fallopian tubes turned her away from the yard and towards the house on the way she plucked four lettuce leaves picked a ripe tomato a yellow pepper and with the army knife she always carried in a sheath around her belt she sliced off one small head of a broccoli all of it going into a basket which she carried in one hand with the other hand she hefted the last pail of water carefully she headed down the two steps and inside closing and locking the door after her which drowned out most of the din that unnerved her still and stood back resting for a moment against the wooden barrier happy for contact with even the inanimate finally she pushed herself away dropped the basket on the table and set the pail by the sink took off the goggles and her hat and began to roll up her shirt sleeves as an afterthought she removed her shirt but left the cotton tank top on immediately her body temperature lowered she crossed the room to the wall under the one window and checked the bank of batteries charged by eight watt solar panels on the roof a flip of a switch cranked up the air filtering system from lowwhere she kept it when she went outto high the fully charged batteries meant she could waste a few amps to enjoy a bit of music as she ate something soothing she flipped through the cds and found pachelbels canon then changed her mindtoo gloomy maybe delibes lakme something lighter that spoke of hope of springtime springtime as the music played she scrubbed all of the vegetables thoroughly in the carbonfiltered water likely it did nothing much for the pollutants in the air still circling the earth but then she wasnt certain what to do about them she pulled a chopping knife from the rack and started on the pepper gutting it setting the seeds aside to dry her mind wandering to a springtime only five years ago the last one where she had seen gary alive how could life have seemed so ordinary she wondered she rinsed and sliced into the tomato the pungent smell reaching her nostrils and added it and the pepper to the lettuce she washed and tore into bitesize pieces spring the weather beautifully mild the scent of lilac in the air the scent of hope she and gary met for lunch at a small caf√© downtown near the campus where he taught she told the receptionist shed be gone for an hour and a half but when she was seated gary said he had to get back to the college and could only stay thirty minutes they sat on the terrace and orderedboth had salads and caf√© lattesand she remembered gazing at the young people semistripped for the mild temperature they all looked so healthy and happy nothing like a twentyyearold body she thought although at thirtyfive she wasnt in bad shape at all thanks to a daily jog before work she recalled looking over garys shoulder as he munched on caesar salad and seeing her reflection in the restaurants window chestnut hair large dark eyes an oval face with few signs of wrinkles nothing that trimonthly dermaabrasions and a bit of botox couldnt fix she glanced at gary and saw him not watching her but staring at those same bodies it was only a fragment of time and yet in that split second she knew he had been unfaithful he felt her look and his handsome face closed around the emotion hows your day he asked she put down her fork who is she she he looked uncomfortable youll have to be more precise than that or the one youre fucking whats her name he opened his mouth his expression guarded his eyes haughty but she locked onto him a human laser and said dont bother lying just tell me her voice remarkably calm to her own ears must have put him at ease her name is eileen a student first year i suppose she came to discuss a paper or project a project not a very good one i gave her direction they could have been talking about the citys plans for revamping the waterfront or a new movie to be seen suddenly she couldnt bear it the strain of the last fifteen years without a word she picked up her bag and stood wait look but before he could say more she was out of earshot my life is a facade she thought years and years of ignoring truth in those moments of that perfect spring day she knew that she had barely loved him when she was twenty and now did not love him at all at least in the way that mattered between a woman and a man the most hurtful part was that she knew it was mutual she ran for an hour but she could not have said what streets or even what district her ringtonenineteen notes of the flower duetplayed again and again until she pulled the cellphone from her purse and tossed it into a trash can then when the shoulder bag grew annoying she pitched it as well sometime later she showed up at the front door without keys darkness had set in the trees and grass and the other homes on the street looked stunned and she saw everything as if for the first time she rang the bell and he let her in moving away from the door as she passed him not wanting a fight but neither did she apparently the relationship was not worth fighting for she climbed the stairs suddenly exhausted and entered their bedroom to find his matching suitcases on the bed both threequarters packed slowly she removed her clothes and let them drop to the floor then ran a bath and sank into a hot tub a glass of beaujolais in her hand and fell asleep when she woke the water was cold tinted with the undrunk wine as if it had been blood that spilled the house was tomb silent his suitcases were gone she found a note on the dresser something about being sorry and wishing her a nice life she had ripped it into tiny pieces and flushed it down the toilet she cut up the broccoli raw and added it to the salad a small bottle of olive oil sat on the floor in the coolest part of the kitchen area and she opened it to add a few drops to the vegetables then pushed the cork back in for a moment she stood looking at the salad then covered the bowl with an elasticized net to keep insects out turned and walked to the couch that doubled as a bed in this oneroom house and fell onto it exhausted always exhausted always unable to sleep why was all this coming back to her now it felt like the disease of memory crept through her mind and heart hiding surging to the fore when she least expected it and did not want it she glanced around the room helplessly she had positioned the couch so that from here she could see every corner and the door one room convenient life condensed half buried in the earth like a grave the design geared to keeping the heat down and a small alice through the looking glass door behind the couch but it only locked from the other side the tunnel led through the dirt mound and would bring her feet outside the compound should this house be invaded one highpitched sharp laugh erupted from her the idea was absurdity itself if the compound was invaded she would have no home outside the compound where could she escape to she had watched the villagers succumb until none were left uninfected and if any were whole she had not come across them in the last year but she had been making fewer and fewer trips into the villages because seeing these creatures cowering from the light became too much besides most of the supplies she needed she already had stored in a small shed just outside the doorcanned goods ammunition for the one rifle stationed next to the couch and the handgun she carried in a holster around her waistweapons she had only fired in practice and was not sure she could actually use on these formerly living humans while there was still gas in the pumps and a couple of functioning vehicles left in the villages she had already brought up many bottles of water in case the well ran dry clothing shoes sheets and towels and kitchen equipment propane tanks although she rarely cooked meals anymore over time she had learned through books how to use the solar panels getting them from the hardware store to the compound had been one thing hauling them to the roof had been another and the heavy batteries had tested her physical strength and ingenuity even more batteries to store the raw energy a converter to turn it into something useful which then powered what had become a decreasing need for energy with no tv broadcasts no radio no phones no internet no contact with the outside world but for a cb radio that she left on but had stopped sending out messages from months ago she only needed lighting and music to get by get by thats what she was doing getting by barely everything the female survivalist needs she said aloud hearing her voice the sound in the stillness so alien to her ears it brought tears to her eyes why was she alive when others were not how had this nightmarish existence come upon her maybe she really had died and gone to hell and this was it the dante book she had read in her youth with the lovely dor√© etchings described hell but she knew there were many more than nine levels when the bacterial infections began they rampaged through chronic care facilities then hospitals in general schools workplaces anywhere and everywhere human beings had physical contact with one another at the same time the ozone layer altered sufficiently that the icebergs at the north pole melted raising the sea level turning what had been frozen tundra into almost pastoral terrain then the antarctic ice began breaking off in large chunks and microorganisms trapped in the ice at both poles were released scientists learned that some lifeforms could lie in wait for millennia wars became the norm day to day reality on the news thousands killed here and there weaponry of all types deployed and the limited nuclear war became reality suddenly the air was not just polluted with smog but radioactive dust circled with the altered jet streams soil and water turned toxic and multinationals focused their resources on cleaning out the poisons so that food could still be grown and water drunk but only by citizens wealthy enough to pay for purification the masses could not brand new immunesystem diseases soared with enormous loss of life human society began to disintegrate garbage piled up transportation came to a halt medication ran out electrical and cellular services died and depending on the season people froze or burned to death unless they were preyed upon by other human beings her mind scanned the hellish reality she had witnessed over five short years descending circle by circle and all the while humanity tried to adapt her heart felt heavy the naivety the stupidity the complacency the men in power said it would all be alright in the end but it wasnt alright it would never be alright again and just when things couldnt get worse they did the new plague spread rapidly and suddenly the dying could not die but by then she was in new zealand traveling aimlessly nowhere to go nothing to do but sit back and watch the apocalypse unfold wait your turn she told herself but her turn had not come in truth new zealand and some of the other isolated islands in this region were the last to go although this country was not spared the nuclear fallout they did manage to stem the flow of visitors and immigrants and eventually movement by their own citizensnobody went in or out but by then it was too late for humanity for garys plea with her to come home to him in that last phone call everything was always too late she picked up the journal she had been keeping the latest one atop a pile of five large books one per year since she had arrived here chronicling the deterioration and her own existence writing helped keep her sane even though some days took up barely half a page filled with mundane details of gardening eating defecating other entries analyzed the politics or the science as she understood itand with all the time in the world and all the books and magazines and newspapers in the library she had learned quite a bit but the worst entries the ones that made her cringe were those where she saw her emotions sprayed on the page as if they were her blood tortured by loneliness and despair she could barely reread those because despite all that she had learned and all that she understood as far as she knew she was the last person alive on the planet every attempt with the cb had met with dead air dante had no idea she mumbled her voice almost an echo in her ears the circles of hell were infinite suicidal thoughts nearly overwhelmed her more times than she could count and she did not yet know why she still lived unscathed by the new plague unaltered by the deadly air but answers like everything else were in short supply and shed long ago stopped her obsessive reading and wondering about why she seemed immune to what affected others diseases that should have killed everyone if only the others could die but they could not die they hid from daylight and wandered aimlessly at night no not aimlessly they always found their way to her compound she wondered if they sought her out for a connection to life when they possessed little resembling that the walking dead her only companions and the worst part was some were not as decayed some she recognized still joe who used to run the butcher shop lucy from the pharmacy ned and his wife sarah who farmed just outside the villages and ran a fruit and vegetable stand the memory of their faces as they had been overlapped with how they were now moved a wave of hysteria up from her gut that caught in her throat and suddenly she found herself sobbing uncontrollably this fit lasted only seconds her last eruption had been about six months ago she picked up the pen and began writing trying to convey in words the feelings that washed through her like waves in a storm she could never get over how quickly the illnesses overtook the living one day she had gone into the chemists and lucy had been fine the next day she had dark circles beneath her eyes and sneezed uncontrollably the third day bill the owner said she was out with a sniffle the next night lucy was spotted walking the streets at midnight her skin mottled her eyes bearing an opaque sheen people tried to talk with her to help her but she seemed incapable of speech only incoherent mutterings and soft moans and those that she touched came down with the sickness lucy was the first local to go as the numbers of the undead increased people packed up their families and fled the villages as many as could get away she had no idea where they went where they could go she found this house and when the grocery store and the hardware shop were abandoned she began stocking up building the fence securing her world and then they came those who were left dozens from villages that once had claimed a combined population of every night they swarmed from their homes and headed to hers a macabre ritual maybe theyre as lonely as i am she wrote im half dead in a different way maybe its a strange symbiotic curse and we need each other if i cease to survive will they if they disappear tomorrow will i still exist how zen she wrote how perfectly horribly zen suddenly she felt heavy tired and her eyes would not stay open she sank down to a full recline telling herself that if she fell asleep now she would be up in the middle of the night but not heeding the warning in a dream that she knows to be a dream she walks over fields covered with wildflowers under a yellow sun crossing a blue sky with few clouds the cool earth beneath her feet the sweet scent of lilac in the air a mild and warm breeze blows her skirt and her hair she closes her eyes and feels heat penetrate to her bones warming her even as she thinks the sun is too strong a sound jolts her and she spins around to see a man coming towards her he is dressed in blue jeans a tshirt and his body is muscular with hair the color of the sun and eyes that she can see as he nears are blue as the sky he is as alive as the day as real as nature that heals and cleanses itself over time suddenly the man is gary and he stops before her and reaches out to cup her chin his touch is electric it is as if her body is nothing but electrical current as sparks explode throughout her sending signals to her brain her heart her genitals she quivers hungry for this fearful of it at the same time without opening his mouth he says to her dont worry this was meant to be how she wonders are you dead she asks he smiles and pulls her to him kissing her full on the lips and she tastes his familiar tongue inside her mouth moving probing an image flashes through her of dark unwholesomeness an invasion she jerked awake her body covered with sweat she sat up abruptly and felt chilly as if the temperature had plummeted she grabbed the blanket from the foot of the couch and wrapped it around her shoulders still shivering disoriented she looked around the darkened room lit only by one watt coiled florescent that she kept lit over the kitchen table to stave off the demons of darkness but the demons had gotten through again she stood on shaky legs feeling her cool forehead and then headed to a cupboard where she kept a first aid bag she placed the thermometer under her tongue and walked to the one window while she waited moving the bar that held the thick wooden shutters so she could open them and look out darkness filled the night and silence nothing once her eyes adjusted she scanned the periphery of the fence to the gate as far as the window would let her see they had gone at least from the area within her view a full moon hung in the sky as if pasted there on top of the blackness she squinted at the orb struggling to see the face that she had seen as a child but the thickened atmosphere blurred details when she pulled out the thermometer and read it under the lamp she saw that her temperature was normal she did not feel sick a glance in the mirror by the door showed a toothin face haggard but she had accepted that she looked weary but brighteyed absently she smoothed back her short hair running fingers through it like a comb im alright she thought feeling both relief and despair that she was not sick youre ovulating she told her image the serious image looked back at her with an expression that said so what does it matter soon youll get old and die she said the image did not reply old and die would she could she die or was her destiny that of the undead the ones who were sick but unable to get well unable to die caught in a balance of the battle of microorganisms that kept them in a terrible stasis that kept them walking endlessly feebly helplessly unable to give themselves wholeheartedly to entropy weak mindless incapable of using toolsisnt that what defines us as human she challenged her image but the image as always did not long to respond suddenly in anger she threw off the blanket stalked to the couch grabbed the rifle and unbolted the door the night air felt cooler and the cold wind of a storm snapped at her tonight she wanted change something would die one of them or her it didnt matter this couldnt go on aware of the insanity of her thinking she would not stop herself she stormed to the fence and strode along the periphery soon she was passing the side of the vegetable garden the side of the mound then reached the back of the dirt mound that enclosed her house her prison nothing no one where were they had they fled in despair had an alien ship come down and taken them all away did the balance of power finally fall to one side and the lifedestroying organisms win and they at long last died tonight of all nights she wanted to find out she wanted to stare into one of those hideous faces to confront this halfbeing to find a way to send it to oblivion maybe that was the way to go get over her aversion and shoot them in the head one by one until there were no more then she could walk free what would it matter if that left her alone she was alone now totally thoroughly the world she remembered had receded like a longago dream barely recalled she passed the weakness in the fence and saw that it had not been breeched nothing had been breeched just her psyche her quick strides brought her around to the other side of the mound then back into what she deemed the front yard not one of the notquitedead frustrated she stepped outside of the glow of the yard light and glared up at the impassive moon suddenly she gave in to an impulse of a different sort snapping her head further back letting the glow of the otherworldly light freeze her face she howled like an animal wailed over and over into the impending storm until the sounds turned to shrieking she dropped the rifle out of her control her body staggered around the yard arms protecting her solar plexus screaming sobbing blind with the impossibleness of despair she only stopped when she slammed against the fence and crumpled to the ground her back braced against the chain link her body curled into a fetal position out of her mind with grief it took time to realize that something was different she felt a burning at the back of her neck the hotness moved along her flesh from side to side and at first she did not know what caused it but then she did cold so intense it felt hot comforting caressing her skin behind her close she heard breathing wet breathing and while her mind warned her that she should be frightened at the closeness the touch another part of her ached for more she sat up pressing her back against the fence more fingers touched her caressing her as a lover would as gary had their foul odor entered her nostrils as flowers lilacs she reached back over her shoulder flesh met flesh and as the rain blew from every direction for the first time in a long time her sorrow evaporated into the wind bitter grounds by neil gaimanneil gaiman is the bestselling author of

in the back of her head goes back to read it again and finds that its topographically reconfigured into a completely different story come back early or never come in every way that counted i was dead inside somewhere maybe i was screaming and weeping and howling like an animal but that was another person deep inside another person who had no access to the face and lips and mouth and head so on the surface i just shrugged and smiled and kept moving if i could have physically passed away just let it all go like that without doing anything stepped out of life as easily as walking through a door i would have but i was going to sleep at night and waking in the morning disappointed to be there and resigned to existence sometimes i telephoned her i let the phone ring once maybe even twice before i hung up the me who was screaming was so far inside nobody knew he was even there at all even i forgot that he was there until one day i got into the cari had to go to the store i had decided to bring back some applesand i went past the store that sold apples and i kept driving and driving i was going south and west because if i went north or east i would run out of world too soon a couple of hours down the highway my cell phone started to ring i wound down the window and threw the cell phone out i wondered who would find it whether they would answer the phone and find themselves gifted with my life when i stopped for gas i took all the cash i could on every card i had i did the same for the next couple of days atm by atm until the cards stopped working the first two nights i slept in the car i was halfway through tennessee when i realized i needed a bath badly enough to pay for it i checked into a motel stretched out in the bath and slept in it until the water got cold and woke me i shaved with a motel courtesy kit plastic razor and a sachet of foam then i stumbled to the bed and i slept awoke at am and knew it was time to get back on the road i went down to the lobby there was a man standing at the front desk when i got there silvergray hair although i guessed he was still in his thirties if only just thin lips good suit rumpled saying i ordered that cab an hour ago one hour ago he tapped the desk with his wallet as he spoke the beats emphasizing his words the night manager shrugged ill call again he said but if they dont have the car they cant send it he dialed a phone number said this is the nights out inn front desk yeah i told him yeah i told him hey i said im not a cab but im in no hurry you need a ride somewhere for a moment the man looked at me like i was crazy and for a moment there was fear in his eyes then he looked at me like id been sent from heaven you know by god i do he said you tell me where to go i said ill take you there like i said im in no hurry give me that phone said the silvergray man to the night clerk he took the handset and said you can cancel your cab because god just sent me a good samaritan people come into your life for a reason thats right and i want you to think about that he picked up his briefcaselike me he had no luggageand together we went out to the parking lot we drove through the dark hed check a handdrawn map on his lap with a flashlight attached to his key ring then hed say left here or this way its good of you he said no problem i have time i appreciate it you know this has that pristine urbanlegend quality driving down country roads with a mysterious samaritan a phantom hitchhiker story after i get to my destination ill describe you to a friend and theyll tell me you died ten years ago and still go round giving people rides be a good way to meet people he chuckled what do you do guess you could say im between jobs i said you im an anthropology professor pause i guess i should have introduced myself teach at a christian college people dont believe we teach anthropology at christian colleges but we do some of us i believe you another pause my car broke down i got a ride to the motel from the highway patrol as they said there was no tow truck going to be there until morning got two hours of sleep then the highway patrol called my hotel room tow trucks on the way i got to be there when they arrive can you believe that im not there they wont touch it just drive away called a cab never came hope we get there before the tow truck ill do my best i guess i should have taken a plane its not that im scared of flying but i cashed in the ticket im on my way to new orleans hours flight four hundred and forty dollars days drive thirty dollars thats four hundred and ten dollars spending money and i dont have to account for it to anybody spent fifty dollars on the motel room but thats just the way these things go academic conference my first faculty doesnt believe in them but things change im looking forward to it anthropologists from all over the world he named several names that meant nothing to me im presenting a paper on the haitian coffee girls they grow it or drink it neither they sold it door to door in portauprince early in the morning in the early years of the century it was starting to get light now people thought they were zombies he said you know the walking dead i think its a right turn here were they zombies he seemed very pleased to have been asked well anthropologically there are several schools of thought about zombies its not as cutanddried as popularist works like the serpent and the rainbow would make it appear first we have to define our terms are we talking folk belief or zombie dust or the walking dead i dont know i said i was pretty sure the serpent and the rainbow was a horror movie they were children little girls five to ten years old who went doortodoor through portauprince selling the chicory coffee mixture just about this time of day before the sun was up they belonged to one old woman hang a left just before we go into the next turn when she died the girls vanished thats what the books tell you and what do you believe i asked thats my car he said with relief in his voice it was a red honda accord on the side of the road there was a tow truck beside it lights flashing a man beside the tow truck smoking a cigarette we pulled up behind the tow truck the anthropologist had the door of the car opened before id stopped he grabbed his briefcase and was out of the car was giving you another five minutes then i was going to take off said the towtruck driver he dropped his cigarette into a puddle on the tarmac okay ill need your triplea card and a credit card the man reached for his wallet he looked puzzled he put his hands in his pockets he said my wallet he came back to my car opened the passengerside door and leaned back inside i turned on the light he patted the empty seat my wallet he said again his voice was plaintive and hurt you had it back in the motel i reminded him you were holding it it was in your hand he said god damn it god fucking damn it to hell everything okay there called the towtruck driver okay said the anthropologist to me urgently this is what well do you drive back to the motel i must have left the wallet on the desk bring it back here ill keep him happy until then five minutes itll take you five minutes he must have seen the expression on my face he said remember people come into your life for a reason i shrugged irritated to have been sucked into someone elses story then he shut the car door and gave me a thumbsup i wished i could just have driven away and abandoned him but it was too late i was driving to the hotel the night clerk gave me the wallet which he had noticed on the counter he told me moments after we left i opened the wallet the credit cards were all in the name of jackson anderton it took me half an hour to find my way back as the sky grayed into full dawn the tow truck was gone the rear window of the red honda accord was broken and the driversside door hung open i wondered if it was a different car if i had driven the wrong way to the wrong place but there were the towtruck drivers cigarette stubs crushed on the road and in the ditch nearby i found a gaping briefcase empty and beside it a manila folder containing a fifteenpage typescript a prepaid hotel reservation at a marriott in new orleans in the name of jackson anderton and a packet of three condoms ribbed for extra pleasure on the title page of the typescript was printed this was the way zombies are spoken of they are the bodies without souls the living dead once they were dead and after that they were called back to life again hurston tell my horse i took the manila folder but left the briefcase where it was i drove south under a pearlcolored sky people come into your life for a reason right i could not find a radio station that would hold its signal eventually i pressed the scan button on the radio and just left it on left it scanning from channel to channel in a relentless quest for signal scurrying from gospel to oldies to bible talk to sex talk to country three seconds a station with plenty of white noise in between lazarus who was dead you make no mistake about that he was dead and jesus brought him back to show usi say to show us what i call a chinese dragon can i say this on the air just as you yknow get your rocks off you whomp her round the backatha head it all spurts outta her nose i damn near laugh my ass off if you come home tonight ill be waiting in the darkness for my woman with my bottle and my gun when jesus says will you be there will you be there no man knows the day or the hour so will you be there president unveiled an initiative today freshbrewed in the morning for you for me for every day because every day is freshly ground over and over it washed over me driving through the day on the back roads just driving and driving they become more personable as you head south the people you sit in a diner and along with your coffee and your food they bring you comments questions smiles and nods it was evening and i was eating fried chicken and collard greens and hush puppies and a waitress smiled at me the food seemed tasteless but i guessed that might have been my problem not theirs i nodded at her politely which she took as an invitation to come over and refill my coffee cup the coffee was bitter which i liked at least it tasted of something looking at you she said i would guess that you are a professional man may i enquire as to your profession that was what she said word for word indeed you may i said feeling almost possessed by something and affably pompous like w c fields or the nutty professor the fat one not the jerry lewis one although i am actually within pounds of the optimum weight for my height i happen to be an anthropologist on my way to a conference in new orleans where i shall confer consult and otherwise hobnob with my fellow anthropologists i knew it she said just looking at you i had you figured for a professor or a dentist maybe she smiled at me one more time i thought about stopping forever in that little town eating in that diner every morning and every night drinking their bitter coffee and having her smile at me until i ran out of coffee and money and days then i left her a good tip and went south and west tongue brought me here there were no hotel rooms in new orleans or anywhere in the new orleans sprawl a jazz festival had eaten them every one it was too hot to sleep in my car and even if id cranked a window and been prepared to suffer the heat i felt unsafe new orleans is a real place which is more than i can say about most of the cities ive lived in but its not a safe place not a friendly one i stank and itched i wanted to bathe and to sleep and for the world to stop moving past me i drove from fleabag motel to fleabag motel and then at the last as i had always known i would i drove into the parking lot of the downtown marriott on canal street at least i knew they had one free room i had a voucher for it in the manila folder i need a room i said to one of the women behind the counter she barely looked at me all rooms are taken she said we wont have anything until tuesday i needed to shave and to shower and to rest whats the worst she can say i thought im sorry youve already checked in i have a room prepaid by my university the names anderton she nodded tapped a keyboard said jackson then gave me a key to my room and i initialed the room rate she pointed me to the elevators a short man with a ponytail and a dark hawkish face dusted with white stubble cleared his throat as we stood beside the elevators youre the anderton from hopewell he said we were neighbors in the journal of anthropological heresies he wore a white tshirt that said anthropologists do it while being lied to we were we were im campbell lakh university of norwood and streatham formerly north croydon polytechnic england i wrote the paper about icelandic spirit walkers and fetches good to meet you i said and shook his hand you dont have a london accent im a brummie he said from birmingham he added never seen you at one of these things before its my first conference i told him then you stick with me he said ill see youre all right i remember my first one of these conferences i was scared shitless id do something stupid the entire time well stop on the mezzanine get our stuff then get cleaned up there must have been a hundred babies on my plane over isweartogod they took it in shifts to scream shit and puke though never fewer than ten of them screaming at a time we stopped on the mezzanine collected our badges and programs dont forget to sign up for the ghost walk said the smiling woman behind the table ghost walks of old new orleans each night limited to fifteen people in each party so sign up fast i bathed and washed my clothes out in the basin then hung them up in the bathroom to dry i sat naked on the bed and examined the papers that had been in andertons briefcase i skimmed through the paper he had intended to present without taking in the content on the clean back of page five he had written in a tight mostly legible scrawl in a perfect perfect world you could fuck people without giving them a piece of your heart and every glittering kiss and every touch of flesh is another shard of heart youll never see again until walking waking calling on your own is unsupportable when my clothes were pretty much dry i put them back on and went down to the lobby bar campbell was already there he was drinking a gin and tonic with a gin and tonic on the side he had out a copy of the conference program and had circled each of the talks and papers he wanted to see rule one if its before midday fuck it unless youre the one doing it he explained he showed me my talk circled in pencil ive never done this before i told him presented a paper at a conference its a piece of piss jackson he said piece of piss you know what i do no i said i just get up and read the paper then people ask questions and i just bullshit he said actively bullshit as opposed to passively thats the best bit just bullshitting piece of utter piss im not really good at um bullshitting i said too honest then nod and tell them that thats a really perceptive question and that its addressed at length in the longer version of the paper of which the one you are reading is an edited abstract if you get some nut job giving you a really difficult time about something you got wrong just get huffy and say that its not about whats fashionable to believe its about the truth does that work christ yes i gave a paper a few years back about the origins of the thuggee sects in persian military troops its why you could get hindus and muslims equally becoming thuggee you seethe kali worship was tacked on later it would have begun as some sort of manichaean secret society still spouting that nonsense she was a tall pale woman with a shock of white hair wearing clothes that looked both aggressively studiedly bohemian and far too warm for the climate i could imagine her riding a bicycle the kind with a wicker basket in the front spouting it im writing a fucking book about it said the englishman so what i want to know is whos coming with me to the french quarter to taste all that new orleans can offer ill pass said the woman unsmiling whos your friend this is jackson anderton from hopewell college the zombie coffee girls paper she smiled i saw it in the program quite fascinating yet another thing we owe zora eh along with the great gatsby i said hurston knew f scott fitzgerald said the bicycle woman i did not know that we forget how small the new york literary world was back then and how the color bar was often lifted for a genius the englishman snorted lifted only under sufferance the woman died in penury as a cleaner in florida nobody knew shed written any of the stuff she wrote let alone that shed worked with fitzgerald on the great gatsby its pathetic margaret posterity has a way of taking these things into account said the tall woman she walked away campbell stared after her when i grow up he said i want to be her why he looked at me yeah thats the attitude youre right some of us write the bestsellers some of us read them some of us get the prizes some of us dont whats important is being human isnt it its how good a person you are being alive he patted me on the arm come on interesting anthropological phenomenon ive read about on the internet i shall point out to you tonight of the kind you probably dont see back in dead rat kentucky id est women who would under normal circumstances not show their tits for a hundred quid who will be only too pleased to get em out for the crowd for some cheap plastic beads universal trading medium i said beads fuck he said theres a paper in that come on you ever had a jello shot jackson no me neither bet theyll be disgusting lets go and see we paid for our drinks i had to remind him to tip by the way i said f scott fitzgerald what was his wifes name zelda what about her nothing i said zelda zora whatever we went out nothing like something happens anywhere midnight give or take we were in a bar on bourbon street me and the english anthropology prof and he started buying drinksreal drinks this place didnt do jello shotsfor a couple of darkhaired women at the bar they looked so similar they might have been sisters one wore a red ribbon in her hair the other wore a white ribbon gauguin might have painted them only he would have painted them barebreasted and without the silver mouseskull earrings they laughed a lot we had seen a small party of academics walk past the bar at one point being led by a guide with a black umbrella i pointed them out to campbell the woman with the red ribbon raised an eyebrow they go on the haunted history tours looking for ghosts you want to say dude this is where the ghosts come this is where the dead stay easier to go looking for the living you saying the tourists are alive said the other mock concern on her face when they get here said the first and they both laughed at that they laughed a lot the one with the white ribbon laughed at everything campbell said she would tell him say fuck again and he would say it and she would say fook fook trying to copy him and hed say its not fook its fuck and she couldnt hear the difference and would laugh some more after two drinks maybe three he took her by the hand and walked her into the back of the bar where music was playing and it was dark and there were a couple of people already if not dancing then moving against each other i stayed where i was beside the woman with the red ribbon in her hair she said so youre in the record company too i nodded it was what campbell had told them we did i hate telling people im a fucking academic he had said reasonably when they were in the ladies room instead he had told them that he had discovered oasis how about you what do you do in the world she said im a priestess of santeria me i got it all in my blood my papa was brazilian my momma was irishcherokee in brazil everybody makes love with everybody and they have the best little brown babies everybody got black slave blood everybody got indian blood my poppa even got some japanese blood his brother my uncle he looks japanese my poppa he just a goodlooking man people think it was my poppa i got the santeria from but no it was my grandmommasaid she was cherokee but i had her figgered for mostly high yaller when i saw the old photographs when i was three i was talking to dead folks when i was five i watched a huge black dog size of a harleydavidson walking behind a man in the street no one could see it but me when i told my mom she told my grandmomma they said shes got to know shes got to learn there was people to teach me even as a little girl i was never afraid of dead folk you know that they never hurt you so many things in this town can hurt you but the dead dont hurt you living people hurt you they hurt you so bad i shrugged this is a town where people sleep with each other you know we make love to each other its something we do to show were still alive i wondered if this was a comeon it did not seem to be she said you hungry a little i said she said i know a place near here they got the best bowl of gumbo in new orleans come on i said i hear its a town where youre best off not walking on your own at night thats right she said but youll have me with you youre safe with me with you out on the street college girls were flashing their breasts to the crowds on the balconies for every glimpse of nipple the onlookers would cheer and throw plastic beads i had known the redribbon womans name earlier in the evening but now it had evaporated used to be they only did this shit at mardi gras she said now the tourists expect it so its just tourists doing it for the tourists the locals dont care when you need to piss she added you tell me okay why because most tourists who get rolled get rolled when they go into the alleys to relieve themselves wake up an hour later in pirates alley with a sore head and an empty wallet ill bear that in mind she pointed to an alley as we passed it foggy and deserted dont go there she said the place we wound up in was a bar with tables a tv on above the bar showed the tonight show with the sound off and subtitles on although the subtitles kept scrambling into numbers and fractions we ordered the gumbo a bowl each i was expecting more from the best gumbo in new orleans it was almost tasteless still i spooned it down knowing that i needed food that i had had nothing to eat that day three men came into the bar one sidled one strutted one shambled the sidler was dressed like a victorian undertaker high top hat and all his skin was fishbelly pale his hair was long and stringy his beard was long and threaded with silver beads the strutter was dressed in a long black leather coat dark clothes underneath his skin was very black the last one the shambler hung back waiting by the door i could not see much of his face nor decode his race what i could see of his skin was a dirty gray his lank hair hung over his face he made my skin crawl the first two men made straight to our table and i was momentarily scared for my skin but they paid no attention to me they looked at the woman with the red ribbon and both of the men kissed her on the cheek they asked about friends they had not seen about who did what to whom in which bar and why they reminded me of the fox and the cat from pinocchio what happened to your pretty girlfriend the woman asked the black man he smiled without humor she put a squirrel tail on my family tomb she pursed her lips then you better off without her thats what i say i glanced over at the one who gave me the creeps he was a filthy thing junkie thin graylipped his eyes were downcast he barely moved i wondered what the three men were doing together the fox and the cat and the ghost then the white man took the womans hand and pressed it to his lips bowed to her raised a hand to me in a mock salute and the three of them were gone friends of yours bad people she said macumba not friends of anybody what was up with the guy by the door is he sick she hesitated then she shook her head not really ill tell you when youre ready tell me now on the tv jay leno was talking to a thin blond woman its not just the movie said the caption so have you seen the action figure he picked up a small toy from his desk pretended to check under its skirt to make sure it was anatomically correct laughter said the caption she finished her bowl of gumbo licked the spoon with a red red tongue and put it down in the bowl a lot of kids they come to new orleans some of them read anne rice books and figure they learn about being vampires here some of them have abusive parents some are just bored like stray kittens living in drains they come here they found a whole new breed of cat living in a drain in new orleans you know that no slaughter s said the caption but jay was still grinning and the tonight show went to a car commercial he was one of the street kids only he had a place to crash at night good kid hitchhiked from la to new orleans wanted to be left alone to smoke a little weed listen to his doors cassettes study up on chaos magick and read the complete works of aleister crowley also get his dick sucked he wasnt particular about who did it bright eyes and bushy tail hey i said that was campbell going past out there campbell my friend the record producer she smiled as she said it and i thought she knows she knows he was lying she knows what he is i put down a twenty and a ten on the table and we went out onto the street to find him but he was already gone i thought he was with your sister i told her no sister she said no sister only me only me we turned a comer and were engulfed by a crowd of noisy tourists like a sudden breaker crashing onto the shore then as fast as they had come they were gone leaving only a handful of people behind them a teenaged girl was throwing up in a gutter a young man nervously standing near her holding her purse and a plastic cup halffull of booze the woman with the red ribbon in her hair was gone i wished i had made a note of her name or the name of the bar in which id met her i had intended to leave that night to take the interstate west to houston and from there to mexico but i was tired and twothirds drunk and instead i went back to my room when the morning came i was still in the marriott everything i had worn the night before smelled of perfume and rot i put on my tshirt and pants went down to the hotel gift shop picked out a couple more tshirts and a pair of shorts the tall woman the one without the bicycle was in there buying some alkaseltzer she said theyve moved your presentation its now in the audubon room in about twenty minutes you might want to clean your teeth first your best friends wont tell you but i hardly know you mister anderton so i dont mind telling you at all i added a traveling toothbrush and toothpaste to the stuff i was buying adding to my possessions though troubled me i felt i should be shedding them i needed to be transparent to have nothing i went up to the room cleaned my teeth put on the jazz festival tshirt and then because i had no choice in the matter or because i was doomed to confer consult and otherwise hobnob or because i was pretty certain campbell would be in the audience and i wanted to say goodbye to him before i drove away i picked up the typescript and went down to the audubon room where fifteen people were waiting campbell was not one of them i was not scared i said hello and i looked at the top of page one it began with another quote from zora neale hurston big zombies who come in the night to do malice are talked about also the little girl zombies who are sent out by their owners in the dark dawn to sell little packets of roasted coffee before sunup their cries of caf√© grill√© can be heard from dark places in the streets and one can only see them if one calls out for the seller to come with the goods then the little dead one makes herself visible and mounts the steps anderton continued on from there with quotations from hurstons contemporaries and several extracts from old interviews with older haitians the mans paper leaping as far as i was able to tell from conclusion to conclusion spinning fancies into guesses and suppositions and weaving those into facts halfway through margaret the tall woman without the bicycle came in and simply stared at me i thought she knows im not him she knows i kept reading though what else could i do at the end i asked for questions somebody asked me about zora neale hurstons research practices i said that was a very good question which was addressed at greater length in the finished paper of which what i had read was essentially an edited abstract someone elsea short plump womanstood up and announced that the zombie girls could not have existed zombie drugs and powders numbed you induced deathlike trances but still worked fundamentally on beliefthe belief that you were now one of the dead and had no will of your own how she asked could a child of four or five be induced to believe such a thing no the coffee girls were she said one with the indian rope trick just another of the urban legends of the past personally i agreed with her but i nodded and said that her points were well made and well taken and that from my perspectivewhich was i hoped a genuinely anthropological perspectivewhat mattered was not whether it was easy to believe but much more importantly if it was the truth they applauded and afterward a man with a beard asked me whether he might be able to get a copy of the paper for a journal he edited it occurred to me that it was a good thing that i had come to new orleans that andertons career would not be harmed by his absence from the conference the plump woman whose badge said her name was shanelle gravelyking was waiting for me at the door she said i really enjoyed that i dont want you to think that i didnt campbell didnt turn up for his presentation nobody ever saw him again margaret introduced me to someone from new york and mentioned that zora neale hurston had worked on the great gatsby the man said yes that was pretty common knowledge these days i wondered if she had called the police but she seemed friendly enough i was starting to stress i realized i wished i had not thrown away my cell phone shanelle gravelyking and i had an early dinner in the hotel at the beginning of which i said oh lets not talk shop and she agreed that only the very dull talked shop at the table so we talked about rock bands we had seen live fictional methods of slowing the decomposition of a human body and about her partner who was a woman older than she was and who owned a restaurant and then we went up to my room she smelled of baby powder and jasmine and her naked skin was clammy against mine over the next couple of hours i used two of the three condoms she was sleeping by the time i returned from the bathroom and i climbed into the bed next to her i thought about the words anderton had written handscrawled on the back of a page of the typescript and i wanted to check them but i fell asleep a softfleshed jasminescented woman pressing close to me after midnight i woke from a dream and a womans voice was whispering in the darkness she said so he came into town with his doors cassettes and his crowley books and his handwritten list of the secret urls for chaos magick on the web and everything was good he even got a few disciples runaways like him and he got his dick sucked whenever he wanted and the world was good and then he started to believe his own press he thought he was the real thing that he was the dude he thought he was a big mean tigercat not a little kitten so he dug up something someone else wanted he thought the something he dug up would look after him silly boy and that night hes sitting in jackson square talking to the tarot readers telling them about jim morrison and the cabala and someone taps him on the shoulder and he turns and someone blows powder into his face and he breathes it in not all of it and he is going to do something about it when he realizes theres nothing to be done because hes all paralyzed theres fugu fish and toad skin and ground bone and everything else in that powder and hes breathed it in they take him down to emergency where they dont do much for him figuring him for a street rat with a drug problem and by the next day he can move again although its two three days until he can speak trouble is he needs it he wants it he knows theres some big secret in the zombie powder and he was almost there some people say they mixed heroin with it some shit like that but they didnt even need to do that he wants it and they told him they wouldnt sell it to him but if he did jobs for them theyd give him a little zombie powder to smoke to sniff to rub on his gums to swallow sometimes theyd give him nasty jobs to do no one else wanted sometimes theyd just humiliate him because they couldmake him eat dog shit from the gutter maybe kill for them maybe anything but die all skin and bones hed do anything for his zombie powder and he still thinks in the little bit of his head thats still him that hes not a zombie that hes not dead that theres a threshold he hasnt stepped over but he crossed it long time ago i reached out a hand and touched her her body was hard and slim and lithe and her breasts felt like breasts that gauguin might have painted her mouth in the darkness was soft and warm against mine people come into your life for a reason those people ought to know who we are and tell that we are here when i woke it was still almost dark and the room was silent i turned on the light looked on the pillow for a ribbon white or red or for a mouseskull earring but there was nothing to show that there had ever been anyone in the bed that night but me i got out of bed and pulled open the drapes looked out of the window the sky was graying in the east i thought about moving south about continuing to run continuing to pretend i was alive but it was i knew now much too late for that there are doors after all between the living and the dead and they swing in both directions i had come as far as i could there was a faint taptapping on the hotelroom door i pulled on my pants and the tshirt i had set out in and barefoot i pulled the door open the coffee girl was waiting for me everything beyond the door was touched with light an open wonderful predawn light and i heard the sound of birds calling on the morning air the street was on a hill and the houses facing me were little more than shanties there was mist in the air low to the ground curling like something from an old blackandwhite film but it would be gone by noon the girl was thin and small she did not appear to be more than six years old her eyes were cobwebbed with what might have been cataracts her skin was as gray as it had once been brown she was holding a white hotel cup out to me holding it carefully with one small hand on the handle one hand beneath the saucer it was half filled with a steaming mudcolored liquid i bent to take it from her and i sipped it it was a very bitter drink and it was hot and it woke me the rest of the way i said thank you someone somewhere was calling my name the girl waited patiently while i finished the coffee i put the cup down on the carpet then i put out my hand and touched her shoulder she reached up her hand spread her small gray fingers and took hold of mine she knew i was with her wherever we were headed now we were going there together i remembered something somebody had once said to me its okay every day is freshly ground i told her the coffee girls expression did not change but she nodded as if she had heard me and gave my arm an impatient tug she held my hand tight with her cold cold fingers and we walked finally side by side into the misty dawn shes taking her tits to the grave by catherine cheek catherine cheek has sold fiction to magazines such as ideomancer susurrus and cat tales she also has stories forthcoming in anthologies such as the leonardo variationsan anthology to benefit the clarion writers workshop of which cheek is a graduateand last drink bird head a charity anthology whose proceeds will go toward promoting literacy when not writing cheek plays with molten glass and takes care of her two children and nine pets the idea for this story came from the theme of the world fantasy convention which was ghosts and revenants cheek didnt know what a revenant was so she looked it up and discovered it was a person who came back from the dead and caused great trouble for the living its that last part that intrigued me she says what kind of trouble could they cause cheek could relate to the character in the storya trophy wife who returns from the dead to find her body is not what it used to be my body is getting older every day and i suspect that it will one day actually stop working she says life is a fatal epidemic melanie hitchhiked for the first time ever after she climbed out of her grave a week later and she wouldnt have been able to flirt her way into the trunk of a late model sedan much less shotgun with full access to the radio but she had had a stellar figure a southern california tan and bleachblonde hair that could pass for natural maintaining a beautiful body had landed her a rich husband and shed kept the position of wife long past the time when a less successful trophy would have been replaced that nice face and body still served her for the embalmers had done a great job preserving her notinconsequential looks the middleaged chiropractor who drove her from the cemetery would happily have driven her all the way across town to the house she shared with brandon her husband but she decided to go to larrys condo first more than anything else she needed to find the man who had raised her from the dead a few people noticed as she walked from the parking lot to larrys door and she got some second looks but she paid them no mind people often mistook her for an actress or a model here in los angeles the land of the barbie the steps up to larrys condo seemed endless when you were wearing fourinch heels she smoothed her hair cleared her throat before knocking on larrys door and felt a thrill of anticipation wasnt he going to be happy to see she was alive again but larrys mouth gaped closed partially then reopened his eyes bugged out like a fish flopping on a shore gasping for air what are you doing here larry finally said i thought you were dead i am she pushed her way into the condo irritated for that she didnt slip her pumps off and line them up next to his five pairs of shoes on the tile but tracked grave dirt across his white carpet and i dont appreciate you raising me from the grave if this is the kind of welcome im going to get larry had slipped on his loafers to walk two feet from the carpet to the door and now he took them off his linen pants were cuffed but not wrinkled and he smoothed the fabric out as he settled at the far edge of the couch why are you here because you raised me melanie looked at her fingers the grave had not yet been filled in with dirt a small blessing but her manicure looked terrible why are you being such a prick come on its me baby did someone murder you larry asked he perched on the edge of the cushion hands resting on knees leaning away from her is that why youre haunting the living no one killed me larry i just went in for a routine tummy tuck must have been some kind of complication so if no one murdered you why are you haunting me melanie frowned shed been excited to see him flattered that he loved her enough to raise her from the dead but now it was apparent that he didnt all those times he swore he couldnt get enough of her and now he was tapping nicotinestained fingers and she had always hated how his condo stank like cigarettes his gaze flicking towards the door why had she ever slept with this man back when she was alive a strong chest and blue eyes must have outweighed his other faults arent you going to offer me a drink you want a drink he spluttered as though pouring a glass of wine for the woman hed been carrying on an affair with for four months was the last thing on his mind you want a drink i want something i uh ive got some orange juice he got the drink from the fridge still sidling around her as though she were a crazy bag lady instead of a rich young younglooking anyway and beautiful woman who now that she was thinking about it was probably too good for him after he handed her the glass he watched her drink it not sitting but standing expectantly as though she were an auditor or an inlaw someone distasteful he couldnt wait to get rid of after she drank the orange juice she realized the discomfort was mutual funny when shed first met him she had thought he might be the kind of lover whod keep her amused for years a secret pleasure for when brandon was working late again a notsosecret one for when brandon went out of town and yet by the time she finished the orange juice she realized that what had started as a very promising affair was over as suddenly as well as death gotta go she said setting the halffinished glass of orange juice on the coffee table next to the coaster im late larry didnt laugh or offer her a ride home and she had already walked down all the stairs when she remembered she didnt have her car it was easier to go without a soul than a car in this town she felt her skirt for keys which werent there since they dont bury you with car keys and muttered some unladylike words they dont bury you with a purse either no matter if it was prada and went very well with the shoes and they dont bury you with money or even a bus pass that mythology about the river styx notwithstanding nor had she ever walked so far in her life no one had ever told her how awkward it would be to find her way home when she was used to having a car and now she had to navigate around freeway overpasses and alley walls behind shopping complexes which would have been no fun to traverse even if she were alive and wearing sensible footwear she thought about hitchhiking again but decided she didnt really want to talk shed just ended an affair after all she needed some alone time but it was warm for may and the horizon held a brown layer of smog no one left their cars no one walked the streets if they could help it and the air had a grimy feel to it that would have burned her lungs if she were still breathing she walked for several hours until she wanted someone to give her a ride her husband maybe or a girlfriend then she wanted someone to talk to and maybe a glass of merlot by the time she staggered up the pavement in front of their house the lacquered layer of hairspray on her professionally dyed hair was starting to flake off she was getting a little squishy around the eyes and the flies kept landing on her especially her eyes and mouth she tried to wave them off but her coordination wasnt what it should have been so she kept smacking her boobs those were still as plump as ever which was only fitting seeing as how she had paid more for them than she had for her first car her sister jessica had mocked her for the waste of money but jessica had the same flat chest melanie had been cursed with and hadnt even managed to get married she undid another button displaying more of the cleavage she had bought men loved her breasts someone had raised her from the dead just so they could see them again probably brandon her husband was the kind of guy who could make anything happen with enough money shed have to thank him when she saw him again but right now she was tired she was irritable and she needed a drink melanie pounded at the door even though brandon wouldnt be home maybe the housekeeper would let her in a woman screamed melanie turned the petite blonde wore a camelcolored suit that might have been chanel until someone let out the seams beyond what its lines were ever meant to bear she kept screaming her hands in the air holding a set of car keys that looked suspiciously familiar and screaming and screaming until it became obvious to the both of them that no dudley doright was going to sweep out of the bushes and save her brandons secretary cindy she better be there just to drop something off melanie thought just because she was dead didnt mean brandon could cheat melanie waited until the buxom waif grew hoarse cindy tapered off to fluttering hands near her throat and finally when nothing else seemed to work the girl spoke you youre dead is brandon home youre dead cindy began to scream again which was really irritating because one melanie still wanted a decent drink and two she needed to see brandon to figure out what to do about this whole rising from the grave nuisance cindy kept screaming so melanie finally plucked the keychain directly from her fingers sure enough there was a house key melanie unwound it from the ring you cant do that cindy had regained some spunk even if it was just the pique of a woman whose sorority sister had just puked on her new blouse those are mine she tried to take them back and might have succeeded death does terrible things to your muscle tone except at that point the orange juice that melanie had drunk poured down her leg embarrassing them both it wasnt pee she wanted to explain it was just orange juice and maybe a little embalming fluid but there was no way to gracefully recover from such an event no matter what finishing school you had attended so neither tried they just stared at each other for a long uncomfortable moment melanie dropped the key ring with an exaggerated shudder cindy scooped up the keys and drove off in melanies mercedes in her mercedes you bitch melanie screamed at the car as it squealed away only dead a few days and brandon was letting his secretary drive her mercedes hed better offer her several karats of apology for that melanie let herself in the house and went straight to the bar she poured herself a drink and then another she accidentally spilled some vermouth on her blouse so she decided to change out of her grave outfit and have a shower she had a really beautiful shower she decided the whole house was beautiful really and her clothing had been tastefully selected shed taken it for granted while she was alive but now that she was dead the luxury of organic cotton towels and travertine underfoot actually meant something to her maybe it wasnt a livingdead thing maybe it was just relief that she was finally home where she was supposed to be she did her pilates video workout and her nightly skin care regimen then went to bed only to find that she couldnt sleep she turned on the television the next day she skipped the pilates workout melanie found the remote and sat on the leather couch putting her feet on a stack of magazines that shed finally have time to read the tivo had four solid days worth of programming on it which for once sounded encouraging rather than daunting shed hardly had time for it beforeshed had too many hair and manicure and personal trainer appointmentsbut now that she was dead there seemed little point besides after all shed been through she deserved a little me time the calendar on the fridge said her husband would be home in three days but it was closer to five by that time shed grown decidedly squishy and not just around the eyes her fingers shrank at the tips giving her a clawlike appearance that begged for an acrylic fill the flesh on her thighs sagged detaching from the bones she thought about the liposuction shed gotten and tsked silently melanie watched qvc drank everything in the liquor cabinet and felt her body decompose really brandon was being insensitive he could have at least called she emailed him then emailed her mom and her sister just to say hi back from the dead whats up with you she was lonely she wanted comfort and companionship so desperately that shed already decided not to be bitchy to let the appearance of the blonde bimbo who looked like a younger version of herself she decided just pass over she could always argue about it later and anyway shed always suspected that brandon led a double life she had had her lovers why should he be any different the key rattled and brandon opened the kitchen door dear god brandon said garment bag dangling off his shoulder and laptop case in his hand whats that horrible smell thats not very nice said melanie feeling hurt she had endured a lot in the past few days and while she considered herself thickskinned brandons complete lack of empathy pissed her off here i am risen from the grave even if not exactly fresh any more and all you can do is complain that im a corpse what did you expect melanie brandon said his voice half wonderment and half horror the garment bag slipped from his hands he turned and vomited in the sink if melanies tear ducts had been still functional she probably would have cried really why did he have to be so dramatic she stood leaving a puddle of formaldehydetainted liquor and various body fluids on the couch she didnt feel guilty it was only from ikea she meant to seductively slink into the kitchen one hand coquettishly outlining her cleavage but she couldnt manage more than a shuffle it was a wonder her tongue still worked when you came to think about it what were you doing planning a business trip right after you raised me from the dead didnt you think you might need to be here for me brandon made strangled gurgling noises he pressed himself against the granitetopped island hands splayed out as though he were vanna white and the undercounter wine case a lovely vowel it was an awkward pose melanie decided actually this whole situation was awkward brandon god no please no she gave him her best pout that pout had gotten her emeralds before but now it seemed broken she sighed so what now why did you raise me from the dead no no no he moaned she snapped her fingers in front of his face hello she was the one who had died what right did he have to act like his life was turned upside down he had always been a firm takecharge kind of guy an alpha male he called himself he dominated in tennis took no prisoners when he negotiated a deal and drove like an asshole on the freeway and yet here he was bawling like a scared little boy brandon she tried again and when that didnt work she slapped him it wasnt much of a slap but as soon as her flesh touched his face brandons eyes rolled up in his head and he passed out smacking his head against the counter and then the floor his hands squeaking uselessly down the front of the dishwasher she sighed and put her hands on her hips useless completely useless and he obviously wasnt the person who had raised her she nudged him with her foot but he wasnt faking melanie found her purse and her cell phone she took his keys out of his pocket she was going to take the z but she felt a little bad about slapping him so she took the audi instead and even though hed never liked the upholstery color she put a plastic bag over the drivers seat because the half case of r√©my shed drunk wasnt preserving her as alcohol was supposed to it seemed to be turning her insides into a slurry of decay at this rate shed be nothing but a skeleton before the month was out melanie got behind the wheel of the audi and took off hoping that some innate psychic sense would take her to the person that brought her back from the grave it didnt she took out her cell phone and dialed hello can you give me the name of a necromancer she asked the operator im sorry we dont have that listing try surrounding cities anything in los angeles county melanie said shed never heard of someone looking up necromancers in the yellow pages but there were apparently a lot of things shed never heard of which existed sorry maam nothing how about witchdoctor she asked im sorry we dont have that the phone flew out of her hand and her already damaged face smacked the steering wheel melanie touched her face and her hand came away sticky steam rose from the front of her car the hood crumpled into an m great that was just what she needed to rearend someone the little geo metro ahead of her had also been crumpled its frame bent around the base of the tire well at least it wasnt an expensive car and it was her fault she used to make calls while driving all the time but now that she was decomposing her reflexes had slipped she pulled her car to a gas station on the other side of the intersection my baby you hurt my baby the other driver had neglected her car in the intersection and walked towards melanie despite the fact that traffic whizzed by them melanie didnt see a car seat in the other vehicle but a bateared chihuahuas head peered out of the womans arms and she realized the woman was talking about her dog how ridiculous the woman had been in a car accident just survived it and she was worried about her stupid pet im going to sue my baby has whiplash the woman shook the dog at melanies side window to demonstrate do you hear me whiplash melanie turned the engine off and fumbled on the floorboards for her cell phone shed hoped shed be able to get out of this without calling the cops but that didnt look like it was going to happen she put on her sunglasses unbuckled her seat belt and opened the door eww the woman said audibly as if melanie stunk like old garbage she put her hands to her nose except she was still holding the dog so it went too melanie decided she didnt like the chihuahua woman true she hadnt had a shower in a few days but the woman was rude get your car out of the road so you dont block traffic oh my god the woman said in a horrified gasp your face what melanie wrenched the rear view mirror to inspect herself the steering wheel had torn flesh away from her forehead exposing bone she almost cried her beautiful face gashed open makeup wouldnt fix that her lip started to quiver and her throat closed up as if she were about to sob she had known this would happen somedayshe was finally losing her looks the chihuahua wriggled out of its owners grasp and scampered forward its bark like the bark of a real dog played at rpm when it reached melanies leg it chomped into her lower calf shaking its head back and forth until it tore off a chunk the ratdog sank its teeth in gnawing as though it had found a delectable morsel bitsy bitsy stop it the woman picked up her chihuahua and pulled the piece of flesh out of its mouth thats dirty dont eat that dirty melanie wailed that was it she wasnt going to deal with this bitchs problems ratdog woman would have to deal with the mess herself screw you she stormed off crossing the street without even bothering to look for traffic cars screeched and honked one missing her by inches but she didnt care peace and quiet though oh and to find whoever had raised her from the dead but since there werent any warlocks in her social circle there was the horrifying possibility that it was an old boyfriend from high school or someone she barely even knew but whoever it was he could find her on his own she was done with living people the living were so rude so judgmental about the least bit of decay she looked around getting her bearings shed started driving without any goal in mind and realized shed driven north of van nuys not too far from where shed lived as a child hills rose ahead of her she and her sister used to climb to the top of those hills to see the sunset when they were younger she took the crows path cutting across lawns and parking lots and once over a chainlink fence despite a no trespassing sign what was the point of following city ordinances when you werent even obeying the laws of nature flesh was falling off faster now shed been buried more than a week earlier after all and the temperatures had to be in the nineties flies clustered around her wound each carrying off a small mouthful she thought of them as lightening her load the tendons in her legs werent working as well as they had and her gait slowed to a weary shuffle but since she didnt have to sleep or rest or eat though she wouldnt have minded a glass of wine she was able to travel all afternoon and through the night she didnt mind by dawn shed reached far enough up the hill that she could see pinkish light creep over the town she carefully sat down her back against the concrete support of a power line and watched the sun rise time ceased to have meaning the sun rose and set animals carried on their daily business and the trees got older her flesh rotted away her skin and eyes dried and shrunk and her lips pulled back her hair stayed blonde her teeth were still white and straight and her breasts still defied gravity those silicone implants would last forever but she didnt care much about that any more shed grown lazy and peaceful now that she didnt have anyone to impress whatever magic animated her left her able to think and see even without eyes and a brain on the day her sister hiked up the hill she was still able to wave jessica was boyishly thin and dirty hair hanging around her face in walnutcolored dreadlocks she had loose cargo pants a tiny tank top and a haversack made of guatemalan fabric with peace corp written on it her neck was hung with bone and shell beads strung on thongs and she had lines on her face even though she was only in her midthirties she was more beautiful than anything jessica sat down next to her gracefully not winded from the climb up the hill oh my god jess whispered i am so so sorry its okay no i mean it when i came back for the funeral i had no idea i mean it was such a shock for me that you died in the first place what with you being so young and i completely forgot about the shaman im sorry really jessica its okay you can yell its okay i deserve it you must be so mad at me no im not mad im happy jess was the only one who had been nice to melanie since she died how could she yell at someone who apologized to a corpse what happened it was this shaman see at least he said he was a shaman and he asked me if i wanted to live forever jess sat crosslegged with her elbows on her knees as though she were used to sitting on the ground i said no but my sister would because you once said you were more afraid of getting old than anything else it was kind of a joke melanie waited for the rest of the story but jess stopped and leaned back melanie belatedly realized shed been too silent go on i thought he was kidding he was kind of drunk you know and then as soon as i got home from the funeral i got an email from you and then from brandon saying that youd been wandering around scaring people and i realized id really screwed things up it took a month or so before i could get my visa sorted out and come back to the states again or i would have been here earlier jess sighed im so sorry it must have been horrible for you no not bad melanie said it was getting harder to talk now that she didnt have lips happens to everyone jess pulled one of the bead and bone necklaces off she laid it on the ground beside melanies bony hand i got him to give me this this will let you die the second time when youre ready she kissed melanie on the skull thanks melanie said she didnt reach for the necklace yet since she had all the time in the world but im going to enjoy the view for a while dead like me by adamtroy castro adamtroy castro is the author of the novel emissaries from the deadan interstellar murder mystery not a zombie novel despite the title hes also written three spiderman novels and a pop culture book called my ox is broken about the television show the amazing race his short fiction has appeared in such magazines as the magazine of fantasy science fiction science fiction age analog cemetery dance and in a number of anthologies his work has been nominated for several awards including the hugo nebula and stoker dead like me is a set of instructions to a hapless protagonist about how to survive the zombie plague by joining it the question that prompted it was zombies dont breathe so how do they track their victims certainly not by scent castro says if not by scent how if we know the method can we fool them and from there i got to what will it cost so lets summarize you held out for longer than anybody would have ever dreamed possible you fought with strength you never knew you had but in the end it did you no damned good there were just too many of the bastards the civilization you believed in crumbled the help you waited for never arrived the hiding places you cowered in were all discovered the fortresses you built were all overrun the weapons you scrounged were all useless the people you counted on were all either killed or corrupted and what remained of your faith was torn raw and bleeding from the shell of the soft complacent man you once were you lost period end of story no use whining about it now theres absolutely nothing left between you and the ravenous holloweyed forms of the living dead heres your essay question how low are you willing to sink to survive answer first wake up in a dark cramped space that smells of rotten meat dont wonder what time it is it doesnt matter what time it is theres no such thing as time anymore its enough that youve slept and once again managed to avoid dreaming thats important dreaming is a form of thinking and thinking is dangerous thinking is something the living do something the dead cant abide the dead can sense where its coming from which is why they were always able to find you back when you used to dream now that youve trained yourself to shuffle through the days and nights of your existence as dully and mindlessly as they do theres no reason to hide from them anymore oh they may curl up against you as you sleep two in particular a man and woman handcuffed together for some reason youll never know have crawled into this little alcove with you but thats different thats just heat tropism as long as you dont actually think they wont eat you leave the alcove which is an abandoned storage space in some kind of large office complex papers litter the floor of the larger room outside furniture is piled up against some of the doors meaning that sometime in the distant past living must have made their last stands here there are no bones there are three other zombies all men in the ragged remains of threepiece suits lurching randomly from one wall to the other changing direction only when they hit those walls as if theyre blind and deaf and this is the only way they know how to look for an exit if you reach the door quickly they wont be able to react in time to follow you dont remember dont remember your name only the living have names dont remember you had a wife named nina and two children named mark and kathy who didnt survive your flight from the slaughterhouse manhattan had become dont remember them any of them only the living have families dont remember that as events herded you south you wasted precious weeks combing the increasing chaos of rural pennsylvania for your big brother ben who lived in pittsburgh and had always been so much stronger and braver than you dont remember your childish shellshocked hope that ben would be able to make everything all right the way he had when you were both growing up with nothing dont remember gradually losing even that hope as the enclaves of living grew harder and harder to find the memories are part of you and as long as youre still breathing theyll always be there if you ever decide you need them it will always be easy to call them up in all their gory detail but you shouldnt want to as long as you remember enough to eat when youre hungry sleep when youre tired and find warm places when youre cold you know all you need to know or ever will need to know its much simpler that way anything else is just an open invitation to the dead walk the way they walk dragging your right foot to simulate tendons that have rotted away hanging your head to give the impression of a neck no longer strong enough to hold it erect recognizing obstructions only when youre in imminent danger of colliding with them and though the sights before you comprise an entire catalogue of horrors dont ever react only the living react this was the hardest rule for you to get down pat because part of you buried deep in the places that still belong to you and you alone has been screaming continuously since the night you first saw a walking corpse rip the entrails from the flesh of the living that part wants to make itself heard but thats the part which will get you killed dont let it have its voice dont be surprised if you turn a corner and almost trip over a limbless zombie inching its way up the street on its belly dont be horrified if you see a living person trapped by a mob of them about to be torn to pieces by them dont gag if one of the dead brushes up against you pressing its maggotinfested face up close against your own remember zombies dont react to things like that zombies are things like that now find a supermarket that still has stuff on the shelves you can if you look hard enough the dead arrived too quickly for the living to loot everything there was pick three or four cans off the shelves cut them open and eat whatever you find inside dont care whether theyre soup meat vegetables or dog food eat robotically tasting nothing registering nothing but the moment when youre full someday picking a can at random you may drink some drain cleaner or eat some rat poison chance alone will decide when that happens but it wont matter when it does your existence wont change a bit youll just convulse fall over lie still a while and then get up magically transformed into one of the zombies youve pretended to be for so long no fuss no muss you wont even have any reason to notice it when it happens maybe its already happened after lunch spot one of the towns few other living people shuffling listlessly down the center of the street you know this one well when you were still thinking in words you called her suzie shes dressed in clothes so old theyre rotting off her back her hair is the color of dirty straw and hideously matted from weeks maybe months of neglect her most striking features are her sunken cheekbones and the dark circles under her gray unseeing eyes even so youve always been able to tell that she must have been remarkably pretty once back when you were still trying to fight the bastardsthey were never zombies to you back then to you they were always the bastardsyou came very close to shooting suzies brains out before you realized that she was warm and breathing and alive you saw that though she was just barely aware enough to scrounge the food and shelter that kept her warm and breathing she was otherwise almost completely catatonic she taught you it was possible to pass for dead shes never spoken a word to you never smiled at you never once greeted you with anything that even remotely resembled human feeling but in the new world shes the closest thing you have to a lover and as you instinctively cross the street to catch her you should take some dim distant form of comfort in the way shes also changed direction to meet you remember though shes not really a lover not in the proper emotional sense of the word the dead hate love even more than they hate thought only the living love but its quite safe to fuck and as long as youre here the two of you can fuck quite openly just like the dead themselves do of course its different with them the necessary equipment is the first thing that rots away but instinct keeps prodding them to try whenever some random cue rekindles the urge they pick partners and rub against each other in a clumsy listless parody of sex that sometimes continues until both partners have been scraped into piles of carrion powder the ultimate dry hump so feel no fear it doesnt attract their attention when you and suzie grab each other and go for a quickie in the middle of the street to knead your hands against the novelty of warm skin to smell stale sweat instead of the open grave to take a rest from the horror that the world has become especially since though you both do what you have to do following all the mechanics of the act neither one of you feels a damn thing no affection no pleasure and certainly no joy that would be too dangerous do what you have to do do it quickly and then take your leave of each other exchange no kisses no goodbyes no cute terms of endearment no acknowledgement that your tryst was anything but a collision between two strangers walking in opposite directions just stagger away without looking back maybe youll see each other again maybe not it really doesnt matter either way spend the next few hours wandering from place to place seeing nothing hearing nothing accomplishing nothing but still drawing breath never forget that let the part of you still capable of caring about such things count that as a major victory at midafternoon pass the place where a school bus lies burned and blackened on one side a small group of living had trusted it to carry them to safety somewhere outside the city but it didnt even get five blocks through the obstacle course of other crashed vehicles before hundreds of dead had imprisoned them in a cage of groping flesh you were a block and a half away watching the siege and when the people in the bus eventually blew themselves up to avoid a more horrific end the heat of the fireball singed the eyebrows from your face at the time youd felt it served you right for not helping these days if you were capable of forming an opinion on anything youd feel that the living were silly bastards its stupid to resist only the living resist resistance implies will and if theres one thing the dead dont have its will exist the way they do dully accepting everything that happens to you and you stand a chance thats the one major reason your brother ben is dead oh you cant know what happened to him you know what happened to your wife and kidsyou know because you were watching trapped behind a chainlink fence as a lurching mob of what had once been elementary school children reduced them to shredded beefbut youll never ever find out what happened to ben still if you ever did find out what happened to him you would not be surprised because hed always been a leader a fighter hed always taken charge of every crisis that confronted him and inspired others with his ability to carry them through he was always special that way and when the dead rose he brought a whole bunch of naive trusting people down into his grave with him you on the other hand were never anything special you were always a follower a yesman an oreo you were always quick to kiss ass and agree with anybody who raised his voice loudly enough you never wanted to be anything but just another face in the crowd and though this profited you well in a society that was merely going to hell its been your single most important asset in the postplague world thats already arrived there its the reason youre still breathing when all the brave heroic defiant mythic ones like your brother ben and the people in the school bus are just gnawed bones and rorschach stains on the pavement take pride in that dont pass too close to the sooty remains of the school bus because you might remember how you stood downwind of their funeral pyre letting it bathe your skin and fill your lungs with the ashes of their empty defiance you might remember the cookedmeat burnt rubber stench the way the clouds billowed over you and through you as if you were far more insubstantial than they dont let that happen youll attract dead from blocks away force it back expunge it pretend its not there turn your mind blank your heart empty and your soul for lack of a better word dead there thats better still later that afternoon while rummaging through the wreckage of a clothing store for something that will keep you warm during the rapidly approaching winter you find yourself cornered and brutally beaten by the living this is nothing to concern yourself with its just the price you have to pay for living in safety the way you do theyre just halfmad from spending their lives fleeing one feeding frenzy or another and they have to let off some steam its not like theyll actually kill you or hurt you so bad youll sicken and die at least not deliberately they may go too far and kill you accidentally but they wont kill you deliberately there are already more than enough dead people running around giving them trouble but they hate you they consider people like you and suzie traitors and they wouldnt be able to respect themselves if they didnt let you know it there are four of them this time all pale all in their late teens all wearing the snottily evil grins of bullies whose chosen victim has detected their approach too late the closest one is letting out slack from a coil of chain at his side the chain ends in a padlock about the size of a fist and though you try to summon your longforgotten powers of speech as their blows rain against your ribs it really doesnt matter they already know what you would say dont beg dont fight back dont see yourself through their eyes just remember the living might be dangerous but the dead are the real bastards its later youre in too much pain to move thats all right itll go away eventually one way or the other alive or dead youll be up on your feet in no time meanwhile just lie there in your own stink in the wreckage of what used to be a clothing store and for christs sake be quiet because only the living scream remember that time not long after the dead rose when there were always screams no matter how far you ran how high you climbed or how deep you dug there were always the screams somewhere nearby reminding you that though you might have temporarily found a safe haven for the night there were always others who had found their backs against brick walls remember how you grew inured to those screams after a while and even found yourself able to sleep through them and as the weeks turned to months you found your tolerance rewardedbecause the closer the number of survivors approached zero the more that constant backdrop of screaming faded away to a long oppressive silence broken only by the low moans and random shuffling noises of the dead its a quiet world now and if youre to remain part of it youre going to have to be quiet too even if your throat catches fire and your breath turns as ragged as sandpaper and your sweat pools in a puddle beneath you and your ribs scrape together every time you draw a breath and the naked mannequins sharing this refuge with you take on the look of nina and mark and kathy and ben and everybody else who ever mattered to you and the look on their faces becomes one of utter disgust and you start to hear their voices saying that youre nothing and that you were always nothing but that theyd never known you were as much as a nothing as youve turned out to be shut up even if you want to tell them these people who once meant everything to you that you held on as long as any normal man could be expected to hold on but there are limits and you exceeded those limits you really did but there was just another set of limits beyond them and another beyond those and the new world kept making all these impossible demands on you and there were only so many impossible things you could bear be silent even if you hear nina shrieking your name and mark telling you hes afraid and kathy screaming for you to save her even if you hear ben demanding that you stand up like a man for once endure the pain ignore the fever dont listen to what your family is trying to tell you why should you listen to their advice it didnt help them no this is what you should keep in mind while youre waiting to see if youll live or die on the offchance you are still alive when you stumble to your feet tomorrow dont look at the fitting mirror on the wall behind you its the first intact mirror youve encountered in months nothing unusual about that of course there just isnt much unshattered glass left in the world these days but the looters and the rioters and the armies and the living dead have left this particular mirror untouched and though its horrendously discolored by dust it still works well enough to destroy you if you dont look at it youll be okay if you do look at it youll see the matted blood in your tangled shoulderlength hair and the flies crawling in your long scraggly beard and the prominent ribs and the clothes so worn they exist only as strips of rags and the dirt and the sores and the broken nose and the swollen mouth and the closed slit that was until recently your left eye and youll realize that this is as close to being dead as you can get without actually being there and that it sucks and youll be just in the right frame of mind after your long night of delirium to want to do something about it and youll stagger out into the street where the dead will be milling about doing nothing the way they always do and youll be in the center of them and youll be overcome with a sudden uncontrollable anger and youll open your mouth as wide as you can and youll scream hey and the dead will freeze in something very much resembling a doubletake and slowly swivel in your direction and if you really wanted to you could bury everything burning you up inside down where it was only a minute ago and you wont want to and youll scream hey again in a voice that carries surprisingly far for something that hasnt been used in so long and the dead will start coming for you and you wont care because youll be screaming you hear me you stinking bastards im alive i think and i feel and i care and im better than you because youll never have that again and youll die in agony screaming the names of everybody you used to love this may be what you want and granted you will go out convinced youve just won a moral victory but remember only the living bother with such things the dead wont even be impressed theyll just be hungry and if you let yourself die then within minutes whats left of you will wake up hungry too with only one fact still burning in its poor rotting skull that suzies faking zora and the zombie by andy duncan andy duncans fiction has appeared in magazines such as asimovs science fiction realms of fantasy conjunctions weird tales and sci fiction and in anthologies such as starlight eclipse one mojo conjure stories and wizards much of his short fiction has been collected in beluthahatchie and other stories which won the world fantasy award duncan won the world

for both the stoker and nebula awards it was also reprinted in the years best fantasy and horror and in that volume duncan is quoted as saying that hed been inspired by the work of zora neale hurston for years but that this story was the first time hed attempted to write about her i marvel that many readers judging from their comments never heard of hurston he says had i realized beforehand that this story would be many readers introduction to her i wouldnt have dared write it what is the truth the houngan shouted over the drums the mambo in response flung open her white dress she was naked beneath the drummers quickened their tempo as the mambo danced among the columns in a frenzy her loose clothing could not keep pace with her kicks swings and swivels her belt shawl kerchief dress floated free the mambo flung herself writhing onto the ground the first man in line shuffled forward on his knees to kiss the truth that glistened between the mambos thighs zoras pencil point snapped ah shit sweatdamp and jostled on all sides by the crowd she fumbled for her penknife and burned with futility zora had learned just that morning that the broadway hoofer and selfproclaimed anthropologist katherine dunham on her rosenwald fellowship to haitithe one that rightfully should have been zorasnot only witnessed this very truth ceremony a year ago for good measure underwent the threeday initiation to become mama katherine bride of the serpent god damballathe heifer three nights later another houngan knelt at another altar with a platter full of chicken people in the back began to scream a man with a terrible face flung himself through the crowd careened against people spread chaos his eyes rolled the tongue between his teeth drooled blood he is mounted the people cried a loa has made him his horse the houngan began to turn the horse crashed into him the houngan and the horse fell together limbs entwined the chicken was mashed into the dirt the people moaned and sobbed zora sighed she had read this in herskovitz and in johnson too still maybe poor fictional tea cake rabid would act like this in the pandemonium she silently leafed to the novel section of her notebook somethin got after me in mah sleep janie she had written tried tuh choke me tuh death another night another compound another pencil the dead man sat up head nodding forward jaw slack eyes bulging women and men shrieked the dead man lay back down and was still the mambo pulled the blanket back over him tucked it in perhaps tomorrow zora thought i will go to pont beudet or to ville bonheur perhaps something new is happening there miss hurston a woman whispered her heavy necklace clanking into zoras shoulder miss hurston have they shared with you what was found a month ago walking by daylight in the ennery road doctor legros chief of staff at the hospital at gonaives was a goodlooking mulatto of middle years with pomaded hair and a thin mustache his threepiece suit was all sharp creases and jutting angles like that of a paper doll and his handshake left zoras palm powder dry he poured her a belt of raw white clairin minus the nutmeg and peppers that would make it palatable to guede the prancing blackclad loa of derision but breathtaking nonetheless and as they took dutiful medicinal sips his small talk was all big all politicswhether mr roosevelt would be true to his word that the marines would never be back whether haitis good friend senator king of utah had larger ambitions whether america would support president vincent if the grateful haitians were to seek to extend his second term beyond the arbitrary date technically mandated by the constitutionbut his eyes to zora who was older than she looked and much older than she claimed posed an entirely different set of questions he seemed to view zora as a sort of plenipotentiary from washington and only reluctantly allowed her to steer the conversation to the delicate subject of his unusual patient it is important for your countrymen and your sponsors to understand miss hurston that the beliefs of which you speak are not the beliefs of civilized men in haiti or elsewhere these are negro beliefs embarrassing to the rest of us and confined to the canailleto the what is the phrase the backwater areas such as your american south these beliefs belong to haitis past not her future zora mentally placed the good doctor waistcoatdeep in a backwater area of eatonville florida and set gators upon him i understand doctor legros but i assure you im here for the full picture of your country not just the broadway version the tomtoms and the shouting but in every ministry veranda and salon i visit why even in the office of the directorgeneral of the health service what is all educated haiti talking about but your patient this unfortunate woman felicia felixmentor would you stuff my ears shelter me from the topic of the day he laughed his teeth white and perfect and artificial zora selfconscious of her own teeth smiled with her lips closed chin down this often passed for flirtation zora wondered what the brighteyed doctor legros thought of the seductive maneater erzulie the most uncivilized loa of all as she slowly crossed her legs she thought huh whats erzulie got on zora got on me well you are right to be interested in the poor creature the doctor said pinching a fresh cigarette into his holder while looking neither at it nor at zoras eyes i plan to write a monograph on the subject myself when the press of duty allows me perhaps i should apply for my own guggenheim eh clement he clapped his hands clement more clairin for our guest if you please and mangoes when we return from the yard as the doctor led her down the central corridor of the gingerbread victorian hospital he steered her around patients in creeping wicker wheelchairs spat volleys of french at cowed black women in white and told her the story she already knew raising his voice whenever passing a doorway through which moans were unusually loud in a young wife and mother in ennery town died after a brief illness she had a christian burial her widower and son grieved for a time then moved on with their lives as men must do empty this basin immediately do you hear me woman this is a hospital not a chickenhouse my pardon now we come to a month ago the haitian guard received reports of a madwoman accosting travelers near ennery she made her way to a farm and refused to leave became violently agitated by all attempts to dislodge her the owner of this family farm was summoned he took one look at this poor creature and said my god it is my sister dead and buried nearly thirty years watch your step please he held open a french door and ushered her onto a flagstone veranda out of the hot close bloodsmelling hospital into the hot close outdoors scented with hibiscus goats charcoal and tobacco in bloom and all the other family members too including her husband and son have identified her and so one mystery was solved and in the process another took its place in the far corner of the dusty enclosed yard in the sallow shade of an hourglass grove a sexless figure in a white hospital gown stood huddled against the wall shoulders hunched and back turned like a child chosen it and counting thats her said the doctor as they approached one of the hourglass fruits dropped onto the stony ground and burst with a report like a pistol firing not three feet behind the huddled figure she didnt budge it is best not to surprise her the doctor murmured hot clairin breath in zoras ear hand in the small of her back her movements are unpredictable as yours are not zora thought stepping away the doctor began to hum a tune that sounded like mama dont want no peas no rice she dont want no coconut oil all she wants is brandy handy all the time but wasnt at the sound of his humming the womanfor woman she was zora would resist labeling her as all haiti had donesprang forward into the wall with a fleshy smack as if trying to fling herself face first through the stones then sprang backward with a halfturn that set her arms to swinging without volition like pendulums her eyes were beads of clouded glass the broad lumpish face around them might have been attractive had its muscles displayed any of the tension common to animal life in her first brush with theater years before zora had spent months scrubbing bustles and darning epaulets during a tour of that damned mikado may gilbert and sullivan both lose their heads and there she learned that putty cheeks and false noses slide into grotesquerie by the final act this womans face likewise seemed to have been sweated beneath too long all this zora registered in a second as she would a face from an elevated train the woman immediately turned away again snatched down a slim hourglass branch and slashed the ground back and forth as a machete slashes through cane the three attached fruits blew up bang bang bang seeds clouding outward as she flailed the branch in the dirt what is she doing she sweeps the doctor said she fears being caught idle for idle servants are beaten in some quarters he tried to reach around the suddenly nimble woman and take the branch nnnnn she said twisting away still slashing the dirt behave yourself felicia this visitor wants to speak with you please leave her be zora said ashamed because the name felicia jarred when applied to this wretch i didnt mean to disturb her ignoring this the doctor eyes shining stopped the slashing movements by seizing the womans skinny wrist and holding it aloft the patient froze knees bent in a halfcrouch head averted as if awaiting a blow with his free hand the doctor still humming still watching the womans face pried her fingers from the branch one by one then flung it aside nearly swatting zora the patient continued saying nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn at metronomic intervals the sound lacked any note of panic or protest any communicative tonality whatsoever was instead a simple emission like the whistle of a turpentine cooker felicia zora asked nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn my name is zora and i come from florida in the united states nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn i have heard her make one other noise only said the doctor still holding up her arm as if she were joe louis and that is when she is bathed or touched with watera sound like a mouse that is trod upon i will demonstrate where is that hose no need for that zora cried release her please the doctor did so felicia scuttled away clutched and lifted the hem of her gown until her face was covered and her buttocks bared zora thought of her mothers wake where her aunts and cousins had greeted each fresh burst of tears by flipping their aprons over their heads and rushing into the kitchen to mewl together like nestlings thank god for aprons zora thought felicias legs to zoras surprise were ropy with muscle such strength the doctor murmured and so untamed you realize miss hurston that when she was found squatting in the road she was as naked as all mankind a horsefly droned past the doctor cleared his throat clasped his hands behind his back and began to orate as if addressing a medical society at columbia it is interesting to speculate on the drugs used to rob a sentient being of her reason of her will the ingredients even the means of administration are most jealously guarded secrets he paced toward the hospital not looking at zora and did not raise his voice as he spoke of herbs and powders salves and cucumbers as if certain she walked alongside him unbidden instead she stooped and hefted the branch felicia had wielded it was much heavier than she had assumed so lightly had felicia snatched it down zora tugged at one of its twigs and found the dense rubbery wood quite resistant lucky for the doctor that anger seemed to be among the emotions cooked away what emotions were left fear remained certainly and what else zora dropped the branch next to a gouge in the dirt that as she glanced at it seemed to resolve itself into the letter m miss hurston called the doctor from halfway across the yard i beg your pardon you have seen enough have you not zora knelt her hands outstretched as if to encompass to contain the scratches that felicia felixmentor had slashed with the branch yes that was definitely an m and that vertical slash could be an i and that next one mi haut mi bas half high half low doctor boas at barnard liked to say that one began to understand a people only when one began to think in their language now as she knelt in the hospital yard staring at the words felicia felixmentor had left in the dirt a phrase welled from her lips that she had heard often in haiti but never felt before a creole phrase used to mean so be it to mean amen to mean there you have it to mean whatever one chose it to mean but always conveying a more or less resigned acquiescence to the world and all its marvels ah bo bo zora said miss hurston the doctors dusty wingtips entered her vision stood on the delicate pattern zora had teased from the dirt a pattern that began to disintegrate outward from the shoes as if they produced a breeze or tidal eddy are you suffering perhaps the digestion often the peasant spices can disrupt refined systems might i have clement bring you a soda orand here his voice took on new excitementcould this be perhaps a feminine complaint no thank you doctor zora said as she stood ignoring his outstretched hand may i please do you think return tomorrow with my camera she intended the request to sound casual but failed not in damballa calls not in the white king of la gonave not in the magic island not in any bestseller ever served up to the haitiloving american public had anyone ever included a photograph of a zombie as she held her breath the doctor squinted and glanced from zora to the patient and back as if suspecting the two women of collusion he loudly sucked a tooth it is impossible madame he said tomorrow i must away to portdepaix leaving at dawn and not returning for it must be tomorrow zora blurted hastily adding because the next day i have an appointment in petionville to obscure that slightest of pauses she gushed oh doctor legros and dimpled his tailored shoulder with her forefinger until we have the pleasure of meeting again surely you wont deny me this one small token of your regard since she was a sprat of thirteen sashaying around the gatepost in eatonville slowing yankees aboil for winter park or sunken gardens or the weeki wachee with a wink and a wave zora had viewed sexuality like other talents as a bank of backstage switches to be flipped separately or together to achieve specific effectsa spotlight glare a thunderstorm the slow seeping warmth of dawn few switches were needed for everyday use and certainly not for doctor legros who was the most everyday of men but of course the doctor said his body ready and still doctor belfong will expect you and i will ensure that he extend you every courtesy and then miss hurston we will compare travel notes on another day nestce pas as she stepped onto the veranda zora looked back felicia felixmentor stood in the middle of the yard arms wrapped across her torso as if chilled rocking on the balls of her calloused feet she was looking at zora if at anything behind her a dusty flamingo highstepped across the yard zora found signboards in haiti fairly easy to understand in french but the english ones were a different story as she wedged herself into a seat in the crowded taptap that rattled twice a day between gonaives and portauprince felicia felixmentor an hour planted and taking root in her mind she found herself facing a stern injunction above the grimy cracked windshield passengers are not permitted to stand forward while the bus is either at a standstill or approaching in motion as the bus lurched forward tires spinning gears grinding the driver loudly recited dear clients let us pray to the good god and to all the most merciful martyrs in heaven that we may be delivered safely unto our chosen destination amen amen zora thought despite herself already jotting in her notebook the beautiful woman in the window seat beside her shifted sideways to give zoras elbow more room and zora absently flashed her a smile at the top of the page she wrote felicia felixmentor the hyphen jagging upward from a pothole then she added a question mark and tapped the pencil against her teeth who had felicia been and what life had she led where was her family of these matters doctor legros refused to speak maybe the family had abandoned its feeble relative or worse the poor woman may have been brutalized into her present state such things happened at the hands of family members zora knew zora found herself doodling a shambling figure arms outstretched nothing like felicia she conceded more like mr karloffs monster several years before in new york to put together a broadway production that came to nothing zora had wandered depressed and whimsical into a times square movie theater to see a foolish horror movie titled white zombie the swaying sugar cane on the poster she was not dead she was not alive what was she suggested however spuriously haiti which even then zora hoped to visit one day bela lugosi in mephistophelean whiskers proved about as haitian as fannie hurst and his zombies stalking bugeyed and stifflegged around the tatty sets all looked white to zora so she couldnt grasp the urgency of the title whatever lugosis designs on the heroine raising zombies just to staff a sugar mill moreover struck her as wasted effort since many a live haitian or floridian would work a full depression day for as little pay as any zombie and do a better job too still she admired how the movie zombies walked mindlessly to their doom off the parapet of lugosis castle just as the fanatic soldiers of the mad haitian king henri christophe were supposed to have done from the heights of the citadel laferriere but suppose felicia were a zombiein haitian terms anyway not a supernaturally revived corpse but a sort of combined kidnap and poisoning victim released or abandoned by her captor her bocor after three decades supposedly the bocor stole a victims soul by mounting a horse backward facing the tail and riding by night to her house there he knelt on the doorstep pressed his face against the crack beneath the door bared his teeth and sssssssst he inhaled the soul of the sleeping woman breathed her right into his lungs and then the bocor would have marched felicia so the tales went past her house the next night her first night as a zombie to prevent her ever recognizing it or seeking it again yet felicia had sought out the family farm however late maybe something had gone wrong with the spell maybe someone had fed her saltthe hairofthedog remedy for yearslong zombie hangovers where then was felicias bocor why hold her prisoner all this time but no longer had he died setting his charge free to wander had he other charges other zombies how had felicia become both victim and escapee and how do you like your zombie miss hurston zora started the beautiful passenger beside her had spoken i beg your pardon zora instinctively shut her notebook i do not believe we have met miss the widemouthed stranger laughed merrily her opalescent earrings shimmering on her high cheekbones one ringlet of brown hair spilled onto her forehead from beneath her kerchief which like her tightfitting highnecked dress was an everswirling riot of color her heavy gold necklace was nearly lost in it her skin was two parts cream to one part coffee antebellum new orleans would have been at this womans feet once the shutters were latched ah i knew you did not recognize me miss hurston her accent made the first syllable of hurston a prolonged purr we met in arcahaie in the hounfort of dieu donnez st leger during the rite of the fishhook of the dead she bulged her eyes and sat forward slackjawed then fell back clapping her hands with delight ruby ring flashing at her passable imitation of a dead man you may call me freida it is i miss hurston who first told you of the zombie felixmentor their exchange in the sweltering crowd had been brief and confused but zora could have sworn that her informant that night had been an older plainer woman still zora probably hadnt looked her best either the deacons and mothers back home would deny it but many a worshipper looked better outside church than in zora apologized for her absentmindedness thanked this freida for her tip and told her some of her hospital visit she left out the message in the dirt if message it was but mused aloud today we lock the poor woman away but who knows once she may have had a place of honor as a messenger touched by the gods no no no no no no no said freida in a forceful singsong no the gods did not take her powers away she leaned in became conspiratorial some man and only a man did that you saw you know zora teasing said ah so you have experience with men none more freida stated then she smiled ah bo bo that is night talk let us speak instead of daylight things the two women chatted happily for a bouncing halfhour freida questioning and zora answeringtalking about her haiti book turpentine camps the sights of new york it was good to be questioned herself for a change after collecting from others all the time the taptap jolted along ladling dust equally onto all who shared the road mounted columns of haitian guards shelfhipped laundresses halfdead donkeys laden with guineagrass the days shadows lengthened this is my stop said freida at length though the taptap showed no signs of slowing and no stop was visible through the windows just dense palm groves to either side where a less graceful creature would merely have stood freida rose then turned and edged toward the aisle facing not the front but oddly the back of the bus zora swiveled in her seat to give her more room but freida pressed against her anyway thrust her pelvis forward against the older womans bosom zora felt freidas heat through the thin material above freida flashed a smile nipped her own lower lip and chuckled as the pluck of skin fell back into place i look forward to our next visit miss hurston and where might i call on you zora asked determined to follow the conventions freida edged past and swayed down the aisle not reaching for the handgrips youll find me she said over her shoulder zora opened her mouth to say something but forgot what directly in front of the bus visible through the windshield past freidas shoulder a charcoal truck roared into the roadway at right angles zora braced herself for the crash the taptap driver screamed with everyone else stamped the brakes and spun the wheel with a hellish screech the bus slewed about in a cloud of dirt and dust that darkened the sunlight crusted zoras tongue and hid the charcoal truck from view for one long delirious nearly sexual moment the bus tipped sideways then it righted itself with a toothloosening slam that shattered the windshield in the silence zora heard someone sobbing heard the engines last faltering cough heard the front door slide open with its usual clatter she righted her hat in order to see the taptap and the charcoal truck had come to rest a foot away from one another side by side and facing opposite directions freida smiling unscathed kerchief still angled just so sauntered down the aisle between the vehicles one finger trailing along the side of the truck tracking the dust like a child she passed zoras window without looking up and was gone she pulled in her horizon like a great fishnet pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder so much of life in its meshes she called in her soul to come and see mouth dry head aching from the heat and from the effort of reading her own chickenscratch zora turned the last page of the manuscript squared the stack and looked up at her audience felicia sat on an hourglass root a baked yam in each hand gnawing first one then the other thats the end zora said in the same soft nonthreatening voice with which she had read her novel thus far im still unsure of the middle she continued setting down the manuscript and picking up the brownie camera but i know this is the end all right and thats something as yam after yam disappeared skins and all felicias eyes registered nothing no matter zora always liked to read her work aloud as she was writing and felicia was as good an audience as anybody she was in fact the first audience this particular book had had while zora had no concerns whatsoever about sharing her novel with felicia she was uncomfortably aware of the narrow victorian casements above and felt the attentive eyes of the dying and the mad on the veranda a bent old man in a wheelchair mumbled to himself halfwatched by a nurse with a magazine in a spasm of experiment zora had salted the yams to no visible effect this zombie took salt like an editor took whiskey im not in your country to write a novel zora told her chewing companion not officially im being paid just to do folklore on this trip why this novel isnt even set in haiti ha so i cant tell the foundation about this quite yet its our secret right felicia the hospital matron had refused zora any of her good china grudgingly piling bribeyams onto a scarred gourdplate instead now only two were left the plate sat on the ground just inside felicias reach chapter by chapter yam by yam zora had been reaching out and dragging the plate just a bit nearer herself a bit farther away from felicia so far felicia had not seemed to mind now zora moved the plate again just as felicia was licking the previous two yams off her fingers felicia reached for the plate then froze when she registered that it was out of reach she sat there arm suspended in the air nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn she said zora sat motionless cradling her brownie camera in her lap felicia slid forward on her buttocks and snatched up two yamschoosing to eat them where she now sat as zora had hoped rather than slide backward into the shade once more zora took several pictures in the sunlight though none of them she later realized managed to penetrate the shadows beneath felicias furrowed brow where the patients sightless eyes lurked zombies came an unearthly cry the old man on the veranda was having a spasm legs kicking arms flailing the nurse moved quickly propelled his wheelchair toward the hospital door i made them all zombies zombies observe my powers said the mad zombiemaker king henri christophe twirling his stage mustache and leering down at the beautiful youngish anthropologist who squirmed against her snakeskin bonds the mad kings broad white face and syrupy accent suggested budapest at his languid gesture blackandwhite legions of zombies both black and white shuffled into view around the papierm√¢ch√© cliff and marched single file up the steps of the balsa parapet and over none cried out as he fell flipping through his captives notebook the king laughed maniacally and said i never knew you wrote this why this is good as zombies toppled behind him like ninepins their german expressionist shadows scudding across his face the mad king began hammily to read aloud the opening passage of imitation of life zora woke in a sweat the rain still sheeted down a ceremonial drumming on the slate roof her manuscript a white blob in the darkness was moving sideways along the desktop she watched as it went over the edge and dashed itself across the floor with a sound like a gust of wind so the iguana had gotten in again it loved messing with her manuscript she should take the iguana to new york get it a job at lippincotts she isolated the iguanas crouching bowlegged shape in the drumming darkness and lay still never sure whether iguanas jumped and how far and why gradually she became aware of another sound nearer than the rain someone crying zora switched on the bedside lamp found her slippers with her feet and reached for her robe the top of her writing desk was empty the manuscript must have been topheavy thats all shaking her head at her night fancies cinching her belt yawning zora walked into the corridor and nearly stepped on the damned iguana as it scuttled just ahead of her claws clackclackclacking on the hardwood zora tugged off her left slipper and gripped it by the toe as an unlikely weapon as she followed the iguana into the great room her housekeeper lucille lay on the sofa crying twohanded into a handkerchief the window above her was open curtains billowing and the iguana escaped as it had arrived scrambling up the back of the sofa and out into the hissing rain lucille was oblivious until zora closed the sash when she sat up with a start oh miss you frightened me i thought the sect rouge had come ah yes the sect rouge that secret invisible mountaindwelling cannibal cult their distant nocturnal drums audible only to the doomed whose blood thirst made the klan look like the bethunecookman board of visitors was lucilles most cherished night terror zora had never had a housekeeper before never wanted one but lucille came with the house as the agent had put it it was all a package mountainside view sect rouge paranoia hot and cold running iguanas lucille darling whatever is the matter why are you crying a fresh burst of tears it is my faithless husband madame my etienne he has forsaken me for erzulie she fairly spat the name as a wronged woman in eatonville would have spat the infamous name of miss delpheeny zora had laid eyes on etienne only once when he came flushed and hatless to the back door to show off his prize catch grinning as widely as the dead caiman he held up by the tail for his giggling wifes benefit he had tied a pink ribbon around the creatures neck and zora had decided then that lucille was as lucky a woman as any there there come to zora here blow your nose thats better you neednt tell me any more if you dont want to who is this erzulie zora had heard much about erzulie in haiti always from other women in tones of resentment and admiration but she was keen for more oh madame she is a terrible woman she has every man she wants all the men and and some of the women too this last said in a hush of reverence no home in haiti is safe from her first she came to my etienne in his dreams teasing and tormenting his sleep until he cried out and spent himself in the sheets then she troubled his waking life too with frets and ill fortune so that he was angry with himself and with me all the time finally i sent him to the houngan and the houngan said why do you ask me what this is any child could say to you the truth you have been chosen as a consort of erzulie and then he embraced my etienne and said my son your bed above all beds is now the one for all men to envy ah madame religion is a hard thing for women even as she tried to console the weeping woman zora felt a pang of writerly conscience on the one hand she genuinely wanted to help on the other hand everything was material whenever erzulie pleases she takes the form that a man most desires to ride him as dry as a bean husk and to rob his woman of comfort oh madame my etienne has not come to my bed in in twelve days she collapsed into the sofa in a fresh spasm of grief buried her head beneath a cushion and began to hiccup twelve whole days zora thought my my as she did dispiriting math but she said nothing only patted lucilles shoulder and cooed later while frying an egg for her dejected redeyed housekeeper zora sought to change the subject lucille didnt i hear you say the other day when the postman ran over the rooster something like ah the zombies eat well tonight yes madame i think i did say this thing and last week when you spotted that big spider web just after putting the ladder away you said ah bo bo the zombies make extra work for me today when you say such things lucille what do you mean to what zombies do you refer oh madame it is just a thing to say when small things go wrong oh the milk is sour the zombies have put their feet in it and so on my mother always says it and her mother too soon lucille was chatting merrily away about the little coffee girls and the ritual baths at saut deau and zora took notes and drank coffee and all was well ah bo bo the sun was still hours from rising when lucilles chatter shut off midsentence zora looked up to see lucille frozen in terror eyes wide face ashen madame listen lucille i hear nothing but the rain on the roof madame lucille whispered the rain has stopped zora set down her pencil and went to the window only a few drops pattered from the eaves and the trees in the distance far up the mountain someone was beating the drumsten drums a hundred who could say the sound was like thunder sustained never coming closer but never fading either zora closed and latched the shutters and turned back to lucille with a smile honey thats just mannoise in the night like the bigmouthing on the porch at joe clarkes store you mean i never told you about all the lying that men do back home break us another egg cille honey and ill tell you some things box b portauprince haiti november dr henry allen moe sec john simon guggenheim memorial foundation fifth avenue new york city new york dear dr moe i regret to report that for all my knocking and ringing and dustraising i have found no relatives of this unfortunate felixmentor woman she is both famous and unknown all have heard of her and know or think they know the twosentence outline of her story and have their own fantasies about her but can go no further she is the garbo of haiti i would think her a madeup character had i not seen her myself and taken her picture as evidence a photograph of the empire state building is evidence too but of what that is for the viewer to say i am amused of course as you were to hear from some of our friends and colleagues on the haiti beat their concerns that poor zora has gone native has thrown away the wpa and jesse owens and the travel trailer and all the other achievements of the motherland to break chickens and become an initiate in the mysteries of the sect rouge lord knows dr moe i spent twentyplus years in the southern us beneath the constant gaze of every first abyssinian macedonian african methodist episcopal presbyterian pentecostal free will baptist assembly of god of christ of jesus with signs following minister mother and deacon all so full of the spirit they look like death eating crackers and in all that time i never once came down with even a mild case of christianity i certainly wont catch the local disease from only six months in haiti obligations travel and illnesssuffering perhaps the digestion thank you doctor legroskept zora away from the hospital at gonaives for some weeks when she finally did return she walked onto the veranda to see felicia as before standing all alone in the quiet yard her face toward the high wall today felicia had chosen to stand on the sole visible spot of green grass a plot of soft imprisoned turf about the diameter of an easter hat zora felt a deep satisfaction upon seeing her this selfcontained fixed point in her travelers life to reach the steps she had to walk past the mad old man in the wheelchair whose nurse was not in sight today despite his sunken cheeks his matted eyelashes his patchy tufts of white hair zora could see he must have been handsome in his day she smiled as she approached he blinked and spoke in a thoughtful voice i will be a zombie soon he said that stopped her excuse me death came for me many years ago said the old man eyes bright and i said no not me take my wife instead and so i gave her up as a zombie that gained me five years you see a good bargain and then five years later i gave our oldest son then our daughter then our youngest and more loved ones too now all zombies all there is no one left no one but me his hands plucked at the coverlet that draped his legs he peered all around the yard i will be a zombie soon he said and wept shaking her head zora descended the steps approaching felicia from behind as doctor legros had said that first day was always a delicate maneuver one had to be loud enough to be heard but quiet enough not to panic her hello felicia zora said the huddled figure didnt turn didnt budge and zora emboldened by long absence repeated the name reached out touched felicias shoulder with her fingertips as she made contact a tingling shiver ran up her arm and down her spine to her feet without turning felicia emerged from her crouch she stood up straight flexed her shoulders stretched her neck and spoke zora my friend felicia turned and was not felicia at all but a tall beautiful woman in a brief white gown freida registered the look on zoras face and laughed did i not tell you that you would find me do you not even know your friend freida zoras breath returned i know you she retorted and i know that was a cruel trick where is felicia what have you done with her whatever do you mean felicia was not mine to give you and she is not mine to take away no one is owned by anyone why is felicia not in the yard is she ill and why are you here are you ill as well freida sighed so many questions is this how a book gets written if felicia were not ill silly she would not have been here in the first place besides she squared her shoulders why do you care so about this powerless woman this woman who let some man lead her soul astray like a starving cat behind an eelbarrel she stepped close the heat of the day coalescing around tell a woman of power your book tell me your book she murmured tell me of the mules funeral and the rising waters and the buzzing peartree and young janies secret sigh zora had two simultaneous thoughts like a moan and a breath interlaced get out of my book and my god shes jealous why bother zora bit off flush with anger you think you know it by heart already and besides zora continued stepping forward nose to nose there are powers other than yours freida hissed stepped back as if pattered with stovegrease zora put her nose in the air and said airily ill have you know that felicia is a writer too her mouth a thin line freida turned and strode toward the hospital thighs long and taut beneath her gown without thought zora walked too and kept pace if you must know freida said your writer friend is now in the care of her family her son came for her do you find this so remarkable perhaps the son should have notified you hmm she winked at zora he is quite a muscular young man with a taste for older women much much older women i could show you where he lives i have been there often i have been there more than he knows how dependent you are zora said on men as freida stepped onto the veranda the old man in the wheelchair cringed and moaned hush child freida said she pulled a nurses cap from her pocket and tugged it on over her chestnut hair dont let her take me the old man howled shell make me a zombie she will a zombie oh pish freida said she raised one bare foot and used it to push the wheelchair forward a foot or so revealing a sensible pair of white shoes on the flagstones beneath these she stepped into as she wheeled the chair around here is your bocor miss hurston what use have i for a zombies cold hands au revoir miss hurston zora i hope you find much to write about in my country however you limit your experiences zora stood at the foot of the steps watched her wheel the old man away over the uneven flagstones erzulie zora said the woman stopped without turning she asked what name did you call me i called you a true name and im telling you that if you dont leave lucilles etienne alone so the two of them can go to hell in their own way then i well then i will forget all about you and you will never be in my book freida pealed with laughter the old man slumped in his chair the laughter cut off like a radio and freida suddenly grave looked down they do not last any time do they she murmured with a forefinger she poked the back of his head poor pretty things with a sigh she faced zora gave her a look of frank appraisal up and down then she shrugged you are mad she said but you are fair she backed into the door shoved it open with her behind and hauled the dead man in after her the taptap was running late as usual so zora restless started out on foot as long as the road kept going downhill and the sun stayed over yonder she reasoned she was unlikely to get lost as she walked through the countryside she sang and picked flowers and worked on her book in the best way she knew to work on a book in her own head with no paper and indeed no words not yet she enjoyed the caution signs on each curvela route tue et blesse or literally the road kills and injures she wondered how it felt to walk naked along a roadside like felicia felixmentor she considered trying the experiment when she realized that night had fallen and where was the taptap and all the other traffic and why was the road so narrow but once shed her dress her shift her shoes would be a terrible armful the only efficient way to carry clothes really was to wear them so thinking she plodded footsore around a sharp curve and nearly ran into several dozen hooded figures in red proceeding in the opposite direction several carried torches all carried drums and one had a large meanlooking dog on a rope who comes asked a deep male voice zora couldnt tell which of the hooded figures had spoken if any who wants to know she asked the hoods looked at one another without speaking several reached into their robes one drew a sword one drew a machete the one with the dog drew a pistol then knelt to murmur into the dogs ear with one hand he scratched the dog between the shoulder blades and with the other he gently stroked its head with the moongleaming barrel of the pistol zora could hear the thump and rustle of the dogs tail wagging in the leaves give us the words of passage said the voice presumably the swordwielders as he was the one who pointed at zora for emphasis give them to us woman or you will die and we will feast upon you she cannot know the words said a womans voice unless she too has spoken with the dead let us eat her suddenly as well as she knew anything on the round old world zora knew exactly what the words of passage were felicia felixmentor had given them to her mi haut mi bas half high half low she could say them now but she would not say them she would believe in zombies a little and in erzulie perhaps a little more but she would not believe in the sect rouge in bloodoathed societies of men she walked forward again of her own free will and the redrobed figures stood motionless as she passed among them the dog whimpered she walked down the hill hearing nothing behind but a growing chorus of frogs around the next bend she saw the distant lights of portauprince and much nearer a taptap idling in front of a store zora laughed and hung her hat on a caution sign between her and the bus the moonlit road was flecked with tiny frogs distinguished from bits of gravel and bark only by their leaping their errands of life ah bo bo she called in her soul to come and see calcutta lord of nerves by poppy z brite poppy z brite is the author of many novels including lost souls exquisite corpse liquor and soul kitchen among others her short fiction has appeared in a number of anthologies such as borderlands dark terrors shadows over baker street mcsweeneys enchanted chamber of astonishing stories and outsiders a new short fiction collection antediluvian tales was released in she is also coeditor with martin h greenberg of the vampire erotica anthologies love in vein and love in vein this story was nominated for the world fantasy award losing out to this years class picture by dan simmons which is ironic because calcutta lord of nerves was inspired by simmonss novel song of kali i approached calcutta and the goddess kali from a very different point of view brite says but my story would never have been written without dans novel incidentally in his acceptance speech simmons said the award should have gone to calcutta this story is a sort of travelogue through the zombieravaged city of calcutta more picaresque than plotdriven it basically consists of a guy walking around and looking at things brite says what makes the story interesting i hope is that the sights he sees are extremely unusual and vivid i was born in a north calcutta hospital in the heart of an indian midnight just before the beginning of the monsoon season the air hung heavy as wet velvet over the hooghly river offshoot of the holy ganga and the stumps of banyan trees on the upper chitpur road were flecked with dots of phosphorus like the ghosts of flames i was as dark as the new moon in the sky and i cried very little i feel as if i remember this because this is the way it must have been my mother died in labor and later that night the hospital burned to the ground i have no reason to connect the two incidents then again i have no reason not to perhaps a desire to live burned on in my mothers heart perhaps the flames were fanned by her hatred for me the insignificant mewling infant that had killed her a nurse carried me out of the roaring husk of the building and laid me in my fathers arms he cradled me numb with grief my father was american he had come to calcutta five years earlier on business there he had fallen in love with my mother and like a man who will not pluck a flower from its garden he could not bear to see her removed from the hot lush squalid city that had spawned her it was part of her exotica so my father stayed in calcutta now his flower was gone he pressed his thin chapped lips to the satin of my hair i remember opening my eyesthey felt tight and shiny parched by the flamesand looking up at the column of smoke that roiled into the sky a night sky blasted cloudy pink like a sky full of blood and milk there would be no milk for me only chemicaltasting drops of formula from a plastic nipple the morgue was in the basement of the hospital and did not burn my mother lay on a metal table a hospital gown stiff with her dying sweat pulled up over her redsmeared crotch and thighs her eyes stared up through the blackened skeleton of the hospital up to the milky bloody sky and ash filtered down to mask her pupils my father and i left for america before the monsoon came without my mother calcutta was a pestilential hellhole a vast cremation grounds or so my father thought in america he could send me to school and movies ball games and boy scouts secure in the knowledge that someone else would take care of me or i would take care of myself there were no thuggees to rob me and cut my throat no goondas who would snatch me and sell my bones for fertilizer there were no cows to infect the streets with their steaming sacred piss my father could give me over to the comparative wholesomeness of american life leaving himself free to sit in his darkened bedroom and drink whiskey until his long sensitive nose floated hazily in front of his face and the sabre edge of his grief began to dull he was the sort of man who has only one love in his lifetime and knows with the sick fervor of a fatalist that this love will be taken from him someday and is hardly surprised when it happens when he was drunk he would talk about calcutta my little american mind rejected the placei was in love with air conditioning hamburgers and pizza the free and indiscriminating love that was lavished upon me every time i twisted the tv dialbut somewhere in my indian heart i longed for it when i turned eighteen and my father finally failed to wake up from one of his drunken stupors i returned to the city of my bloody birth as soon as i had the plane fare in my hand calcutta you will say what a place to have been when the dead began to walk and i reply what better place to be what better place than a city where five million people look as if they are already deadmight as well be deadand another five million wish they were i have a friend named devi a prostitute who began her work at the age of fifteen from a tarpaper shack on sudder street sudder is the bourbon street of calcutta but there is far less of the carnival there and no one wears a mask on sudder street because disguises are useless when shame is irrelevant devi works the big hotels now selling american tourists or british expatriates or german businessmen a taste of exotic bengal spice she is gaunt and beautiful and hard as nails devi says the world is a whore too and calcutta is the pussy of the world the world squats and spreads its legs and calcutta is the dank sex you see revealed there wet and fragrant with a thousand odors both delicious and foul a source of lushest pleasure a breeding ground for every conceivable disease the pussy of the world it is all right with me i like pussy and i love my squalid city the dead like pussy too if they are able to catch a woman and disable her enough so that she cannot resist you will see the lucky ones burrowing in between her legs as happily as the most avid lover they do not have to come up for air i have seen them eat all the way up into the body cavity the internal female organs seem to be a great delicacy and why not they are the caviar of the human body it is a sobering thing to come across a woman sprawled in the gutter with her intestines sliding from the shredded ruin of her womb but you do not react you do not distract the dead from their repast they are slow and stupid but that is all the more reason for you to be smart and quick and quiet they will do the same thing to a manchew off the soft penis and scrotal sac like choice morsels of squid leaving only a red raw hole but you can sidle by while they are feeding and they will not notice you i do not try to hide from them i walk the streets and look that is all i do anymore i am fascinated this is not horror this is simply more of calcutta first i would sleep late through the sultry morning into the heat of the afternoon i had a room in one of the decrepit marble palaces of the old city devi visited me here often but on a typical morning i woke alone clad only in twisted bedsheets and a luxurious patina of sweat sun came through the window and fell in bright bars across the floor i felt safe in my secondstory room as long as i kept the door locked the dead were seldom able to navigate stairs and they could not manage the sustained cooperative effort to break down a locked door they were no threat to me they fed upon those who had given up those too traumatized to keep running the senile abandoned old the catatonic young women who sat in gutters cradling babies that had died during the night these were easy prey the walls of my room were painted a bright coral and the sills and door were aqua the colors caught the sun and made the day seem cheerful despite the heat that shimmered outside i went downstairs crossed the empty courtyard with its dry marble fountain and went out into the street this area was barren in the heat painfully bright with parched weeds lining the road and an occasional smear of cow dung decorating the gutter by nightfall both weeds and dung might be gone children collected cow shit and patted it into cakes held together with straw which could be sold as fuel for cooking fires i headed toward chowringhee road the broad main thoroughfare of the city halfway up my street hunched under the awning of a mattress factory i saw one of the catatonic young mothers the dead had found her too they had already taken the baby from her arms and eaten though the soft part at the top of the skull vacuous bloody faces rose and dipped curds of tender brain fell from slack mouths the mother sat on the curb nearby her arms cradling nothing she wore a filthy green sari that was ripped across the chest the womans breasts protruded heavily swollen with milk when the dead finished with her baby they would start on her and she would make no resistance i had seen it before i knew how the milk would spurt and then gush as they tore into her breasts i knew how hungrily they would lap up the twin rivers of blood and milk above their bobbing heads the tin awning dripped long ropy strands of cotton cotton hung from the roof in dirty clumps caught in the corners of the doorway like spiderweb someones radio blared faintly in another part of the building tuned to an englishlanguage christian broadcast a gospel hymn assured calcutta that its dead in christ would rise i moved on toward chowringhee most of the streets in the city are positively cluttered with buildings buildings are packed in cheekbyjowl helterskelter like books of different sizes jammed into a rickety bookcase buildings even sag over the street so that all you see overhead is a narrow strip of sky crisscrossed by miles of clotheslines the flapping silks and cottons are very bright against the sodden dirty sky but there are certain vantage points where the city opens up and all at once you have a panoramic view of calcutta you see a long muddy hillside that has become home to a bustee thousands and thousands of slum dwellings where tiny fires are tended through the night the dead come often to these slums of tin and cardboard but the people do not leave the busteewhere would they go or you see a wasteland of disused factories empty warehouses blackened smokestacks jutting into a rustcolored sky or a flash of the hooghly river steelgray in its shroud of mist spanned by the intricate girderandwirescape of the howrah bridge just now i was walking opposite the river the waterfront was not considered a safe place because of the danger from drowning victims thousands each year took the long plunge off the bridge and thousands more simply waded into the water it is easy to commit suicide at a riverfront because despair collects in the water vapor this is part of the reason for the tangible cloud of despair that hangs over calcutta along with its veil of humidity now the suicides and the drowned street children were coming out of the river at any moment the water might regurgitate one and you would hear him scrabbling up the bank if he had been in the water long enough he might tear himself to spongy gobbets on the stones and broken bricks that littered the waterfront all that remained would be a trace of foul brown odor like the smell of mud from the deep part of the river policeespecially the sikhs who are said to be more violent than hindushad been taking the dead up on the bridge to shoot them even from far away i could see spraypatterns of red on the drab girders alternately they set the dead alight with gasoline and threw them over the railing into the river at night it was not uncommon to see several writhing shapes caught in the downstream current the fiery symmetry of their heads and arms and legs making them into fivepointed human stars i stopped at a spice vendors stand to buy a bunch of red chrysanthemums and a handful of saffron the saffron i had him wrap in a twist of scarlet silk it is a beautiful day i said to him in bengali he stared at me half amused half appalled a beautiful day for what true hindu faith calls upon the believer to view all things as equally sacred there is nothing profaneno dirty dog picking through the ash bin at a cremation ground no stinking gangrenous stump thrust into your face by a beggar who seems to hold you personally responsible for all his woes these things are as sacred as feasting day at the holiest temple but even for the most devout hindus it has been difficult to see these walking dead as sacred they are empty humans that is the truly horrifying thing about them more than their vacuous hunger for living flesh more than the blood caked under their nails or the shreds of flesh caught between their teeth they are soulless there is nothing in their eyes the sounds they maketheir farts their grunts and mewls of hungerare purely reflexive the hindu who has been taught to believe in the soul of everything has a particular horror of these drained human vessels but in calcutta life goes on the shops are still open the confusion of traffic still inches its way up chowringhee no one sees any alternatives soon i arrived at what was almost invariably my days first stop i would often walk twenty or thirty miles in a dayi had strong shoes and nothing to occupy my time except walking and looking but i always began at the kalighat temple of the goddess there are a million names for her a million vivid descriptions kali the terrible kali the ferocious skullnecklace destroyer of men eater of souls but to me she was mother kali the only one of the vast and colorful pantheon of hindu gods that stirred my imagination and lifted my heart she was the destroyer but all final refuge was found in her she was the goddess of the age she could bleed and burn and still rise again very awake beautifully terrible i ducked under the garlands of marigolds and strands of temple bells strung across the door and i entered the temple of kali after the constant clamor of the street the silence inside the temple was deafening i fancied i could hear the small noises of my body echoing back to me from the ceiling far above the sweet opium glaze of incense curled around my head i approached the idol of kali the jagrata her gimlet eyes watched me as i came closer she was tall gaunter and more brazenly naked than my friend devi even at her best moments her breasts were tipped with bloodat least i always imagined them soand her two sharp fangs and the long streamer of a tongue that uncurled from her open mouth were the color of blood too her hair whipped about her head and her eyes were wild but the third crescent eye in the center of her forehead was merciful it saw and accepted all the necklace of skulls circled the graceful stem of her neck adorned the sculpted hollow of her throat her four arms were so sinuous that if you looked away even for an instant they seemed to sway in her four hands she held a noose of rope a skullstaff a shining sword and a gaping very deadlooking severed head a silver bowl sat at the foot of the statue just beneath the head where the blood from the neck would drip sometimes this was filled with goats or sheeps blood as an offering the bowl was full today in these times the blood might well be human though there was no putrid smell to indicate it had come from one of the dead i laid my chrysanthemums and saffron at kalis feet among the other offerings mostly sweets and bundles of spice i saw a few strange objects a fingerbone a shriveled mushroom of flesh that turned out upon closer inspection to be an ear these were offerings for special protection mostly wrested from the dead but who was to say that a few devotees had not lopped off their own ears or finger joints to coax a boon from kali sometimes when i had forgotten to bring an offering i cut my wrist with a razor blade and let a few drops of my blood fall at the idols feet i heard a shout from outside and turned my head for a moment when i looked back the four arms seemed to have woven themselves into a new pattern the long tongue seemed to loll farther from the scarlet mouth andthis was a frequent fantasy of minethe wide hips now seemed to tilt forward affording me a glimpse of the sweet and terrible petalled cleft between the thighs of the goddess i smiled up at the lovely sly face if only i had a tongue as long as yours mother i murmured i would kneel before you and lick the folds of your holy pussy until you screamed with joy the toothy grin seemed to grow wider more lascivious i imagined much in the presence of kali outside in the temple yard i saw the source of the shout i had heard there is a stone block upon which the animals brought to kali mostly baby goats are beheaded by the priests a gang of roughly dressed men had captured a dead girl and were bashing her head in on the sacrificial block their arms rose and fell ropy muscles flexing they clutched sharp stones and bits of brick in their scrawny hands the girls halfpulped head still lashed back and forth the lower jaw still snapped though the teeth and bone were splintered foul thin blood coursed down and mingled with the rich animal blood in the earth beneath the block the girl was nude filthy with her own gore and waste the flaccid breasts hung as if sucked dry of meat the belly was burst open with gases one of the men thrust a stick into the ruined gouge between the girls legs and leaned on it with all his weight only in extensive stages of decay can the dead be told from the lepers the dead are greater in number now and even the lepers look human when compared to the dead but that is only if you get close enough to look into the eyes the faces in various stages of wet and dry rot the raw ends of bones rubbing through skin like moldy cheesecloth the cancerous domes of the skulls are the same after a certain point lepers could no longer stay alive begging in the streets for most people would now flee in terror at the sight of a rotting face as a result the lepers were dying then coming back and the two races mingled like some obscene parody of incest perhaps they actually could breed the dead could obviously eat and digest and seemed to excrete at random like everyone else in calcutta but i supposed no one knew whether they could ejaculate or conceive a stupid idea really a dead womb would rot to pieces around a fetus before it could come halfway to term a dead scrotal sac would be far too cold a cradle for living seed but no one seemed to know anything about the biology of the dead the newspapers were hysterical printing picture upon picture of random slaughter by dead and living alike radio stations had either gone off the air or were broadcasting endless religious exhortations that ran together in one long keening whine the edges of muslim hindu christian doctrine beginning to fray and blur no one in india could say for sure what made the dead walk the latest theory i had heard was something about a genetically engineered microbe that had been designed to feed on plastic a microbe that would save the world from its own waste but the microbe had mutated and was now eating and replicating human cells causing basic bodily functions to reactivate it did not much matter whether this was true calcutta was a city relatively unsurprised to see its dead rise and walk and feed upon it it had seen them doing so for a hundred years all the rest of the lengthening day i walked through the city i saw no more dead except a cluster far away at the end of a blocked street in the last rags of bloody light fighting each other over the bloated carcass of a sacred cow my favorite place at sunset is by the river where i can see the howrah bridge the hooghly is painfully beautiful in the light of the setting sun the last rays melt onto the water like hot ghee turning the river from steel to khaki to nearly golden a blazing ribbon of light the bridge rises black and skeletal into the fading orange sky tonight an occasional skirl of bright flowers and stillglowing greasy embers floated by the last earthly traces of bodies cremated farther up the river above the bridge were the burning ghats where families lined up to incinerate their dead and cast the ashes into the holy river cremation is done more efficiently these days or at least more hurriedly people can reconcile in their hearts their fear of strangers dead but they do not want to see their own dead rise i walked along the river for a while the wind off the water carried the scent of burning meat when i was well away from the bridge i wandered back into the maze of narrow streets and alleyways that lead toward the docks in the far southern end of the city people were already beginning to settle in for the night though here a bedroom might mean your own packing crate or your own square of sidewalk fires glowed in nooks and corners a warm breeze still blew off the river and sighed its way through the winding streets it seemed very late now as i made my way from corner to corner through intermittent pools of light and much longer patches of darkness i heard small bells jingling to the rhythm of my footsteps the brass bells of rickshaw men ringing to tell me they were there in case i wished for a ride but i could see none of the men the effect was eerie as if i were walking alone down an empty nighttime street being serenaded by ghostly bells the feeling soon passed you are never truly alone in calcutta a thin hand slid out of the darkness as i passed looking into the doorway it came from i could barely make out five gaunt faces five forms huddled against the night i dropped several coins into the hand and it slid out of sight again i am seldom begged from i look neither rich nor poor but i have a talent for making myself all but invisible people look past me sometimes right through me i dont mind i see more things that way but when i am begged from i always give with my handful of coins all five of them might have a bowl of rice and lentils tomorrow a bowl of rice and lentils in the morning a drink of water from a broken standpipe at night it seemed to me that the dead were among the bestfed citizens of calcutta now i crossed a series of narrow streets and was surprised to find myself coming up behind the kalighat the side streets are so haphazardly arranged that you are constantly finding yourself in places you had no idea you were even near i had been to the kalighat hundreds of times but i had never approached it from this direction the temple was dark and still i had not been here at this hour before did not even know whether the priests were still here or if one could enter so late but as i walked closer i saw a little door standing open at the back the entrance used by the priests perhaps something flickered from within a candle a tiny mirror sewn on a robe the smoldering end of a stick of incense i slipped around the side of the temple and stood at the door for a moment a flight of stone steps led up into the darkness of the temple the kalighat at night deserted might have been an unpleasant prospect to some the thought of facing the fierce idol alone in the gloom might have made some turn away from those steps i began to climb them the smell reached me before i ascended halfway to spend a day walking through calcutta is to be assailed by thousands of odors both pleasant and foul the savor of spices frying in ghee the stink of shit and urine and garbage the sicksweet scent of the little white flowers called mogra that are sold in garlands and that make me think of the gardenia perfume american undertakers use to mask the smell of their corpses almost everyone in calcutta is scrupulously clean in person even the very poor they will leave their trash and their spit everywhere but many of them wash their bodies twice a day still everyone sweats under the sodden veil of heat and at midday any public place will be redolent with the smell of human perspiration a delicate tang like the mingled juices of lemons and onions but lingering in the stairwell was an odor stronger and more foul than any i had encountered today it was deep and brown and moist it curled at the edges like a mushroom beginning to dry it was the perfume of mortal corruption it was the smell of rotting flesh then i came up into the temple and i saw them the large central room was lit only with candles that flickered in a restless draft first this way then that in the dimness the worshippers looked no different from any other supplicants at the feet of kali but as my eyes grew accustomed to the candlelight details resolved themselves the withered hands the ruined faces the burst body cavities where ropy organs could be seen trailing down behind the cagework of ribs the offerings they had brought by day kali grinned down upon an array of blossoms and sweetmeats lovingly arranged at the foot of her pedestal the array spread there now seemed more suited to the goddess i saw human heads balanced on raw stumps of necks eyes turned up to crescents of silverwhite i saw gobbets of meat that might have been torn from a belly or a thigh i saw severed hands like pale lotus flowers the fingers like petals opening silently in the night most of all piled on every side of the altar i saw bones bones picked so clean that they gleamed in the candlelight bones with smears of meat and long snotty runners of fat still attached skinny armbones clubby legbones the pretzel of a pelvis the beadwork of a spine the delicate bones of children the crumbling ivory bones of the old the bones of those who could not run these things the dead brought to their goddess she had been their goddess all along and they her acolytes kalis smile was hungrier than ever the tongue lolled like a wet red streamer from the open mouth the eyes were blazing black holes in the gaunt and terrible face if she had stepped down from her pedestal and approached me now if she had reached for me with those sinuous arms i might not have been able to fall to my knees before her i might have run there are beauties too terrible to be borne slowly the dead began to turn toward me their faces lifted and the rotting cavities of their nostrils caught my scent their eyes shone iridescent faint starry light shimmered in the empty spaces of their bodies they were like cutouts in the fabric of reality like conduits to a blank universe the void where kali ruled and the only comfort was in death they did not approach me they stood holding their precious offerings and they looked at methose of them that still had eyesor they looked through me at that moment i felt more than invisible i felt empty enough to belong among these human shells a ripple seemed to pass through them thenin the uncertain candlelight in the light that shimmered from the bodies of the deadkali did move the twitch of a finger the deft turn of a wristat first it was so slight as to be nearly imperceptible but then her lips split into an impossibly wide toothy grin and the tip of her long tongue curled she rotated her hips and swung her left leg high into the air the foot that had trod on millions of corpses made a pointe as delicate as a prima ballerinas the movement spread her sex wide open but it was not the petalled mandalalike cleft i had imagined kissing earlier the pussy of the goddess was an enormous deep red hole that seemed to lead down to the center of the world it was a gash in the universe it was rimmed in blood and ash two of her four hands beckoned toward it inviting me in i could have thrust my head into it then my shoulders i could have crawled all the way into that wet crimson eternity and kept crawling forever then i did run before i had even decided to flee i found myself falling down the stone staircase cracking my head and my knee on the risers at the bottom i was up and running before i could register the pain i told myself that i thought the dead would come after me i do not know what i truly feared was at my back at times i thought i was running not away from something but toward it i ran all night when my legs grew too tired to carry me i would board a bus once i crossed the bridge and found myself in howrah the even poorer suburb on the other side of the hooghly i stumbled through desolate streets for an hour or more before doubling back and crossing over into calcutta again once i stopped to ask for a drink of water from a man who carried two cans of it slung on a long stick across his shoulders he would not let me drink from his tin cup but poured a little water into my cupped hands in his face i saw the mingled pity and disgust with which one might look upon a drunk or a beggar i was a welldressed beggar to be sure but he saw the fear in my eyes in the last hour of the night i found myself wandering through a wasteland of factories and warehouses of smokestacks and rusty corrugated tin gates of broken windows there seemed to be thousands of broken windows after a while i realized i was on the upper chitpur road i walked for a while in the watery light that fills the sky before dawn eventually i left the road and staggered through the wasteland not until i saw its girders rising around me like the charred bones of a prehistoric animal did i realize i was in the ruins of the hospital where i had been born the hole of the basement had filled up with broken glass and crumbling metal twenty years worth of cinders and weeds all washed innocent in the light of the breaking dawn where the building had stood there was only a vast depression in the ground five or six feet deep i slid down the shallow embankment rolled and came to rest in the ashes they were infinitely soft they cradled me i felt as safe as an embryo i let the sunrise bathe me perhaps i had climbed into the gory chasm between kalis legs after all and found my way out again calcutta is cleansed each morning by the dawn if only the sun rose a thousand times a day the city would always be clean ashes drifted over me smudged my hands gray flecked my lips i lay safe in the womb of my city called by its poets lord of nerves city of joy the pussy of the world i felt as if i lay among the dead i was that safe from them i knew their goddess i shared their many homes as the sun came up over the mud and glory of calcutta the sky was so full of smoky clouds and pale pink light that it seemed to my eyes to burn followed by will mcintosh will mcintoshs fiction has been published in strange horizons asimovs science fiction postscripts interzone and futurismic his story perfect violet was selected to appear in science fiction best of the year edition mcintosh is currently working on his first novel soft apocalypse based on the story of the same name published in interzone mcintosh says that zombies are a way to face the existential terror we feel at the awareness of our own mortality i think people love zombie fiction because it explores that terror so directlythe dead are right there in your face and theyre not undead beings with supernatural powers and sexy lives theyre corpses he says corpses scare the shit out of us followed is the result of a discussion mcintosh initiated in a graduate social psychology class he was teaching in which he posed the question if you knew you could save lives for each how many would you save i pointed out that we probably can save lives for or less and we dont mcintosh says and each of us has to live with that knowledge or rationalize it away or sell our cars she came wandering down the sidewalk like any other corpse her herkyjerky walk unmistakable among the fluid strides of the living she was six or seven southeast asian maybe indian her ragged clothes caked in dried mud pedestrians cut a wide berth around her without noticing her at all i thought nothing of her figured the person she followed had ditched her in a car and she was catching up in that relentless way that corpses do i was downtown sitting outside jittery joes coffee shop on a summer afternoon there were still a few weeks before fall semester so i was relaxed in no hurry to get anywhere i returned to the manuscript i was reading and didnt think another thing of the corpse until i noticed her in my peripheral vision standing right in front of my table i glanced up at her turned looked over my shoulder then back at her then i realized she was looking at me with that unfocused stare with those big lifeless brown eyes as if she was claiming me but that couldnt be i waited for her to move on but she just stood i lifted my coffee halfway to my mouth set it back down shakily the woman at the next table dressed in a green hemp dress her foot propped on an empty chair looked at me over the top of her paperback with thinly veiled disdain when i caught her eye she looked back down at the paperback i lurched to my feet the metal chair screeching on the brick pavement my barely touched coffee sloshing onto the table and retreated down the sidewalk i ducked into the anonymity of my parked car and lingered there tracking the corpse in my rearview mirror as she lurched toward me maybe it was a mistake a misunderstandingmaybe shed walk right past me my volvo green was a fuelcell vehicle dammit the most efficient i could afford not an energy pig like most corpsemagnets drove how could i have hooked a corpse i cracked my window waited to see if she would pass i heard her little feet scuffing the pebbly pavement as she drew close she stopped three feet from my door turned and faced me her face was round and babyish her chin a tiny knot under her slack open mouth she was so tiny i started the car and pulled out almost hitting another car as i drove off i saw my corpse in the side mirror lurching down the sidewalk patiently following whatever homing device the dead used to track those they had claimed every few minutes i pulled back the curtain to see if she was coming and then there she was walking along the side of the road with her head down she turned up my driveway stubbed her toe on the thin lip of asphalt stumbled regained her tenuous balance she struggled stiffly up the three steps to my front door and stopped i dropped the curtain got up and locked the dead bolt i phoned jenna i have a corpse i said as soon as she answered oh my god peter jenna said there was a long pause are you sure well christ i wailed shes standing on my fucking doorstep im pretty sure shes mine i dont understand you dont deserve a corpse i know jesus i cant believe it i just cant believe it jenna consoled me by ticking off the evidence all the ways i was not like other corpseowners then she changed the subject i wasnt in the mood to talk about university politics or howwasyourday minutiae so i got off the phone after making plans to have dinner with her i tried to distract myself by turning on the tv i checked the stock market the dow was up almost three percent the nasdaq two i switched to the news the president was conducting a press conference in a field of newly constructed windmills on her decision to pull out of the kyoto iii accord were doing everything we can to curb global warming she said to the cameras but we will not bow to foreign pressure the american way of life is not negotiable blah blah blah even with the news cameras picking the best angles a few hundred of her corpses were visible cordoned from her by a phalanx of bluesuited secret service agents the corpse of an emaciated four or fiveyearold black boy his distended belly bulging as if a kickball was hidden under his skin wandered through a breach and headed toward the president he was swept up by an agent and returned to the crowd but gentlythe administration didnt want to give amnesty international any more ammunition i tried to take solace in the presidents corpses she had eighty or ninety thousand piled twenty deep around the white house gates more arriving daily i only had one i flipped through the channels strange how most tv shows depicted the world as corpseless nary a corpse to be seen on the sitcoms cop shows interactivesall those people walking the streets working cutting up with friends and not one of them followed by a corpse had there really been a time when there were no corpses i could hardly imagine it anymore i pulled back the curtain looked at her standing motionless in front of my door i couldnt help myself i wondered if there were clues on her to tell me who she was or how she died some sort of evidence that the cosmic actuarial table that sent her to me had made an error i went to the door and opened it she came in her bare feet tracking dirt onto the hardwood floor look around i said with a sweep of my hand i dont have that much stuff i gave her a tour solar power fluorescent bulbs i pointed out that all my furniture was used she didnt look only stared up at me i try to buy locally grown food i voted for the one world party nothing i scanned the room for more evidence what did i do i asked her empty face tell me what i did shed been a cute kid i pictured her laughing running playing hopscotch on the sidewalk like my sister used to i pictured her drinking brown water out of a dirty metal cup lying in bed dying of typhoid or dysentery maybe her family couldnt afford a bedmaybe shed died on a straw mat on the floor in the corner of a dirt hut i let a familiar indignant anger rise in me at the injustice of it she was so completely silent standing there unmoving not breathing shes going to be with me for the rest of my life i thought how could i possibly stand that i sat in my recliner in the living room she stood in front of me at arms length and stared i took a good look at her skinny legs with bony knees very brown feet long black hair littered with leaves and twigs her red mudcaked shorts had a single front pocket i reached over and flinching at the stiff cold feel of her flesh felt around in her pocket with two fingers there was something in iti fished it out it was a button a shiny new button gunmetal grey with veins of teal snaking through it i turned it over it was cool and smooth unmarkedthe kind of thing a little girl might carry around if she didnt have any barbies to play with i lifted her dirty hand by the wrist turned it palmup put the button in her hand closed her cold fingers over it and gently lowered her hand back to her side the button clattered to the hardwood floor is she there jenna asked i nodded my corpse stood outside the restaurant door staring in at me through the plate glass i should have picked a restaurant farther from my house so i could eat before she reached me just ignore her jenna whispered an elderly couple opened the door to leave and my corpse came in ignored as much unseen as ignorednot like a lost dog but like a block of wood or a wisp of autumn wind she came and stood in front of me staring a pretty button tucked in her pocket jenna kept eating as if nothing had changed though she examined my corpse out of the corner of her eye i forked a halfspear of asparagus in lemon butter into my mouth chewed and swallowed felt it lodge in my throat mine was not the only corpse in the establishment there were about ten actually two stood by the bar their eyes in shadow under the dim light of stainedglass lamps their filthy rags out of place among pressed pants white shirts polished wood and chrome an attractive welldressed thirtysomething couple had three of them hovering around their table like their own personal waitstaff one was an old stooped asian man another a twelveyearold black girl the third a fiveyearold who could have been my corpses longlost sister jesus they must be living like complete pigs to rack up so many corpses the door opened as another couple left an infant corpse crawled in her back foot just clearing the door as it closed she was nude her jerky crawl reminded me of a turtles she made a grunting sound as she labored across the floor stopped in front of the already wellattended couple plopped onto her butt stared up at the woman the woman kept eating her paella one of the restaurants specialties the man said something and she laughed covering her mouth out of the corner of my eye i thought i saw my corpse glance down at my plate i jerked my head around and looked at her intently her eyes were glazed and fixed on my face whats the matter jenna said dont stare at her she hissed as if i had picked my nose what what is it id swear she just looked down at my plate i said do you want to split a dessert she asked i wondered if i had imagined that quick furtive glance probably you go ahead and get one im pretty full i put my fork down my blackened salmon hardly touched when i got home i sat at the kitchen table and wrote a check to the world hunger fund i usually sent them or so three grand hurt but i could afford it looking up i was startled by a face staring in through the kitchen window her face until now shed stood facing the windowless front door evidently she could learn she stared unblinking she never blinkedi guess id noticed but it hadnt fully registered till now as i worked the check into an envelope i found myself holding it so my corpse could see it i wondered was the little girl still in there aware of where she was and what was happening or was she just an empty shell i tore up the check and wrote another for that much i could not easily afford i walked it to the mailbox it was a beautiful night the moon was full the crickets and cicadas deafening two houses down and across the street the corpse of a tall scrawny black man squatted peering with one eye through the lighted crack of a drawn shade my corpse came around the house pushing through the waisthigh grass and native weeds another testament to my green sensitivities another reason why this corpse was a mistake and met me on the way back she followed me to the front door i closed it in her face i got up early the next morning after a mostly sleepless night i pulled up the shade and there was her little round face she was just tall enough for her nose to be above the bottom of the window frame shit i thumped my forehead on the molding fought back a hitching sob i had really hoped i could buy her off get the hell away from me i shouted through the closed window before yanking the shade back down while i showered i pictured my corpse waiting patiently outside the window why couldnt it have been a manan old man with no teeth fall semester loomed my first class was in five days i couldnt imagine teaching with a corpse staring at me none of the students had corpses so mine was the only one in my am class the students politely avoided looking at her even though she stood barely three feet in front of me her head craned to stare up at my face as i went over the syllabus my hands shook from exhaustion and nerves as i held the syllabus id been a wreck the night before had four or five drinks to staunch my anxiety took forever to figure out what i would wear i debated whether to dress downa tshirt and jeansto demonstrate that i was just a regular guy that i lived simply and didnt really deserve a corpse but would the students see through me think i was being pretentious id finally pulled out a pair of black jeans and my white shirt the shirt id been wearing the day my corpse had shown up actually smart casual the sort of outfit i usually wore things got worse as i started to lecture i tend to pace back and forth as i talk and as i did she shadowed me taking two small lurching steps for every one of mine the scuff of her little feet on the linoleum floor set my teeth on edge bare feet scuffing on dirty floors made me nuts the way some people go nuts at the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard or the feel of cotton balls i stopped pacing i kept losing my train of thought stumbling over words i made eye contact with one of my new students she quickly looked down pretending to take notes though i hadnt said anything important i was barely saying anything coherent let alone important without realizing it i found myself looking right at my corpse as if i were lecturing to her she stared back i forced myself to look away at the blank white wall in the back of the room realized i was pacing again and she was pacing with mescuffscuff scuffscuff jerking along like like what like a dead child i let the class out early and headed to my office in a fogexhausted hung over wondering how i could possibly make it through my one oclock class she did her best to keep upi could hear the scuffing behind me a surge of anger tore through me and i wheeled pointed at her opened my mouth to speak her gaze flickered to my chest for a split second then back up this time id seen it there was no doubt her eyes had dropped and almostnot quite but almostfocused i saw that i said stabbing my finger at her i was in the hall outside my office confronting a corpse jack popped his bald head out of his office took in the scene pulled his head back inside embarrassed i wheeled and headed into my office leaving the door ajar allowing her to follow i stared down at her tell me what i did i shouted leaning down and pushing my face close to hers im a good person i dont deserve this i wanted her to focus to look at me to listen to what i was saying i saw the little pinkishgrey dollop dangling from the back of her throat below that darkness i yanked the onyx buddha statue off my desk and hurled it over her head it crashed into a bookshelf shattering a framed picture of yankee stadium scattering a halfdozen textbooks jesus syou okay jack called i hefted my computer monitor over my head and slammed it to the floor at her feet it split partway popping and sparking then jack was on me i hadnt seen him come in but he was behind me and had his arms wrapped around my chest calm down calm down he shouted i struggled tried to yank free im not sure what i would have done if id gotten free i truly hope i wouldnt have brought the computer console down on her head i gave a final violent tug my shirt ripped loudly shhhh shhhh jack said into my ear youre okay its okay shhhh i started to cry jack held on until he felt me relax then loosened his grip kept his arms around me for a moment longer let me go jack and i didnt know each other very well it added to the surreal feel as i stood in my demolished office crying through a blur of tears i saw a button lying on the floor by my corpses foot in a daze i knelt and picked it up it was her buttongrey with veins of teal unmistakable how had it gotten out of her pocket i think the shirts a total loss jack said behind me a little sheepishly i looked down at my shirt there was a long tear along the seam under the arm and the front was flapped openthree or four buttons had popped off i guess you never look at the buttons on a shirt even if you button them a thousand times the buttons on my white shirt were gunmetal grey with veins of teal quite unique they werent as bright and new as my corpses button because theyd taken a few turns in the dryer gently i lifted her hand and turned it over ran my finger over her tiny palm over the pads of her baby fingers rough not the fingers of a child who spent much time playing hopscotch is everyone all right maggie from down at the end of the hall stood in my doorway behind her two more of my colleagues craned their necks trying to see what was happening there was rarely excitement in our department maybe an irate student once in a while but never shattered glass or exploding computer monitors everythings fine jack said he was a good guy i realized i was still down on my knees staring at the button my eyes red and tearstained the crowd dispersed trailed by two corpses jack squatted put his arm around my shoulder you okay now i nodded im not gonna say i understand how you feel but it must be awful i nodded if you ever want to talk just knock i nodded a third time he patted my back and left it was nearly time for my one oclock class i kept a sweater in the bottom drawer of my desk for days when the ac was cranked too high i pulled the sweater over the ruined shirt and as my head popped through i thought i caught my corpse glancing down at the button lying at her feet i stooped and retrieved the button slipped it into her pocket next to the other shinier one i went around the corner to the bathroom held the door open for my corpse when it started to swing shut on her i washed my face and combed my hair her watchful eyes reflected in the mirror i yanked a couple of paper towels from the dispenser wet them under the faucet knelt and wiped the worst of the dirt from my corpses chubby cheeks and forehead i tried to comb some of the debris out of her hair but it was hopelessly tangled i shoved the comb into my back pocket and plucked the biggest chips out by hand i glanced at my watch time for class after retrieving a stack of syllabi and the class roll from my office i headed into the airy central lobby up the double flight of stairs steadying myself with the silver metal handrail halfway up i turned and looked back my corpse was struggling up the second step her legs too small and too stiff to make the climb easily i went back down wrapped my arms around my corpse and carried her up the stairs the song the zombie sang by harlan ellisonand robert silverberg between them harlan ellison and robert silverberg have won pretty much every award the science fiction and fantasy field has to offer heck individually theyve each won pretty much every award the field has to offer both have been named grand masters by the science fiction and fantasy writers of america the organizations lifetime achievement award and between them they have hugos nebulas and locus awards among a slew of other awards they are quite simply living legends to include a story by either would be an honor to have one written by both of them is transcendent in his collaborative collection partners in wonder ellison said that this story was inspired by a writer he encountered while teaching at a college writing workshop the man was smashed drunk from morning to night but still managed to put himself in front of the typewriter every morning to bang out a few words it was as though he was a zombie ellison said that he continued writing only as a reflex the way a frogs leg jumps when it receives a galvanic shock that he might as well be dead and stored in a vault except when he had to write from the fourth balcony of the los angeles music center the stage was little more than a brilliant blur of constantly changing chromaticsstabs of bright green looping whorls of crimson but rhoda preferred to sit up there she had no use for the golden horseshoe seats buoyed on their grabgrav plates bobbling loosely just beyond the fluted lip of the stage down there the sound flew off flew up and away carried by the remarkable acoustics of the centers takamuri dome the colors were important but it was the sound that really mattered the patterns of resonance bursting from the hundred quivering outputs of the ultracembalo and if you sat below you had the vibrations of the people down there she was hardly naive enough to think that the poverty that sent students up to the top was more ennobling than the wealth that permitted access to a horseshoe yet even though she had never actually sat through an entire concert down there she could not deny that music heard from the fourth balcony was purer more affecting lasted longer in the memory perhaps it was the vibrations of the rich arms folded on the railing of the balcony she stared down at the rippling play of colors that washed the sprawling proscenium dimly she was aware that the man at her side was saying something somehow responding didnt seem important finally he nudged her and she turned to him a faint mechanical smile crossed her face what is it laddy ladislas jirasek mournfully extended a chocolate bar its end was ragged from having been nibbled man cannot live by bekh alone he said no thanks laddy she touched his hand lightly what do you see down there colors thats all no music of the spheres no insight into the truths of your art you promised not to make fun of me he slumped back in his seat im sorry i forget sometimes please laddy if its the liaison thing thats bothering you i i didnt say a word about liaison did i it was in your tone you were starting to feel sorry for yourself please dont you know i hate it when you start dumping guilt on me he had sought an official liaison with her for months almost since the day they had met in contrapuntal he had been fascinated by her amused by her and finally had fallen quite hopelessly in love with her still she kept just beyond his reach he had had her but had never possessed her because he did feel sorry for himself and she knew it and the knowledge put him for her forever in the category of men who were simply not for longterm liaison she stared down past the railing waiting taut a slim girl honeycolored hair eyes the lightest gray almost the shade of aluminum her fingers lightly curved as if about to pounce on a keyboard music uncoiling eternally in her head they say bekh was brilliant in stuttgart last week jirasek said hopefully he did the kreutzer and timijians sixth and the knife and some scarlatti which i dont know i dont remember what they said but he got a tenminute standing ovation and der musikant said they hadnt heard such precise ornamentation since the houselights dimmed hes coming rhoda said leaning forward jirasek slumped back and gnawed the chocolate bar down to its wrapper coming out of it was always gray the color of aluminum he knew the charging was over knew hed been unpacked knew when he opened his eyes that he would be at stage right and there would be a grip ready to roll the ultracembalos input console onstage and the filament gloves would be in his righthand jacket pocket and the taste of sand on his tongue and the gray fog of resurrection in his mind nils bekh put off opening his eyes stuttgart had been a disaster only he knew how much of a disaster timi would have known he thought he would have come up out of the audience during the scherzo and he would have ripped the gloves off my hands and he would have cursed me for killing his vision and later they would have gone to drink the dark nutty beer together but timijian was dead died in bekh told himself five years before me ill keep my eyes closed ill dampen the breathing will the lungs to suck more shallowly the bellows to vibrate rather than howl with winds and theyll think im malfunctioning that the zombianic response wasnt triggered this time that im still dead really dead not mr bekh he opened his eyes the stage manager was a thug he recognized the type stippling of unshaved beard crumpled cuffs latent homosexuality tyrant to everyone backstage except perhaps the chorus boys in the revivals of romberg and friml confections ive known men to develop diabetes just catching a matinee bekh said whats that i dont understand bekh waved it away nothing forget it hows the house very nice mr bekh the houselights are down were ready bekh reached into his righthand jacket pocket and removed the thin electronic gloves sparkling with their rows of minisensors and pressors he pulled the right glove tight smoothing all wrinkles the material clung like a second skin if you please he said the grip rolled the console onstage positioned it locked it down with the dogging pedals and hurried offstage left through the curtains now bekh strolled out slowly moving with great care tubes of glittering fluids ran through his calves and thighs and if he walked too fast the hydrostatic balance was disturbed and the nutrients didnt get to his brain the fragility of the perambulating dead was a nuisance one among many when he reached the grabgrav plate he signalled the stage manager the thug gave the sign to the panelman who passed his fingers over the colorcoded keys and the grabgrav plate rose slowly majestically up through the floor of the stage went nils bekh as he emerged the chromatics keyed sympathetic vibrations in the audience and they began to applaud he stood silently head slightly bowed accepting their greeting a bubble of gas ran painfully through his back and burst near his spine his lower lip twitched slightly he suppressed the movement then he stepped off the plate walked to the console and began pulling on the other glove he was a tall elegant man very pale with harsh brooding cheekbones and a craggy massive nose that dominated the flowergentle eyes the thin mouth he looked properly romantic an important artistic asset they told him when he was starting out a million years ago as he pulled and smoothed the other glove he heard the whispering when one has died ones hearing becomes terribly acute it made listening to ones own performances that much more painful but he knew what the whispers were all about out there someone was saying to his wife of course he doesnt look like a zombie they kept him in cold till they had the techniques then they wired him and juiced him and brought him back and the wife would say how does it work how does he keep coming back to life what is it and the husband would lean far over on the arm of his chair resting his elbow placing the palm of his hand in front of his mouth and looking warily around to be certain that no one would overhear the blurred inaccuracies he was about to utter and he would try to tell his wife about the residual electric charge of the brain cells the persistence of the motor responses after death the lingering mechanical vitality on which they had seized in vague and rambling terms he would speak of the builtin lifesupport system that keeps the brain flushed with necessary fluids the surrogate hormones the chemicals that take the place of blood you know how they stick an electric wire up a frogs leg when they cut it off okay well when the leg jerks they call that a galvanic response now if you can get a whole man to jerk when you put a current through himnot really jerking i mean that he walks around he can play his instrument can he think too i suppose i dont know the brains intact they dont let it decay what they do they use every part of the body for its mechanical functionthe hearts a pump the lungs are bellowsand they wire in a bunch of contacts and leads and then theres a kind of twitch an artificial burst of lifeof course they can keep it going only five six hours then the fatiguepoisons start to pile up and clog the linesbut thats long enough for a concert anyway so what theyre really doing is they take a mans brain and they keep it alive by using his own body as the lifesupport machine the wife says brightly is that it instead of putting him into some kind of box they keep him in his own skull and do all the machinery inside his body thats it thats it exactly more or less more or less bekh ignored the whispers he had heard them all hundreds of times before in new york and beirut in hanoi and knossos in kenyatta and paris how fascinated they were did they come for the music or to see the dead man walk around he sat down on the players ledge in front of the console and laid his hands along the metal fibers a deep breath old habit superfluous inescapable the fingers already twitching the pressors seeking the keys under the closecropped gray hair the synapses clicking like relays here now timijians ninth sonata let it soar bekh closed his eyes and put his shoulders into his work and from the ring of outputs overhead came the proper roaring tones there it has begun easily lightly bekh rang in the harmonics got the sympathetic pipes vibrating built up the texture of sound he had not played the ninth for two years vienna how long is two years it seemed hours ago he still heard the reverberations and duplicated them exactly this performance differed from the last one no more than one playing of a recording differs from another an image sprang into his mind a glistening sonic cube sitting at the console in place of a man why do they need me when they could put a cube in the slot and have the same thing at less expense and i could rest and i could rest there keying in the subsonics this wonderful instrument what if bach had known it beethoven to hold a whole world in your fingertips the entire spectrum of sound and the colors too and more hitting the audience in a dozen senses at once of course the music is what matters the frozen unchanging music the pattern of sounds emerging now as always now as he had played it at the premiere in timijians last work decibel by decibel a reconstruction of my own performance and look at them out there awed loving bekh felt tremors in his elbows too tense the nerves betraying him he made the necessary compensations hearing the thunder reverberating from the fourth balcony what is this music all about do i in fact understand any of it does the sonic cube comprehend the b minor mass that is recorded within itself does the amplifier understand the symphony it amplifies bekh smiled closed his eyes the shoulders surging the wrists supple two hours to go then they let me sleep again is it fifteen years now awaken perform sleep and the adoring public cooing at me the women who would love to give themselves to me necrophiliacs how could they even want to touch me the dryness of the tomb on my skin once there were women yes lord yes once once there was life too bekh leaned back and swept forward the old virtuoso swoop brings down the house the chill in their spines now the sound builds toward the end of the first movement yes yes so bekh opened the topmost bank of outputs and heard the audience respond everyone sitting up suddenly as the new smash of sound cracked across the air good old timi a wonderful sense of the theatrical up up knock them back in their seats he smiled with satisfaction at his own effects and then the sense of emptiness sound for its own sake is this what music means is this a masterpiece i know nothing any more how tired i am of playing for them will they applaud yes and stamp their feet and congratulate one another on having been lucky enough to hear me tonight and what do they know what do i know i am dead i am nothing i am nothing with a demonic twohanded plunge he hammered out the final fugal screams of the first movement weatherex had programmed mist and somehow it fit rhodas mood they stood on the glass landscape that swept down from the music center and jirasek offered her the pipe she shook her head absently thinking of other things i have a pastille she said what do you say we look up inez and treat see if they want to get something to eat she didnt answer rhoda will you excuse me laddy i think i want to be all by myself for a while he slipped the pipe into his pocket and turned to her she was looking through him as if he were no less glass than the scene surrounding them taking her hands in his own he said rhoda i just dont understand you wont even give me time to find the words laddy no this time ill have my say dont pull away dont retreat into that little world of yours with your halfsmiles and your faraway looks i want to think about the music theres more to life than music rhoda there has to be ive spent as many years as you working inside my head working to create something youre better than i am youre maybe better than anyone ive ever heard maybe even better than bekh someday fine youre a great artist but is that all theres something more its idiocy to make your art your religion your whole existence why are you doing this to me because i love you thats an explanation not an excuse let me go laddy please rhoda art doesnt mean a damn thing if its just craft if its just rote and technique and formulas it doesnt mean anything if there isnt love behind it and caring and commitment to life you deny all that you split yourself and smother the part that fires the art he stopped abruptly it was not the sort of speech a man could deliver without realizing quickly crushingly how sententious and treacly it sounded he dropped her hands ill be at treats if you want to see me later he turned and walked away into the shivering reflective night rhoda watched him go she suspected there were things she should have said but she hadnt said them he disappeared turning she stared up at the overwhelming bulk of the music center and began slowly to walk toward it maestro you were exquisite tonight the pekinese woman said in the green room golden added the bullfrog sycophant a joy i cried really cried trilled the birds nutrients bubbled in his chest he could feel valves flapping he dipped his head moved his hands whispered thankyous staleness settled grittily behind his forehead superb unforgettable incredible then they went away and he was left as always with the keepers the man from the corporation that owned him the stage manager the packers the electrician perhaps its time said the corporation man smoothing his mustache lightly he had learned to be delicate with the zombie bekh sighed and nodded they turned him off want to get something to eat first the electrician said he yawned it had been a long tour late nights meals in jetports steep angles of ascent and rapid reentries the corporation man nodded all right we can leave him here for a while ill put him on standby he touched a switch the lights went off in banks one by one only the nightlights remained for the corporation man and the electrician for their return for their final packing the music center shut down in the bowels of the selfcontained system the dusteaters and a dozen other species of cleanup machines began stirring humming softly in the fourth balcony a shadow moved rhoda worked her way toward the downslide emerging in the center aisle of the orchestra into the horseshoe around the pit and onto the stage she went to the console and let her hands rest an inch above the keys closing her eyes catching her breath i will begin my concert with the timijian ninth sonata for unaccompanied ultracembalo a light patter of applause gathering force now tempestuous waiting the fingers descending the world alive with her music fire and tears joy radiance all of them caught in the spell how miraculous how wonderfully she plays looking out into the darkness hearing in her tingling mind the terrible echoes of the silence thank you thank you all so much her eyes moist moving away from the console the flow of fantasy ebbing she went on into the dressing room and stood just within the doorway staring across the room at the corpse of nils bekh in the sustaining chamber his eyes closed his chest still his hands relaxed at his sides she could see the faintest bulge in his right jacket pocket where the thin gloves lay fingers folded together then she moved close to him looked down into his face and touched his cheek his beard never grew his skin was cool and satiny a peculiarly feminine texture strangely through the silence she remembered the sinuous melody of the liebestod that greatest of all laments and rather than the great sadness the passage always brought to her she felt herself taken by anger gripped by frustration and disappointment choked by betrayal caught in a seizure of violence she wanted to rake the puddingsmooth skin of his face with her nails she wanted to pummel him deafen him with screams destroy him for the lie for the lies the many lies the unending flow of lying notes the lies of his life after death her trembling hand hovered by the side of the chamber is this the switch she turned him on he came out of it eyes closed rising through a universe the color of aluminum again then again he thought he would stand there a moment with eyes closed collecting himself before going onstage it got harder and harder the last time had been so bad in los angeles in that vast building balcony upon balcony thousands of blank faces the ultracembalo such a masterpiece of construction he had opened the concert with timis ninth so dreadful a sluggish performance noteperfect the tempi flawless and yet sluggish empty shallow and tonight it would happen again shamble out on stage don the gloves go through the dreary routine of recreating the greatness of nils bekh his audience his adoring followers how he hated them how he longed to turn on them and denounce them for what they had done to him schnabel rested horowitz rested joachim rested but for bekh there was no rest they had not allowed him to go oh he could have refused to let them sustain him but he had never been that strong he had had strength for the loveless lightless years of living with his music yes for that there had never been enough time strong was what he had had to be to come from where he had been to learn what had to be learned to keep his skills once they were his yes but in dealing with people in speaking out in asserting himself in short having courage no there had been very little of that he had lost dorothea he had acceded to wizmers plans he had borne the insults lisbeth and neil and coshah gee cosh was he still alivethe insults they had used to keep him tied to them for better or worse always worse so he had gone with them done their bidding never availed himself of his strengthif in fact there was strength of that sort buried somewhere in himand in the end even sharon had despised him so how could he go to the edge of the stage stand there in the full glare of the lights and tell them what they were ghouls selfish ghouls as dead as he was but in a different way unfeeling hollow but if he could if he could just once outwit the corporation man he would throw himself forward and he would shout pain a stinging pain in his cheek his head jolted back the tiny pipes in his neck protested the sound of flesh on flesh echoed in his mind startled he opened his eyes a girl before him the color of aluminum her eyes a young face fierce thin lips tightly clamped nostrils flaring why is she so angry she was raising her hand to slap him again he threw his hands up wrists crossed palms forward to protect his eyes the second blow landed more heavily than the first were delicate things shattering within his reconstructed body the look on her face she hated him she slapped him a third time he peered out between his fingers astonished by the vehemence of her eyes and felt the flooding pain and felt the hate and felt a terribly wonderful sense of life for just that one moment then he remembered too much and he stopped her he could see as he grabbed her swinging hand that she found his strength improbable fifteen years a zombie moving and living for only seven hundred four days of that time still he was fully operable fully conditioned fully muscled the girl winced he released her and shoved her away she was rubbing her wrist and staring at him silently sullenly if you dont like me he asked why did you turn me on so i could tell you i know what a fraud you are these others the ones who applaud and grovel and suck up to you they dont know they have no idea but i know how can you do it how can you have made such a disgusting spectacle of yourself she was shaking i heard you when i was a child she said you changed my whole life ill never forget it but ive heard you lately slick formulas no real insight like a machine sitting at the console a player piano you know what player pianos were bekh thats what you are he shrugged walking past her he sat down and glanced in the dressingroom mirror he looked old and weary the changeless face changing now there was a flatness to his eyes they were without sheen without depths an empty sky who are you he asked quietly how did you get in here report me go ahead i dont care if im arrested someone had to say it youre shameful walking around pretending to make musicdont you see how awful it is a performer is an interpretative artist not just a machine for playing the notes i shouldnt have to tell you that an interpretative artist artist wheres your art now do you see beyond the score do you grow from performance to performance suddenly he liked her very much despite her plainness despite her hatred despite himself youre a musician she let that pass what do you play then he smiled the ultracembalo of course and you must be very good better than you clearer cleaner deeper oh god what am i doing here you disgust me how can i keep on growing bekh asked gently the dead dont grow her tirade swept on as if she hadnt heard telling him over and over how despicable he was what a counterfeit of greatness and then she halted in midsentence blinking reddening putting hands to lips oh she murmured abashed starting to weep oh oh she went silent it lasted a long time she looked away studied the walls the mirror her hands her shoes he watched her then finally she said what an arrogant little snot i am what a cruel foolish bitch i never stopped to think that youthat maybei just didnt think he thought she would run from him and you wont forgive me will you why should you i break in i turn you on i scream a lot of cruel nonsense at you it wasnt nonsense it was all quite true you know absolutely true then softly he said break the machinery dont worry i wont cause any more trouble for you ill go now i cant tell you how foolish i feel haranguing you like that a dumb little puritan puffed up with pride in her own art telling you that you dont measure up to my ideals when i you didnt hear me i asked you to break the machinery she looked at him in a new way slightly out of focus what are you talking about to stop me i want to be gone is that so hard to understand you of all people should understand that what you say is true very very true can you put yourself where i am a thing not alive not dead just a thing a tool an implement that unfortunately thinks and remembers and wishes for release yes a player piano my life stopped and my art stopped and i have nothing to belong to now not even the art for its always the same always the same tones the same reaches the same heights pretending to make music as you say pretending but i cant of course you can come sit down well discuss it and youll play for me play for you he reached out his hand and she started to take it then drew her hand back youll have to play for me he said quietly i cant let just anyone end me thats a big important thing you see not just anyone so youll play for me he got heavily to his feet thinking of lisbeth sharon dorothea gone all gone now only he bekh left behind some of him left behind old bones dried meat breath as stale as egypt blood the color of pumice sounds devoid of tears and laughter just sounds he led the way and she followed him out onto the stage where the console still stood uncrated he gave her his gloves saying i know they arent yours ill take that into account do the best you can she drew them on slowly smoothing them she sat down at the console he saw the fear in her face and the ecstasy also her fingers hovering over the keys pouncing god timis ninth the tones swelling and rising and the fear going from her face yes yes he would not have played it that way but yes just so timis notes filtered through her soul a striking interpretation perhaps she falters a little but why not the wrong gloves no preparation strange circumstances and how beautifully she plays the hall fills with sound he ceases to listen as a critic might he becomes part of the music his own fingers moving his muscles quivering reaching for pedals and stops activating the pressors as if he plays through her she goes on soaring higher losing the last of her nervousness in full command not yet a finished artist but so good so wonderfully good making the mighty instrument sing draining its full resources underscoring this making that more lean oh yes he is in the music it engulfs him can he cry do the tearducts still function he can hardly bear it it is so beautiful he has forgotten in all these years he has not heard anyone else play for so long seven hundred four days out of the tomb bound up in his own meaningless performances and now this the rebirth of music it was once like this all the time the union of composer and instrument and performer soulwrenching allencompassing for him no longer eyes closed he plays the movement through to its close by way of her body her hands her soul when the sound dies away he feels the good exhaustion that comes from total submission to the art thats fine he said when the last silence was gone that was very lovely a catch in his voice his hands were still trembling he was afraid to applaud he reached for her and this time she took his hand for a moment he held her cool fingers then he tugged gently and she followed him back into the dressing room and he laid down on the sofa and he told her which mechanisms to break after she turned him off so he would feel no pain then he closed his eyes and waited youll justgo she asked quickly peacefully im afraid its like murder im dead he said but not dead enough you wont be killing anything do you remember how my playing sounded to you do you remember why i came here is there life in me im still afraid ive earned my rest he said he opened his eyes and smiled its all right i like you and as she moved toward him he said thank you then he closed his eyes again she turned him off then she did as he had instructed her picking her way past the wreckage of the sustaining chamber she left the dressing room she found her way out of the music centerout onto the glass landscape under the singing stars and she was crying for him laddy she wanted very much to find laddy now to talk to him to tell him he was almost right about what hed told her not entirely but more than she had believed before she went away from there smoothly with songs yet to be sung and behind her a great peace had settled unfinished at last the symphony had wrung its last measure of strength and sorrow it did not matter what weatherex said was the proper time for mist or rain or fog

passion play which originated in during the thirty years war bubonic plague had spread all over bavaria the citizens of oberammergau begged god to spare them she says in return they would put on a play about the crucifixion and resurrection of jesus every ten years the ravages of the plague ceased and the oberammergauers kept their vow they still perform the play most recently in it was a chilly may morning and cardinal schonbruns knees cracked as he took his seat beside father meyer in the passionspielhaus father meyer heard the noise very clearly he was acutely aware of every sound smell and sight around him of the splinters in the planks of the large openair stage before them the smell of dew the dampness of his palms the murmurs of anticipation of the assembling crowd and those of speculationand derisionwhen his own people scattered among the thousands caught sight of him he was aware that he looked like a prisoner wedged between his friend hans ahrenkiel the bishop of munich and his nemesis the cardinal he was aware that his life as a priest would be over that day the cardinal scowled at father meyer and said is it true what ive just heard father meyer licked his lips how had he hoped to keep it a secret that depends on what it is eminence did you give absolution to the wandelnder leichnam this morning though his heart sanksomeone had betrayed himfather meyer regarded the cardinal steadily ja does that surprise you cardinal schonbrun made a shocked noise on father meyers left the bishop shook his head mournfully did it partake of the holy eucharist the cardinal was a much younger man than father meyer could ever remember being blond and blueeyed vigorous and vital filled with new ideas for the new church the kind of man rome wanted to lead her flocks into the twentyfirst century the kind of man father meyer gray and aged was not father meyer raised his chin the church has always offered her mercy to the condemned ja i did it the cardinals face mottled with anger he opened his mouth glanced at the swelling audience and spoke in a harsh tense whisper think what youve done man polluted the body of christ youve made a mockery of the sacraments of your own vows father meyer spread open his hands all i know your eminence is that oberammergau my village and that of my ancestors that this village made a vow to god and that now four hundred years later were shaming that vow with what we are doing today bishop ahrenkiel touched father meyers arm they had sat in the rectory together drinking ancient benedictine brandy and discussing the new ideas in companionable silence theyd listened to father meyers collections of gregorian chants gone through scrapbooks of passion plays through the centuries father meyer had hoped that bishop ahrenkiel at least would understand but he alas was a new bishop i thought we had gone through all that johannes he said now for the obvious benefit of the cardinal these are not living creatures they have no souls the vatican has spoken on the matter and the vatican is wrong father meyer turned anguished eyes toward the young cardinal everyone is wrong your eminence ive spent time among these leichname ii feel they are my ministry they arent merely corpses as science would have us believe i hear their hearts though they cannot speak they seek the father as we all do they hope for love and mercy and justice father meyer the cardinal began but at that moment the single voice of the prologue a man dressed in a simple white robe with a band of gold around his forehead called them to order bend low bend low those same words had rung through the passion meadow for centuries as once again the bavarian village of oberammergau renewed its covenant with god the townspeople would perform a play glorifying the suffering and resurrection of christthe passionif the lord would spare them from the ravages of the plague in it had worked no more fevers that shook the body no more pustules that burst and ran no more deaths after the vow grace oberammergau was not unique in this bargaining in the s many villages towns and cities promised to put on passion plays in return for survival but in all the world oberammergau was the only village that still honored its pledge the villagers pointed to this fidelity as the reason the town had also been spared the horrors of the more recent plague the one that turned men and women even tiny babies into hellish monstersthe walking dead rotting slathering mindless what terror had run throughout the world now of course the zombies were contained and could even be controlledas they would be today on the passion stage such a gift from god such a miracle and as through the centuries people from all over the world came to see gods miracles nearly half a million souls flocked to oberammergau in the course of each decades one hundred summer performances but this year the numbers were doublingtriplingbecause of the introduction of the new elementa newer way to glorify the agony and suffering of our lord jesus christ death from the sinner i release sang the prologue figure and the crowd stirredin eagerness father meyer thought bitterly at what was to come but if his plan worked they would leave this place with their bloodlust unsated sir father meyer began but a stalwart hausfrau behind him tapped him on the shoulder and said hsst the prologue soloist sang on it was anton veck whom father meyer knew well anton had been an altar boy was still busy in the parish church of st peter and st paul in a thousand helpful little ways anton anton he thought was it you who told them anton had been there and he had not approved and most damning of all he was a cousin of kaspar mueller with a sigh father meyer bowed his head and pulled his rosary from his pocket he would not watch the play though he like every other oberammergauer counted his life not in years but in how many passion plays he had either performed in or seen at sixtyfive this was his sixth cycle and though until this year he had held the position of secondincommand on the council of six and twelve the committee that oversaw every aspect of the play including the most important one choosing the actors who were to play out the passion of christ hed known the rules they had to be oberammergauers or to have lived among the nativeborn for at least twenty years in the case of the women they had to be virgins and youngcastoff restrictions reimposed during the cycle of the zombie plague in the hope of pleasing god more fully hed known the rules the most prominent families must be represented and he hadnt disregarded the rules hed simply answered to a higher law and that was why after today he knew he would be defrocked no matter he would continue in the work without the blessing of his church without the blessing his throat tightened thumb and forefinger slipped over the worn wooden beads of the rosary his father had carved for him put that away the cardinal whispered angrily rosaries were not appreciated in the new church father meyer covered the rosary with both his hands his lips moved as he mentally counted the beads carved with love in rosette shapes to honor the virgin it was a beautiful thing and should be in a museum like the old church he thought with her compassion and her love his thoughts drifted back to the choosing of the roles it had been a foregone conclusion at least to the others that kaspar mueller would play christ he had done so for three cycles and no family in oberammergau was more prominent nor more powerful than his but to play christ for a fourth play thirty years older than when he began father meyer had pointed out correctly enough that women over the age of thirtyfive werent even allowed in the play should a sixtythreeyearold man portray a man almost half his age that doesnt matter its his spiritual qualities that matter most adolph mueller who was on the counciland another of kaspars cousinshad asserted but the fact of his health remained he was older frailer the part of christ was gruelingeach passion play lasted eight hours with only a break for lunch and then there was the matter of hanging on the cross and then there was the matter of kaspars falling from his front porch and breaking his ribs father meyer had assumed that would end the discussion they would have to choose another younger man but kaspar let it be known that he wouldnt hear of it wouldnt share the stage with anyone else nor would he allow his understudy to take over the role the priest was concerned and let that fact be known to the council and in deference to his office the discussion continued but father meyer should have realized the weakness of his position the muellers were one of the founding families of oberammergau and they owned the largest hotel two restaurants and four taverns they also donated generously each year to the villages state woodcarving school father meyers family hadnt arrived until near the end of the nineteenth century to most oberammergauers the meyers were little better than interlopers and of what benefit would it be to please the parish priest over the largest employer in town yet finally after much deliberation kaspar announced he would allow the placement of a double of himself upon the cross during the crucifixion scene one of the zombies the wandelndere leichnamechanging corpsesas they were called in german changed yet again to look like him think of it adolph mueller had exhorted the council at last we can depict the true passion of christ we can drive nails through its palms and pierce its father really you must watch or people will talk cardinal schonbrun said as he stood father meyer shook himself the sun was high in the sky the stage was empty the curtains closed it was the lunch interval four hours had passed it was time he called upon the virgin for courage people already talk eminence he said the talk hasnt stopped since i stepped down from the council which is why were here the cardinal cut in gesturing to the bishop and the many priests assembled around them to prove that the church approves of these proceedings even if you do not bishop ahrenkiel put his arm around father meyer come lets go have some sausage and a beer the cardinal would surely not object father meyers heart jumped in his chest now was the moment goodbye his soul whispered to holy mother church forgive me imim not hungry he stammered his fear showing if i may be excused to go to my house for the interval the cardinal regarded him i think not i think you should eat with us father he forced himself not to panic but im not feeling nein you must come with us father meyer father meyer sagged the cardinal must have guessed his plan to slip backstage and free the ten leichname the village had purchased why had he dreamed it would be possible he was a fool a cursed old fool father meyer cardinal schonbrun pressed gesturing for him to walk beside him father meyer forced back tears perhaps he could find another way he could not believe that in four hours they would actually crucify the pitiful thing its done in movies and things all the time bishop ahrenkiel murmured as father meyer plodded slightly behind the cardinal it has been approved by the various humane organizations the unions the dont speak to me father meyer turned his head away from his old friend but johannes dont they sat in the crowded rooms of the mueller hotel among the tourists who were titillated by the presence of live zombies in their midst though long ago the contagion had been stopped still people held the old fears maria mueller kaspars daughter brought the priests large mugs of beer and plates of pork ribs and sauerkraut though in her forties she curtsied daintily to the bishop and the cardinal but pointedly turned her back on father meyer no one in the village had spoken to him since hed resigned from the council it goes well does it not bishop ahrenkiel asked her everyone must be so proud she frowned this is our holy obligation your eminence we dont do it out of pride father meyer pursed his lips one of the lords own creatures would be made to suffer horribly this afternoon for anothers sin of pride they had told him the zombies had no nerve endings father meyer sat hunched in his seat with tears running down his cheeks he clutched his rosary while he watched the creature writhe in agony as they stretched open its palm and slammed the nail through the movements are being directed with a remote control device johannes the bishop reminded him with a hint of pride in his voice it really doesnt feel anything its only made to look that way the other palm the sound of the hammer on the nail echoed against the baffles on the walls blood spurted in the air and streamed over the end of the cross and onto the stage chang whang whang whang the creature struggled its mouth opened closed opened the hausfrau behind them moaned do you see cardinal schonbrun said to father meyer this reminds everyone of the suffering of our lord it brings them nearer to god ive never felt such emotion during a passion play the scourging that was excellent bishop ahrenkiel was it not the bishop grunted neither assent nor dissent father meyer brought his rosary to his heart as they hoisted the cross upward the zombie swayed then fell forward pinioned in place by the spikes in its hands and feet blood flowed in rivulets from the crown of thorns some into its mouth the blue contact lenses gleamed as itshiseyes gazed toward heaven such monumental pain father meyer doubled his fists feeling upon his own flesh the whip marks the holes in his hands the thorns digging into his scalp unable to suppress a sob he remembered what he had done that morning dawn had been hours away in the high alps in his beloved unheated church it was freezing he looked at the unmoving figure in the darkened confessional closed the curtain and rested his hand against the side of the booth the swell of an ancient chant rorate caeli masked the thundering of his heart he inhaled the bittersweet odor of incense and gazed at the crucifix above the altar at the gentle face carved five six hundred years before by one of the oberammergau faithful the wounds as fresh and red as at calvary the agony the love most wondrous savior father meyer whispered if im doing wrong forgive me please understand oh lord that i believe this to be a child of thine and if itif heis not and i do pollute thy body as the church charges if i offend thee i am heartily sorry he stepped into his side of the confessional and drew the curtain he sat took a deep breath and crossing himself began bless me father for i have sinned it has been he hesitated who could say how long it had been for the one who sat in silence on the other side of the screen it has been some time since my last confession these are my sins he swallowed hard and thought for a moment how to proceed it had been so clear last night when hed resolved to do this so obviously a divine inspiration but now now when he was doing it really risking it he felt alone untried but thus had our savior felt he thought and was comforted in his fear i have had thoughts father i have had thoughts that were other than those our lord would have us think i have wished for things he leaned his damp forehead against the screen such monumental pride to speak for another to dare to dream what was in anothers heart a heart that didnt even beat not really a mind that didnt think nein he didnt believe that listen he whispered to the silhouette he could see through the screen i absolve you and forgive you of any sinful thought or deed in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost amen he squinted through the crosshatches do you understand go in peace god has forgiven father came a voice and father meyer started violently it had spoken praise be to god he knew he had always believed he had prayed its anton the voice went on and he realized it was the veck boy standing just outside the curtain the cardinal and the bishop are at my cousins hotel theyre asking for you father meyer looked now at the figure on the cross the figure he had dared to forgive the stage was set for the climax of the play the passion and the suffering of the lord the three crosses had been raisedon the other two the actors playing the thieves hung supported by belts beneath their loincloths as kaspar mueller would have been the holy women in their veils and robes clasped their hands and wept the roman centurion stood to one side pondering the players gazed up at the wandelnder leichnam nailed to kaspar muellers cross while the old man hid behind a pile of rocks which would be used later in the resurrection scene they spoke to the zombie and it was kaspar who answered in his quavering old mans voice behind the cross kaspar cried out eli eli lama sabachthani and the pharisees reviled him for calling out to the prophet elias and the figure on the cross pale and slight panted and looked up then down reanimated corpse father meyers head insisted his heart replied an innocent man doomed to suffer like this ten times for each zombie was to be used for ten performances they had devised ways to fill the holes in itshishands with wax to stitch up and conceal the wound in his side ten times they would do this to it for the glory of god and the glory of oberammergau the soldier offered the sponge of vinegar to the creature when kaspar mueller cried out i thirst and it tasted the bile father meyer was certain of it mother behold thy son kaspar mueller gasped the zombie looked down at krista veck father meyer gripped his rosary he could not let this continue his holy office required he speak the truth of god as he knew it as long as he was a priest he was compelled to act on behalf of the shepherds lambs it is over said kaspar the ribcage of the zombie worked furiously into thy hands i commend my spirit its head drooped forward ah murmured the cardinal a low ominous rumbling filled the theater it was the time in the play for the earthquake and the rending of the temple the crosses jittered on the stage the zombies palms began to bleed again it is gods hand on us cried the actor who played enan blood streamed from its side and hands itshishead bobbed father meyer could abide no more he rose to his feet and cried ja it is father the cardinal said grabbing his hand father meyer shook him off and crawled over him he ran down the stairs to the front of the stage before anyone could stop him he leaped on it and grabbed the wrist of the startled centurion you cannot do this as a priest of god i order you to stop what what kaspar demanded appearing from behind the rocks he was dressed as the risen christ in pure white robes blasphemer father meyer shouted at him he thrust himself away from the centurion pushed krista veck and the other holy women out of his way and scrabbled onto the rocks help me get him down for the love of god help me get down from there the cardinals voice rang over the rising voices of the crowd and the actors get father meyer off the stage father please rudi mangasser the centurion grasped father meyers ankle the priest yanked his leg free for gods sake rudi i baptized you help me father meyer pulled at the spike in the middle of the leichnams palm it was hammered in all the way to the bone blood pooled around it smearing father meyers fingers help me help me he stared at the audience which had leapt to its feet angry faces looks of horror some were backing away others rushing forward others were crying he is a being we cannot do this he reached across the limp body and yanked off the crown of thorns bringing skin with it a sudden piercing chorus of screams erupted from the onlookers startled father meyer froze and looked at them fingers pointed toward the stageat him he supposed he dug his fingers into the zombies palm straining to pull out the nail the head slowly lifted who had the remote control device father meyer wondered vaguely but the screams grew louder people turned to run from the theater the cardinal and the bishop crossed themselves and sank to their knees the head wobbled father meyer took hold of it beneath the jaw to support it the flesh was hot hot the head turned it was covered with large red sores from which pus flowed like blood the pest someone shrieked it has the plague shaking father meyer stared into the sightless eyes new sores exploded over the zombies body even as father meyer watched they ruptured in a jagged line along the would in its side they traveled over its chest its stomach the heavens filled with a rumbling the earthnot just the stagebegan to shake its a trick someone shouted the priest has the control box there were cries of outrage now krista veck tore off her veil and shook her fist at father meyer while rudi mangasser scrambled onto the rocks and pulled him down idiot rudi shouted slapping father meyer across the face as they both fell to the stage floor what are you doing you crazy old man i i father meyer pushed rudi aside and knelt in front of the zombie he made the sign of the cross and folded his hands two red sores bubbled from his own palms stigmata but stigmata of a different sort of the new church and a new sickness he supposed which would cripple the world as the old sickness had four hundred years before he burst into tears and opened his arms the covenant is broken god has spoken through one of his children to tell us of his great displeasure his wounds dropped onto the boards a changing corpse my beloved my brethren we are all changing corpses all get him off the stage cardinal schonbrun shouted again no dont touch me i have it already father meyer warned but he knew it was too late then as one being the throng roared and flew at him a hundred hands grabbed him hitting punching crushing they kicked his shins and aching knees someone slammed a fist into his side a woman he had never seen before wrapped her fingers around his clerical collar and choked him choked hard until he couldnt breathe couldnt see then the face of the woman swelled with boils he watched horrified as they burst and a thick oozing pus ran down her face shes got it too shouted a man beside her she grabbed her face and wailed sores rose on the backs of her hands exploded splattering the mans face and everywhere the infection touched him pustules rose crusted split the man fell to his knees shrieking the contagion engulfed the crowd like a flood of forty days and forty nights cries of terror shattered father meyers ears the sky pounded with thunder the hoof beats of four horsemen timbers and scenery fractured and crashed the stage split open and the ground beneath it and people screamed and flailed wildly as they tumbled into the pit all all tore asunder a jag of lightning slammed into the cross on the stage igniting it at the base bonfirehot hellfirehot the zombie opened its mouth once twice its head lolled to the side and its sightless gaze moved moved it fixed on father meyer seemed to look at him yes froze there staring at the priest of the old church the old love behold thy son behold him father meyer raised his hand and blessed him the zombie bowed his head the flames engulfed him and he was gone he did this to us cardinal schonbrun cried and three men grabbed father meyer pulling at him beating him weeping with rage father meyer stared at the fire as his arms were wrenched from their sockets as blows and burning splinters rained down on his head new sores erupted burst ran over his other wounds no pain could be worse no agony no no pain could surpass that in his heart no fear could be greater than the fear in his soul he raised his gaze to heaven father forgive us he whispered with the last breath of his body we didnt know we really didnt almost the last story by almost the last man by scott edelman scott edelmans fiction has appeared in a variety of anthologies and magazines such as crossroads tales of the southern literary fantastic postscripts forbidden planets summer chills and the mammoth book of monsters when not writing edelman edits science fiction weekly and sci fi magazine and in the past edited the fiction magazine science fiction age edelman is something of a zombie genius hes had stories appear in each of james lowders eden studios zombie anthologies the book of all flesh the book of more flesh and the book of final flesh and hes been nominated for the bram stoker award three times for his zombie fiction as i read each of his zombie stories i thought for sure id found one to include in the bookthat thered be no way hed top himself after that story only to discover that each was better than the last and thats without even mentioning his brilliant a plague on both your houses a fiveact shakespearean play that he describes as a cross between romeo and juliet and night of the living dead this story which is one of his stoker award nominees is not in any way shakespearean but one reviewer compared it to the work of another literary legend w h auden maybe it would be best to begin this way lets start in fact on the day that it all started with laura already at work in the county library but heres the thingas the day goes by maybe she wont even come to realize yet that the dead are suddenly refusing to stay dead because life happens that way with momentous things occurring across town while we in our homes in our ignorance clip our fingernails or floss our teeth earthquakes roar floods rise towers fall and somewhere on the other side of the globe a man who may not hear of these things for many months if at all scrapes with his stick in a small patch of dusty earth and prays for rain if he ever grows perturbed on that day it will only be because the rain fails to come and not due to dark happenings on continents far away for our purposes let it begin that way for laura who did not notice her world tilting on its axis she noticed little that first day of the change because little affected her personally save that fewer patrons than normal wandered into her branch of the library the ripples had not yet reached her but still that small alteration to her routine puzzled her a bit as over the years she had grown accustomed to the predictable rhythms of her week but she let that feeling drop and on the whole it turned out to be an unusually good workday for her she was able to spend less of her time that shift reshelving books that had been left on tables and more of it catching up on paperwork so she ended the day pleased as she headed back to her apartment that night she treated herself to chinese takeout maybe when she unpacks her dinner special she should even find an extra fortune cookie at the bottom of the bag now that would cause her to smile because theres something else that you should know about laura shes been using the vocabulary words printed on the back of each fortune to teach herself chinese not the best method perhaps but still hers and the surprise cookie put her one word closer to her goal see she was planning to visit china someday adding that information just about now should help add poignancy to her tale considering what we already know is inevitably to come and what she does not and so later that night after the additional reward of a very special episode of one of her favorite television shows during which two estranged sisters are reunited plus the rush she got from the way shed been able to avoid a phone call from her mother thanks to caller id she would tuck into bed pleased with herself and with the world and ready to fall into a peaceful sleep knowing nothing of the chaos elsewhere and suspecting less much as our man working his field with a stick might finally set aside that stick and stretch out on his straw mat to drift away while looking up at the stars never knowing that he had just lived through a december or an august or a september it was only the next day when laura slid that mornings newspapers onto the rods that kept them from getting tattered as they were being read that she learned there had been anything special about the day before she wasnt sure that she believed it though the facts of the miraculous resurrection seemed to her as if they should instead be shelved under fiction she grew angry with herself and angry with her former ignorance as well believing that had such a grand difference been born in the universe she should have been able to feel it that the rules of life and death should change without her knowledge and permission didnt seem right she overheard much talk at her branch all in whispers of course as to what it meant and how one should proceed to walk through such an unexpected world but she knew of no other way to live and believed that one should accept the directions in which fate pushes us she had never been able to see a different way for herself before thanks in part or so she felt to the mother whose call she had avoided the night before and saw no reason that she should try to see a different way for herself now and so in the face of the death of death which would likely cause most people to abandon their routines she still returned each day to carry out her duties each successive day however will bring fewer of the living and more of the dead to browse in her department until her regular clientele is completely replaced at first perhaps shell hardly notice that the undead are undead for therell be no slavering over her flesh the way she would have assumed theyll just be shuffling slowly along extracting books from the shelves and sitting at the tables much the same way the regulars had they wont behave so differently from the living and so she wont notice that theyre not living but then something will happen that will finally cause her to see and believe the great change that has occurred perhaps shell notice that these new visitors are more intense at their tasks than those who had come before maybe it will be the fact that there is no whispering and no cause for her to shush or perhaps its that she finally notices that no one is taking any bathroom breaks whatever the catalyst she will eventually see theyll seem more serious than those she was used to and though more and more of them will drift in each day so that some will finally have to stand theyll be even better behaved than those who over her long years of service shed grown used to who by that time will have been entirely replaced so that she is the only living creature who shows up there each day but still even that even noting that only the dead surround her will not cause her to change her routine shell come to understand that the men women and children though they really have to be understood as former men women and children are actually looking for something in the pages of those books something that matters to them a great deal theyre not just going through the rote motions that had obsessed them in life but what exactly are they seeking she watches them eagerly intently knowing that if she could only figure out what they sought that she would find something meaningful there for herself as well something that had waited just one step ahead of her her entire life somehow it would all start to make sense all of it no forget that forget about laura and her mother and the stale taste of fortune cookies thats no way to begin this it doesnt seem right at all theres got to be a better way im going to start over which is something thats a lot easier to do here on this page than from where im standing how about this for an opening then the day the zombies came emily was dropping by the library yes theres that library again its important youll see to visit her friend rachel which also means that it was the day that rachel died but as emily arrived to take her friend to lunch she doesnt know that yet she knew that there was something odd about the day though in fact as she parked her car and fumbled for change for the meter she wondered what with the strange news reports that had been coming over her car radio during her drive whether the two old friends should postpone their outing for another day maybe ill even have her pause for a moment and think it a hoax shell wonder whether this was just like that oldtime martian invasion that drove everybody mad when it was first broadcast on the radio or mans supposed landing on the moon which will have you wondering for a moment which of us didnt believe man ever made it to the moon emily or me its emily at least most of the time its emily and then shell think whether the broadcasts were a ratings trick or not did it really matter regardless of the dangers of this world life had to go on she knew that life happened and you had to happen too there would always be disruptions worthy of locking the doors and pulling down the shades if you wanted to find them as you can tell emily is the sort of person who lives in two worlds both this one the one we all agree upon as reality and another one one slightly askew to keep that first one at arms length she always felt that though a person had to live in the world it did not mean she had to be of it one should be able to keep the world at a distance so that it did not disrupt ones plans and live as if all lifes problems were on the other side of the world as if she lived in a hut somewhere her husband out most of the day poking at yams in the soil together they would be happy less because of any affinity they had for each other than because of their separateness from society and its ills they would live in ignorance of headlines and be bound together by that simplicity the beating drums of the world would appear muffled and distant emily survived many tragedies that way compared to her divorce dealing with the resurrection of the dead would be a snap as she walked up the steps of the library approaching the intricate wroughtiron gates at the entrance wondering whether she and rachel should do chinese or italian a man ran toward her and then past her screaming as he headed for the street blood spurted from one shoulder in emilys shock it took her a moment to edit that initial thought to no not from his shoulder but from the place where his arm used to be she was ashamed to admit to herself that she felt relieved when he passed by her without spattering blood on her new blouse which she had bought just for this occasion as she stood frozen halfway between the street and the library entrance one of the undead stumbled out the gates above her after its escaping prey its skin was grey and its clothing still spilled clods of earth from its disinterment blood dripped from its mouth emily will do her best to force her legs to move before the dead thing shifts its focus to her but her internal struggle proves unnecessary as the shell of a man totters as it tries to move from one step to the next loses its balance and then rolls past her tumbling down the length of the stairs after it finally struck the pavement it lay motionless for a moment and emily thought it could be taken for a pile of cloth and bones but then as she watched it slowly rose to its feet and looked up at her really looked at her she thought shed heard the radio hosts surmise that these undead things were beyond thought but it certainly seemed to her to be thinking almost considering for a moment whether it could make its way back up those steps to her before it turned from her and shuffled down the street in search apparently of an easier target emily would have sworn that it shrugged emily rushed inside calling out her friends name therell be some personal detail seeded into the text before this so that youll know that even with what emily has been handed in life she is still an optimistic sort one who even in the face of what she has just seen expected to find her friend alive maybe youll learn of a lost dog who made its way home or a parent whose cancer scare passed lets make it the dog ill have her see one on the street earlier as she parks her car so that therell be a reason for her to wistfully remember a few details people are often taught more lasting lessons by pets than by parents from across the room emily could make out that rachel stood where emily had always found her behind the counter where she checked out books but by then rachel was no longer emilys friend a bite that had been taken out of rachels neck had allowed blood to spill down the front of her blouse her skin was not yet grey it was deathly pale but not yet the color of the creature who had fallen past emily on its hunt so perhaps it had happened not so long ago emily will think that if only she had arrived a half an hour earlier perhaps she would have found her friend alive it does not occur to her to think that if she had arrived a half an hour earlier maybe they would both be dead but thats just the kind of person emily is thank the dog emily did not enter the vast room to approach her friend she hung back in the hallway and noted that no one else remained there neither human nor zombie that was a good thing emily took that to mean that perhaps she could be safe there in a building at the top of stairs which seemed untenable to the dead it all depended what her friend had turned into it did not seem to emily as if rachel had become a predator her friend had always been gentle could she ever become anything but whatever the circumstance emily did not think that death necessarily had to be a lifealtering experience emily noticed that the whole time she watched rachel stayed by her station her fingers on her keyboard her dull eyes looking straight ahead waiting but for what did some spark that still glowed somewhere inside her still expect customers to come maybe she was merely doing what had always been expected of her in life out of a habit that transcended death or was she waiting for emily only for a different reason than she would have been waiting earlier cannily hoping to entice her close too close with a feigned calmness that was truly no longer hers if only emily could figure it out unravel the suddenly mysterious why of her friend she felt that somehow everything would then make sense and shed know with or without a dog with or without a husband who poked at the earth with a stick how she was meant to live her life from that day forward no thats all wrong too this is getting frustrating i usually dont vacillate like this at least not when it comes to putting words on the page give me a few moments ive got it lets begin this way instead walter was at the main branch of the library researching his next novel the day the zombies came i know i know whats with these libraries youre thinking surely theres a more exciting place to go with this but no for me there isnt and youll soon see why when the screaming began echoing down the narrow hallways and filling the cavernous room in which he sat there were so many books stacked about him that he needed to stand to see what was happening the first thing he saw was that the librarian who had been so kind to him over the years but whose name he had never bothered to learn later he would berate himself for that was beating her fists against the back of a man who was no longer a man the thing was biting chunks out of her neck and spitting gristle as it growled they soon both fell behind the counter so that walter was no longer able to see them but he could still hear the unsettling sounds of feasting walter ducked back down below the wall of books that he had built around him and i will have to think later about whether to stress the metaphor of this with examples of how he had shielded himself with books during all other aspects of his life and crawled from the room unashamed well only slightly ashamed for he had learned long ago that he was a writer not a fighter he did not lift his head thinking unrealistically that if he couldnt see zombies they could not see him until he bumped up against tiny chairs and realized that he had reached the childrens section craning his neck to look up he saw one of the undead holding a young girl up to its mouth and chewing its way through her organs perhaps flecks of her blood will splash onto his face perhaps he will only imagine it as the reality might be too much for you or perhaps it will be both that flecks of blood will splash onto his face but he will only think that he imagined it because it wont be too much for you it will be too much for him the girl wriggled erratically as she died and walter noting that the zombie was too lost in the frenzy of its feast to notice him leapt to his feet and ran past walter knew the layout of the library intimately as it had become his second home well actually more like his first home as his apartment had never become a true home to him and made his way to the vault in which he knew the rare holdings were stored at night it was kept locked but during the day the staff left it open for easier access he had a hunch that he could be protected in there he would lock himself in and no zombie would be able to figure out how to get in after him surely zombies couldnt calculate combinations numbers were too complex for them all they knew was one body another body another body getting out again once things had calmed down again when he would be seen once more as a person and not just a body not just a snack would be easy because safes were designed to prevent people from breaking in not out right he hoped he was right he was sure he was right at least thats what he kept telling himself as the air inside the vault grew moist and stuffy and he struggled mostly in vain to hear whether the screaming outside had stopped sigh no no no im afraid that last try didnt hold together any better than the first two it didnt bring alive what its like to live among the dead but unfortunately that third account is really the best narrative i have to work with because that ones my life because that ones the truth as i have lived it and because now especially now metaphor has to go from now on i should only write what actually happened i should only write the truth on the other hand my old tools seem so reassuring at a time like this and my old coping mechanisms so tempting i keep thinking that there must be a reason for that with so few other comforts left in the world i hope i can be forgiven for backsliding come to think of it are there any other comforts left in the world not counting the mere fact of just being alive itself or maybe its more than just backsliding maybe like a cigarette smoker teetering on the verge of quitting i just need one more dose of my drug before giving it up for good so let me try once more to explain i hope that this time it will work out better for you for both of us here we go i once knew a woman who loved her husband so much that she could not bear to let him go when marilyn swore that she would be true to him in sickness and health she meant it but that isnt always such a good thing for when her husband grew ill she kept him pinned to life in the hospital when he would have been much happier in the grave perhaps in a different story she would have kept him from the grave as a form of punishment but not in this story because that would be ironic and marilyn loved him without irony as he lay there while some machines breathed for him others circulated his blood and still others carried away his wastes she would look at him at the forest of tubes binding him to an unfulfillable promise and weep dont go she would whisper repeating it like a mantra though one with infinite variation you cant go not yet you mustnt go but eventually he went luckily for her his death came on a day when the dead were no longer dying when all life signs ceased the nurses scurried in to the alarms and buzzers they had expected long before there was nothing more that they could do and they at least having long since lost patience with marilyn anyway were glad of it the most important lesson to be learned in this place was letting go and they wished that she had not been such a slow student as a doctor came in to verify what the nurses already knew and murmured the sympathetic words he had been trained to utter about her loss so how sympathetic could they have been anyway the womans husband reached out suddenly grabbed a nurse by the wrist and ripped her arm out of its socket the blood splattered the wife across her folded arms sore from hugging herself as she wept she screamed not taking her eyes from her husband as the remaining nurses joined the doctor in wrapping restraints about the man once they were done and he was attached to the bed they all fled the room carrying the injured nurse with them leaving marilyn alone as the man or what was once a man i have no true word for him as our terminology has not yet advanced as much as our species zombie seems so fraught with baggage struggled impotently and snapped at flesh that was out of reach marilyn thought that she heard her husband call her name buried in his grunts or so she thought were sounds she knew so well murmurs endearments the echoes of living words past and so she stepped closer stunned to find herself in such a bizarre situation she had heard from the small tv bolted to one corner of the ceiling that they listened to as she waited for him to wake that scenes like this were playing themselves out all across the country across the world well not in every corner of the world as we have already discussed somewhere there will always be that man happily oblivious and that stick but she never expected to have someone she knew drawn into such a predicament and especially not herself death is what happened to other people careless people she tilted her head and closed her eyes to listen more intently and something she heard made her certain she swore that she could make out her name and so she moved even closer to him erasing that final space between them and let his teeth rip into her flesh so that she too could join him in the only afterlife that people from then on would ever know no thats not right no one likes reading about people who voluntarily turn themselves into victims we want to see people who take action who make choices who triumph over adversity instead of surrendering to it so how about this i once knew a woman who hated her husband so much that she could not bear to let him go he was rich and so tried his best to pay catherine to leave but he could never seem to name her price as she had no price something he found hard to believe since as i said he was rich and so he turned instead to trying to simply leave her but none of his escape plans worked she kept reeling him back in with the orchestrated disapproval of their friends the withholding of time with his children or at its most drastic with threats of libels plausible enough that she knew they would stick many were the times he flew to the opposite coast in the morning only to be persuaded to return in the evening she stayed on the grounds of their estate and made sure that he stayed there with her once the zombies came because yes i give up what else am i supposed to call them her job became that much easier he no longer wanted to travel into the city which had quickly descended into chaos and so did his job from his home office ordering about with phone calls emails and faxes others who did not have the luxury of his monied sort of refuge as he worked he would keep an eye on the perimeter of their estate via security cameras making sure that the outside world did not invade catherine had her own security cameras ones her husband did not know about and she would check on him often during the day to make sure he had not fled this went on until the weight of the outside world and the weight of her husbands inner world grew so great that he could take it no longer one day she came upon him slumped in the bath in a room devoid of both his cameras and hers the water was tinged with red the cuts on his wrists were lengthwise in that moment as he hesitated between life and new life she hugged him and wrenched him from the water not caring that he was covering her with both suds and blood she dragged him to their safe room it had been installed to protect them from those who would take their wealth and their lives by force and now it would protect her from the invisible force that would dare to take her husband she knew what was going to happen next and so she moved quickly she set him folded on the far side of the safe room his legs stretched out on the floor his back against one of the reinforced walls she did not know why she took such care as she laid him there she could have tossed him the length of the room and not caused him any damage what was to come would come regardless she retreated outside watching him waiting for him to reanimate when she saw her husband begin to twitch she slammed shut the door to the safe room and locked it she was glad that her husband was back little caring in what state he was back she sat on the kingsized bed and listened to him slam against the walls of his prison he would try to break free continuously never tiring and so at last she would know forever where he was that was a bit closer perhaps but still no that one wasnt right either so far with each of these stories im making it all sound too pat i really should stop trying to make sense of it after all part of the truth of zombies and by zombies i mean more than just the raw reality of each individual one of them i mean the concept the very fact that they exist is that there is no sense to them no one expects a hurricane to make sense or an earthquake to have a point and ive learned that about zombies by now too but it turns out to be just like the way people look up at the passing clouds and without even trying find a seahorse a cow or even abe lincoln i cant seem to stop that is what i do it just happens its a compulsion i guess i look at life messy chaotic preposterous life dismantle its unanswered mysteries and incongruous facts rearrange them until there is a beauty not supplied by random events and put them back together again so that all the pieces fit i transform nonsense into serendipity thats a man up there in that moon damn it no matter what im told about an accidental pattern of asteroids and im supposed to behave differently in response to this latest upheaval so i find myself telling myself these stories not consciously choosing to start them and seemingly not able to consciously choose to stop maybe thats my way of going into shock but what i saw when i first stepped from the safety of the vault told me that this pretense of attempting to make sense of how i live now how we all live now is in itself senseless when i finally opened the vault door the first thing i noticed was the silence i was amazed by how quiet it had become no more guttural raging from the undead no further death throes from the living as i moved slowly down the hallways though i found evidence of each red splashes darkened the walls stray bones littered the floors but there were no zombies and no humans i could easily put together the story of what had happened during my hermitage from the disgusting detritus alone but i struggled not to what i had seen with my own eyes had been horrible enough i didnt want to add my imagination to the mix and besides i was too hungry to do so that and only that was what had overcome my fear enough to bring me out of the vault i would not have moved had not my bodys command been move or die i made my way as slowly as my hunger would allow to the machines i had so often eaten from while researching my previous books i knew the taste of stale moon pies far too well my honesty made me put money in the machine rather than break open the glass case but i felt silly for it was there still a world out there that cared after i had eaten two bags of pretzels and a box of raisinets and downed two cans of orange soda i could think straight again only then did it come to me that i should secure the librarys front door because based on the signs around which i had tiptoed there had been no one left alive with the luck to have done it before except for me everyone who had been in the library when the attack began had died i moved slowly and silently toward the front of the building and strangely a part of me felt just as badly for the fallen books that had been knocked to the floor in struggles as another part of me did when gazing at what must have been the sites of fallen people each time i was embarrassed for feeling that way but im a writer thats just one more action i cant control i passed the bank of computers at which i had often sat to check my email and saw that the screensavers still danced i couldnt resist i slapped the spacebar and punched in my password amid the spam was a note from my agent wondering if i still lived i replied to him that i did and since three days had passed since hed sent his message i asked him the same question i started browsing through my favorite blogs discovering that no part of the world had escaped this plague when i suddenly rememberedthe front gate thered be enough time for exploration on the internet later as i swung shut the wroughtiron gates at the librarys main entrance i worried that i was being premature by not yet having checked every inch of the building was i alone in here was i locking death out or locking it inside the better for it to catch me i had to take that chance unless i wanted to spend my days living inside a locked vault until those outside sorted this all out and we all got back to normal as i looked down at the base of the steps on the milling undead it was as if they could sense me as if they felt that by merely continuing to live that i was taunting them they careened off each other as they gathered into clumps it was unnerving to study them that way knowing that they were studying me i moved back from the gates in the hope that i would be less noticeable it seemed to work they wandered off again listless zombies once more from this height they might as well have been commuters on their way to work only their job was eating the actual commuters not that this city had any left there were none of the living left at least not on the streets that surrounded the library that much was clear all of the action was past i could not escape though the signs of actions past i had tried before to avoid the implications of such signs but would the world ever be rid of them dark stains everywhere as random as oil slicks told me what had happened out there what i had thankfully missed while inside the vault automobiles appeared to have been flung randomly across the landscape outside one flipped onto its back on the bottom steps of the library others piled up against each other as far into the distance as i could see an armored car lay on its side amid the chaos i could picture the drivers dodging both living and dead each terrified that he or she would migrate from being one to being the other losing control first of their vehicles and finally their lives i didnt want to keep reliving that so i looked again at the armored car it was filled with money i imagined which my last royalty statements told me i needed more of i could probably go out there if i was crazy enough to risk it and grab all the cash i could carry but what good would that do me now we had evolved overnight into a world beyond money a new economy ruled the world and it was one based on meat as i stared at the armored car and thought wistfully of a past and future no longer within my reach i thought i could see something move through a small narrow window in the vehicles side i studied that slot and though there was no more movement i could tell that yes as i was looking someone was looking back i risked stepping closer to the gates again but unfortunately at that distance i could not read any expression there i could barely make out any features at all an eye a nose just enough to tell me that i was not alone then i saw a hand its curled fingers beckoning me forward i was not the last man in the world after all not some robinson crusoe stranded after the rise of the zombies or maybe come to think of it i was and as the tale promised id just found my friday the stories come more slowly now i know i know i promised you that they wouldnt come at all any longer but if you out there were in here with me were at my side youd see that there is good reason for them to continue and besides maybe this will be the story worth telling or maybe just maybe i will tell them until i finally admit that there might no longer be any stories worth telling so there once was a womani wont give her a name i wont bother giving any of them names any longer for after all arent they all just archetypes arent they really just you and mewho had tried and tried and tried and tried to have a child but no matter what she and her husband and the doctors and the insurance companies and the midwives and the potential grandmothers did she kept miscarrying but somehow even as her husband suggested at first gently and then more insistently that they consider adoption she avoided the choice he was pushing upon her and she also avoided despair she knew that she would eventually have a child a child of her own and so she was able to shut out all the voices that yammered around her and she almost proved those voices wrong too by carrying a fetus nearly to term so close but then it died too just like all of the others she could sense the motionlessness inside the potential that had become merely a weight she felt the absence in a way she had never known before one could feel an absence she had always been honest with her husband before as a couple they prided themselves on their honesty but this time she could not bear to tell him the truth she knew what would happen next what the doctors would insist and she didnt want to endure again what shed endured so many times already so she prayed just as for the first time in her life since she had been a child she had been praying for a child of her own and then just before the next days already scheduled prenatal appointment which she had thought she would have to break so as not to reveal what had occurred she felt movement within but the movement felt more violent than any kicking the baby had done before prior to what she convinced herself was only a brief nap she could feel things ripping and tearing inside and her spotting became bleeding enough to frighten her she went alone to the doctor not wanting to have to be forced to tell her husband what was going on and when the doctor gave her a sonogram he saw no heartbeat he was baffled and did not know what to tell her nothing had prepared him for this how could there be movement with no heartbeat and then perhaps in response to the sonograms invasion the movements increased the woman clutched her stomach and screamed and as the doctor rushed to his wall of supplies to find a way to relieve her agony the baby chewed its way out of its mothers womb and poked its head through the skin of her stomach the doctor even in the midst of the insanity of the event reacted reflexively reaching for the child instinctively wanting to see that whatever else was incomprehensible about this moment it was healthy not able to see the dead skin hidden by the blanket of blood the child snapped at him as it wriggled free from its dying mother and the doctor backed away hurriedly tripping over his own feet and then fled the room or perhaps he should only attempt to flee perhaps after he loses his balance instead of righting himself and continuing on he should fall to the floor and the child the thing should fall from the mother now dead atop the examining table and begin to feast upon the doctor perhaps that would make more dramatic sense however the scene ends we should keep in mind that it is a scene which with many variations played itself out around the world that day as the fruits of failed pregnancies suddenly resulted not in dead babies but in undead ones but neither this mother nor this doctor could know that but even if they had known what other choices would they have made there was barely escape from the plague without how could there be escape from the plague within so lets just say that this particular baby struggled its way free from its mothers guts and slid off the examining table whether onto the warm doctor or onto the cold linoleum to be decided later what will happen next would remain the same regardless it crawled out of the examining room into an office which by then had been emptied by the bloodied or unbloodied doctors screaming it pulled and wriggled its way down the street unable to move in any way other than that of a real baby perhaps someday if it survived it would learn to walk though physically it would never have more than a newborns form but for now it crawled making slow progress people on the street gave it a wide berth the trail of blood that it left behind itself clear warning of its intent and though it grew frustrated that frustration could not propel it quickly enough to overtake any of them but then a dog came over sniffing curious unafraid and close enough for the zombie child to grab hold of its front paws it yanked at them roughly breaking the dogs front legs as the animal squealed and struggled vainly to retreat the baby pulled itself forward along the length of the dogs trembling body to reach and snap the back legs as well the baby had no teeth as yet and so could not chew its way into the animals belly as its tiny brain desired so it had to punch its way in with small but strong fists and suck on the red raw meat it had exposed as the child feasted it felt itself pulled away from its orgy of blood and before it could react to this affront tossed through the air it bounced off the back wall of a small cage and as it attempted to reorient itself and go on the attack once more the door slammed shut the woman whose dog had just been killed had a cage in which she would transport her dog to the park each day in the back of her van and the zombie baby found itself trapped within it beat blindly at the sides of the cage but the metal was too strong for it to bend the woman smiled as she drove it back to her home the reason she had a dog she always knew was because she could not have a child and now most unexpectedly she had a child she saw it as a gift from god she did not care that it was dead or that she would obviously have to be very very careful or she would end up dead herself she would love it for the rest of her life even after the world came through the other side of this plague she would tell no one of it so that when all the other zombies were rounded up and destroyed her baby would remain safe she would love it and care for it as long as she lived but she would never let it out of its cage well maybe that wont turn out to be one of the stories worth telling right now in the midst of it all it seems somewhat pointless to even bother creating stories but i know that someday the world will want to make sense of what we went through together and someone will have to step forward to do that that someone might as well be me so i at least have to try one thing ive been realizing as my subconscious mind weaves life into art well let others decide later if theres any art there is that all zombie stories are true also no zombie stories are true because you see there are no zombie stories until i write them the universe has no opinion of us no matter how much we want to pretend real life does not contain the quality of story no arcs no morals no meaning life is what we make of it and i was finally after a lifetime of typing in a position to make something of it it had been a week since i had taken refuge in this place undoubtedly whoever was inside the armored car had to have been there nearly as long or he would not still be alive however long the person had been trapped heor she i shouldnt forget there was a chance that it could be a shesurely needed food by now and it was up to me to help i rushed back to the candy machine that i had long since cracked open having abandoned the comforting illusion of order that dropping change in the slot had earlier brought me and filled my pockets with pretzels beef jerky soda and whatever else could fit the cans cold through the cloth of my jacket reminded me that the citys electricity still worked which had to be a good sign right somewhere out there the wheels of industry kept turning and human beings had to be the ones turning them or so i hoped im afraid i didnt understand enough about technology to know for sure im not that kind of writer id research that after what i told myself i had to do if there was an after i ran down to the ground floor and paused at the far end of the hallway that led to the main entrance back enough from the gates so that though i could make out the foot traffic i could not be easily seen i watched as the zombies moved in their random patterns and waited for the street ahead to clear there would come a moment i was sure in which nothing stood between me and the armored car and no one hovered close enough to catch me even if i was noticed and then trying not to think too much about it i ran it was not a pretty thing as i am a writer not a runner those two roles cohabit rarely and certainly not in me i am ashamed to say that it was not courage that propelled me clumsily on it was loneliness that had overcome my fear not altruism when i was closer to the armored car than i was to the librarys front door i suddenly thoughtwhat if that hadnt been a living person i had seen staring back at me through that narrow window what if the guard had died in the crash and was now himself a zombie and the face was that of something struggling to get out and unable to figure out how and hungry it was too late to dwell on that for more than an instant because out of the corner of an eye i could see a shuffling form as i ran more quickly soda sloshing the thick back door of the armored car was raised in front of me and i dove in the door slammed shut behind me and i turned my head quickly to see that yes thankfully i was visiting someone still alive the man in the stained guard uniform locking the door looked far the worse for wear than i did but he was still a man the air hung heavy with sweat but after someone has lived in the back of a small truck for a week i guess i was lucky i could stand it at all i lay there breathing heavily feeling drained as much from the tension as the exertion and did not protest as the guard patted me down i knew what he was looking for and was just thankful at this juncture that he was eating my food instead of attempting to eat me he snapped a huge chocolate chip cookie in half and shoved both pieces in his mouth then popped a soda which exploded across his face thanks to my mad dash but he wasnt angry as he surely would have been back in the old days of only a week before he just laughed and took a long pull from the can thanks he said wiping the crumbs and foam from his face i dont think a soda has ever tasted this good and as you might guess i havent had many reasons to laugh in a while i nodded and forced a smile i was glad to see him to know that i wasnt alone but i wasnt happy about the fact that id had to come to him rather than the reverse to do it why are you still here i said a little too terse considering what should be joyful circumstances once you knew i was inside why didnt you make a break for the library that place is like a fortress he swiveled clumsily about and showed me his right foot the ankle of which twisted at an ugly angle id never have made it with this he said once we flipped and i felt the snap i knew that it was all over for me but you have to try barry i said he started when i called him by name so i pointed at his id badge still hanging from his chest pocket i didnt want to feel responsible for you starving out here so i brought food but its too risky to do more than once you cant expect me to continue supplying you and you cant last forever in here alone i didnt plan on lasting forever he shrugged the bags under his eyes shrugged with him would have been nice though but better starved to death than eaten to death ill admit i expected to end up with a bigger coffin but this one will have to do no i said suddenly and firmly surprised at myself even as i blurted it out im not going to let that happen we ought to be able to get you up those steps and into the library if we work together i can distract them they dont move that fast faster than me he said wearily his expression was a defeated one but i knew better than to accept it as irreversible if theres one thing ive learned over the years its that people want to live weve got to try i said you dont want me to have come this far for nothing i ought to at least get a chance to save your life he laughed which i considered progress i peered out the small window in the rear door back up the steps of the library to safety the front gates looked infinitely far away i was stunned that i had survived the first leg of the journey but i knew that regardless of how treacherous it seemed i was going back if i was going to die it was going to be in that library or at the very least trying to get back to that library and not in the rear of an armored car barry might have been willing to settle for a coffin of that size but mine had to be a little larger and contain the complete works of shakespeare besides barry had not answered but it was as if we had made a silent decision we watched and waited too weary for small talk which we both hoped and pretended that there would be time for later too weary for anything but studying the street praying for a moment when it would be completely clear and allow barry time to hobble to safety but unlike earlier that day no such moment came each time the random patterns of the shuffling undead had the streets almost emptied there would always be one lone zombie lingering under a stop light as if waiting for it to change i didnt really think it could be doing that responding to the world that used to be no not in real life only in stories maybe but still there it was the lights did not function and so it stared up at the pole until i grew tired of waiting im going to distract him i whispered the guard ordered me not to in one of those voices guards have and grabbed at my arm but i leapt through the door anyway and was back on the street before he could do anything about it instead of running immediately toward the steps leading up to the door of the library as any sane person would have done i ran at the lightdistracted zombie prayed for it to notice me before i got too close then veered away at the last possible instant i knew i could still outrun it it was pulled along in my wake by its undead desire now i shouted back at barry over my shoulder this is your chance take it i watched as he tumbled out from the safety of his truck and began hopping but i could not spare him any more of my attention after that a second zombie perhaps sensing my presence on that street as i imagined only a zombie could or was that truly only a power of my imagination had come around a corner and now i had to distract two of them luckily even though my lack of anything resembling an athletic past slowed me down death kept the zombies even slower as i ran it seemed to me that they must only catch their prey by surprise and with persistence for they did not have speed on their side i lured them away from the path barry had to be taking but when i saw a third zombie appear i knew that i could tempt fate no longer there were getting to be too many trajectories for me to calculate to stay alive i swooped down on the struggling guard who had just reached the bottom of the steps and grabbed him by the shoulders nearly knocking him down as i shouted at him to move i dont think i used any actual words we ran a desperate threelegged race together dodging the undead who slowly began to follow us as i pulled him up step by step agonizingly slow ourselves as we neared the door i could hear the snapping of teeth behind us and knew that barry had slowed me down too much i dove in pushing him ahead of me and from my knees slammed the gates shut behind us gasping i stood looking in awe at the dead flesh that obscured my vision of anything beyond they glared at us but we were protected from them once we moved more deeply inside the building they would forget about us as they had forgotten about all else and drift away we were safe we laughed and there was a hysterical tinge to our laughter as i imagined there would always be in circumstances where death seemed so close and yet was repulsed and then a zombie who must have snuck through the door while id been outside rescuing and doing my supposedly distracting dance reached out from within the library and with a sickening groan completely ripped off barrys injured leg now heres a story that i think i still deserve to tell i dont know that there are many more like that stories that i have actually earned and besides im doing a pretty good job of proving that there isnt much else that im good for a writer again no names please no longer having access to a human audience and unable to stop writing begins to write stories suitable only for the undead he cannot write the love stories he was used to writing because the zombies know nothing of love he can no longer write stories in which the motivations are based on greed because zombies know nothing of money all that is left to him is to write stories of action and adventure well boring and repetitive action and adventure because zombies know of that in their own special but limited way since the zombies know of only one thing all the stories sound the same but this writer he figures that it doesnt matter because if zombies have one trait it is patience my agent on the other hand tells me that my readers do not have patience and certainly have no desire to read of writers the only people who want to read of writers or so he tells me are other writers but what does he know anyway at this time i probably have no agent and i say this not the way a beginning writer in search of an agent does i say this because my agent has probably been eaten which some might say isnt a bad end for an agent but since he is dead and my fictional writers readers are also dead we might as well just move on the stories this writer writes all follow the same pattern as zombies are easily entertained they begin with the sense that there is walking meat nearby and then it is spotted and then it is chased and then the walking meat is no longer walking for the living is inside the dead the writer types out many variations of this outline because that is all that he knows how to do and when there are no more stories to tell hes going to continue to tell them anyway some of his tales are set on city streets some are on country roads still others take place in zoos in shopping malls and schools and airplanes but whatever the setting at their heart they are all the same shuffle shamble shuffle a little more quickly run well as zombies run anyway run run run eat eventually this writer who is obviously not very selfaware or he would have given up long agoor if not long ago at least once his audience had deserted himrealizes that he has written hundreds of such stories but now that the reams of paper are stacked high next to his manual typewriter because he refused to let the fall of civilization keep him from his appointed rounds he had no idea what to do with them there were no zombie magazines in which to publish them no zombie bookstores in which they could be sold at least not yet he thinks and so he decides he must go out into the street the street which he had avoided for so long and declaim his stories he expected that this would be the end of him and he was ready for it after all a lion tamer may stick his head into a lions mouth for a brief moment but let him attempt to read hamlet while so inserted and all will be lost but he had been too alone for too long and without an audience even longer whatever was to happen had to be better than what had happened so far but when he actually begins his readings out in the middle of an intersection that hadnt known a car for years he was pleasantly surprised zombies gathered and approached him but they only came to a certain point and then came no further as he read they stood about him in a circle and seemed to listen well he could pretend that about those that had ears at least so he did not stop reading even as he grew hoarse he felt fulfilled he believed that he had at last found the one true audience he had been seeking his entire life but then he realizes that he is getting to the end of the stories that he has brought along with him and encased in a circle of the dead as it were there was no opening in the crowd for him to get back to the additional manuscripts that remained in his hiding place back inside so when he gets to the end of the last story in his hands he begins all over again the zombies begin to growl they may like the repetitiveness of theme but they do not like the repetition of actual stories he tries to back away but there is nothing behind him but more of the undead they move forward and their circle closes tightly around him until it is difficult for him to breathe from the weight of them and as they start to tear him to quivering shreds he has just enough time to think everyones a critic before he has no more time in which to think but no thats not right either because even though the ending is horrifying and the writers fate undeserved though i can think of a few publishers who might wish that all writers ended up that way theres still a moral to the telling of the tale zombies are a force of nature and forces of nature do not come equipped with morals forces of nature do not come packaged with a purpose a message or a reason they just are which is why the guard was suddenly dead destroyed just when we thought wed gotten back to safety or maybe maybe the one thing that forces of nature can share with fiction is that they often bring along with them a sense of irony we would have heard the zombie that had slipped in during my trip outside coming toward us if we had not been laughing so loudly after our return to the supposed protection of the library perhaps a force of nature cannot allow such joy to continue without a response we were hysterical with relief slapping each other on our backs as we extricated ourselves from our heap on the floor and so i didnt even realize that anything unplanned was happening until the guards laughter turned to a howl of pain i sprung away from him to see that barrys right leg was no longer his it was in the zombies hands dripping blood the guard kept screaming while clawing at his spurting leg which spilled more blood than a body should be able to lose and still have the screaming continue there was nothing i could do for him no way to save him even if i was able to tie off the leg to stop the bleeding he would be one of them soon and after my leg i knew what i had to do i hoped that he was too dazed from loss of blood to realize what was coming i helped him stand on his remaining foot his moaning was by then barely audible and he was nearly unconscious which made what i was about to do easier i opened the gate that protected us from the few zombies still milling about at the top of the stairs and pushed him into the midst of them for a brief moment he surged with more energy he mustered a scream but then the undead began to tear him apart and the screaming stopped while they were distracted in their feeding i was able to step back from the door without fear that any of them would enter but still i kept my eye on them at all times as i circled around the zombie inside that had stolen our rescue from us it was intent on its snack chewing on the leg that had broken in the first place to start the chain of events that led us to this horrible event so it didnt notice me at all as i rushed at it from behind and shoved it out to join his fellows as i slammed the gate again this time hopefully not to be opened again until the earth shifted on its axis once more i could see that it showed no sign of even having noticed that anything had happened he just continued attacking the leg of the man i had gotten killed see in a story this would never have turned out that way in a story which has to make sense which has to provide rewards for its journey or else we wouldnt call it story barry would have lived but life does not often promise such rewards and when it does rarely delivers in a story the two of us could have struggled to make a life for ourselves here until the world woke from this zombie dream and brought rescue or until we found a way to make contact with the enclave of civilization that id knowwell at least in a story that id know and hopewould be out there fiction would have given us both a better end unfortunately i am a better writer than god chooses to be for it does not seem as if either rescue or solace will be found i no longer even think it possible no one answers the emails i send out on the intermittent days i am even able to send them no one posts updates to the web sites i used to visit in fact day by day sites that i had previously been able to visit are gone i have grown so used to error messages that life itself seems an error message with each part of the web that vanishes i imagine that a part of the real world has gone as well when it all goes i will be alone well not entirely alone i will still have my friends shakespeare is here and frost and faulkner and austen and carver and proust all telling me of the worlds in which they lived worlds that continued to exist only because i am still here to read about them ive always known that fact and the lesson it taught me is that my world will not continue to exist unless someone is there to read about it that is why i have been creating these stories thats why ive always created stories but i cant do it any longer i see that i have lived too long have lived through the time of my usefulness out to the time beyond stories i could keep trying to tell them but what would be the point of that its not worth remaining in a world without readers and i doubt that you still exist my world can survive my death but it cannot survive yours art for arts sake was never what i was about art alone was never enough so im going to stop writing and im going to start praying prayer ive tried it and it just isnt working for me but it does plant the seed for one last story i give you my word and this time you can believe my promise after the world went to hell a priest who had been traveling hurried back to his flock so that they could still make it into heaven he didnt make it home alive the same way most of the world didnt make it home alive as the disease began to spread but he made it home newly dead the reason does not matter he walked through the night a stranger to exhaustion shuffling along the highway toward his church as cars sped by speeding more quickly when they saw him filled with passengers in search of a freedom they would never find by the time he entered his small town having been on the move for the better part of a week it was sunday and the members of his congregation had made their way uncertainly to their church they knew what had been going on in the world that it was the stuff of revelations come at last and since they knew that their priest had headed to new york for a conference they assumed he was dead and they did not expect to see him again but they also knew that it was sunday and this was where they should be they were all sitting quietly in their pews wondering whether one of them should step forward and stumble through the service when the priest himself stumbled in no one spoke no one fled as he assumed his usual place even though it was clear what he had become because they had faith something which i do not have he tried to lead them in prayer though perhaps tried is not the best word as it implies volition and he was operating on habit and tropism and halfforgotten dream but regardless the words would not come as neither his mouth nor his brain were suitable for speech any longer so the parishioners prayed on their own standing and sitting and singing and speaking and remaining silent as they had always done for they knew well what god expected of them their priest growled before them a deep rumble that some of them felt was not all that much different than what they had already been hearing for so many years when it became the proper time for the congregation to receive communion the priest stretched out his hands and with the fingers that remained to him gestured them all forward they did not hesitate they filed toward him not frightened by his yellow eyes or the pallor of his skin or the fact that beneath his shredded clothing his flesh was shredded as well they felt themselves in the presence of a miracle and one does not argue with a miracle they only knew that it was the usual time of the week to be made one with god when his flock was lined up before him the priest seemed to freeze the momentum of his faith had gotten him this far but that did not mean that he was capable of much in the way of independent action and thought as he paused he was vaguely aware that something more active was expected of him but the fog refused to lift so that he could see what that something was after death if one goes through the motions of life it can only be by traversing the ruts one had chosen in life he sensed somehow that he was expected to feed them but he had not prepared he had no consecrated wafers with which to proceed no consecrated wine with which to wash away sins so he fed them of his flesh and quenched them with his blood he pulled open the tatters of his shirt and tore mouthsized gobbets from his chest one by one he dropped them on waiting tongues mumbling incoherently each time he did so then each of his congregants went back to his or her life and as they had been promised knew life eternal and as for the priest he remained in his sanctuary and fed the dwindling members of his flock each sunday until no flesh remained with which he could do so but by that time it didnt matter as there were none left who required salvation and there you have itthe last tale im ever going to tell the last story i never thought id ever consider a story and judge it to be the last i thought id die in the middle of telling a tale but now why bother the telling of tales is through and i too am almost through let it be the last story and let it be told by the last man the candy machines are empty now and ive resorted to licking the empty wrappings that id previously abandoned all thats left in the soda machine are a few cans of grape ive long ago gone through the desks of the missing why cant i think dead workers and found every last candy bar and cracker electricity is random and water has slowed to a trickle which means that the world beyond this one is sending signals to me that it is running down entropy is rising soon i will be out of both food and water and my only choices will be do i die because i no longer have anything left to eat or because i let myself be eaten there seems to be little difference between the two whether i choose death by action or death by inaction i will have still chosen death i have been backed into a corner i guess i should consider that is a good thing because it means that i will not be a victim in my own death i will be a participant when i go which will not be long or else my choice will be taken from me will i be the last isolated as i am i cant tell ill never know i guess that each of us wherever we are will appear to be the last to ourselves and if we appear to be the last then we are the last but if by some miracle i am not the last man telling the last story if there are others who someday read these words who have managed to restore a civilization to this planet currently hovering between life and death think of me from time to time as you go about your day think of us i lived in a time of no hope feeling there was no life outside my own and with no new life to follow i wish that you could know this time as i have known the times before my own i wish that i could trust that you would be there to someday read these words even if you are not human even if you must be a visitor who travels to our world a million years from now to discover what exists on the third planet from the sun and all you find is the shuffling undead the same ones i have known still hunting still searching much like we were only eternal will you be able to figure out who we once were or will you merely sit in awe and wonder at how such shambling creatures could have built this world and then seemingly forgotten how they brought it into existence if you come here to this building to this vault to these pages you will know it is important that you know in any case i do not think you will be coming not from this world or any other i may be imaginative i may be a dreamer but i am unable to live in either imagination or dream and so i will be gone soon with my strength fading and with your future existence to read these words in doubt i do not know why i struggle to write them well maybe i do i cant stop writing well i can it will be when i stop living and with strength finally fading it is time for me to do both i cannot write i can barely think i can only choose so goodbye in case you surprise me and come to read these words lets leave it like this did i starve was i eaten as long as i do not write the words i did neither and continue to exist in the eternal present forever alive as immortal as the undead i can be with you still whoever you are whenever you are as long as you are if you are keep me alive so perhaps i was wrong perhaps art alone art for arts sake can be enough it feels enough now as i make my choice meanwhile our man with a stick and plot of land who toiled on the other side of the globe and slept under different stars remember him the one who knew nothing of our roaring earthquakes rising floods or falling towers wakes before dawn from troubling dreams while hed slept the strange visions had made sense to him but once he was awake it all slipped away when he rose from his straw mat and woke his son and tried to tell the boy what he had seen because dreams were meaningful to his people he remembered nothing of libraries or zombies or the taste of grape soda all that came to him was the uncomfortable feeling of having been in the heart of a big city which to him was frightening enough he had heard of such places but knew of no one who had ever visited one and he was glad that he instead had been born here with his patch of earth and the mountains that surrounded it with his stick and a son whom he needed to teach how to survive with little more than that but that was enough why would anyone require more a wife for him and a mother for the boy perhaps but more those would be riches he did not need tomorrow in fact if asked to remember his dream of the previous morning this morning he would answer what dream i remember no dream and though some might choose to judge him and his way of life he is at peace with the universe as he knew it and he will go on as before content fulfilled and utterly and happily oblivious to the fact that half a world away almost the last man on earth believed that he had finished telling almost the last stories how the day runs down by john langan john langan is the author of several stories including episode seven last stand against the pack in the kingdom of the purple flowers which appeared in my anthology wastelands stories of the apocalypse that story and all of his other fiction to date was originally published in the magazine of fantasy science fiction by the time this anthology sees print these will have been collected in mr gaunt and other uneasy encounters along with a previously unpublished novella other forthcoming work includes a story in ellen datlows anthology poe how the day runs down which is original to this volume resulted from langans notion to write a monologue from the point of view of the stage manager in thornton wilders play our town in which our town was infested with zombies im not sure what prompted me to combine those two things langan said there was a certain mordant humor in the juxtaposition of the stage managers homespun wisdom with zombie horror that appealed to me the stage dark with the almostblue light of the late late night when youve been up well past the third ranks of latenight talk shows into the land of the infomercial the late show movies whose soundtrack is out of sync with its characters mouths and which may break for commercial without regard for the action on the screen the rebroadcast of the news you couldnt bear to watch the first time it is possiblejustto discern rows of smallish rectangular shapes running across the stage as well as the bulk of a more substantial though irregular shape to the rear the sky is dark no moon no stars when the stage manager snaps on his flashlighta large one whose bright beam he sweeps back and forth over the audience once twice three timesthe effect of the sudden light the twirl of shadows around the theater is emphasized by brushes rushing over drums which give the sound of leaves and a rainstick which conjures the image of bones clicking against one another more than it does rain having surveyed the audience to his apparent satisfaction the stage manager trains his light closer to home this allows the audience to see the rows of tombstones that stretch the width of the stage two deep in most places three in a couple even from his quick inspection of them it is clear that these are old tombstones most of them chipped and worn almost smooth the stage manager spares a moment for the gnarled shape behind the tombstones a squat willow before positioning the flashlight on the ground to his left bottom down so that its white light draws a cone in the air he settles himself down beside it his back leaning for and finding a tombstone his legs gradually crossing in front of him it has to be said even with the light shining right beside him the stage manager is not easy to see a reasonable guess would locate him somewhere in his late forties but estimates a decade to either side would not be unreasonable his eyes are deep set sheltered under heavy brows and the bill of the worn baseball cap on his head his nose is thick and may have been broken in some distant confrontation the shadows from the light spilling across his face make it difficult to decide if his broad upper lip sports a mustache although his solid chin is clear of any hair his ethnicity is uncertain he could put in an appearance at most audience members family reunions as a cousin twiceremoved and not look out of place he is dressed warmly for late fall in a bomber jacket flannel shirt jeans and heavy boots stage manager zombies as with most things in life the reality when compared to the hightech hollywoodgloss of the movies comes as something of a surprise for one thing theres the smell a stench that combines all the worst elements of raw sewage and rotted meat together with the faint tang of formaldehyde folks used to think that last was from the funeral homeswhatever theyd used to pickle dear aunt myrtlebut as it turned out this wasnt the case its just part of the smell they bring with them some peoplescientists doctorshave speculated that its the particular odor of whatever is causing the dead to rise up and stagger around although i gather other scientists and doctors have disagreed with that theory but you dont have to understand the chemistry of it to know that its theirs for another thing when it comes to zombies no one anticipated how persistent the damned things would be you shoot them in the chest they keep on coming you shoot them in the leghell you blow their leg clean off with your shotgun at pointblank range they fall on their side flop around for a minute or two then figure out how to get themselves on their front so they can pull themselves forward with their hands while they push with their remaining leg and all the time the leg you shot off is twitching like mad as if if it had a few more nerve cells at its disposal it would find a way to continue after you itself there is shooting in the headits true that works destroy enough brain matter and they dropbut do you have any idea what its like to try to hit a moving target even a slowmoving one in the head at any kind of distance especially if you arent using a stateoftheart sniper rifle but the snubnosed thirtyeight you bought ten years ago when the house next door was burglarized and havent given a thought to sinceand the face youre aiming at belongs to your pastor who just last saturday was exhorting the members of your diminished congregation not to lose hope the lord was testing you from high over the stage managers head a spotlight snaps on illuminating owen trezza standing in the center aisle about threequarters of the way to the stage hes facing the back of the theater at a guess hes in his midthirties his brown hair standing out in odd directions the way it does when youve slept on it and not washed it for several days running his glasses ducttaped on the right side his cheeks and chin full of stubble going to beard the denim jacket hes wearing is stained with dirt grass and what it would be nice to think of as oil as are his jeans the green sweatshirt under his jacket is if not clean at least not marred by any obvious discolorations although whatever logo it boasted has flaked away to a few scattered flecks of white in his outstretched right hand he holds a revolver with an abbreviated barrel that wavers noticeably as he points it at something outside the spotlights reach owen oh jesus oh sweet jesus stop stop right there pastor parks pleasedont come any closer pastor

of the spotlight the sound of inexpensive loafers dragging across the carpet owen pastor parksmichaelmichael parks this is your final warning stop right there stop right there the shoes continue their scrape over the carpet from the rear of the theater a terrible odor rolls forward like the cloud that hangs around the carcass of a deer two days dead and burst open on a hot summer afternoon owens hand is shaking badly he grabs his right wrist with his left hand which steadies it enough for him to pull the trigger the gun cracks like an especially loud firecracker and jerks up and away owen brings it back to aim owen okaythat was a warning shot now please stay where you are the rough noise of the steps is joined by the outline of a figure at the edge of the spotlights glow owen shoots a second time again the gun cracks and leaps back he swings it around and pulls the trigger four times straining to keep the pistol pointed ahead now the air is heavy with the sharp smell of gunsmoke hands at its sides back stiff swaying like a metronome as it walks the figure advances into the light it is a man perhaps ten years owens senior dressed in a pair of khaki slacks and a black shortsleeved shirt whose round white collar is crusted with dried blood except for a spot over his collar which is open in a dull ragged wound the color of old liver his skin is gray although it is

off by a surge of denial he starts to speak whatever he was about to say whether plea or threat or defiance is drowned out by a boom that staggers the ears simultaneously the back of pastor parkss head blows out in a spray of stale blood and congealed brains and splinters of bone that spatters those sitting to either side of the aisle the minister drops to the floor the stage manager has risen to his feet in his right hand he holds out a longbarreled pistol trailing a wisp of smoke for what is probably not more than five seconds he keeps the gun trained on the pastors unmoving body then raises the revolver and returns it to a shoulder holster under his left arm owen trezza continues staring at the corpse as the spotlight snaps off the stage manager resumes his seat stage manager no there are some marksmen and women about thats for sure but its equally sure theyre in the minority most folks have to rely on other methods a few wouldbe hemen have tried to play conan the barbarian rushed the zombies with a hatchet in one hand a butcher knife in the other one particularly inspired specimen a heavyset guy named gary floss ripstarted the chainsaw hed bought to take down the line of pines in front of his house this was a mistake then everyone saw what lousy shape gary kept his house in the problem is that hatchet you have in your right hand isnt a weapon its a tool youve used splitting wood for the fireplace and while its probably sharp enough for another winters worth of logs its not going to separate someones head from their shoulders with a single blow from your mighty arm the same things true for the knife sweating up your left hand its cutlery and if you recall the effort it takes to slice a roast with ita roast that is not trying to find its way inside your skull with its persistent fingersyou might want to reconsider your chances of removing limbs with ease even if you have a razorsharp ax and an honesttogod machete these things are actually rather difficult to use well the moviesagainaside no one picks up this kind of weapon and is instantly skilled with it you need training in the meantime youre likely to leave your hatchet lodged in a collar bone the pride of your assorted knives protruding above a hip as for gary floss and his chainsawyou want to be careful swinging one of those around a man could take off an arm to the right and left of the theater the snarl of a chainsaw starting it revs once twice a third time changes pitch as it catches on something it blends with a mans voice shriekingthen silence stage manager what works is fire zombies move away from fire faster than they move towards a fresh kill the problem is theyre not especially flammableno more than you or i areso you have to find a way to make the fire stick for a time this meant billy joe royales homemade napalm a lingering sense of civic responsibility precludes me from disclosing the formula for billy joes incendiary weapon which he modified from suggestions inwas it the anarchist cookbook or an old issue of soldier of fortune or something hed watched on the discovery channel back before it stopped broadcasting its the damnedest thing do you know the history channels still on the air just about every other channels gone blue once in a while one of the stations out of the city will manage a broadcast the last was a week and a half ago when the abc affiliate showed a truncated news report that didnt tell anyone much they hadnt already heard or guessed and a rerun of an episode of general hospital from sometime in the late nineties but wherever the history channel is located someone programmed in twentyfour hours worth of old world war ii documentaries that have been playing on continuous loop ever since you go from dday to pearl harbor to anzio all of it in black and white interrupted by colorful ads for restaurant chains that havent served a meal in a month cars that no ones seen on the road for as long movies that never made it to the theater truth to tell i think the folks who bother to waste their generators power on the tv do so more for the commercials than any nostalgia for a supposed greatest generation these days a big mac seems an almost fabulous extravagance a cadillac opulent decadence a new movie an impossible indulgence thats all a bit offtopic though we were talking about billy joe and his bathtub napalm by the time he perfected the mixture the situation here had slid down the firepole from nottoobad to disastrous all within the matter of a couple of days where we are son of a gun i never told you the name of this place did i i apologize itsthe zombies have become so much the center of existence that theyre the default topic of conversation what we have now instead of the weather this is the town of goodhope crossing specifically the municipal cemetery out behind the dutch reformed church where im sitting is the oldest part of the place the newer graves are the stage manager points out at the audience stage manager relax relax while theres nowhere thats completely safe anymore the cemeterys no worse a danger than anyplace else for the better part ofi reckon it must be going on four decades local regulations have decreed that every body must be buried in a properly sealed coffin and that coffin must be buried within a vault to prevent contamination of groundwater and the like the zombies have demonstrated their ability to claw their way out of all sorts of coffins time and again but i have yet to hear of any of them escaping a vault rumors to the contrary theyre not any stronger than you or me in fact as a rule they tend to be weaker and the longer they go without feeding the weaker they become muscle decay you know hunger doesnt exactly kill themit more slows them down to the point theyre basically motionless dormant you might say so the chances are good that anyone who mightve been squirming around down there in the dirt has long since run out of gas granted not that im in any rush to make absolutely sure it is true those who passed on before the requirement for a vault were able to make their way to the surface a lot of them werent exactly in the best of shape to begin with though and the ordeal of breaking out of their coffins and fighting up through six feet of earththe soil in these parts is dense thick with clay and studded with rocksit didnt do anything to help their condition thats for sure some of the very old ones didnt arrive in one piece and there were some who either couldnt complete the trip or werent coherent enough even to start it stage right a stage light pops on throwing a dim yellow glow over one of the tombstones and jennifer and jackson howland her standing behind the headstone him seated on the ground in front of and to its right they are sister and brother what their parents friends secretly call catholic or irish twins jennifer is ten months her brothers senior which currently translates to seventeen to his sixteen they are siblings as much in their buildtall yet heavyas they are in their angular faces their brown eyes their curly brown hair both are dressed in orange hunting caps and orange hunting vests over white cableknit sweaters jeans and construction boots jennifer props a shotgun against her right hip and snaps a piece of bubblegum jackson has placed his shotgun on the ground behind him chin on his fists he stares at the ground jennifer i still say youre sitting too close jackson its fine jenn jennifer yeah well see how fine it is when i have to shoot you in the head to keep you from making me your happy meal jackson sighs extravagantly pushes himself backwards over and behind his gun jackson there is that better jennifer as long as the person whose grave youre sitting on now doesnt decide your ass would make a tasty treat jackson glares at her and climbs to his feet jennifer arent you forgetting something she nods at the shotgun lying on the ground jackson thrusts his hands in the pockets of his vest jackson im sure therell be plenty of time for me to arm myself if anything shows up jennifer dont be so sure christine compton said her family was attacked by a pair of eaters who ran like track stars jackson uhhuh jennifer why would she make that up jackson shedid mr compton kill them jennifer it was mrs compton actually christines dad cant shoot worth shit jackson regardlesstheyre both dead these sprinting zombies again so we dont have to worry about them jennifer there could be others you never know jackson ill take my chances pauses besides its not as if we need to be here in the first place jennifer oh jackson dont you think if greatgrandma rose were going to return she would have already i mean its been like what ten days two weeks since the last ones dug themselves out and it took them a while to do that jennifer right which means there could be others wholl need even longer jackson do you really believe that jennifer lookits what dad wants okay jackson and we all know hes the posterchild for mental health these days jennifer what do you expect after what happened to mom and lisa jackson what he says happened jennifer not this shit again jackson all im saying is the three of them were in the carin a hummer for christs sake they had guns how does that situation turn against you thats an honest question id love to know how you go from that to jennifer just shut up jackson whatever the siblings look away from one another jackson wanders the graves to the right almost offstage then slowly turns and walks back to their greatgrandmothers grave while he does jennifer checks her gun aims it at the ground in front of the tombstone and returns it to its perch on her hip jackson steps over his shotgun and squats beside the grave jackson did dad even know her jennifer his grandmother i dont think so didnt she die before he was born like years before when grandpa jack was a kid jackson i guess i dont remember dad and i never talked about that kind of stufffamily history jennifer im pretty sure he never met her jackson great another pause jennifer you want to know what i keep thinking about jackson do i have a choice jennifer hey fuck you if thats the way youre going to be fuck you jackson im sorry sorry geez jennifer forget it jackson seriously come on im sorry jennifer i was going to say that for like the

jalape√±o peppers jackson yes yes remember grandpa started coughing so hard jennifer his teeth shot out onto moms plate jackson yeah he wipes his eyes hey he stands stares down at the grave is thatwhat is that jennifer what jackson pointing there in the middle see how the grounds jennifer positions her gun setting the stock against her shoulder lowering the barrel and steps around the headstone jennifer show me jackson kneels brings his right hand to within an inch of the ground jennifer not so close jackson you see it right jennifer nods jackson rises and steps back onto his gun almost tripping over it jennifer you might want to cover your ears jennifer fires five times into the earth jackson slaps his hands to either side of his head as dirt jumps up from the grave the noise of the shotgun is considerable a roar that chases its echoes around the inside of the theater theres a fair amount of gunsmoke too so that when jennifer steps back and raises her gun jackson coughs and waves his arms to clear the air jackson holy shit jennifer no sense in doing a halfassed job jackson was it her jennifer i think so something was right at the surface jackson lets hope it wasnt a woodchuck jennifer do you see any woodchuck guts jackson i dont see much of anything he stoops retrieves his shotgun does this mean we can go home jennifer we should probably wait a couple more minutes just to be sure jackson wonderful the two of them stare down at the grave the stage light pops off stage manager siblings rightwhat else can i tell you about the town i dont imagine latitude and longitude are much use im guessing itll be more helpful for me to say that new york citys about an hour and a half south of here hartford an hour and a half east and the hudson river twenty minutes west in an average year its hot in the summer cold in the winter theres enough snow to give the kids their fair share of snow days you can have thunderstorms so fierce they spin off tornadoes like tops at one time this was ibm country that and people who commuted to blue collar jobs in the city at places like con ed that changed twice the first time in the early nineties when ibm collapsed and sent a host of middleaged men and women scrambling for work the second time was after when all the affluent folks whod suddenly decided manhattan was no longer their preferred address realized that for the same amount of money you were spending on your glorified walkin closet you could be the owner of a substantial home on a reasonable piece of property in place that was still close enough to the city for you to have a manageable commute coming after the long slowdown in new home construction that had followed ibms constriction this sent real estate prices up like a fourth of july rocket gentrification i guess youd call it what it meant was that your house significantly appreciated in value in what seemed like no more than a monthit wasnt overnight no not that fast but fast enough i reckon were talking thirty forty fifty percent climbs sometimes higher depending on how close you were to a metronorth station or the taconic parkway it also meant a boom in the construction of new homesluxury models mostly they didnt quite achieve the status of mcmansions but they were too big on the outside with too few rooms on the inside and crowded too close to their neighbors with a front yard that was just about big enough to be worth the effort it was going to cost you to yank the lawnmower to life every other saturday if you owned any significant amount of property the temptation to cash in on all the contractors making up for lost time was nigh irresistible that farm that hadnt ever been what youd call a profitmachine and that had been siphoning off more money that it gave back for more years than you were comfortable admitting became a dozen fifteen parcels of land a new little community with a name something like orchard hills that you could tell yourself was an acknowledgement of its former occupant what this expansion of houses meant was that when the zombies started showing up in significant numbers they found family after family waiting for them in what must have seemed like enormous lunchboxes from the balcony another spotlight snaps on its tightly focused beam picking out mary phillips standing in front of the orchestra pit although she faces the audience her gaze is unfocused she cannot be thirty her red hair has been cut recentlypoorly practically hacked off in places where it traces the contours of her skull and only partially touched in others where it sprouts in tufts and a couple of long strands that suggest its previous style the light freckles on her face are disturbed by the remnants of what must have been an enormous black eye which has faded to a motley of green and yellow and a couple of darker spots radiating out from her right eye she is wearing a white dress shirt whose brownish polka dots appear to have been applied irregularly even haphazardly a pair of almostnew dark jeans and white sneakers clumped with mud she keeps her hands at her sides in tight fists mary i was in the kitchen boiling water for pasta wed had a gas delivery a couple of weeks beforeits funny everythings falling to piecesthis was after the first outbreak had been contained and all the politicians and pundits were saying yes wed had a close call but the worst was pastwhat had happened in india asia what was happening in south americanone of that was going to happen here no matter that there were reports the thingswhat we were calling the eaters because zombies sounded too ridiculousthe eaters had been sighted in a dozen different places from maine to california none of them previously affected you heard storiesmy nextdoor neighbor barbara odenkirkshe was the hr director for an ad agency in manhattan and she commuted to the city every day took the train from beacon the last time we talked she told me that there were more of them the eaters along the sides of the tracks every trip she said none of the guys on the train acted particularly concernedif an eater came too close to a moving train it didnt end well for them i asked her about the places alongside the tracks what about them the towns and cities and housesid taken that same ride i dont know how many times when ted and i first started seeing one another and i remembered all the houses you saw sitting off in the woods oh barbara said she was sure the local police were on top of the situation they werent of course not like barbara thought i dont know why when that soccer game in cold spring was attackedwe were so surprised so shocked so outraged we should have been packing our cars cramming everything we could fit into our volvos and bmws and heading out of town tires screaming where im not sure maybe north up to the adirondacksi heard the situation isnt as bad there even the catskills might have been better but the gas truck pulled into the driveway the way it did every six months and the power was on more than it was out and we could drive to shop ritewhere if the shelves were stocked thinner than wed ever seen them and the butcher case was empty not to mention the deli and fish counters we could fill our baskets with enough of the foods we were used to for us to tell ourselves that the president was right we were through the roughest part of this and almost believe it ted had bought a portable generator when the first outbreak was at its height and it looked as if orlando would be overrun everyone else was buying whatever guns they could lay their hands on and heres my husband asking me to help him unload this heavy box from the back of the car he was uptighti think he was expecting me to rake him over the coals for not having returned from walmart with an armful of rifles i wasnt angry if anything i was impressed with his foresight i wasnt especially concerned about being armedat that point i still believed the police and national guard were capable of dealing with the eaters and if they werent i was surrounded by neighbors who were two steps away from forming their own militia the blackouts thoughwe were lucky the big one only lasted here until later that same night according to npr there were places where the lights were out for a week ten days but there were shorter outages every few days most no more than five or ten seconds a few a solid couple of hours having the generatornot to mention the big red containers of gas i had no idea how ted had obtained rationing was already in effect and most gas stations were pretty serious about itthat generator gave me a feeling of security no machine gun could have matched to tell the truth i was more worried by teds insistence that he could hook it up himself being in it does not give you the magical ability to master any and all electrical deviceshow many times had i said that to him especially when sean reynolds two houses over is an electrician who loves helping out with this kind of stuff but no hes fully capable of doing this which is what hed said about the home entertainment system he tripped half the circuit breakers in the house setting up what was i supposed to do i made sure to unplug the computers though as well as the entertainment center somehowwith a lot more cursing than i was happy with the kids hearing from their fatherhe succeeded which is why on that particular afternoon i was standing at the kitchen stove waiting for a pot of water to boil robbie had asked for mac and cheese again and i wasnt inclined to argue with her since brian would eat it too and we had more than enough boxes of it stacked in the pantry it was the organic kind that only needed a little bit of milk added to make the sauce which i thought was more economical although the stuff had cost more to begin with so wheres the sense in that the power had gone out an hour earlier and while we tried to use the generator prudently starting it up now didnt seem especially extravagant i waited until i was ready to start dinner then ran out onto the back porch down the stairs and under the porch to where ted had installed the generator when ted was home the moment he heard that lock click he dropped whatever he was doing to dash into the kitchen and asked if id made sure it was safe to go outside no matter what i replied hed insist on checking himselfas if he could see better through his glasses than i could with vision i got that it was a guy thing and in its own way i suppose it was kind of sweet really thoughunless there was an eater standing outside the door i didnt think i had anything to worry about they werent much for runningmost of them had trouble walking okay high school track was ten years and two kids in my past but i was still in good enough shape from chasing after those kids to leave ted eating my dust granted my husbands idea of exercise was putting away the dishes the point is i wasnt concerned about being caught by an eater from what id heard on the radio they were most dangerous in large numbers when they could trap you sure there were woods at the edge of the backyard that couldve hidden a decentsized group of them but i was fairly confident my wellarmed neighbors would mow the lot of them down the second they staggered into the open we were pretty anal about checking the tree line i tried to do it at least once an hour usually on the hour when the hall clock played its electronic version of the westminster chimes but some of the neighbors were at their windows every fifteen or twenty minutes matt odenkirk had a pair of highpowered binocularsthey looked like they cost a bundleand he would stand on his back porch staring into the woods for minutes at a time it was as if he was certain the eaters were out there doing their best to blend in with the foliage and all he needed was to catch one of them moving to reach for the equallyexpensivelooking rifle balanced against the railing and be the hero of the neighborhood which never happened i dont think he fired that gun oncei dont think it was in his hands whenwhen theywhen he the generator started no problem i was out and in the house almost before the kids realized i turned on the stove light and filled a pot with water from the coolerwhich always drove ted crazy thats for drinkingonly hed say use the water from the filter jugs for cooking but our water tasted funny im sorry it did and no matter how many times you passed it through those jugs it was like drinking from a sulfur spring what do you mean ted wouldhed insist it tastes fine okay id say then you can drink it which he would of course to prove his point when he wasnt home thoughon a day like today when hed driven in to ibm because they were openi cant imagine what they could have been doing what business they could have been conducting with everything the way it wason a day like today we used the bottled water for cooking i lit the burner set the pot on it and switched on the transistor radio usually i kept the radio quiet because who knew what the news was going to be today granted npr wasnt as bad as any of the tv channels which as things had deteriorated in florida and alabama had taken to broadcasting their raw footage so that when mobile was overrun you saw all the carnage in color and up close and personal but npr had sent a reporter to mobile and when the national guard lines collapsed she was caught on the wrong sidetrapped inside a car the eaters got her and you heard pretty much everything first shes saying oh no oh please as they pound on the car windows then the windows shatter she screams and you can hear the eaters the slap of their hands on the upholstery as they grab at her and miss the rip of the reporters clothes where they catch her and their voicesi know theres a lot of debate about the sounds they make whether theyre expressions of coherent thought or just some kind of muscle spasm but i swear i listened to that broadcast all the way through and those were voices they were saying something i couldnt make out what because now the reporter was shrieking emptying her lungs in panic and pain i thought that was as bad as it would getas it could getbut i was wrong there was a soundit was the sound a drumstick makes when you twist it off the thanksgiving turkey a long tearing followed by a poponly it was wet the reporters voice went from high to low from scream to moan and that moanit was awful it was what comes out of you the moment you set one foot into death and feel it tugging the rest of you after the restone of the eaters figured out how to open one of the car doors whatever the reporter was wearing rasped on the seat as she was dragged out her moan rising a little as she realized this was it and then there was a noise like the rest of that thanksgiving bird being torn apart in all directions this succession of ripping and snapping and then you hear the eaters feeding stuffing pieces of the reporter into their mouths grunting with pleasure at the taste it robbie was old enough to understand what was on the radio and even brian picked up on more than you expected i didnt want to expose them to something like that as it was they heard too much from the other kids in the neighborhood especially the mcdonald girls alice their mother was one of those parents who likes to pretend theyre treating their kids with what they call respect when really all theyre doing is exposing them to all kinds of things theyre too young to handle a parenta mother isnt supposed tothats not your job your jobyour duty your sacred dutyit is your sacred duty to protect those children to keep them safe no matter whatyou have to protect them no matter well i was with the generator running i could let them watch a dvd which had gone from a daily occurrencesometimes twicedailyto a treat like going to the movies had been when i was their age they were so thrilled robbie was willing to sit down to the incredibles which brian adored but didnt do anything for her so with the two of them safely seated in front of the tv i was safe to turn on the radio low and try to catch up with what news i could as the water came to a boil and you know the news wasnt bad i wouldnt call it good exactly but the national guard seemed to be making progress theyd held onto orlando although apparently disney world was the worse for it and had caught a significant number of the eaters on one of the major highwaysi cant remember the number it may have been highway where theyd brought in the air power let the planes drop bombs on the eaters until they were in so many microscopic pieces given what we learned about them in the weeks after this was about the worst thing that could have happened since it spread bits of them and their infection to the four winds but at the time it sounded like a step forward there was talk of retaking mobile a team of navy seals had rescued a group of survivors holed up in city hall and a squad of special forces had made an exploratory journey into the city that had brought them to within sight of the harbor of course the powersthatbe are going to tell you that things are better than they are but i was willing to believe them i heard the truck pull up outside heard the slow rumble of its engine the squeal and hiss of its air brakes i noticed it but i wasnt especially concerned the rosses had sold their house across the street to a couple from the city who supposedly had paid them almost a million dollars for it the news made our eyes goggle ted and i spent a giddy couple of hours imagining how we might spend our million once we went online to check housing prices in the adirondacks though all our fantasies came crashing down up north a million was the least youd pay for a place not even half the size of ours we knew canada had closed the border but we looked anyway with the state of the us dollar it was more like million for the same undersized house it appeared we would be staying where we were and wed have new neighbors whose moving truck had arrived sometimes i think about that driver i dont know anything about himor her it could have been a woman although for some reason i always picture a man not a kid someone in his fifties maybe kind of heavyset with a crew cut that doesnt hide the gray in his hair hes been around long enough to have seen all kinds of crises which is why he doesnt panic keeps working through this one no one else at the delivery company wants to make the drive upstate with him risk the wilds to the north but hes happy to leave the city for a day everybodys on edge there are soldiers and heavily armed police clustered at all the docks the airports the train stations the bus terminals everyone who arrives in the city is supposed to be examined by a doctor flanked by a pair of men who keep the lasersights of their pistols centered on the travelers forehead for the duration of the exam the slightest cause for concernfever swollen and tender glands discolored tongueis grounds for immediate quarantine protest and those men to either side of the doctor are expressly authorized to put a pair of bullets in your head whats worse is with the police largely off the streets groups of ordinary citizens have taken it on themselves to patrol the city for eaters theyve given themselves license to stop and question anyone they consider suspicious and if you ask what gives them the right theyll be only too happy to show you the business ends of their assorted pistols and rifles theres been at least one major shootout between two of these patrols each of whom claimed they thought the other were eaters cops had to be pulled off port duty to bring it under control which they did by shooting most of the participants i cant imagine anything happened to the driver while he was in the city my guess is he passed through the checkpoints and was on his way without a hitch it was a nice early fall morning the air cool but not cold the leaves on the verge of losing their green the sun bright but not oppressive maybe he had the radio on was listening to one of the am stations out of the city he heard the news out of florida and thought i knew it he decided to take the next exit stop at a dunkin donuts for a celebratory coffee and a boston cream as he steered into the parking lot maybe he noticed the absence of any other cars or maybe he saw the lights on in the donut shop and assumed hed arrived during a lull in business he parked the truck climbed down from the cab and walked toward the glass door there are times i see him striding up to the counter his eyes on the racks of donuts on the wall opposite him not aware of anything unusual until he sees that all the racks are empty in what feels to him like slowmotion he turns to the tables to his right and takes in the floor slick with blood the remains of the last patrons scattered across the tables then i think thats ridiculoustheres no way he would not have seen all of that right away the second he swung open the door he would have smelled it chances are he wouldnt have had to go that farhe would have seen the blood splashed across the windows and immediately turned around either waywhether he bolts out of the place or walks away without going inhe would be distracted shocked by what hes almost seen maybe the closest hes been to something like this has been an image on the tv its the reason he doesnt pick up on the feet dragging across the tarmac until the eater is out from around the front of the truck and practically on him the drivers eyes bulge if hes never been this close to such carnage you can be sure hes never had an eater lurching towards him either his feet catch on one another and he trips which causes the eater to trip and fall on top of him for one horrifying moment hes under the thing under that stink the teeth clacking in his ear as it tries to take a bite out of him those hands pawing at him he drives his right elbow back and up into its face fireworks of pain burst in his arm but the eater rolls off him he scrambles to his feet kicking at the eaters hands as they try to drag him down again and climbs up and into the trucks cab maybe he jumps when the eater slaps the door almost drops the keys his fingers cant fit into the ignition the eater pounds the door throws itself against it actually makes the truck rock eversoslightly the key slides into place the engine turns over and the driver grinds the gears putting the truck into first he speeds out of that parking lot so fast the rear end of the truck bashes a telephone pole throwing open one of the rear doors and tumbling a couple of plastic crates out onto the road his foot doesnt leave the gas pedal let them take it out of his pay his heart is hammering his hands trembling on the wheel if he smokes hes desperate for a cigarette if he quit he wishes he hadnt if he never has he wishes hed started it wouldnt have been until that dunkin donuts was a good thirty forty minutes in his rearview mirror that the driver would have felt his right elbow throbbing when he glanced down he saw blood on the seat and floor he turned his arm over his stomach squeezed at the torn skin bright with blood the pair of broken teeth protruding just above the joint his foot relaxed on the gas the truck slowed to the point it was barely moving his vision constricted to a tunnel he wondered if he was about to faint he took the wheel with his right hand reached around with his left and felt for the jagged edges of the eaters teeth the blood made them slippery hard to keep hold of he dug his fingers into his skin seeking purchase but that only squeezed out more blood there was no choice he had to stop he clicked on the hazards steered to the shoulder and set the brake he did not turn off the engine he leaned over and slid the first aid box out from under his seat his fingers slipped on the catch once he had it open he found the bottle of sterile saline and the stack of gauze bandages he sprayed half the bottle over his elbow unwrapped a couple of bandages and wiped his skin there was a pair of tweezers in the box despite his shaking hand he succeeded in tugging one and then the other tooth from his arm their extraction caused more bleeding he dropped the tweezers on the floor next to the teeth and emptied the remainder of the saline on his elbow there were enough gauze pads left for him to wipe his elbow off and improvise a bandage using the roll of surgical tape no one really understood what brought the eaters out of the ground up off their tables in the morgues and funeral homes in the first place there was all kinds of speculation some of it ridiculoushell was full ted and i had a good laugh over that onesome of it more plausible but still theoreticalnpr had on a scientist from the cdc who talked about a kind of superbacteria like a nasty staph infection that could colonize a human host in order to gain more flesh to consume although that seemed like a lot for a single microorganism to accomplish besides none of the eaters the government had captured showed the slightest response to any of the antibiotics they were injected with i wondered if it was a combination of causes several bacteria working together but ted swore that was impossible because the it thing made him an expert in bacteriology too what we did know was that if an eater got its teeth in you even if you escaped becoming its next meal you were finished all the same it just took longerbetween thirty minutes and fortyeight hours the initial symptoms were a raging fever swollen and tender glands and a tongue the color of old meat in short order these were followed by hallucinations convulsions and death anywhere from five minutes to two hours after your heart had ceased beating your bodyreanimated was the technical term it was incurable and if you presented to your doctor or a hospital er with the telltale signs you were taken as fast as possible to a hospital room hooked up to monitors for your heart rate and blood pressure and strapped onto a bed if there was an experimental cure making the rounds that day it would be tested on you when it didnt work you would be offered the services of the clergy and left for the inevitable an armed guard was stationed outside your door after the monitors had confirmed your death he would enter the room unholster his pistol and make sure you didnt return at first the guards were given silencers but people complained said they felt better hearing the gunshot knowing they were safe i dont know how much of this the driver knew but im guessing hed heard most of it which is why he didnt take himself to the nearest hospital as soon as he realized what had happened to him instead he switched off the hazards released the brake and headed back out onto the road it could be he was thinking he had to make this last delivery while he could but i doubt it he was already dead his body simply needed to catch up to that fact his mind thoughhis mind was not having any of this as far as his mind was concerned hed scraped his arm that was all hardly enough to have turned him into one of those things and if he went on with this day the way hed intended everything would be fine if he had to roll down his window because the cab had grown so hot he checked to be sure he hadnt turned the heater on high he must be fighting off the cold that was making the rounds at work that same cold must be what was causing the skin under his jaw to feel so sore the temptation to tilt the rearview mirror so he could inspect his tongue must have been almost too much to resist if the driver heard anything moving in the back of the truck he probably assumed it was more of the plastic crates come loose maybe a piece of furniture that had broken the straps securing it of course by then his fever would have ignited so the eaters could have banged around the inside of that container for the hours it took him to complete what should have been a sixtyminute trip and i doubt he would have noticed or the sounds might have registered butyou know how it is when youre that sick youre aware of whats going on around you but theres a disconnectit fails to mean what it should how else do you explain what led this guy to drive a large moving truck full of eaters into the middle of a neighborhoodinto the middle of our neighborhoodmy neighborhood the place where i lived with my husband and my kids my girl and my boyhow else do you explain someone fucking up so completely so enormously thats rightthe truck that came to a stop outside the house as i watched bubbles forming at the bottom of the pot of water i was heating was fullit was packed with eaters dont ask me how many and no i dont know how they got in there id never heard of anything like that before maybe the things were chasing someone who climbed into the back of the truck thinking the eaters wouldnt be able to follow them and was wrong maybe the eaters started as a group of infected who were in the same state of denial as the driver and wanted to hide themselves until they recoveredwhich of course they didnt maybe they didnt jump into the truck all at the same time maybe a few were in pursuit of a meal a few more were looking to hide and a few others thought theyd found a cool place to escape the sun as the fever soared within him his neck ached so bad swallowing became agony his tongue swelled in his mouth the driver must have let the truck slow to a stop over and over again leaning his head on the steering wheel for whatever comfort its lukewarm plastic could provide there would have been plenty of opportunities for eaters to hitch a ride with him i dont know what that mans fate was whether he died the moment he set the parking brake or opened the door and stepped down from the cab to let his customers know their furniture had arrived or if the eaters figured out the door handle and dragged him from his seat but i hope they got to him first i hope he found himself in the middle of a group of eaters and had consciousness left to understand what was about to happen to him i hopei pray i get down on my knees and plead with god almighty that those things ripped him apart while his heart was still beating i hope they stripped the flesh from his arms and legs i hope they jammed their fingers into him and rooted around for his organs i hope they bit through his ears the way you do a tough piece of steak i hope he suffered i hope he felt pain like no one ever felt before thats why i spend so much time imagining him so that his death can be as realas vividto me as possible i the first bubbles had lifted themselves off the bottom of the pot and drifted up through the water to burst at the surface on the radio the report about the special forces in mobile had ended and the anchor was talking about sightings of eaters in places like bangor carbondale and santa cruz which the local authorities were writing off as hysteria but at least some of which the anchor said there was disturbing evidence were true in which case they represented a new phase in what he called the reanimation crisis from the living room brian yelped and said scary which he did when something on the screen was too much for him robbie said its okayvis gonna get them out watch one of those grace notes your kids sound that makes you catch your breath its so unexpected so pure there was a knock at the front door it sounded like a knock when i rewind it and play it again in my mind it still sounds like a knock no matter how i try to hear it otherwise none of the descriptions of the eaters mentioned anything about knocking besides i hadnt heard anyones gun going off which i fully expected would announce the arrival of eaters in our neck of the woods of course this was because everyone was watching the treeline behind the houses i realize how ridiculous it sounds how unforgivably stupid but it never occurred to any of us that the eaters might walk right up to our front doors and knock on them ori dont knowmaybe we were aware of the possibility but assumed there was no way a single eater let alone a truckload of them could appear in the middle of the street without someone noticing i left the pot with the wisps of steam starting to curl off the water and walked down the front stairs to the door at the top of the stairs i thought it might be ted home from work but on the way down i decided it couldnt be him because he wouldnt have bothered knocking would he it had to be a neighbor probably the mcdonald girls come to ask if robbie wanted to go out and play with them they were forever doing things like that showing up five minutes before dinner and asking robbie to play with themwhich the second she heard their voices robbie naturally was desperate to do i tried to compromise told robbie she could go out for a little while after she was done with her food or invited the mcdonald girls to join us for dinner but robbie would insist she wasnt hungry or the mcdonald girls would say they had already eaten or were going to have pizza later when their father brought it home at which robbie would ask why we couldnt have pizza which brian would hear and start chanting pizza pizza pizza sometimes i let robbie run out and kept a plate warm for her let her eat with ted and me when he got home which she loved being at the table with mommy and daddy and no little brother sometimes though i told the mcdonald girls to return in half an hour roberta was sitting down to her dinnerand prepared myself for the inevitable storm of protests i hadnt made up my mind what my decision this time would be but my stomach was clenching i turned the lock twisted the doorknob and pulled the door open they say that time slows down in moments of crisis for some people maybe it does for me swinging that door in was like hitting the fastforward button on the dvd player when the images on the screen advance so fast they appear as separate pictures one moment im standing with the door in my hand and a trio of eaters on the front step theyre women about my age i thinkthe one nearest me is missing most of her face except for her right eye which is cloudy and blue and looks as if its a glass eye thats been scuffed im staring at bare bone adorned with tatters and shreds of muscle and skin her mouthher teeth part and i have the absurd impression shes about to speak to me the next moment im scrambling up the stairs backwards i could leap them three at a timei have in the pastbut theres no way im turning my back on the figures who have entered the house the pair behind the faceless one dont appear nearly as desiccated their skin is bluegray and their faces show no expression but compared to whats raising her right foot to climb the stairs after me theyre practically normal the moment after that im in the kitchen one hand reaching for the handle of the pot of water which hasnt come to full boil yet behind me i can hear the stairs shifting under the eaters weight i can smell themgod everything ive heard about the way the things smell is true i want to call to the kids tell them to get in here with me but its all i can do not to vomit that second the second my fingers are closing around the handlethats the one i return to when i replay the three minutes it took my life to disintegrate i focus on me in the kitchen i cant remember how i got there i mean i know how i went from the stairs to the kitchen i dont know why once i reached the top of the stairs it would have been easy enough to haul myself to my feet and run into the living room to robbie and brian we could havei could have shoved the couch out from the wall used it to delay the eaters while we ran for the back dooror even around them back down the stairs and out the front door or into the downstairs rec room we could have barricaded ourselves in the garage weinstead i ran for the kitchen i realize i must have been thinking about a weapon i must have been searching for something to defend myselfus with and the pot on the stove must have been the first thing that occurred to me this has to be what made me choose the kitchen but i cant remember it all i have is me on the stairs and then my fingers curling around that piece of metal which isnt in my hand anymore its lying on the kitchen floor and miss skullfaces right eye has sagged downwards because the pot has collapsed her cheek where it struck it the hot water doesnt appear to have had any affect on her although a couple of the pieces of flesh dangling from her face have fallen onto her blouse shes moving towards me fast her hands outstretched and i see that shes missing two of the fingers on her left hand the ring and pinkie and i wonder if she lost them trying to prevent whoever it was from tearing off her face the next thing im on the floor on my back which is numb my head is swimming across the kitchen tiles from me miss skullface struggles to raise herself from her back at the time i dont know whats happened but i realize now the eaters rush carried us into the wall stunning us both the other eaters are nowhere to be seen and then im on the other side of the kitchen island which ive scooted around on my butt im driving the heel of my left foot straight into the eaters face the shock of the impact traveling through the sole of my sneaker up my leg i feel as much as hear the crunch of bone splintering im as scared as ive ever been but the sensation of the eaters face breaking under my foot sends a rush of animal satisfaction through me although im intent on the web of cracks spreading out from the sudden depression where miss skullfaces nose and cheeks used to be im aware that her companions are not in the kitchen i mustif i havent before i must understand that the other eaters have left miss skullface to deal with me and turned in search of easierof thei know i pull myself off the floor and im pretty sure i kick the same spot on the eaters face with the toe of my sneaker because afterwards its smeared with what i think are her brains what i remember next is to the front rear left and right of the theater the air is full of screaming at first the sound is so loud so piercing that its difficult for anyone in the audience to do anything more than cover her or his ears mary raises her hands to either side of her head it does not appear that the stage manager does even as the screams climb the register from terror to pain muffled by skin and bone the screams resolve themselves into a pair of voices it is hard to believe that such noises could issue from the throats of anything human they seem more like the shrieks of an animal being vivisected as they continue for four five six secondsan amount of time that under other circumstances would pass almost without notice but that with the air vibrating like a plucked guitar string stretches into hoursit becomes possible to distinguish the screams as a single word tortured to the edge of intelligibility made the vessel for unbearable pain mommy the screaming stopscut off mary removes her hands from her ears hesitantly as if afraid her childrens screams might start again mary thatsthere aretheythere are somei dontthere are some things a mother shouldnt have to see all right my parentsiwhen i was growing up our next door neighbors oldest son died of leukemia and my mother said no parent should outlive their children which is true i used to think it was the worst thing that could happen to you as a parent especially of small children but i was wrongi wastheyoh they had them in their teeth now mary screams head thrown back eyes closed hands clutching her shirt she opens her mouth and pours forth a wail of utter loss when her scream subsides to a low moan her head drops forward she brings her hands to her head runs one over it while the other winds one of the long strands of her hair around itself from the front of the theater marys voice speaks but from the echoey quality of the words its clear this is a recording marys voice that second the second my fingers are closing around the handlethats the one i return to when i replay the three minutes it took my life to disintegrate i focus on me in the kitchen i cant remember how i got there i mean i know how i went from the stairs to the kitchen i dont know why once i reached the top of the stairs it would have been easy enough to haul myself to my feet and run into the living room to robbie and brian we could haverobbie and brian i didnt want to expose them to something like that a parenta mother isnt supposed tothats not your job your jobyour duty your sacred duty is to protect those children to keep them safe no matter whatweinstead i ran for the kitchen i realize i must have been thinking about a weapon i must have been searching for something to defend myselfus with and the pot on the stove must have been the first thing that occurred to me this has to be what made me choose the kitchen but i cant remember it you have to protect them no matter the recording stops the spotlight snaps off and mary is gone lost to the darkness slowly the stage manager comes to his feet once he is up he looks away from the audience towards the willow behind him he takes a deep breath before turning towards the audience again stage manager heres the problem when you sign up for this jobwhen youre cast in the part if you likeyoure told your duties will be simple and few keep an eye on things not that theres much you can donot that theres anything you can do reallybut there isnt much that needs doing truth to tell most of the business of daytoday existence takes care of itself runs ahead on the same tracks its used for as long as thereve been people good things occurtoo few i suppose most would sayand bad things as wellwhich those same folks would count too numerous i knowbut even the very worst things happen now as im afraid they always have oh sure could be you can give a little nudge here or there try to make sure this person wont be at work on a june morning thatll be full of gunfire or steer the cop in the direction of that house shes had a nagging suspicion about but mostly youre there to watch it all take place then something like thisthen this these zombies folk getting up who should be lying downit overtakes you sweeps across the world and your part of it likelike i dont know what something i dont have words for you do the best you canwhat you can which mostly consists of putting on a brave face and not turning your eyes away from whatever horrors in front of you although there may be opportunities for more direct action through his jacket the stage manager pats his gun stage manager you try to maintain some semblance of a sense of humor which is not always as hard as maybe it should be theres something to the old saw about horror and humor being flip sides of the same coin an idiot takes his arm off with his chainsaw trying to play heroi grant you its pretty grim fodder for laughs but you make do with whats to handso to speak a situation like this though like this poor woman and her childrenthose childreni know what she saw when she ran into that living room i know what that is on her shirt and how it got there i canti dont have the faintest idea what im supposed to do with that knowledge i could tell you i suppose but to what end you know what those thingsthose eaters thats not a bad word is ityou know what they did to that little girl and that little boy theres no need for the specifics maybe youd rather hear about the scene that greeted mary when she fled her house in horror or maybe youve guessed that too her neighbors houses overrun pretty much without a single shot being fired this is the beginning of the second phase of the zombie troublewhat did that newscaster call it the reanimation crisis from something people were watching on their tvs or seeing outside the windows of their trains zombies become something thats waiting for you when you go to get in your car that clatters around your garage that thumps on your door situation like this where folks have known the worlds going to hell and been preparing themselves for itwhich mostly means emptying their bank accounts accumulating as many guns as walmartll sell themyoud expect that all that planning would count for something that those zombies never would have made it up marys front walk that one or the other of her neighbors would have noticed what was tumbling out the back of that delivery truck and started shooting thered be a lot of noise a lot of mess possibly a close call or two but everything would turn out well in the end mary would be home with her kids her neighbors would be patting themselves on the backs with a certain amount of justifiable pride and at least one zombie outbreak would have been contained instead marys the only one to escape alive which she accomplishes by running screaming out of her house up the street and out onto route where shes struck by a red pickup truck driven by an eighteenyearold girl who received it as a birthday present from her parents last month mary avoids being hit headon which wouldve killed her but shes tossed to the side of the road to her credit the girl stops reverses and leaves the truck to see to the woman who collided with it actually its a risky movefor all the girl knows she couldve knocked down a zombie marys pretty seriously concussed but its clear to the girl she hails from one of the big houses on the side streetthe houses from which a few zombies are emerging doused with blood the girl doesnt waste any time she hustles mary into her truck and literally burns rubber racing away the girlwho deserves a name shes beth driscollbeth takes mary into the center of goodhope crossing to the new walkin emergencycare place and stays with her as the doctor examines her with an openly worried expression on his face marys in what hes going to call a fugue statelike being part of the way into a comaand shes never going to surface from it the doctordr bartram for the recordtries to arrange for an ambulance to transfer her to one of the local hospitals but all at once the ambulances are very busy by the time he considers driving her himself the police will have told everyone to stay off the roads when those same police start stumbling through the front doors with wounds of their own for the doc to treat mary will be placed on a cot in one of the hallways and left there beth will check on her as shes able which wont be much because shell be busy helping the doc and his staff with the injured after the medical facilities are transferred to st pats church hall marys installed there given a futonbed and a molded plastic chair and a garbage bag full of assorted sweatpants tshirts underwear and socks beth tends to her as she can ted doesnt show up looking for his wife in fairness to him thats due to his having parked in front of his house about two minutes after beth sped off with mary once he realized what was taking place he bolted his car for the house whose front door hed noticed open and which had him dreading the worst the worst met him at the door in the form of the pair whod devoured his children one of whom was holding brians stuffed frog which was dark with blood you may consider it a kindness that ted died without seeing what was left of his beloved daughter and son upstairs mary can eat and drink use the toilet if you take her to it speak to her and shell bob her head in your direction there are times after beths sat with her for an hour maybe read to her from the bible which beth secretly hopes might produce a miraculous cure the girl looks at mary halfslumped in her chair or reclining on her bed and wonders if mary isnt lucky to be like this safe from the chaos thats descended on the world she has no ideashe can have no idea that deep within marys psyche shes standing at that stove for the tenthousandth time watching a pot full of water begin to boil waiting for her children to start screaming the stage manager sighs looks up looks down rubs his hands together halfheartedly sighs again stage manager i never finished telling you about the town did i not that it makes much difference at this point but maybe one or two of you are curious once more the stage manager settles himself on the ground against the headstone although he appears to have more trouble finding a comfortable position than previously stage manager all right what more is there to say about goodhope crossing the longerterm history of the town isnt that much different from any other in this neck of the woods there were farms around these parts as far back as the dutch but goodhope crossing as the name suggests owes itself to the railroads in the years after the civil war when track was stitching up the country everywhere you looked three northsouth lines and one eastwest line met one another right here from the orchestra pit a quartet of wooden train whistles sound softly stage manager there was a long low hill to the east of the junction a stream and some flatter land to the west the town was plotted on that axis the poorer folk crowding their small houses together on the hill the better off setting up main street and its larger dwellings on the other side of the stream from those two locations the town spread outward most of the commercial establishments opening on the other side of the hill while the majority of new homes went up on and just off main street lot of irish settled here poles and italians too big catholic population the local church st patricks started on main street and by the turn of the century had moved across the stream to the top of another hill just south of the one most of its parish lived on st pats was part of the archdiocese of new york right before everything fell apart they were the third or fourth largest congregation in the fold interestinglyyou might even say ironicallyenough pretty much the entire surviving population has relocated to the hill which remained a location of more affordable housing control the high ground its what a military strategist will tell you and its a good plan for zombies as much as anything once the halfdozen or so whod staggered up concord street were dealt with and all the dwellings had been checked and doublechecked to be sure they were clear folks started putting up the best barrier they could as fast as they could around the foot of the hill tipping over cars running barbed wire propping up old boxsprings mattresses piling whatever looked as if it might hold a walking corpse at bay long enough for you to have a clear shot at it sofas bureaus bookcases china cabinets from either side of the theater the sounds of men and women grunting furniture creaking atop other furniture stage manager hillary schwabel who used to manage the local true value hardware strung some wires all the way around what people already had christened the wall and hooked them to several of her louder alarms she also hung a dozen motiondetector lights from trees and houses next to the wall things are so sensitive a catll trip them but it beats the alternative as a rule zombies travel in numbers when you see one of them you see ten twenty sometimes as many as fifty a hundred a significant percentage of that group is going to be limber enough to make a try at getting past the walland all it takes is for one of them to succeed grab someone and start biting for you to want to know theyre moving in your direction while theyre still a safe distance away its another myth that they only or mostly move at night their eyesights poortononexistentapparently the ravages death inflicts on the eyes are exacerbated by the process of reanimation although they never stop moving completely if you should have the misfortune to come across them after dark theyre likely to be shuffling their feet practically standing in place no they prefer the light the dawn pouring through the trees sets them going a bright day is practically a guarantee youre going to see some of them all of that said a few of them have been known to travel by night especially if the moon is full and even inching forward a little bit at a time will bring you somewhere eventually better safe than sorry right have you noticed how disasters bring out the clich√©s in droves why is that is the trite and overused that consoling or is it that even though the brain is shortcircuiting it still wants to grasp whats going on so it reaches for whatever tools are at hand no matter how worn and rusted or is the language breaking down along with everything else ive never been what youd call a poet but i have always prided myself on my phrasing on a knack for finding a fit and even memorable form for whatever sentiment im attempting to convey lately thoughlately i swear i sound more and more like a parody of a good ole boy your folksy uncle with his bucket of country wisdom nor is that the worst before everything went down the crapper one of myyou might say duties although i considered it more a responsibility if that distinction means anything to youanyway one of the things i did was to help those whod shuffled off their mortal coils come to grips with their new condition mostly this meant talking with them taking them for a last look at their loved ones about what youd expect in a few cases i let them have one of their days over again which knowing what they knew now tended to be a more unhappy experience than theyd anticipated even after id spoken to them showed them what i could there were a few who refused to walk down the long dark hall to join the ranks of those whod gone before who insisted on remaining in their house or at the spot theyd ceased breathing which was a shame but was allowed for once the dead started to rise thoughfor the one thing death no longer separated what lasted from what didnt instead the two remained bound together as the one began its new existence for another thing the destruction of that second lifeor unlifedidnt allow matters to proceed on their natural course instead well maybe you want to see for yourselves the theaters lights come on their harsh brightness reveals the center aisle side aisles front and rear of the theater crowded with figureswith zombies it appears since the men women and children surrounding the audience bear the familiar signs of decay whatever shock and fear the appearance of so many of them in such proximity engenders however is gradually tempered by their complete lack of movement indeed with the exception of one figure shuffling its way from the very back of the theater up the center aisle the apparent zombies might as well be mannequins stage manager being chained to that body as it stumbles along in the singleminded pursuit of flesh as it finds and kills and consumes that fleshit isnt good for the other part for what i call the sparkit twists it warps it so that when its cut loose this is how it appears mostly a fewi havent worked out the exact numbers but its something on the order of one in a thousand fifteen hundredthey show up hostile violent as if what they last were in life has followed them across its borders theres no talking to them let alone reasoning with them im not certain what they could do to methereve been rumors through the grapevine but you know how that it isbut im not inclined to find out the stage manager rises to his feet withdrawing his revolver from its shoulder holster on the way in a continuous motion he extends his arm sights along the long barrel of the gun and squeezes the trigger the guns boom stuns the air the young man in the brown threepiece suit who is approximately halfway to the stage jerks as the back of his head detonates in a surprisingly solid clump the young man falls against one of the motionless forms in the aisle an old woman wearing a blue dress and a knitted white pullover who barely moves as he slides down her to the floor the stage manager maintains his aim at the young man for five seconds then levels the gun and sweeps it across the theater it is difficult to ascertain whether his eye is on the figures in the aisle the audience in their seats or both unable to locate any further threats he reholsters the pistol he remains standing stage manager thatstheres nothing else i can do it meansi dont like thinking about what it means its a step up from what a fellow like that was butits not a part of the job i relish could be it would be a service to the rest of these folks but i havent got the stomach for it the stage manager lowers himself to the ground the lights dim but not all the way the forms in the aisles remain where they are stage manager once in a whileits less and less but it still happensa regular person finds their way here that was how i had the chance to talk with billy joe royale heofthefamoushomemadenapalm id witnessed his handiwork in actionmust have been the day after the day after that truckload of zombies parked in the middle of mary phillipss neighborhood the number of zombies had increased exponentially the cops had been overrun in most places the national guard who were supposed to be on their way remained an unfulfilled promise those who could had retreated to the parking lot of st pats which since the hill hadnt yet been fortified looked to be the most defensible position i reckon it was at that there wasnt time for much in the way of barriers or boobytraps but those men and womenthere were fortysix of themdid what they could from the right and left of the theater comes a cacophony of gunfire of voices shouting defiance instructions obscenity encouragement of screams it is underscored by a frenzied atonal sawing of the violins it subsides as the stage manager continues to speak but remains faintly audible stage manager in the end though no matter how much ammunition you have if the zombies have sufficient numbers theres little you can hope for aside from escaping to fight another day these folks couldnt expect that much theyd backed themselves against the churchs north wall and the zombies were crowding the remaining three sides exactly how billy joe succeeded in evading the zombies finding his way inside st pats climbing up the belltower and shimming out onto the roofall the while carrying a large cloth laundrybag of threeliter soda bottles full of an extremely volatile mixtureid like to take credit for it but i was down below all my attention focused on the bynow fortytwo defenders staging what i was sure was their updated alamo they were aiming to die bravely and i was not about to look away from that when the first of billy joes sodabottlebombs landed no one myself included knew what had just taken place about twenty feet back into the zombies ranks there was a flash and a clap and an eruption of heavy black smoke something had exploded but none of the men and women could say what or why when the second third fourth and fifth bombs struck in an arc to either side of the first and smoke was churning up into the air and the smell of dead skin and muscle barbecuing was suddenly in everyones nostrils it was clear the cavalry had arrived a couple of guys looked around expecting a humvee with a grenadelauncher on top or an attack helicopter whose approach had been masked by the noise of the fighting the rest were busy taking advantage of the wall of fire the bombs had created which separated the zombies on this side of it from those on the other reducing their numbers from whocouldcounthowmany to a more manageable thirty or forty while they worked on clearing the zombies closest to them billy joe continued to lob bottle after bottle of his fiery concoction dropping some of them into the thick of the zombies holding onto others almost too long so that they detonated over the zombies literally raining fire down on their heads hed stuffed twentythree bottles into that laundry bag and he threw all but one of them the din of the battle rises again accompanied by the pops of a drumstick tapping on a drum and the lower thrum of viols being plucked the pops increase the thrums increase then the violins scream an interruption and all noise stops stage manager that last bomb was what killed him a singleserve coke bottle that remained in his hand past the point of safety it blew off his right arm to the elbow and hurled him flaming from the roof he didnt survive the fall which was just as well since his burning corpse was shot by roughly half the people hed saved stupid but understandable i guess he took longer to show up than id anticipated the better part of a day during which his identity and his actions had been discovered along with the two hundred additional bottles of napalm standing row after row in his parents basement unfortunately he hadnt seen fit to leave the formula but those bombs were a big downpayment on buying those among the living sufficient time to move to the hill and begin the process of securing it thereve been a couple of tries at duplicating his secret mix neither of which ended well from the rear of the theater the faint crump of explosions stage manager as for billy joe stage left a stage light pops on throwing a dim yellow glow over one of the tombstones and billy joe royale who is a very young sixteen his face struggling with its acne a few longish hairs trying to play a goatee on his chin he is dressed in an oversized blue new york giants shirt baggy jeans and white sneakers a backwards baseball cap lifts the blond hair from his forehead which emphasizes the surprise smoothing his features he hooks his thumbs in the pockets of his jeans in what must be an effort at appearing calm cool he sees the stage manager and nods at him the bill of the stage managers hat tilts in reply billy joe so are you like him stage manager who is that billy joe you knowgod stage manager im afraid not billy joe oh oh you arent stage manager im more of a minor functionary billy joe what is that some kinda angel or something stage manager no imi meet people when they show up here help them find their bearings then i

can without leaving the stage billy joe thats it stage manager it is billy joe well no point in delaying the inevitable right stage manager i suppose not billy joe can you tell me one thingbefore i go can you answer one question stage manager i can try billy joe were fucked arent we the stage manager pauses as if weighing his words stage manager theres always a chancei realize how that sounds but theres just enough truth left in it to make it worth saying things could turn around someone could discover a cure whatevers driving the zombies could die outhell it isnt even winter yet a couple weeks of freezing temperatures could thin their numbers significantly or someone could be resistant to their bite to the infection with sixplus billion people on the planet you figure there has to be one person it doesnt affect billy joe do you believe any of that shit stage manager no billy joe yeah he exits stage right stage manager understand its not that i dont want to believe any of it i want to believe all of it all of that shit as my young friend would say but doing so has traveled past the point of hard to the point of no return no thisthis i fear is how the day runs down for the human race its how homo sapiens sapiens departs the scene carried off a bite at a time in the teeth of the undead if there werent so much pain so much suffering in the process you could almost see the humor in it this is the way the world ends not with a bang and not with a whimper but with the bleak gusto of a lowbudget horror movie the stage manager reaches for his flashlight which he shuts off and takes with him as he rises from his seat and walks to the back of the stage he is visible against the bulk of the willow and then the shadows have him the theater lights come up revealing the aisles still full of the dead men women old young most wearing their causes of their several demises they encompass the audience and do not move for fiona and with thanks to john joseph adams acknowledgments
