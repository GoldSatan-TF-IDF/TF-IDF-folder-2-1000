these stories were written over a period of thirteen years beginning with the takamoku joseki and ending with grace notes created especially for this collection for that reason some details about v is life will appear inconsistentsometimes shes driving an omega sometimes her trans am she bought the trans am in at the end of the novel burn marks her dog peppy became part of her life in at the conclusion of bitter medicine the story the maltese cat was originally written in during the bushquayle administration i sometimes write short stories when i am trying to understand a question that doesnt seem to merit a whole novel that was true of settled score where i was wrestling with the issue of personal responsibility unusual settings suggest other stories i once swam for a corporate competition where i was so slow the other swimmers were eating dinner by the time i covered two laps the starting gun and all of us diving at once turned into at the old swimming hole however in the maltese cat i simply wanted to pay my own particular homage to the great master of the hardboiled detective sara paretsky chicago june introduction a walk on the wild side touring chicago with v i warshawski a lone heron spreads its wings and rises from the marsh it circles briefly then heads south disappearing in the shrouding mist a handful of purplenecked ducks continues to nibble at delicacies in the fetid water their families have come here for millennia breaking the journey from canada to the amazon at what we newcomers think of as the south side of chicago the patch of marsh where they rest is small about half a square mile its the sole remains of the wetlands which used to cover the twentyfive miles from whiting indiana north to mccormick place the monstrous convention center that squats next to lake michigan only fifty years ago much of this area including the eightlane highway that connects the south side with the loop was still under water the marsh has been filled in with everything from cyanide to slag with a lot of garbage to give it body the locals call the remaining bit of swamp dead stick pond from the eponymous rotting wood which dots it it appears on no city maps it is so obscure that chicago police officers stationed ten blocks away at the port of chicago havent heard of it nor have officials at the local chicago park district office to find it you have to know a native im not native to this neighborhood nor even to this city i first saw chicago at two on a june morning in i was coming from a small town in eastern kansas to do summer service work here for the presbytery of chicagovolunteer work in a time of great hope great excitement a time when we thought change possible when we believed that if we poured enough energy enough goodwill into the terrible problems of our country we could change those problems for good the vastness of the city at night was overwhelming red flares glowed against a yellow sky followed by mile on mile of unbending lights street lamps neon signs traffic lights flashing police blueslights that didnt illuminate but threw shadows and made the city seem a monster ready to devour the unwary the eye with which i see chicago is always half cocked for alienation and despair because for me the city is a dangerous place where both states are only just below the surface when i fly in at night over the sprawl of lights the feeling of tininess of one lone unknown being recurs i have to scan the landscape trying to pick out the landmarks of the south side that tell me i have a home here friends a lover a life of warmth chicagoans find their own particular warmth where all city dwellers doin their home neighborhood my city holds seventyseven separate neighborhoods each with its own special ethnic or racial makeup each with its own shopping area library police station and schools adults even those whove migrated to the suburbs identify themselves with the neighborhoods of their childhood an irishamerican secretary of mine from south shore used to spit when she talked about irish staff from west side communities she wouldnt even pass along messages from them northsiders dont go south southsiders seldom venture even as far as the loop unless their jobs take them there chicago has two baseball teams to accommodate these parochial needs the cubs play at wrigley field five miles north of the loop the white sox are at comiskey park the same distance south of it chicago s financial district is called the loop because of the elevated train tracks that circle it a southsider i am often sharply criticized at south side events for being a cubs fan i have to explain that my allegiance dates from that summer of when i helped run an innercity program for children the cubs now sold out even in losing seasons were then in such desperate need of an audience that they gave free tickets to our kids on thursdays the sox didnt so i became a cubs fan one thing all chicagoans understand is loyalty especially loyalty to someone who has bribed you for years the definition of an honest chicago politician has been one who stays boughtso my explanation passes muster it was hard to get the kids on the train to go north although they lived four blocks from the el most had never ridden it most had never been downtown even to look at the fabled christmas windows at marshall field once a chicago landmark now a colonial property of a minneapolis conglomerate and none of them had ever been north when they found that they werent going to be killed going to and from wrigley field they started looking forward to the games of all chicago neighborhoods the most interesting to me are those on the far southeast side where dead stick pond fights for survival beneath the rusting sheds of the old steel mills the whole history of the city is contained in four small neighborhoods theresouth chicago south deering pullman and the east side to see the true south side drive south on the dan ryan expressway away from the gold coast with its pricey restaurants and shops the route passes first jackson street where members of chicagos greek community operate restaurants then cermak road which which leads to chinatown then nods at th street which borders the worldrenowned university of chicagomy neighborhoodon its way to the very end of the city at th street where the expressway splits offering the driver the choice between memphis and indiana go east on i toward indiana at rd street the air becomes acrid even with the windows up and the heater or cooler turned off your nose stings and your eyes tear although the steel mills are dead and a third of the south side is out of work enough heavy industry still exists to produce quite a stench in this old manufacturing corridor out the window to your left a hillock dotted with methane flares stretches the mile from rd to th streets this is the city of chicago landfill where we chicagoans send our garbage its almost full and the question of where to dump next is just one of the pressures on dead stick pond the flares keep the garbage from exploding as the bacteria devouring our refuse produce methane when landfill runs under a road as it does here exploding methane can destroy large sections of highway youll also see grain elevators poking up behind the garbage mountain and startlingly the smokestacks from oceangoing freighters the landfill and factories hide a network of waterways from the road at th street twenty miles southeast of the water tower where tourists and chicagoans both like to shop you finally leave the expressway and head east into the heart of the industrial zone on a weekday yours may be the only car among the semis that compete with barges and trains to supply the factories and haul their finished products one hundred thirtieth passes metron one of chicago s few surviving steel mills medusa cement and the scrap corporation of chicago with a mountain of scrap iron to prove it at torrence avenue you run into the giant ford assembly plant their largest in the world there you turn north again crossing the calumet river on an old counterweight vertical lift bridge immediately beyond is nd street a narrow badly paved industrial thoroughfare turn left under the welded tube company billboard and follow the semis west under a sky purplepink with smog marsh grasses and cattails tower above the cars despite a century of dumping that has filled the ground water with more carcinogens than the epa can classify the grasses flourish if you are a birdwatcher and patient you can find meadowlarks and other prairie natives here after a mile nd street intersects with a gravel track stony island to the right it goes up to the cid landfill to the left it runs next to dead stick pond until both of them deadend at lake calumet medusa cement is busy digging at the south end of the marsh on the west the feralloy corporation buildings loom to the east major construction is underway conflicting signs tacked to the trees proclaim the area both a cleanwater project and warn trespassers of hazardous wastes despite warning signs on a good day you can find anything from a pair of boots to a bedstead dumped in dead stick pond fish have been returning to the calumet river and its tributaries since passage of the clean water act in the seventies but the ones that make their way into the pond show up with massive tumors and rotted fins the phosphates in the water further cut the amount of oxygen that can penetrate the surface even so wild birds continue to land here on their migratory routes and chicagoans so poor they live in shanties without running water catch their dinners in the marsh their shacks dot unmarked trails in the swamps the inhabitants have a high mortality rate from esophageal and stomach cancers because of the pollutants in their well water the halfferal dogs around their homes make it hard for any social welfare agent to get a clear idea of their living situation by this point in your tour you are either cold and tired or hot and thirsty either way you would probably like to relax over the native drinka shot and a beer the ideal place to do so is sonnys inn a few miles north retrace your route to torrence avenue and go left or north from th to rd street almost two miles you can see the remains of wisconsin steel once one of the worlds largest producers it has been bankrupt and gone half a decade now at th torrence becomes colfax ride it up to th where youll turn right and drive three blocks to commercial avenue the main drag in south chicago two blocks north to st street and youll find sonnys inn just across the railroad tracks the little bungalows that line the route are well kept up for the most part although a few look pretty hopeless even though almost percent of the population is out of work they still take pride in their homes and yards and the steel city and south chicago banks which hold most of their home mortgages refinance them time and again in themselves these banks make an amazing tourist attraction what other big city in the world can boast of banks so committed to their community that they carry their customers through a prolonged period of trouble it is the gallantry of this old neighborhood that made me take it for the home of my detective v i warshawski the gallantry on the one hand and the racial and ethnic mix that turned it into a volatile soup on the other south chicago was traditionally the first stop for new immigrants in chicago the mills running three shifts a day provided jobs for the unskilled and illiterate the neighborhood has been home to irish polish bohemian yugoslav african and most recently hispanic americans as each new wave of immigrants arrived the previous ones with a fragile toehold on the american dream of universal prosperity would fight to keep the newcomers out the public schools were frequent arenas for real fights girls on south chicago s streets either acquired boyfriends to protect them or were carefully watched day and night by their parents or learned the basics of street fighting to protect themselves even though v i grew up under the watchful eye of her mother her father wanted her to be able to look after herself as a police officer he knew better than most parents what dangers faced a girl who couldnt fight for herself so v i came of age under the shadow of the mills with weekend treks to dead stick pond to watch the herons feed she certainly knows sonnys bar sonnys has stood through all the waves of ethnic and racial change it is a throwback to the days of the late great mayor daley his icons hang on the walls and stand on shelvessigned photos of him with the original sonny signed photos of him with president kennedy campaign stickers yellowing newspaper articles a set of antlers over the bar obscures some of the memorabilia if you go at lunchtime on a weekday your dining companions will represent a complete cross section of the south sideevery racial and ethnic group the city can boast and most of the neighborhood occupations you can get a drink and a sandwich for under five dollars and if you do decide to go native and ask for a shot and a beerthats rye and a draw dont call attention to yourself by asking for brandname whiskeys south chicago doesnt top the citys list of neighborhoods eligible for limited street and sidewalk repair funds you may notice places where pavements have collapsed if you look into the holes youll see cobblestones five feet down because the landfill a century ago didnt hold back the underlying marshes the city jacked itself up and built another layer over the top south chicago is one of the few places where the original substratum remains if you happen to stay at the palmer house downtown you might like to know that it is the only surviving building from the lower city not wanting to dismantle his pride and joy mr palmer raised the whole building up on stilts so that the new higher state street could be paved in front with your shot and your polish dog under your belt youre ready now for more sightseeing driving west two miles to stony island and four blocks south to th street youre now in the pullman historic landmark district george pullman who made his fortune inventing and manufacturing the pullman car built almost two thousand houses to form a model village in the area was supposed to be a showcase for workers partly to keep union agitation low the houses were built in the federal style from clay bricks dug out of nearby lake calumet the pullman company operated all the village stores and provided all services unfortunately the houses rapidly became too expensive for the working population to own discontent with the company over that and other matters came to a head during the depression of the s when many workers lost their jobs the scene of violent confrontations pullman lost a court battle with its workers over the right to own and operate the town when the company pulled out the neighborhood went through numerous economic and ethnic upheavals but in was designated a national landmark since then people have been renovating these beautiful old homes clay from the calumet made better bricks than any available today one of the crimes pullman residents have to guard against is loss of brick garagespeople go on vacation and come home to find their garages have been dismantled brick by brick and carted off to become part of some house under construction in a remote neighborhood instead of taking the expressway north you should slide out of the south side the back way going east to buffalo street past the national shrine to st jude the catholic patron of hopeless or difficult cases drive north on buffalo and suddenly you find its turned into us highway it twists and turns a bit for the next two miles but the us signs are easy to follow at th street youll see the last of the usx works on your right and suddenly youre out of the industrial zone back in quiet residential streets at the corner of st street and south shore drive stands the old south shore country club it was once the meeting place of the wealthy and powerful who lived in the area one of the late mayor daleys daughters was married here the private beach and golf course have been taken over by the chicago park district police horses now occupy the stables and the natives are the ones swinging clubs on the green the clubhouse is a community center now a beautiful place worth a side stop beyond the country club lake michigan springs into view you might pull off at la rabida childrens hospital half a mile up the road to climb the rocks overlooking the lake from this vantage point looking south you can see the industrial quag you just visited to the north the skyline made famous by skidmore edward durrel stone bud goldberg and their friends is silhouetted against the sky back in your car return to us soon it becomes an eightlane highway that takes you the quick way to the loop lake michigan will be your companion the rest of your journey spewing foam against the rocksa barricade put up by men hoping to tame the water it is not a tame lake though underneath the asphalt lies the marsh home to herons for twentyfive thousand years the lake may yet reclaim it grace notes i gabriella sestieri of pitigliano anyone with knowledge of her whereabouts should contact the office of malcolm ranier i was reading the heraldstar at breakfast when the notice jumped out at me from the personal section i put my coffee down with extreme care as if i were in a dream and all my actions moved with the slowness of dream time i shut the paper with the same slow motion then opened it again the notice was still there i spelled out the headline letter by letter in case my unconscious mind had substituted one name for another but the text remained the same there could not be more than one gabriella sestieri from pitigliano my mother who died of cancer in at the age of fortysix who could want her all these years later i said aloud peppy the golden retriever i share with my downstairs neighbor raised a sympathetic eyebrow we had just come back from a run on a dreary november morning and she was waiting hopefully for toast it cant be her father his mind had cracked after six months in a german concentration camp and he refused to acknowledge gabriellas death when my father wrote to inform him of it id had to translate the letter in which he said he was too old to travel but wished gabriella well on her concert tour anyway if he was alive still hed be almost a hundred maybe gabriellas brother italo was searching for her he had disappeared in the maelstrom of the war but gabriella always hoped he survived or her first voice teacher francesca salvini whom gabriella longed to see again to explain why she had never fulfilled salvinis hopes for her professional career as gabriella lay in her final bed in jackson park hospital with tubes ringing her wasted body her last messages had been for me and for salvini this morning it dawned on me for the first time how hurtful my father must have found that he adored my mother but for him she had only the quiet fondness of an old friend i realized my hands around the newspaper were wet with sweat that paper and print were clinging to my palms with an embarrassed laugh i put the paper down and washed off the ink under the kitchen tap it was ludicrous to spin my mind with conjectures when all i had to do was phone malcolm ranier i went to the living room and pawed through the papers on the piano for the phone book ranier seemed to be a lawyer with offices on la salle street at the north end where the pricey new buildings stand his was apparently a solo practice the woman who answered the phone assured me she was mr raniers assistant and conversant with all his files mr ranier couldnt speak with me himself now because he was in conference or court or the john im calling about the notice in this mornings paper wanting to know the whereabouts of gabriella sestieri what is your name please and your relationship with mrs sestieri the assistant left out the second syllable so that the name came out as sistery ill be glad to tell you that if you tell me why youre trying to find her im afraid i cant give out confidential client business over the phone but if you tell me your name and what you know about mrs sestieri well get back to you when weve discussed the matter with our client i thought we could keep this conversation going all day the person youre looking for may not be the same one i know and i dont want to violate a familys privacy but ill be in a meeting on la salle street this morning i can stop by to discuss the matter with mr ranier the woman finally decided that mr ranier had ten minutes free at twelvethirty i gave her my name and hung up sitting at the piano i crashed out chords as if the sound could bury the wildness of my feelings i never could remember whether i knew how ill my mother was the last six months of her life had she told me and i couldntor didnt wish tocomprehend it or had she decided to shelter me from the knowledge gabriella usually made me face bad news but perhaps not the worst of all possible news our final separation why did i never work on my singing it was one thing i could have done for her i didnt have a voice as gabriella put it but i had a serviceable contralto and of course she insisted i acquire some musicianship i stood up and began working on a few vocal stretches then suddenly became wild with the desire to find my mothers music the old exercise books she had me learn from i burrowed through the hall closet for the trunk that held her books i finally found it in the farthest corner under a carton holding my old case files a baseball bat a box of clothes i no longer wore but couldnt bring myself to give away i sat on the closet floor in misery with a sense of having buried her so deep i couldnt find her peppys whimpering pulled me back to the present she had followed me into the closet and was pushing her nose into my arm i fondled her ears at length it occurred to me that if someone was trying to find my mother id need documents to prove the relationship i got up from the floor and pulled the trunk into the hall on top lay her black silk concert gown id forgotten wrapping that in tissue and storing it in the end i found my parents marriage license and gabriellas death certificate tucked into the score of don giovanni when i returned the score to the trunk another old envelope floated out i picked it up and recognized mr fortieris spiky writing carlo fortieri repaired musical instruments and sold or at least used to sell music he was the person gabriella went to for italian conversation musical conversation advice he still sometimes tuned my own piano out of affection for her when gabriella met him hed been a widower for years also with one child also a girl gabriella thought i ought to play with her while she sang or discussed music with mr fortieri but barbara was ten years or so my senior and wed never had much to say to each other i pulled out the yellowed paper it was written in italian and hard for me to decipher but apparently dated from addressing her as cara signora warshawski mr fortieri sent his regrets that she was forced to cancel her may concert i shall of course respect your wishes and not reveal the nature of your indisposition to anyone else and cara signora you should know by now that i regard any confidence of yours as a sacred trust you need not fear an indiscretion it was signed with his full name i wondered now if hed been my mothers lover my stomach tightened as it does when you think of your parents stepping outside their prescribed roles and i folded the paper back into the envelope fifteen years ago the same notion must have prompted me to put his letter inside don giovanni for want of a better idea i stuck it back in the score and returned everything to the trunk i needed to rummage through a different carton to find my own birth certificate and it was getting too late in the morning for me to indulge in nostalgia ii malcolm raniers office overlooked the chicago river and all the new glass and marble flanking it it was a spectacular viewif you squinted to shut out the burntout waste of chicago s west side that lay beyond i arrived just at twelvethirty dressed in my one good suit black with a white crepedechine blouse i looked feminine but austereor at least that was my intention raniers assistantcumreceptionist was buried in danielle steel when i handed her my card she marked her page without haste and took the card into an inner office after a tenminute wait to let me understand his importance ranier came out to greet me in person he was a soft round man of about sixty with gray eyes that lay like pebbles above an apparently jovial smile ms warshawski good of you to stop by i understand you can help us with our inquiry into mrs sestieri he gave my mothers name a genuine italian lilt but his voice was as hard as his eyes hold my calls cindy he put a hand on the nape of my neck to steer me into his office before wed shut the door cindy was reabsorbed into danielle i moved away from the handi didnt want grease on my fivehundreddollar jacketand went to admire a bronze nymph on a shelf at the window beautiful isnt it ranier might have been commenting on the weather one of my clients brought it from france it looks as though it should be in a museum a call to the bar association before i left my apartment told me he was an importexport lawyer various imports seemed to have attached themselves to him on their way into the country the room was dominated by a slab of rose marble presumably a work table but several antique chairs were also worth a second glance a marquetry credenza stood against the far wall the modigliani above it was probably an original coffee mshe glanced at my card againwarshawski no thank you i understand youre very busy and so am i so lets talk about gabriella sestieri daccordo he motioned me to one of the spindly antiques near the marble slab you know where she is the chair didnt look as though it could support my hundred and forty pounds but when ranier perched on a similar one i sat with a wariness that made me think he had them to keep people deliberately off balance i leaned back and crossed my legs the woman at ease id like to make sure were talking about the same person and that i know why you want to find her a smile crossed his full lips again not touching the slate chips of his eyes we could fence all day ms warshawski but as you say time is valuable to us both the gabriella sestieri i seek was born in pitigliano on october thirtieth she left italy sometime early in no one knows exactly when but she was last heard of in siena that february and theres some belief she came to chicago as to why i want to find her a relative of hers now in florence but from the pitigliano family is interested in locating her my specialty is importexport law particularly with italy im no expert in finding missing persons but i agreed to assist as a favor to a client the relativemrs sestieris relativehas a professional connection to my client and now it is your turn ms warshawski ms sestieri died in march my blood was racing i was pleased to hear my voice come out without a tremor she married a chicago police officer in april they had one child me and your father officer warshawski died in now may i have the name of my mothers relative ive known only one member of her family my grandmothers sister who lives here in chicago and am eager to find others actually if they bore any resemblance to my embittered aunt rosa id just as soon not meet the remaining verazi clan you were cautious ms warshawski so you will forgive my caution do you have proof of your identity you make it sound as though treasure awaits the missing heir mr ranier i pulled out the copies of my legal documents and handed them over who or what is looking for my mother ranier ignored my question he studied the documents briefly then put them on the marble slab while condoling me on losing my parents his voice had the same soft flat cadence as when hed discussed the nymph youve no doubt remained close to your grandmothers sister if shes the person who brought your mother to chicago it might be helpful for me to have her name and address my aunt is a difficult woman to be close to but i can check with her to see if she doesnt mind my giving you her name and address and the rest of your mothers family i held out my hands empty i dont know any of them i dont even know how many there are who is my mystery relative what does heshewant he paused looking at the file in his hands i actually dont know i ran the ad merely as a favor to my client but ill pass your name and address along ms warshawski and when hes been in touch with the person im sure youll hear this runaround was starting to irritate me youre a heck of a poker player mr ranier but you know as well as i that youre lying like a rug i spoke lightly smiling as i got to my feet and crossed to the door snatching my documents from the marble slab as i passed for once his feelings reached his eyes turning the slate to molten rock as i waited for the elevator i wondered if answering that ad meant i was going to be suckerpunched over dinner that night with dr lotty herschel i went through my conversation with ranier trying to sort out my confused feelings trying too to figure out who in gabriellas family might want to find her if the inquiry was genuine they surely know shes dead lotty said thats what i thought at first but its not that simple see my grandmother converted to judaism when she married nonno mattiasorry thats gabriellas fathergrandpa matthiasgabriella usually spoke italian to me anyway my grandmother died in auschwitz when the italian jews were rounded up in then my grandfather didnt go back to pitigliano the little town they were from after he was liberatedthe jewish community there had been decimated and he didnt have any family left so he was sent to a jewishrun sanatorium in turin but gabriella only found that out after years of writing letters to relief agencies i stared into my wineglass as though the claret could reveal the secrets of my family there was one cousin she was really close to from the christian side of her family named frederica frederica had a baby out of wedlock the year before gabriella came to chicago and got sent away in disgrace after the war gabriella kept trying to find her but fredericas family wouldnt forward the lettersthey really didnt want to be in touch with her gabriella might have saved enough money to go back to italy to look for herself but then she started to be ill she had a miscarriage the summer of sixtyfive and bled and bled tony and i thought she was dying then my voice trailed away as i thought of that hot unhappy summer the summer the city burst into riotspawned flames and my mother lay in the stifling front bedroom oozing blood she and tony had one of their infrequent fights id been on my paper route and they didnt hear me come in he wanted her to sell something which she said wasnt hers to dispose of and your life my father shouted you can give that away as a gift even if she was still alive he broke off then seeing me and neither of them talked about the matter again at least when i was around to hear lotty squeezed my hand what about your aunt greataunt in melrose park she might have told her siblings dont you think was she close to any of them i grimaced i cant imagine rosa being close to anyone see she was the last child and gabriellas grandmother died giving birth to her so some cousins adopted her and when they emigrated in the twenties rosa came to chicago with them she didnt really feel like she was part of the verazi family i know it seems strange but with all the uprootings the war caused and all the disconnections its possible that the main part of gabriellas mothers family didnt know what became of her lotty nodded her face twisted in sympathy much of her family had been destroyed in those death camps also there wasnt a schism when your grandmother converted i shrugged i dont know its frustrating to think how little i know about those people gabriella sayssaidthe verazis werent crazy about it and they didnt get together much except for weddings or funeralsexcept for the one cousin but pitigliano was a jewish cultural center before the war and nonno was considered a real catch i guess he was rich until the fascists confiscated his property fantasies of reparations danced through my head not too likely lotty said youre imagining someone overcome with guilt sixty years after the fact coming to make you a present of some land i blushed factory actually the sestieris were harness makers who switched to automobile interiors in the twenties i suppose if the place is even still standing its part of fiat or mercedes you know all day long ive been swinging between wild fantasiesabout nonnos factory or gabriellas brother surfacingand then i start getting terrified wondering if its all some kind of terrible trap although whod want to trap me or why is beyond me i know this malcolm ranier knows it would be so easy no not to set your mind at rest not to prove you can bypass the security of a modern high risefor no reason whatsoever are you to break into that mans office oh very well i tried not to sound like a sulky child denied a treat you promise victoria lotty sounded ferocious i held up my right hand on my honor i promise not to break into his office iii it was six days later that the phone call came to my office a young man with an italian accent so thick that his english was almost incomprehensible called up and gaily asked if i was his cousin vittoria parliamo italiano i suggested and the gaiety in his voice increased as he switched thankfully to his own language he was my cousin ludovico the greatgreatgrandson of our mutual verazi ancestors he had arrived in chicago from milan only last night terribly excited at finding someone from his mothers family thrilled that i knew italian my accent was quite good really only a tinge of america in it could we get together any place he would find mejust name the time as long as it was soon i couldnt help laughing as the words tumbled out although i had to ask him to slow down and repeat it had been a long time since id spoken italian and it took time for my mind to adjust ludovico was staying at the garibaldi a small hotel on the fringe of the gold coast and would be thrilled if i met him there for a drink at six oh yes his last namethat was verazi the same as our greatgrandfather i bustled through my business with greater efficiency than usual so that i had time to run the dogs and change before meeting him i laughed at myself for dressing with care in a pantsuit of crushed lavender velvet which could take me dancing if the evening ended that way but no selfmockery could suppress my excitement id been an only child with one cousin from each of my parents families as my only relations my cousin boomboom whom i adored had been dead these ten years and more while rosa s son albert was such a mass of twisted fears that i preferred not to be around him now i was meeting a whole new family i tapdanced around the dog in my excitement peppy gave me a longsuffering look and demanded that i return her to my downstairs neighbor mitch her son had stopped there on our way home from running you look slick doll mr contreras told me torn between approval and jealousy new date new cousin i continued to tapdance in the hall outside his door yep the mystery relative finally surfaced ludovico verazi you be careful doll the old man said severely plenty of con artists out there to pretend theyre your cousins you know and next thingphht whatll he con me out of my dirty laundry i planted a kiss on his nose and danced down the sidewalk to my car three men were waiting in the garibaldis small lobby but i knew my cousin at once his hair was amber instead of black but his face was my mothers from the high rounded forehead to his wide sensuous mouth he leapt up at my approach seized my hands and kissed me in the european stylesort of touching the air beside each ear bellissima still holding my hands he stepped back to scrutinize me my astonishment must have been written large on my face because he laughed a little guiltily i know it i know it i should have told you of the resemblance but i didnt realize it was so strong the only picture ive seen of cousin gabriella is a stage photo from when she starred in jommellis iphigenia jommelli i interrupted i thought it was gluck no no cugina jommelli surely gabriella knew what she sang laughing happily he moved to the armchair where hed been sitting and took up a brown leather case he pulled out a handful of papers and thumbed through them then extracted a yellowing photograph for me to examine it was my mother dressed as iphigenia for her one stage role the one that gave me my middle name she was made up her dark hair in an elaborate coil but she looked absurdly young like a little girl playing dressup at the bottom of the picture was the name of the studio in siena where she had sung and on the back someone had lettered gabriella sestieri fa la parte diphigenia nella produzione diphigenia da jommelli the resemblance to ludovico was clear despite the blurring of time and cosmetics to the lines of her face i felt a stab of jealousy i inherited her olive skin but my face is my fathers you know this photograph ludovico asked i shook my head she left italy in such a hurry all she brought with her were some venetian wineglasses that had been a wedding present to nonna laura i never saw her onstage ive made you sad cousin vittoria by no means my intention perhaps you would like to keep this photograph i would very much nowa drink or dinner he laughed again i have been in america only twentyfour hours not long enough to be accustomed to dinner in the middle of the afternoon soa drink by all means take me to a typical american bar i collected my trans am from the doorman and drove down to the golden glow the bar at the south end of the loop owned by my friend sal barthele my appearance with a goodlooking stranger caused a stir among the regularsas id hoped murray ryerson an investigative reporter whose relationship with me is compounded of friendship competition and a disastrous romantic episode put down his beer with a snap and came over to our table sal barthele emerged from her famous mahogany horseshoe bar under cover of murray s greetings and ludovicos accented english she muttered girl you are strutting you look indecent anyway isnt this cradle snatching boy looks young i was glad the glow from the tiffany table lamps was too dim for her to see me blushing in the car coming over i had been calculating degrees of consanguinity and decided that as second cousins we were eugenically safe i was embarrassed to show it so obviously anyway he was only seven years younger than me my newfound cousin i said too abruptly ludovico verazisal barthele owner of the glow ludovico shook her hand so you are an old friend of this cousin of mine you know her more than i dogive me ideas about her character dangerous murray said she breaks men in her soup like crackers only if theyre crackers to begin with i snapped annoyed to be presented to my cousin in such a light crackers to begin with ludovico asked slanggergofor pazzo i explained also a cracker is an oafa cretino murray put an arm around me ah victhe sparkle in your eyes lights a fire in my heart its just the third beer murray thats heartburn sal put in ludovico what do you drinkwhiskey like your cousin or something nice and italian like campari whiskey before dinner cousin vittoria no no by the time you eat you have nono tasting sensation for me signora a glass of wine please later over dinner at filigree we became vic and vicoplease veek no one is calling me ludovico since the time i am a little boy in trouble and later still after two bottles of barolo he asked me how much i knew about the verazi family niente i said i dont even know how many brothers and sisters gabriellas mother had or where you come into the picture or where i do for that matter his eyebrows shot up in surprise so your mother was never in touch with her own family after she moved here i told him what id told lotty about the war my grandmothers estrangement from her family and gabriellas depression on learning of her cousin fredericas death but i am the grandson of that naughty frederica that girl who would have a baby with no father vico shouted in such excitement that the wait staff rushed over to make sure he wasnt choking to death this is remarkable vic this is amazing that the one person in our family your mother is close to turns out to be my grandmother ah it was sad very sad what happened to her the family is moved to florence during the war my grandmother has a baby maybe the father is a partisan my grandmother was the one person in the family to be supporting the partisans my greatgrandparents they are very prudish they say this is a disgrace never mind there is a war on and much bigger disgraces are happening all the time sopoofoff goes this naughty frederica with her baby to milano and the baby becomes my mother but she and my grandmother both die when i am ten so these most respectable verazi cousins finally they decide the war is over the grandson is after all far enough removed from the taint of original sin they come fetch me and raise me with all due respectability in florence he broke off to order a cognac i took another espresso somehow after forty i no longer can manage the amount of alcohol i used to id only drunk half of one of the bottles of wine so how did you learn about gabriella and why did you want to try to find her well cam cugina it is wonderful to meet you but i have a confession i must make it was in the hopes of findingsomethingthat i am coming to chicago looking for my cousin gabriella what kind of something you say you know nothing about our greatgrandmother claudia fortezza so you are not knowing even that she is in a small way a composer i couldnt believe gabriella never mentioned such a thing if she didnt know about it the rift with the verazis must have been more severe than she led me to believe but maybe that explains why she was given early musical training i added aloud you know my mother was a quite gifted singer although alas she never had the professional career she should have yes yes she trained with francesca salvini i know all about that salvini was an important teacher even in a little town like pitigliano people came from siena and florence to train with her and she had a connection to the siena opera but anyway vic i am wanting to collect claudia fortezzas music the work of women composers is coming into vogue i can find an ensemble to perform it maybe to record it so i am hoping gabriella too has some of this music i shook my head i dont think so i kept all her music in a trunk and i dont think theres anything from that period but you dont know definitely do you so maybe we can look together he was leaning across the table his voice vibrating with urgency i moved backward the strength of his feelings making me uneasy i suppose so then let us pay the bill and go now but vico its almost midnight if its been there all this while it will still be there in the morning ah i am being the cracker i see we had been speaking in italian all evening but for this mangled idiom vico switched to english mi scusi cara cugina i have been so engaged in my hunt through the papers of old aunts through attics in pitigliano in used bookstores in florence that i forget not everyone shares my enthusiasm and then last month i find a diary of my grandmothers and she writes of the special love her cousin gabriella has for music her special gift and i thinkahha if this music lies anywhere it is with this gabriella he picked up my right hand and started playing with my fingers besides confess to me vic in your minds eye you are at your home feverishly searching through your mothers music whether i am present or not i laughed a little shakily the intensity in his face made him look so like gabriella when she was swept up in music that my heart turned over with yearning so i am right we can pay the bill and leave the wait staff hoping to close the restaurant had left the bill on our table some time earlier i tried to pay it but vico snatched it from me he took a thick stack of bills from his billfold counting under his breath he peeled off two hundreds and a fifty and laid them on the check like many europeans hed assumed the tip was included in the total i added four tens and went to retrieve the trans am iv as we got out of the car i warned vico not to talk in the stairwell we dont want the dogs to hear me and wake mr contreras he is a malevolent neighbor you need me perhaps to guard you hes the bestnatured neighbor in the world unfortunately he sees his role in my life as cerberus with a whiff of othello thrown in its late enough without spending an hour on why im bringing you home with me we managed to tiptoe up the stairs without rousing anyone inside my apartment we collapsed with the giggles of teenagers whove walked past a cop after curfew somehow it seemed natural to fall from laughter into each others arms i was the first to break away vico gave me a look i couldnt interpretmockery seemed to dominate my cheeks stinging i went to the hall closet and pulled out gabriellas trunk once more i lifted out her evening gown again fingering the lace panels in the bodice they were silver carefully edged in black shortly before her final illness gabriella managed to organize a series of concerts that she hoped would launch her career again at least in a small way and it was for these that she had the dress made tony and i sat in the front row of mandel hall almost swooning with our passion for her the gown cost her two years of free lessons for the couturiers daughter the last few given when she had gone bald from chemotherapy as i stared at the dress wrapped in melancholy i realized vico was pulling books and scores from the trunk and going through them with quick careful fingers id saved dozens of gabriellas books of operas and lieder but nothing like her whole collection i wasnt going to tell vico that though hed probably demand that we break into old mr fortieris shop to see if any of the scores were still lying about at one point vico thought he had found something a handwritten score tucked into the pages of idomeneo i came to look someone not my mother had meticulously copied out a concerto as i bent to look more closely vico pulled a small magnifying glass from his wallet and began to scrutinize the paper i eyed him thoughtfully does the music or the notation look anything like our greatgrandmothers he didnt answer me but held the score up to the light to inspect the margins i finally took the pages from him and scanned the clarinet line im no musicologist but this sounds baroque to me i flipped to the end where the initials cf were inscribed with a flourish carlo fortieri might have copied this for my mothera true labor of love copying music is a slow painful business baroque vico grabbed the score back from me and looked at it more intensely but this paper is not that old i think i think not also i have a feeling its something one of my mothers friends copied out for a chamber group they played in she sometimes took the piano part he put the score to one side and continued burrowing in the trunk near the bottom he came on a polished wooden box big enough to fit snugly against the short side of the trunk he grunted as he prised it free then gave a little crow of delight as he saw it was filled with old papers take it easy cowboy i said as he started tossing them to the floor this isnt the city dump he gave me a look of startling rage at my reproof then covered it so quickly with a laugh that i couldnt be sure id seen it this old wood is beautiful you should keep this out where you can look at it it was gabriellas from pitigliano in it carefully wrapped in her winter underwear shed laid the eight venetian glasses that were her sole legacy of home fleeing in haste in the night she had chosen to transport a fragile load as if that gained her control of her own fragile destiny vico ran his long fingers over the velvet lining the case the green had turned yellow and black along the creases i took the box away from him and began replacing my school essays and report cardsmy mother used to put my best school reports in the case at two vico had to admit defeat you have no idea where it is you didnt sell it perhaps to meet some emergency bill or pay for that beautiful sports car vico what on earth are you talking about putting aside the insult what do you think a score by an unknown nineteenthcentury woman is worth ah mi scusi vici forget that everyone doesnt value these verazi pieces as i do yes my dear cousin and i didnt just fall off a turnip truck either i switched to english in my annoyance not even the most enthusiastic grandson would fly around the world with this much mystery whats the storyare the verazis making you their heir if you produce her music or are you looking for something else altogether turnip truck what is this turnip truck forget the linguistic excursion and come clean vico meaning confession is good for the soul so speak up what are you really looking for he studied his fingers grimy from paging through the music then looked up at me with a quick frank smile the truth is fortunato magi may have seen some of her music he was puccinis uncle you know and very influential among the italian composers of the end of the century my greatgrandmother used to talk about magi reading claudia fortezzas music she was only a daughterinlaw and anyway claudia fortezza was dead years before she married into the family so i never paid any attention to it but then when i found my grandmothers diaries it seemed possible that there was some truth to it its even possible that puccini used some of claudia fortezzas music so if we can find it it might be valuable i thought the whole idea was ludicrousit wasnt even as though the puccini estate were collecting royalties that one might try to sue for and even if they wereyou could believe almost any highly melodic vocal music sounded like puccini i didnt want to get into a fight with vico about it though i had to be at work early in the morning there wasnt any time you can remember gabriella talking about something very valuable in the house he persisted i was about to shut him off completely when i suddenly remembered my parents argument that id interrupted reluctantly because he saw id thought of something i told vico about it she was saying it wasnt hers to dispose of i suppose that might include her grandmothers music but there wasnt anything like that in the house when my father died and believe me i went through all the papers hoping for some kind of living memento of my mother something more than her venetian wineglasses vico seized my arms in his excitement you see she did have it she must have sold it anyway or your father did after she died who would they have gone to i refused to give him mr fortieri as a gift if gabriella had been worried about the ethics of disposing of someone elses belongings she probably would have consulted him maybe even asked him to sell it if she came to that in the end but vico didnt need to know that you know someone i can tell he cried no i was a child she didnt confide in me if my father sold it he would have been embarrassed to let me know its going on three in the morning vico and i have to work in a few hours im going to call you a cab and get you back to the garibaldi you work your long lost cousin vico comes to chicago for the first time and you cannot kiss off your boss he blew across his fingers expressively i work for myself i could hear the brusqueness creep into my voicehis exigency was taking away some of his charm and i have one job that wont wait past tomorrow morning what kind of work is it you do that cannot be deferred detective private investigator and i have to be on aai couldnt think of the italian so i used englishshipping dock in four hours ah a detective he pursed his lips i see now why this murray was warning me about you you and he are lovers or is that a shocking question to ask an american woman murray s a reporter his path crosses mine from time to time i went to the phone and summoned a cab and cousin i may take this handwritten score with me to study more leisurely if you return it i will be here with it tomorrow afternoonwhen you return from your detecting i went to the kitchen for some newspaper to wrap it in wondering about vico he didnt seem to have much musical knowledge perhaps he was ashamed to tell me he couldnt read music and was going to take it to some third party who could give him a stylistic comparison between this score and something of our grandmothers the cab honked under the window a few minutes later i sent him off on his own with a chaste cousinly kiss he took my retreat from passion with the same mockery that had made me squirm earlier v all during the next day as i huddled behind a truck taking pictures of a handoff between the vice president of an electronics firm and a driver as i tailed the driver south to kankakee and photographed another handoff to a man in a sports car traced the car to its owner in libertyville and reported back to the electronics firm in naperville i wondered about vico and the score what was he really looking for last night i hadnt questioned his story too closelythe late night and pleasure in my new cousin had both muted my suspicions today the bleak air chilled my euphoria a quest for a greatgrandmothers music might bring one pleasure but surely not inspire such avidity as vico displayed hed grown up in poverty in milan without knowing who his father or even his grandfather were maybe it was a quest for roots that was driving my cousin so passionately i wondered too what item of value my mother had refused to sell thirty summers ago what wasnt hers to sell that she would stubbornly sacrifice better medical care for it i realized i felt hurt i thought i was so dear to her she told me everything the idea that shed kept a secret from me made it hard for me to think clearly when my dad died id gone through everything in the little house on houston before selling it id never found anything that seemed worth that much agony so either she did sell it in the endor my dad had done soor she had given it to someone else of course she might have buried it deep in the house the only place i could imagine her hiding something was in her piano and if that was the case i was out of luck the piano had been lost in the fire that destroyed my apartment ten years ago but if itwhatever it waswas the same thing vico was looking for some old piece of musicgabriella would have consulted mr fortieri if she hadnt gone to him he might know who else she would have turned to while i waited in a naperville mall for my prints to be developed i tried phoning him he was eighty now but still actively working so i wasnt surprised when he didnt answer the phone i snoozed in the presidents antechamber until he could finally snatch ten minutes for my report when i finished a little after five i stopped in his secretarys office to try mr fortieri again still no answer with only three hours sleep my skin was twitching as though id put it on inside out since seven this morning id logged a hundred and ninety miles i wanted nothing now more than my bed instead i rode the packed expressway all the way northwest to the ohare cutoff mr fortieri lived in the italian enclave along north harlem avenue it used to be a days excursion to go there with gabriella we would ride the number six bus to the loop transfer to the douglas line of the el and at its end take yet another bus west to harlem after lunch in one of the storefront restaurants my mother stopped at mr fortieris to sing or talk while i was given an old clarinet to take apart to keep me amused on our way back to the bus we bought polenta and olive oil in frescobaldis deli old mrs frescobaldi would let me run my hands through the bags of cardamom the voluptuous scent making me stomp around the store in an exaggerated imitation of the drunks along commercial avenue gabriella would hiss embarrassed invectives at me and threaten to withhold my gelato if i didnt behave the street today has lost much of its charm some of the old stores remain but the chains have set out tendrils here as elsewhere mrs frescobaldi couldnt stand up to jewel and vespuccis where gabriella bought all her shoes was swallowed by the nearby mall mr fortieris shop on the ground floor of his darkshuttered house looked forlorn now as though it missed the lively commerce of the street i rang the bell without much hope no lights shone from either story i dont think hes home a woman called from the neighboring walk she was just setting out with a laundryladen shopping cart i asked her if shed seen mr fortieri at all today shed noticed his bedroom light when she was getting ready for workhe was an early riser just like her and this time of year she always noticed his bedroom light in fact shed just been thinking it was strange she didnt see his kitchen light onhe was usually preparing his supper about now but maybe hed gone off to see his married daughter in wilmette i remembered barbara fortieris wedding gabriella had been too sick to attend and had sent me by myself the music had been sensational but i had been angry and uncomfortable and hadnt paid much attention to anythingincluding the groom i asked the woman if she knew barbaras married namei might try to call her father there oh you know her my mother was a friend of mr fortierisgabriella sestieriwarshawski i mean talking to my cousin had sunk me too deep in my mothers past sorry honey never met her she married a boy she met at college i cant think of his name just about the time my husband and i moved in here and they went off to those lakefront suburbs together she made it sound like as daring a trip as any her ancestors had undertaken braving the atlantic fatigue made it sound funny to me and i found myself doubling over to keep the woman from seeing me shake with wild laughter the thought of gabriella telling me no gelato if you do not behave this minute only made it seem funnier and i had to bend over clutching my side you okay there honey the woman hesitated not wanting to be involved with a stranger long day i gasped suddencrampin my side i waved her on unable to speak further losing my balance i reeled against the door it swung open behind me and i fell hard into the open shop banging my elbow against a chair the fall sobered me i rubbed my elbow crooning slightly from pain bracing against the chair i hoisted myself to my feet it was only then that it dawned on me that the chair was overturnedalarming in any shop but especially that of someone as fastidious as mr fortieri without stopping to reason i backed out the door closing it by wrapping my hand in my jacket before touching the knob the woman with the laundry cart had gone on down the street i hunted in my glove compartment for my flashlight then ran back up the walk and into the shop i found the old man in the back in the middle of his workshop he lay amid his tools the stem of an oboe still in his left hand i fumbled for his pulse maybe it was the nervous beating of my own heart but i thought i felt a faint trace of life i found the phone on the far side of room buried under a heap of books that had been taken from the shelves and left where they landed vi damn it warshawski what were you doing here anyway sergeant john mcgonnigal and i were talking in the back room of mr fortieris shop while evidence technicians ravaged the front i was as surprised to see him as he was me id worked with him or around him anyway for years downtown at the central district no one down there had told me hed transferredkind of surprising because hed been the righthand man of my dads oldest friend on the force bobby mallory bobby was nearing retirement now i was guessing mcgonnigal had moved out to montclare to establish a power base independent of his protector bobby doesnt like me messing with murder and mcgonnigal sometimes apes his boss or used to even at his most irritable when hes inhaling bobbys frustration mcgonnigal realizes he can trust me if not to tell the whole truth at least not to lead him astray or blow a police operation tonight he was exasperated simply by the coincidence of mine being the voice that summoned him to a crime scenethe nature of their work makes most cops a little superstitious he wasnt willing to believe id come out to the montclare neighborhood just to ask about music as a sop i threw in my longlost cousin who was trying to track down a really obscure score and what is that sonatas by claudia fortezza verazi okay maybe i sometimes led him a little bit astray someone tore this place up pretty good for a while before the old guy showed up it looks as though he surprised the intruder and thought he could defend himself withwhat did you say he was holding an oboe you think your cousin did that because the old guy didnt have any claudia whoever whoever sonatas i tried not to jump at the question i dont think so my voice came from far away in a small thread but at least it didnt quaver i was worrying about vico myself i hadnt told him about mr fortieri i was sure of that but maybe hed found the letter fortieri wrote gabriella the one id tucked into the score of don giovanni and then came out here looking forwhatever he was really huntingand found it so he stabbed mr fortieri to hide hishad he come to chicago to make a fool of me in his search for something valuable and how had mcgonnigal leaped on that so neatly i must be tired beyond measure to have revealed my fears lets get this cousins name damn it vic you cant sit on that i move to this district three months ago the first serious assault i bag who should be here but little miss muppet right under my tuffet youd have to be on drugs to put a knife into the guy but you know something or you wouldnt be here minutes after it happened is that the timing minutes before my arrival mcgonnigal hunched his shoulders impatiently the medics didnt stop to figure out that kind of stuffhis blood pressure was too low take it as read that the old mand be dead if you hadnt shown so patyoull get your citizens citation the next time the mayors handing out medals maybe fortierid been bleeding half an hour but no more so i want to talk to your cousin and then ill talk to someone else and someone else and someone after that you know how a police investigation runs yes i know how they run i felt unbearably tired as i gave him vicos name letter by slow letter to relay to a patrolman did your guys track down mr fortieris daughter shes with him at the hospital and what does she know that youre not sharing with me she knew my mother i should go see her its hard to wait in a hospital while people you dont know cut on your folks he studied me narrowly then said roughly that hed seen a lot of that himself lately his sister had just lost a kidney to lupus and i should get some sleep instead of hanging around a hospital waiting room all night i longed to follow his advice but beneath the rolling waves of fatigue that crashed against my brain was a sense of urgency if vico had been here had found what he was looking for he might be on his way to italy right now the phone rang mcgonnigal stuck an arm around the corner and took it from the patrolman who answered it after a few grunts he hung up your cousin hasnt checked out of the garibaldi but hes not in his room as far as the hall staff know he hasnt been there since breakfast this morning but of course guests dont sign in and out as they go you got a picture of him i met him yesterday for the first time we didnt exchange high school yearbooks hes in his midthirties maybe an inch or two taller than me slim reddishbrown hair thats a little long on the sides and combed forward in front and eyes almost the same color i swayed and almost fell as i walked to the door in the outer room the chaos was greater than when id arrived on top of the tumbled books and instruments lay gray print powder and yellow crimescene tape i skirted the mess as best i could but when i climbed into the trans am i left a streak of gray powder on the floor mats vii although her thick hair now held more gray than black i knew barbara fortieri as soon as i stepped into the surgical waiting room now barbara carmichael now fiftytwo summoned away from flute lessons to her fathers bedside she didnt recognize me at first id been a teenager when she last saw me and twentyseven years had passed after the usual exclamations of surprise of worry she told me her father had briefly opened his eyes at the hospital just before they began running the anesthetic and had uttered gabriellas name why was he thinking about your mother had you been to see him recently he talks about you sometimes and about her i shook my head i wanted to see him to find out if gabriella had consulted him about selling something valuable the summer she got sick the summer of of course barbara didnt know a thing about the matter shed been in her twenties then engaged to be married doing her masters in performance at northwestern in flute and piano with no attention to spare for the women who were in and out of her fathers shop i recoiled from her tone as much as her words the sense of gabriella as one of an adoring harem i uttered a stiff sentence of regret over her fathers attack and turned to leave she put a hand on my arm forgive me victoria i liked your mother all the same it used to bug me all the time he spent with her i thought he was being disloyal to the memory of my own mother anyway my husband is out of town the thought of staying here alone waiting on news so i stayed with her we talked emptily to fill the time of her classes the recitals she and her husband gave together the fact that i wasnt married and no i didnt keep up with my music around nine one of the surgeons came in to say that mr fortieri had made it through surgery the knife had pierced his lung and he had lost a lot of blood to make sure he didnt suffer heart damage they were putting him on a ventilator in a druginduced coma for a few days if we were his daughters we could go see him but it would be a shock and he wanted us to be prepared we both grimaced at the assumption that we were sisters i left barbara at the door of the intensive care waiting room and dragged myself to the trans am a fine mist was falling outlining street lamps with a gauzy halo i tilted the rearview mirror so that i could see my face in the silver light those angular cheekbones were surely slavic and my eyes tonys clear deep gray surely i was surely tony warshawskis daughter the streets were slippery i drove with extreme care frightened of my own fatigue safe at home the desire for sleep consumed me like a ravening appetite my fingers trembled on the keys with my longing for my bed mr contreras surged into the hall when he heard me open the stairwell door oh there you are doll i found your cousin hanging around the entrance waiting for you least i didnt know he was your cousin but he explained it all and i thought you wouldnt want him standing out there not knowing how long it was gonna be before you came home ah cara cugina vico appeared behind my neighbor but before he could launch into his recitative the chorus of dogs drowned him barking and squeaking as they barreled past him to greet me i stared at him speechless how are you your working it was good my working was difficult im tired so maybe i take you to dinner to the dancing you are lively he was speaking english in deference to mr contreras whose only word of italian is grappa dinner and dancing and ill feel like a corpse why dont you go back to your hotel and let me get some sleep naturally naturally you are working hard all the day and i am playing i have youryour partitura score buono score i have her i will take her upstairs and put her away very neat for you and leave you to your resting ill take it with me i held out my hand no no we are leaving one big mess last night i know that and i am greedy last night making you stay up when today you work so i come with you cleanil disordinedisorderliness then you rest without worry you smell flowers while i work before i could protest further he ducked back into mr contrerass living room and popped out with a large portmanteau with a flourish he extracted a bouquet of spring flowers and the score wrapped this time in a cream envelope and put his arm around me to shepherd me up the stairs the dogs and the old man followed him all four making so much racket that the medical resident whod moved in across the hall from mr contreras came out please i just got off a thirtysixhour shift and im trying to sleep if you cant control those damned dogs im going to issue a complaint to the city vico butted in just as mr contreras drawing a deep breath prepared to unleash a major aria in defense of his beloved animals mi scusa signora mi scusa it is all my doing i am here from italy to meet my cousin for the first time i am so excited i am not thinking i am making noise i am disturbing the rest your beautiful eyes require i stomped up the stairs without waiting for the rest of the flow vico caught up with me as i was closing the door this building attracts hardworking ladies who need to sleep your poor neighbor she is at a hospital where they work her night and day what is it about america that ladies must work so hard i gave her some of your flowers i knew you wouldnt mind and they made her so happy she will give you no more complaints about the ferocious beasts he had switched to italian much easier to understand on his lips than english flinging himself on the couch he launched happily into a discussion of his day with the partitura he had found through our mutual acquaintance mr ranier someone who could interpret the music for him i was right it was from the baroque and not only that most likely by pergolesi so not at all possibly by our greatgrandmother why would your mother have a handwritten score by a composer she could find in any music store i was too tired for finesse vico where were you at five this afternoon he flung up his hands why are you like a policeman all of a sudden eh cugina its a question the police may ask you id like to know myself a wary look came into his eyesnot anger which would have been natural or even bewildermentalthough he used the language of a puzzled man i couldnt be jealous of him although it was a compliment when we had only just met so what on earth was i talking about and why the police but if i really wanted to know he was downstairs with my neighbor and for that matter vic where were you at five oclock on the kennedy expressway heading toward north harlem avenue he paused a second too long before opening his hands wide again i dont know your city cousin so that tells me nothing bene thank you for going to so much trouble over the score now you must let me rest i put a hand out for it but he ignored me and rushed over to the mound of papers wed left in the hall last night with a cry that i was to rest he was to work now he took the pergolesi from its envelope the music is signed at the end with the initials cf who would that be probably whoever copied it for her i dont know he laid it on the bottom of the trunk and placed a stack of operas on top of it my lips tight with anger i lifted the libretti out in order to get at the pergolesi vico rushed to assist me but only succeeded in dropping everything so that music and old papers both fluttered to the floor i was too tired to feel anything except a tightening of the screws in my forehead without speaking i took the score from him and retreated to the couch was this the same concerto vico had taken with him the night before id been naive to let him walk off with a document without some kind of proper safeguard i held it up to the light but saw nothing remarkable in the six pages no signs that a secret code had been erased or brought to light nothing beyond a few carefully corrected notes in measure i turned to the end where the initials cf were written in the same careful black ink as the notes vico must have found fortieris letter to my mother stuffed inside don giovanni and tracked him down no hed been here at five so the lawyer ranier was involved vico had spent the day with him together theyd traced mr fortieri vico came here for an alibi while the lawyer searched the shop i remembered raniers eyes granite chips in his soft face he could stab an old man without a seconds compunction vico a satisfied smile on his face came to the couch for gabriellas evening gown this goes on top right this beautiful concert dress and now cugina all is tidy i will leave you to your dreams may they be happy ones he scooped up his portmanteau and danced into the night blowing me a kiss as he went viii i fell heavily into sleep and then into dreams about my mother at first i was watching her with mr fortieri as they laughed over their coffee in the little room behind the shop where mcgonnigal and i had spoken impatient with my mother for her absorption in someone elses company i started smearing strawberry gelato over the oboe mr fortieri was repairing bobby mallory and john mcgonnigal appeared wearing their uniforms and carried me away i was screaming with rage or fear as bobby told me my naughtiness was killing my mother and then suddenly i was with her in the hospital as she was dying her dark eyes huge behind a network of tubes and bottles she was whispering my name through her parched lips mine and francesca salvinis maestra salvini nella cassa vittora mia carissima dale she croaked my father holding her hands demanded of me what she was saying i woke as i always did at this point in the dream my hair matted with sweat maestra salvini is in the box i had told tony helplessly at the time she wants me to give her something i always thought my mother was struggling with the idea that her voice teacher might be dead that that was why her letters were returned unopened francesca salvini on the voice had filled my ears from my earliest childhood as gabriella staged her aborted comeback she longed to hear some affirmation from her teacher she wrote her at her old address in pitigliano and in care of the siena opera as well as through her cousin fredericanot knowing that frederica herself had died two years earlier cassaboxisnt the usual italian word for coffin but it could be used as a crude figure just as it is in english it had always jarred on me to hear it from my motherher speech was precise refined and she tolerated no obscenities and as part of her last wordsshe lapsed into a coma later that afternoon from which she never awokeit always made me shudder to think that was on her mind salvini in a box buried as gabriella was about to be but my mothers urgency was for the pulse of life as though she had given me explicit instructions in my sleep i rose from the bed walked to the hall without stopping to dress and pulled open the trunk once more i took out everything and sifted through it over and over but nowhere could i see the olivewood box that had held gabriellas glasses on the voyage to america i hunted all through the living room and then in desperation went through every surface in the apartment i remembered the smug smile vico had given me on his way out the door last night hed stuffed the box into his portmanteau and disappeared with it ix vico hadnt left chicago or at least he hadnt settled his hotel bill i got into his room at the garibaldi by calling room service from the hall phone and ordering champagne when the service trolley appeared from the bar i followed the waiter into the elevator saw which room he knocked on as i sauntered past him down the hall then let myself in with my picklocks when hed taken off again in frustration i knew my cousin wasnt in or at least wasnt answering his phoneid already called from across the street i didnt try to be subtle in my search i tossed everything from the drawers onto the floor pulled the mattress from the bed and pried the furniture away from the wall fury was making me wanton by the time id made sure the box wasnt in the room the place looked like the remains of a shipwreck if vico didnt have the box he must have handed it off to ranier the importexport lawyer who specialized in remarkable objets doubtless knew the value of an old musical score and how to dispose of it the bedside clock was buried somewhere under the linens i looked at my watchit was past four now i let myself out of the room trying to decide whether ranier would store the box at his office or his home there wasnt any way of telling but it would be easier to break into his office especially at this time of day i took a cab to the west loop rather than trying to drive and park in the rushhour maelstrom the november daylight was almost gone last nights mist had turned into a biting sleet people fled for their homebound transportation heads bent into the wind i paid off the cab and ran out of the ice into the caleb building s coffee shop to use the phone when ranier answered i gave myself a high nasal voice and asked for cindy shes left for the day who is this amanda parton im in her book group and i wanted to know if she remembered youll have to call her at home i dont want this kind of personal drivel discussed in my office he hung up good good no personal drivel on company time only theft i mixed with the swarm of people in the calebs lobby and rode up to the thirtyseventh floor a metal door without any letters or numbers on it might lead to a supply closet working quickly while the hall was briefly empty i unpicked the lock behind lay a mass of wires the phone and signal lines for the floor and a space just wide enough for me to stand in i pulled the door almost shut and stared through the crack a laughing group of men floated past on their way to a blackhawks game a solitary woman hunched over a briefcase scowled at me i thought for a nervous moment that she was going to test the door but she was apparently lost in unpleasant thoughts all her own finally around six ranier emerged talking in italian with vico my cousin looked as debonair as ever with a marigold tucked in his lapel where hed found one in midnovember i dont know but it looked quite jaunty against his brown worsted the fragment of conversation i caught seemed to be about a favorite restaurant in florence not about my mother and music i waited another ten minutes to make sure they werent standing at the elevator or returning for a forgotten umbrella then slipped out of the closet and down to raniers importexport law office someone leaving an adjacent firm looked at me curiously as i slid the catch back i flashed a smile said i hated working nights he grunted in commiseration and went on to the elevator cindys chair was tucked against her desk a white cardigan draped primly about the arms i didnt bother with her area but went to work on the inner door here ranier had been more careful it took me ten minutes to undo it i was angry and impatient and my fingers kept slipping on the hafts lights in these modern buildings are set on master timers for quadrants of a story so that they all turn on or off at the same time outside full night had arrived the high harsh lamps reflected my wavering outline in the black windows i might have another hour of fluorescence flooding my search before the building masters decided most of the denizens had gone home for the day when i reached the inner office my anger mounted to murderous levels my mothers olivewood box lay in pieces in the garbage i pulled it out they had pried it apart and torn out the velvet lining one shred of pale green lay on the floor i scrabbled through the garbage for the rest of the velvet and saw a crumpled page in my mothers writing gasping for air i stuck my hand in to get it the whole wastebasket rose to greet me i clutched at the edge of the desk but it seemed to whirl past me and the roar of a giant wind deafened me i managed to get my head between my knees and hold it there until the dizziness subsided weak from my emotional storm i moved slowly to raniers couch to read gabriellas words the page was dated the th of october her last birthday and the writing wasnt in her usual bold upright script pain medication had made all her movements shaky at that point the letter began carissima without any other address but it was clearly meant for me my cheeks burned with embarrassment that her farewell note would be to her daughter not her husband at least not to a lover either i muttered thinking with more embarrassment of mr fortieri and my explicit dream my dearest i have tried to put this where you may someday find it as you travel through life you will discard that which has no meaning for you but i believehopethis box and my glasses will always stay with you on your journey you must return this valuable score to francesca salvini if she is still alive if she is dead you must do with it as the circumstances of the time dictate to you you must under no circumstances sell it for your own gain if it has the value that maestra salvini attached to it it should perhaps be in a museum it hung always in a frame next to the piano in maestra salvinis music room on the ground floor of her house i went to her in the middle of the night just before i left italy to bid her farewell she feared she too might be arrestedshe had been an uncompromising opponent of the fascists she gave it to me to safeguard in america lest it fall into lesser hands and i cannot agree to sell it only to buy medicine so i am hiding this from your papa who would violate my trust to feed more money to the doctors and there is no need already after all these drugs they give me make me ill and destroy my voice should i use her treasure to add six months to my life with only the addition of much more pain you my beloved child will understand that that is not living that mere survival of the organism oh my darling one my greatest pain is that i must leave you alone in a world full of dangers and temptations always strive for justice never accept the secondrate in yourself my darling even though you must accept it from the world around you i grieve that i shall not live to see you grown in your own life but remember il mio amore per te è lamor che muove il sole e laltre stelle my love for you is the love that moves the sun and all the other stars she used to croon that to me as a child it was only in college i learned that dante said it first i could see her cloudy with pain obsessed with her commitment to save salvinis music scoring open the velvet of the box and sealing it in the belief i would find it only the pain and the drugs could have led her to something so improbable for i would never have searched unless vico had come looking for it no matter how many times i recalled the pain of those last words nella cassa i wouldnt have made the connection to this box this lining this letter i smoothed the letter and put it in a flat side compartment of my case with the sense that my mother was with me in the room some of my anger calmed i was able to begin the search for francesca salvinis treasure with a degree of rationality fortunately ranier relied for security on the buildings limited access id been afraid he might have a safe instead he housed his papers in the antique credenza inside the original decorative lock hed installed a small modern one but it didnt take long to undo it my anger at the destruction of gabriellas box made me pleased when the picklocks ran a deep scratch across the marquetry front of the cabinet i found the score in a file labeled sestieriverazi the paper was old parchment that had frayed and discolored at the edges and the writing on itclearly done by handhad faded in places to a pale brown scored for oboe two horns a violin and a viola the piece was eight pages long the notes were drawn with exquisite care on the second third and sixth pages someone had scribbled another set of bar lines above the horn part and written in notes in a fast careless hand much different from the painstaking care of the rest of the score in two places hed scrawled da capo in such haste that the letters were barely distinguishable the same impatient writer had scrawled some notes in the margin and at the end i couldnt read the script although i thought it might be german nowhere could i find a signature on the document to tell me who the author was i placed the manuscript on the top of the credenza and continued to inspect the file a letter from a signor arnoldo piave in florence introduced vico to ranier as someone on the trail of a valuable musical document in chicago signor raniers help in locating the parties involved would be greatly appreciated ranier had written in turn to a man in germany wellknown to be interested in thcentury musical manuscripts to let him know ranier might soon have something unusual to show him i had read that far when i heard a key in the outer door the cleaning crew i could face down but if ranier had returned i swept the score from the credenza and tucked it in the first place that met my eyebehind the modigliani that hung above it a second later ranier and vico stormed into the room ranier was holding a pistol which he trained on me i knew it vico cried in italian as soon as i saw the state of my hotel room i knew you had come to steal the score steal the score my dear vico i was pleased to hear a tone of light contempt in my voice vico started toward me but backed off at a sharp word from ranier the lawyer told me to put my hands on top of my head and sit on the couch the impersonal chill in his eyes was more frightening than anger i obeyed now what vico demanded of ranier now we had better take her out towell the place name wont mean anything to you a forest west of town one of the sheriffs deputies will take care of her there are sheriffs deputies who will do murder for hire in unincorporated parts of cook county my body would be found by dogs or children under a heap of rotted leaves in the spring so you have mob connections i said in english do you pay them or they you i dont think it matters ranier was still indifferent lets get going oh verazi he added in italian before we leave just check for the score will you what is this precious score i asked its not important for you to know you steal it from my apartment but i dont need to know about it i think the state will take a different view before ranier finished another cold response vico cried out that the manuscript was missing then search her bag ranier ordered vico crossed behind him to snatch my case from the couch he dumped the contents on the floor a shawn colwin tape a tampon that had come partially free of its container loose receipts and a handful of dog biscuits joined my work notebook miniature camera and binoculars in an unprofessional heap vico opened the case wide and shook it the letter from my mother remained in the inner compartment where is it ranier demanded dont ask dont tell i said using english again verazi get behind her and tie her hands youll find some rope in the bottom of my desk ranier wasnt going to shoot me in his office too much to explain to the building management i fought hard when ranier kicked me in the stomach i lost my breath though and vico caught my arms roughly behind me his marigold was crushed and he would have a black eye before tomorrow morning he was panting with fury and smacked me again across the face when he finished tying me blood dripped from my nose onto my shirt i wanted to blot it and momentarily gave way to rage at my helplessness i thought of gabriella of the love that moves the sun and all the other stars and tried to avoid the emptiness of raniers eyes now tell me where the manuscript is ranier said in the same impersonal voice i leaned back in the couch and shut my eyes vico hit me again okay okay i muttered ill tell you where the damned thing is but i have one question first youre in no position to bargain ranier intoned i ignored him are you really my cousin vico bared his teeth in a canine grin oh yes cara cugina be assured we are relatives that naughty frederica whom everyone in the family despised was truly my grandmother yes she slunk off to milan to have a baby in the slums without a father and my mother was so impressed by her example that she did the same then when those two worthy women died the one of tuberculosis the other of excess heroin the noble verazis rescued the poor gutter child and brought him up in splendor in florence they packed all my grandmothers letters into a box and swept them up with me and my one toy a horse that someone else had thrown in the garbage and that my mother brought home from one of her nights out my aunt discarded the horse and replaced it with some very hygienic toys but the papers she stored in her attic then when my soworthy uncle who could never thank himself enough for rescuing this worthless brat died i found all my grandmothers papers including letters from your mother and her plea for help in finding francesca salvini so that she could return this most precious musical score and i thought what have these verazis ever done for me but rubbed my nose in dirt and you that same beautiful blood flows in you as in them and as in me and claudia fortezza our greatgrandmother did she write music or was that all a fiction oh no doubt she dabbled in music as all the ladies in our family like to even you looking at that score the other night and asking me about the notation oh yes like all those stuckup verazi cousins laughing at me because id never seen a piano before i thought you would fall for such a tale and it amused me to have you hunting for her music when it never existed his eyes glittered amber and flecks of spit covered his mouth by the time he finished the idea that he looked like gabriella seemed obscene ranier slapped him hard and ordered him to calm down she wants us excited its her only hope for disarming me he tapped the handle of the gun lightly on my left kneecap now tell me where the score is or ill smash your kneecap and make you walk on it my hands turned clammy i hid it down the hall theres a wiring closet the metal door near the elevators go see ranier ordered verazi my cousin returned a few minutes later with the news that the door was locked are you lying ranier growled at me how did you get into it same as into here i muttered picklocks in my hip pocket ranier had vico take them from me then seemed disgusted that my cousin didnt know how to use them he decided to take me down to unlock the closet myself no ones working late on this side of the floor tonight and the cleaning staff dont arrive until nine we should be clear they frogmarched me down the hall to the closet before untying my hands i knelt to work the lock as it clicked free vico grabbed the door and yanked it open i fell forward into the wires grabbing a large armful i pulled with all my strength the hall turned black and an alarm began to blare vico grabbed my left leg i kicked him in the head with my right he let go i turned and grabbed him by the throat and pounded his head against the floor he got hold of my left arm and pulled it free before he could hit me i rolled clear and kicked again at his head i hit only air my eyes adjusted to the dark i could make out his shape as a darker shape against the floor squirming out of reach roll clear and call out ranier shouted at him on the count of five im going to shoot i dove for raniers legs and knocked him flat the gun went off as he hit the floor i slammed my fist into the bridge of his nose and he lost consciousness vico reached for the gun suddenly the hall lights came on i blinked in the brightness and rolled toward vico hoping to kick the gun free before he could focus and fire enough hands behind your heads all of you it was a city cop behind him stood one of the calebs security force x it didnt take me as long to sort out my legal problems as id feared raniers claim that id broken into his office and he was protecting himself didnt impress the cops if ranier was defending his office why was he shooting at me out in the hall besides the city cops had long had an eye on him they had a pretty good idea he was connected to the mob but no real evidence i had to do some fancy tap dancing on why id been in his office to begin with but i was helped by bobby mallorys arrival on the scene assaults in the loop went across his desk and one with his oldest friends daughter on the rap sheet brought him into the holding cells on the double for once i told him everything i knew and for once he was not only empathetic but helpful he retrieved the score for mehimselffrom behind the modigliani along with the fragments of the olivewood box without talking to the states attorney or even suggesting that it should be impounded to make part of the states case it was when he started blowing his nose as someone translated gabriellas letter for himhe didnt trust me to do it myselfthat i figured hed come through for me but what is it he asked when hed handed me the score i hunched a shoulder i dont know its old music that belonged to my mothers voice teacher i figure max loewenthal can sort it out max is the executive director of beth israel the hospital where lotty herschel is chief of perinatology but he collects antiques and knows a lot about music i told him the story later that day and gave the score to him max is usually imperturbably urbane but when he inspected the music his face flushed and his eyes glittered unnaturally what is it i cried if its what i thinkno id better not say i have a friend who can tell us let me give it to her vicos blows to my stomach made it hard for me to move otherwise i might have started pounding on max the glitter in his eye made me demand a receipt for the document before i parted with it at that his native humor returned youre right victoria im not immune from cupidity i wont abscond with this i promise but maybe id better give you a receipt just the same xi it was two weeks later that maxs music expert was ready to give us a verdict i figured bobby mallory and barbara carmichael deserved to hear the news firsthand so i invited them all to dinner along with lotty of course that meant i had to include mr contreras and the dogs my neighbor decided the occasion was important enough to justify digging his one suit out of mothballs bobby arrived early with his wife eileen just as barbara showed up she told me her father had recovered sufficiently from his attack to be revived from his druginduced coma but he was still too weak to answer questions bobby added that theyd found a witness to the forced entry of fortieris house a boy hiding in the alley had seen two men going in through the back since he was smoking a reefer behind a garage he hadnt come forward earlier but when john mcgonnigal assured him they didnt care about his dopethis one timehe picked raniers face out of a collection of photos and the big guy promptly donated his muscle to usa parttime deputy whos singing like a bird on account of hes pod about being fingered he hesitated then added if you wont press charges theyre going to send verazi home you know i smiled unhappily i know eileen patted his arm thats enough shop for now victoria who is it whos coming tonight max rang the bell just then arriving with both lotty and his music expert a short skinny brunette she looked like a street urchin in her jeans and outsize sweater max introduced her as isabel thompson an authority on rare music from the newberry library i hope we havent kept dinner waitinglotty was late getting out of surgery max added lets eat later i said enough suspense what have i been lugging unknowing around chicago all this time she wouldnt tell us anything until you were here to listen max said so we are as impatient as you ms thompson grinned of course this is only a preliminary opinion but it looks like a concerto by marianne martines but the insertions the writing at the end max began when bobby demanded to known who marianne martines was she was an eighteenthcentury viennese composer she was known to have written over four hundred compositions but only about sixty have survived so its exciting to find a new one she folded her hands in her lap a look of mischief in her eyes and the writing isabel max demanded she grinned you were right max it is mozarts a suggestion for changes in the horn line he started to describe them then decided just to write them in above her original notation he added a reminder that the two were going to play together the following mondaythey often played piano duets sometimes privately sometimes for an audience hah i knew it i was sure max was almost dancing in ecstasy so i put some krugs down to chill liquid gold to toast the moment i held in my hand a manuscript that mozart held he pulled a couple of bottles of champagne from his briefcase i fetched my mothers venetian glasses from the dining room only five remained whole of the eight she had transported so carefully one had shattered in the fire that destroyed my old apartment and another when some thugs broke into it one night a third had been repaired and could still be used how could i have been so careless with my little legacy but whose is it now lotty asked when wed all drunk and exclaimed enough to calm down thats a good question i said ive been making some inquiries through the italian government francesca salvini died in and she didnt leave any heirs she wanted gabriella to dispose of it in the event of her death in the absence of a formal will the italian government might make a claim but her intention as expressed in gabriellas letter might give me the right to it as long as i didnt keep it or sell it just for my own gain wed be glad to house it ms thompson offered seems to me your ma would have wanted someone in trouble to benefit bobby was speaking gruffly to hide his embarrassment whats something like this worth ms thompson pursed her lips a private collector might pay a quarter of a million we couldnt match that but wed probably go to a hundred or hundred and fifty thousand so what mattered most to your ma vicki besides you music music and victims of injustice you probably cant do much about the second but you ought to be able to help some kids learn some music barbara carmichael nodded in approval a scholarship fund to provide chicago kids with music lessons its a great idea vic we launched the gabriellasalvini program some months later with a concert at the newberry mr fortieri attended fully recovered from his wounds he told me that gabriella had come to consult him the summer before she died but she hadnt brought the score with her since shed never mentioned it to him before he thought her illness and medications had made her delusional im sorry victoria it was the last time she was well enough to travel to the northwest side and im sorry that i disappointed her its been troubling me ever since barbara told me the news i longed to ask him whether hed been my mothers lover but did i want to know what if he too had moved the sun and all the other stars for herid hate to know that i sent him to a frontrow chair and went to sit next to lotty in gabriellas honor the cellini wind ensemble had come from london to play the benefit they played the martines score first as the composer had written it and then as mozart revised it i have to confess i liked the original better but as gabriella often told me im no musician the pietro andromache i you only agreed to hire him because of his art collection of that im sure lotty herschel bent down to adjust her stockings and dont waggle your eyebrows like thatit makes you look like an adolescent groucho marx max loewenthal obediently smoothed his eyebrows but said its your legs lotty they remind me of my youth you know going into the underground to wait out the air raids looking at the ladies as they came down the escalators the updraft always made their skirts billow youre making this up max i was in those underground stations too and as i remember the ladies were always bundled in coats and children max moved from the doorway to put an arm around lotty thats what keeps us together lottchen i am a romantic and you are severely logical and you know we didnt hire caudwell because of his collection although i admit i am eager to see it the board wants beth israel to develop a transplant program its the only way were going to become competitive dont deliver your publicity lecture to me lotty snapped her thick brows contracted to a solid black line across her forehead as far as i am concerned he is a cretin with the hands of a caliban and the personality of attila lottys intense commitment to medicine left no room for the mundane consideration of money but as the hospitals executive director max was on the spot with the trustees to see that beth israel ran at a profit or at least at a smaller loss than theyd achieved in recent years theyd brought caudwell in in part to attract more paying patientsand to help screen out some of the indigent who made up percent of beth israels patient load max wondered how long the hospital could afford to support personalities as divergent as lotty and caudwell with their radically differing approaches to medicine he dropped his arm and smiled quizzically at her why do you hate him so much lotty i am the person who has to justify the patients i admit to thisthis troglodyte do you realize he tried to keep mrs mendes from the operating room when he learned she had aids he wasnt even being asked to sully his hands with her blood and he didnt want me performing surgery on her lotty drew back from max and pointed an accusing finger at him you may tell the board that if he keeps questioning my judgment they will find themselves looking for a new perinatologist i am serious about this you listen this afternoon max you hear whether or not he calls me our little baby doctor i am fiftyeight years old i am a fellow of the royal college of surgeons besides having enough credentials in this country to support a whole hospital and to him i am a little baby doctor max sat on the daybed and pulled lotty down next to him no no lottchen dont fight listen to me why havent you told me any of this before dont be an idiot max you are the director of the hospital i cannot use our special relationship to deal with problems i have with the staff i said my piece when caudwell came for his final interview a number of the other physicians were not happy with his attitude if you remember we asked the board to bring him in as a cardiac surgeon first and promote him to chief of staff after a year if everyone was satisfied with his performance we talked about doing it that way max admitted but he wouldnt take the appointment except as chief of staff that was the only way we could offer him the kind of money he could get at one of the university hospitals or humana and lotty even if you dont like his personality you must agree that he is a firstclass surgeon i agree to nothing red lights danced in her black eyes if he patronizes me a fellow physician how do you imagine he treats his patients you cannot practice medicine if now its my turn to ask to be spared a lecture max interrupted gently but if you feel so strongly about him maybe you shouldnt go to his party this afternoon and admit that he can beat me never very well then max got up and placed a heavily brocaded wool shawl over lottys shoulders but you must promise me to behave this is a social function we are going to remember not a gladiator contest caudwell is trying to repay some hospitality this afternoon not to belittle you i dont need lessons in conduct from you herschels were attending the emperors of austria while the loewenthals were operating vegetable stalls on the ring lotty said haughtily max laughed and kissed her hand then remember these regal herschels and act like them eure hoheit ii caudwell had bought an apartment sight unseen when he moved to chicago a divorced man whose children are in college only has to consult with his own taste in these matters he asked the beth israel board to recommend a realtor sent his requirements to themtwenties construction near lake michigan good security modern plumbingand dropped seven hundred and fifty thousand for an eightroom condo facing the lake at scott street since beth israel paid handsomely for the privilege of retaining dr charlotte herschel as their perinatologist nothing required her to live in a fiveroom walkup on the fringes of uptown so it was a bit unfair of her to mutter parvenu to max when they walked into the lobby max relinquished lotty gratefully when they got off the elevator being her lover was like trying to be companion to a bengal tiger you never knew when shed take a lethal swipe at you still if caudwell was insulting herand her judgmentmaybe he needed to talk to the surgeon explain how important lotty was for the reputation of beth israel caudwells two children were making the obligatory christmas visit they were a boy and a girl deborah and steve within a year of the same age both tall both blond and poised with a hearty sophistication born of a childhood spent on expensive ski slopes max wasnt very big and as one took his coat and the other performed brisk introductions he felt himself shrinking losing in selfassurance he accepted a glass of special cuvée from one of themwas it the boy or the girl he wondered in confusionand fled into the melee he landed next to one of beth israels trustees a woman in her sixties wearing a gray textured minidress whose black stripes were constructed of feathers she commented brightly on caudwells art collection but max sensed an undercurrent of hostility wealthy trustees dont like the idea that they cant out buy the staff while he was frowning and nodding at appropriate intervals it dawned on max that caudwell did know how much the hospital needed lotty heart surgeons do not have the worlds smallest egos when you ask them to name the worlds three leading practitioners they never can remember the names of the other two lotty was at the top of her field and she too was used to having things her way since her confrontational style was reminiscent more of the battle of the bulge than the imperial court of vienna he didnt blame caudwell for trying to force her out of the hospital max moved away from martha gildersleeve to admire some of the paintings and figurines shed been discussing a collector himself of chinese porcelains max raised his eyebrows and mouthed a soundless whistle at the pieces on display a small watteau and a charles demuth watercolor were worth as much as beth israel paid caudwell in a year no wonder mrs gildersleeve had been so annoyed impressive isnt it max turned to see arthur gioia looming over him max was shorter than most of the beth israel staff shorter than everyone but lotty but gioia a tall muscular immunologist loomed over everyone he had gone to the university of arkansas on a football scholarship and had even spent a season playing tackle for houston before starting medical school it had been twenty years since he last lifted weights but his neck still looked like a redwood stump gioia had led the opposition to caudwells appointment max had suspected at the time that it was due more to a medicine mans not wanting a surgeon as his nominal boss than from any other cause but after lottys outburst he wasnt so sure he was debating whether to ask the doctor how he felt about caudwell now that hed worked with him for six months when their host surged over to him and shook his hand sorry i didnt see you when you came in loewenthal you like the watteau its one of my favorite pieces although a collector shouldnt play favorites any more than a father should eh sweetheart the last remark was addressed to the daughter deborah who had come up behind caudwell and slipped an arm around him caudwell looked more like a victorian sea dog than a surgeon he had a round red face under a shock of yellowwhite hair a hearty santa claus laugh and a bluff direct manner despite lottys vituperations he was immensely popular with his patients in the short time hed been at the hospital referrals to cardiac surgery had increased percent his daughter squeezed his shoulder playfully i know you dont play favorites with us dad but youre lying to mr loewenthal about your collection come on you know you are she turned to max he has a piece hes so proud of he doesnt like to show it to peoplehe doesnt want them to see hes got vulnerable spots but its christmas dad relax let people see how you feel for a change max looked curiously at the surgeon but caudwell seemed pleased with his daughters familiarity the son came up and added his own jocular cajoling this really is dads pride and joy he stole it from uncle griffen when grandfather died and kept mother from getting her mitts on it when they split up caudwell did bark out a mild reproof at that youll be giving my colleagues the wrong impression of me steve i didnt steal it from grif told him he could have the rest of the estate if hed leave me the watteau and the pietro of course he couldve bought ten estates with what those two would fetch steve muttered to his sister over maxs head deborah relinquished her fathers arm to lean over max and whisper back mom couldve used them too max moved away from the alarming pair to say to caudwell a pietro you mean pietro dalessandro you have a model or an actual sculpture caudwell gave his staccato admirals laugh the real mccoy loewenthal the real mccoy an alabaster an alabaster max raised his eyebrows surely not i thought pietro worked only in bronze and marble yes yes chuckled caudwell rubbing his hands together everyone thinks so but there were a few alabasters in private collections ive had this one authenticated by experts come take a look at ititll knock your breath away you come too gioia he barked at the immunologist youre italian youll like to see what your ancestors were up to a pietro alabaster lottys clipped tones made max starthe hadnt noticed her joining the little group i would very much like to see this piece then come along dr herschel come along caudwell led them to a small hallway exchanging genial greetings with his guests as he passed pointing out a john william hill miniature they might not have seen picking up a few other people who for various reasons wanted to see his prize by the way gioia i was in new york last week you know met an old friend of yours from arkansas paul nierman nierman gioia seemed to be at a loss im afraid i dont remember him well he remembered you pretty well sent you all kinds of messagesyoull have to stop by my office on monday and get the full strength caudwell opened a door on the right side of the hall and let them into his study it was an octagonal room carved out of the corner of the building windows on two sides looked out on lake michigan caudwell drew salmon drapes as he talked about the room why hed chosen it for his study even though the view kept his mind from his work lotty ignored him and walked over to a small pedestal which stood alone against the paneling on one of the far walls max followed her and gazed respectfully at the statue he had seldom seen so fine a piece outside a museum about a foot high it depicted a woman in classical draperies hovering in anguish over the dead body of a soldier lying at her feet the grief in her beautiful face was so poignant that it reminded you of every sorrow you had ever faced who is it meant to be max asked curiously andromache lotty said in a strangled voice andromache mourning hector max stared at lotty astonished equally by her emotion and her knowledge of the figurelotty was totally uninterested in sculpture caudwell couldnt restrain the smug smile of a collector with a true coup beautiful isnt it how do you know the subject i should know it lottys voice was husky with emotion my grandmother had such a pietro an alabaster given her greatgrandfather by the emperor joseph the second himself for his help in consolidating imperial ties with poland she swept the statue from its stand ignoring a gasp from max and turned it over you can see the traces of the imperial stamp here still and the chip on hectors foot which made the hapsburg wish to give the statue away to begin with how came you to have this piece where did you find it the small group that had joined caudwell stood silent by the entrance shocked at lottys outburst gioia looked more horrified than any of them but he found lotty overwhelming at the best of timesan elephant confronted by a hostile mouse i think youre allowing your emotions to carry you away doctor caudwell kept his tone light making lotty seem more gauche by contrast i inherited this piece from my father who bought itlegitimatelyin europe perhaps from yourgrandmother was it but i suspect you are confused about something you may have seen in a museum as a child deborah gave a highpitched laugh and called loudly to her brother dad may have stolen it from uncle grif but it looks like grandfather snatched it to begin with anyway be quiet deborah caudwell barked sternly his daughter paid no attention to him she laughed again and joined her brother to look at the imperial seal on the bottom of the statue lotty brushed them aside i am confused about the seal of joseph the second she hissed at caudwell or about this chip on hectors foot you can see the line where some philistine filled in the missing piece some person who thought his touch would add value to pietros work was that you doctor or your father lotty max was at her side gently prising the statue from her shaking hands to restore it to its pedestal lotty this is not the place or the manner to discuss such things angry tears sparkled in her black eyes are you doubting my word max shook his head im not doubting you but im also not supporting you im asking you not to talk about this matter in this way at this gathering but max either this man or his father is a thief caudwell strolled up to lotty and pinched her chin youre working too hard dr herschel you have too many things on your mind these days i think the board would like to see you take a leave of absence for a few weeks go someplace warm get yourself relaxed when youre this tense youre no good to your patients what do you say loewenthal max didnt say any of the things he wanted tothat lotty was insufferable and caudwell intolerable he believed lotty believed that the piece had been her grandmothers she knew too much about it for one thing and for another a lot of artworks belonging to european jews were now in museums or private collections around the world it was only the most godawful coincidence that the pietro had ended up with caudwells father but how dare she raise the matter in the way most likely to alienate everyone present he couldnt possibly support her in such a situation and at the same time caudwells pinching her chin in that condescending way made him wish he were not chained to a courtesy that would have kept him from knocking the surgeon out even if hed been ten years younger and ten inches taller i dont think this is the place or the time to discuss such matters he reiterated as calmly as he could why dont we all cool down and get back together on monday eh lotty gasped involuntarily then swept from the room without a backward glance max refused to follow her he was too angry with her to want to see her again that afternoon when he got ready to leave the party an hour or so later after a long conversation with caudwell that taxed his sophisticated urbanity to the utmost he heard with relief that lotty was long gone the tale of her outburst had of course spread through the gathering at something faster than the speed of sound he wasnt up to defending her to martha gildersleeve who demanded an explanation of him in the elevator going down he went home for a solitary evening in his house in evanston normally such time brought him pleasure listening to music in his study lying on the couch with his shoes off reading history letting the sounds of the lake wash over him tonight though he could get no relief fury with lotty merged into images of horror the memories of his own disintegrated family his search through europe for his mother he had never found anyone who was quite certain what became of her although several people told him definitely of his fathers suicide and stamped over these wisps in his brain was the disturbing picture of caudwells children their blond heads leaning backward at identical angles as they gleefully chanted grandpa was a thief grandpa was a thief while caudwell edged his visitors out of the study by morning he would somehow have to reconstruct himself enough to face lotty to respond to the inevitable flood of calls from outraged trustees hed have to figure out a way of soothing caudwells vanity bruised more by his childrens behavior than anything lotty had said and find a way to keep both important doctors at beth israel max rubbed his gray hair every week this job brought him less joy and more pain maybe it was time to step down to let the board bring in a young mba who would turn beth israels finances around lotty would resign then and it would be an end to the tension between her and caudwell max fell asleep on the couch he awoke around five muttering by morning by morning his joints were stiff from cold his eyes sticky with tears hed shed unknowingly in his sleep but in the morning things changed when max got to his office he found the place buzzing not with news of lottys outburst but word that caudwell had missed his early morning surgery work came almost completely to a halt at noon when his children phoned to say theyd found the surgeon strangled in his own study and the pietro andromache missing and on tuesday the police arrested dr charlotte herschel for lewis caudwells murder iii lotty would not speak to anyone she was out on two hundred fifty thousand dollars bail the money raised by max but she had gone directly to her apartment on sheffield after two nights in county jail without stopping to thank him she would not talk to reporters she remained silent during all conversations with the police and she emphatically refused to speak to the private investigator who had been her close friend for many years max too stayed behind an impregnable shield of silence while lotty went on indefinite leave turning her practice over to a series of colleagues max continued to go to the hospital every day but he too would not speak to reporters he wouldnt even say no comment he talked to the police only after they threatened to lock him up as a material witness and then every word had to be pried from him as if his mouth were stone and speech excalibur for three days v i warshawski left messages which he refused to return on friday when no word came from the detective when no reporter popped up from a nearby urinal in the mens room to try to trick him into speaking when no more calls came from the states attorney max felt a measure of relaxation as he drove home as soon as the trial was over he would resign retire to london if he could only keep going until then everything would benot all right but bearable he used the remote release for the garage door and eased his car into the small space as he got out he realized bitterly hed been too optimistic in thinking hed be left in peace he hadnt seen the woman sitting on the stoop leading from the garage to the kitchen when he drove in only as she uncoiled herself at his approach im glad youre homei was beginning to freeze out here how did you get into the garage victoria the detective grinned in a way he usually found engaging now it seemed merely predatory trade secret max i know you dont want to see me but i need to talk to you he unlocked the door into the kitchen why not just let yourself into the house if you were cold if your scruples permit you into the garage why not into the house she bit her lip in momentary discomfort but said lightly i couldnt manage my picklocks with my fingers this cold the detective followed him into the house another tall monster five foot eight athletic light on her feet behind him maybe american mothers put growth hormones or steroids in their childrens cornflakes hed have to ask lotty his mind winced at the thought ive talked to the police of course the light alto continued behind him steadily oblivious to his studied rudeness as he poured himself a cognac took his shoes off found his waiting slippers and padded down the hall to the front door for his mail i understand why they arrested lottycaudwell had been doped with a whole bunch of xanax and then strangled while he was sleeping it off and of course she was back at the building sunday night she wont say why but one of the tenants idd her as the woman who showed up around ten at the service entrance when he was walking his dog she wont say if she talked to caudwell if he let her in if he was still alive max tried to ignore her clear voice when that proved impossible he tried to read a journal which had come in the mail and those kids theyre marvelous arent they like something out of the fabulous furry freak brothers they wont talk to me but they gave a long interview to murray ryerson over at the star after caudwells guests left they went to a flick at the chestnut street station had a pizza afterwards then took themselves dancing on division street so they strolled in around two in the morningconfirmed by the doormansaw the light on in the old mans study but they were feeling no pain and he kind of overreactedtheir termif they were buzzed so they didnt stop in to say goodnight it was only when they got up around noon and went in that they found him v i had followed max from the front hallway to the door of his study as she spoke he stood there irresolutely not wanting his private place desecrated with her insistent airhammer speech and finally went on down the hall to a littleused living room he sat stiffly on one of the brocade armchairs and looked at her remotely when she perched on the edge of its companion the weak piece in the police story is the statue v i continued she eyed the persian rug doubtfully and unzipped her boots sticking them on the bricks in front of the fireplace everyone who was at the party agrees that lotty was beside herself by now the story has spread so far that people who werent even in the apartment when she looked at the statue swear they heard her threaten to kill him but if thats the case what happened to the statue max gave a slight shrug to indicate total lack of interest in the topic v i plowed on doggedly now some people think she might have given it to a friend or a relation to keep for her until her name is cleared at the trial and these people think it would be either her uncle stefan here in chicago her brother hugo in montreal or you so the mounties searched hugos place and are keeping an eye on his mail and the chicago cops are doing the same for stefan and i presume someone got a warrant and went through here right max said nothing but he felt his heart beating faster police in his house searching his things but wouldnt they have to get his permission to enter or would they victoria would know but he couldnt bring himself to ask she waited for a few minutes but when he still wouldnt speak she plunged on he could see it was becoming an effort for her to talk but he wouldnt help her but i dont agree with those people because i know that lotty is innocent and thats why im here not like a bird of prey as you think using your misery for carrion but to get you to help me lotty wont speak to me and if shes that miserable i wont force her to but surely max you wont sit idly by and let her be railroaded for something she never did max looked away from her he was surprised to find himself holding the brandy snifter and set it carefully on a table beside him max her voice was shot with astonishment i dont believe this you actually think she killed caudwell max flushed a little but shed finally stung him into a response and you are god who sees all and knows she didnt i see more than you do v i snapped i havent known lotty as long as you have but i know when shes telling the truth so you are god max bowed in heavy irony you see beyond the facts to the innermost souls of men and women he expected another outburst from the young woman but she gazed at him steadily without speaking it was a look sympathetic enough that max felt embarrassed by his sarcasm and burst out with what was on his mind what else am i to think she hasnt said anything but theres no doubt that she returned to his apartment sunday night it was v is turn for sarcasm with a little vial of xanax that she somehow induced him to swallow and then strangled him for good measure come on max you know lotty honesty follows her around like a cloud if shed killed caudwell shed say something like yes i bashed the little vermins brains in instead shes not speaking at all suddenly the detectives eyes widened with incredulity of course she thinks you killed caudwell youre doing the only thing you can to protect herstanding mute and shes doing the same thing what an admirable pair of archaic knights no max said sharply its not possible how could she think such a thing she carried on so wildly that it was embarrassing to be near her i didnt want to see her or talk to her thats why ive felt so terrible if only i hadnt been so obstinate if only id called her sunday night how could she think i would kill someone on her behalf when i was so angry with her why else isnt she saying anything to anyone warshawski demanded shame maybe max offered you didnt see her on sunday i did that is why i think she killed him not because some man let her into the building his brown eyes screwed shut at the memory i have seen lotty in the grip of anger many times more than is pleasant to remember really but never never have i seen her in this kind ofuncontrolled rage you could not talk to her it was impossible the detective didnt respond to that instead she said tell me about the statue i heard a couple of garbled versions from people who were at the party but i havent found anyone yet who was in the study when caudwell showed it to you was it really her grandmothers do you think and how did caudwell come to have it if it was max nodded mournfully oh yes it was really her familys im convinced of that she could not have known in advance about the details the flaw in the foot the imperial seal on the bottom as to how caudwell got it i did a little looking into that myself yesterday his father was with the army of occupation in germany after the war a surgeon attached to pattons staff men in such positions had endless opportunities to acquire artworks after the war v i shook her head questioningly you must know something of this victoria well maybe not you know the nazis helped themselves liberally to artwork belonging to jews everywhere they occupied europe and not just to jewsthey plundered eastern europe on a grand scale the best guess is that they stole sixteen million piecesstatues paintings altarpieces tapestries rare books the list is beyond reckoning really the detective gave a little gasp sixteen million youre joking not a joke victoria i wish it were so but it is not the us army of occupation took charge of as many works of art as they found in the occupied territories in theory they were to find the rightful owners and try to restore them but in practice few pieces were ever traced and many of them ended up on the black market you only had to say that suchandsuch a piece was worth less than five thousand dollars and you were allowed to buy it for an officer on pattons staff the opportunities for fabulous acquisitions would have been endless caudwell said he had the statue authenticated but of course he never bothered to establish its provenance anyway how could he max finished bitterly lottys family had a deed of gift from the emperor but that would have disappeared long since with the dispersal of their possessions and you really think lotty would have killed a man just to get this statue back she couldnt have expected to keep it not if shed killed someone to get it i mean you are so practical victoria you are too analytical sometimes to understand why people do what they do that was not just a statue true it is a priceless artwork but you know lotty you know she places no value on such possessions no it meant her family to her her past her history everything that the war destroyed forever for her you must not imagine that because she never discusses such matters that they do not weigh on her v i flushed at maxs accusation you should be glad im analytical it convinces me that lotty is innocent and whether you believe it or not im going to prove it max lifted his shoulders slightly in a manner wholly european we each support lotty according to our lights i saw that she met her bail and i will see that she gets expert counsel i am not convinced that she needs you making her innermost secrets public v i s gray eyes turned dark with a sudden flash of temper youre dead wrong about lotty im sure the memory of the war is a pain that can never be cured but lotty lives in the present she works in hope for the future the past does not obsess and consume her as perhaps it does you max said nothing his wide mouth turned in on itself in a narrow line the detective laid a contrite hand on his arm im sorry max that was below the belt he forced the ghost of a smile to his mouth perhaps its true perhaps its why i love these ancient things so much i wish i could believe you about lotty ask me what you want to know if you promise to leave as soon as ive answered and not to bother me again ill answer your questions iv max put in a dutiful appearance at the michigan avenue presbyterian church monday afternoon for lewis caudwells funeral the surgeons former wife came flanked by her children and her husbands brother griffen even after three decades in america max found himself puzzled sometimes by the natives behavior since she and caudwell were divorced why had his exwife draped herself in black she was even wearing a veiled hat reminiscent of queen victoria the children behaved in a moderately subdued fashion but the girl was wearing a white dress shot with black lightning forks which looked as though it belonged at a disco or a resort maybe it was her only dress or her only dress with black in it max thought trying hard to look charitably at the blond amazonafter all she had been suddenly and horribly orphaned even though she was a stranger both in the city and the church deborah had hired one of the church parlors and managed to find someone to cater coffee and light snacks max joined the rest of the congregation there after the service he felt absurd as he offered condolences to the divorced widow did she really miss the dead man so much she accepted his conventional words with graceful melancholy and leaned slightly against her son and daughter they hovered near her with what struck max as a stagey solicitude seen next to her daughter mrs caudwell looked so frail and undernourished that she seemed like a ghost or maybe it was just that her children had a hearty vitality that even a funeral couldnt quench caudwells brother griffen stayed as close to the widow as the children would permit the man was totally unlike the hearty sea dog surgeon max thought if hed met the brothers standing side by side he would never have guessed their relationship he was tall like his niece and nephew but without their robustness caudwell had had a thick mop of yellowwhite hair griffens domed head was covered by thin wisps of gray he seemed weak and nervous and lacked caudwells outgoing bonhomie no wonder the surgeon had found it easy to decide the disposition of their fathers estate in his favor max wondered what griffen had gotten in return mrs caudwells vague disoriented conversation indicated that she was heavily sedated that too seemed strange a man she hadnt lived with for four years and she was so upset at his death that she could only manage the funeral on drugs or maybe it was the shame of coming as the divorced woman not a true widow but then why come at all to his annoyance max found himself wishing he could ask victoria about it she would have some cynical explanationcaudwells death meant the end of the widows alimony and she knew she wasnt remembered in the will or she was having an affair with griffen and was afraid she would betray herself without tranquilizers although it was hard to imagine the uncertain griffen as the object of a strong passion since he had told victoria he didnt want to see her again when she left on friday it was ridiculous of him to wonder what she was doing whether she was really uncovering evidence that would clear lotty ever since she had gone he had felt a little flicker of hope in the bottom of his stomach he kept trying to drown it but it wouldnt quite go away lotty of course had not come to the funeral but most of the rest of the beth israel staff was there along with the trustees arthur gioia his giant body filling the small parlor to the bursting point tried finding a tactful balance between honesty and courtesy with the bereaved family he made heavy going of it a sableclad martha gildersleeve appeared under gioias elbow rather like a furry football he might have tucked away she made bright unseemly remarks to the bereaved family about the disposal of caudwells artworks of course the famous statue is gone now what a pity you could have endowed a chair in his honor with the proceeds from that piece alone she gave a high meaningless laugh max sneaked a glance at his watch wondering how long he had to stay before leaving would be rude his sixth sense the perfect courtesy that governed his movements had deserted him leaving him subject to the gaucheries of ordinary mortals he never peeked at his watch at functions and at any prior funeral he would have deftly pried martha gildersleeve from her victim instead he stood helplessly by while she tortured mrs caudwell and other bystanders alike he glanced at his watch again only two minutes had passed since his last look no wonder people kept their eyes on their watches at dull meetings they couldnt believe the clock could move so slowly he inched stealthily toward the door exchanging empty remarks with the staff members and trustees he passed nothing negative was said about lotty to his face but the comments cut off at his approach added to his misery he was almost at the exit when two newcomers appeared most of the group looked at them with indifferent curiosity but max suddenly felt an absurd stir of happiness victoria looking sane and modern in a navy suit stood in the doorway eyebrows raised scanning the room at her elbow was a police sergeant max had met with her a few times the man was in charge of caudwells death too it was that unpleasant association that kept the name momentarily from his mind v i finally spotted max near the door and gave him a discreet sign he went to her at once i think we may have the goods she murmured can you get everyone to go we just want the family mrs gildersleeve and gioia you may have the goods the police sergeant growled im here unofficially and reluctantly but youre here warshawski grinned and max wondered how he ever could have found the look predatory his own spirits rose enormously at her smile you know in your heart of hearts that arresting lotty was just plain dumb and now im going to make you look real smart in public too max felt his suave sophistication return with the rush of elation that an ailing diva must have when she finds her voice again a touch here a word there and the guests disappeared like the hosts of sennacherib meanwhile he solicitously escorted first martha gildersleeve then mrs caudwell to adjacent armchairs got the brother to fetch coffee for mrs gildersleeve the daughter and son to look after the widow with gioia he could be a bit more ruthless telling him to wait because the police had something important to ask him when the last guest had melted away the immunologist stood nervously at the window rattling his change over and over in his pockets the jingling suddenly was the only sound in the room gioia reddened and clasped his hands behind his back victoria came into the room beaming like a governess with a delightful treat in store for her charges she introduced herself to the caudwells you know sergeant mcgonnigal im sure after this last week im a private investigator since i dont have any legal standing youre not required to answer any questions i have so im not going to ask you any questions im just going to treat you to a travelogue i wish i had slides but youll have to imagine the visuals while the audio track moves along a private investigator steves mouth formed an exaggerated o his eyes widened in amazement just like bogie he was speaking as usual to his sister she gave her highpitched laugh and said well win first prize in the how i spent my winter vacation contests our daddy was murdered zowie then his most valuable possession was snatched powie but hed already stolen it from the jewish doctor who killed him yowie and then a p i to wrap it all up yowie zowie powie deborah please mrs caudwell sighed i know youre excited sweetie but not right now okay your children keep you young dont they maam victoria said how can you ever feel old when your kids stay seven all their lives oo ow she bites debbie watch out she bites steve cried mcgonnigal made an involuntary movement as though restraining himself from smacking the younger man ms warshawski is right you are under no obligation to answer any of her questions but youre bright people all of you you know i wouldnt be here if the police didnt take her ideas very seriously so lets have a little quiet and listen to what shes got on her mind victoria seated herself in an armchair near mrs caudwells mcgonnigal moved to the door and leaned against the jamb deborah and steve whispered and poked each other until one or both of them shrieked they then made their faces prim and sat with their hands folded on their laps looking like brighteyed choirboys griffen hovered near mrs caudwell you know you dont have to say anything vivian in fact i think you should return to your hotel and lie down the stress of the funeralthen these strangers mrs caudwells lips curled bravely below the bottom of her veil its all right grif if i managed to survive everything else one more thing isnt going to do me in great victoria accepted a cup of coffee from max let me just sketch events for you as i saw them last week like everyone else in chicago i read about dr caudwells murder and saw it on television since i know a number of people attached to beth israel i may have paid more attention to it than the average viewer but i didnt get personally involved until dr herschels arrest on tuesday she swallowed some coffee and set the cup on the table next to her with a small snap i have known dr herschel for close to twenty years it is inconceivable that she would commit such a murder as those who know her well should have realized at once i dont fault the police but others should have known better she is hot tempered im not saying killing is beyond heri dont think its beyond any of us she might have taken the statue and smashed dr caudwells head in in the heat of rage but it beggars belief to think she went home brooded over her injustices packed a dose of prescription tranquilizer and headed back to the gold coast with murder in mind max felt his cheeks turn hot at her words he started to interject a protest but bit it back dr herschel refused to make a statement all week but this afternoon when i got back from my travels she finally agreed to talk to me sergeant mcgonnigal was with me she doesnt deny that she returned to dr caudwells apartment at ten that nightshe went back to apologize for her outburst and to try to plead with him to return the statue he didnt answer when the doorman called up and on impulse she went around to the back of the building got in through the service entrance and waited for some time outside the apartment door when he neither answered the doorbell nor returned home himself she finally went away around eleven oclock the children of course were having a night on the town she says gioia interjected agreed v i smiled i make no bones about being a partisan i accept her version the more so because the only reason she didnt give it a week ago was that she herself was protecting an old friend she thought perhaps this friend had bestirred himself on her behalf and killed caudwell to avenge deadly insults against her it was only when i persuaded her that these suspicions were as unmerited aswell as accusations against herselfthat she agreed to talk max bit his lip and busied himself with getting more coffee for the three women victoria waited for him to finish before continuing when i finally got a detailed account of what took place at caudwells party i heard about three people with an ax to grind one always has to ask what ax and how big a grindstone thats what ive spent the weekend finding out you might as well know that ive been to little rock and to havelock north carolina gioia began jingling the coins in his pockets again mrs caudwell said softly grif i am feeling a little faint perhaps home you go mom steve cried out with alacrity in a few minutes mrs caudwell the sergeant said from the doorway get her feet up warshawski for a moment max was afraid that steve or deborah was going to attack victoria but mcgonnigal moved over to the widows chair and the children sat down again little drops of sweat dotted griffens balding head gioias face had a greenish sheen foliage on top of his redwood neck the thing that leapt out at me victoria continued calmly as though there had been no interruption was caudwells remark to dr gioia the doctor was clearly upset but people were so focused on lotty and the statue that they didnt pay any attention to that so i went to little rock arkansas on saturday and found the paul nierman whose name caudwell had mentioned to gioia nierman lived in the same fraternity with gioia when they were undergraduates together twentyfive years ago and he took dr gioias anatomy and physiology exams his junior year when gioia was in danger of academic probation so he could stay on the football team well that seemed unpleasant perhaps disgraceful but theres no question that gioia did all his own work in medical school passed his boards and so on so i didnt think the board would demand a resignation for this youthful indiscretion the question was whether gioia thought they would and if he would have killed to prevent caudwell making it public she paused and the immunologist blurted out no no but caudwellcaudwell knew id opposed his appointment he and iour approaches to medicine were very opposite and as soon as he said niermans name to me i knew hed found out and that hed torment me with it forever ii went back to his place sunday night to have it out with him i was more determined than dr herschel and got into his unit through the kitchen entrance he hadnt locked that i went to his study but he was already dead i couldnt believe it it absolutely terrified me i could see hed been strangled andwell its no secret that im strong enough to have done it i wasnt thinking straight i just got clean away from therei think ive been running ever since you mcgonnigal shouted how come we havent heard about this before because you insisted on focusing on dr herschel v i said nastily i knew hed been there because the doorman told me he would have told you if youd asked this is terrible mrs gildersleeve interjected i am going to talk to the board tomorrow and demand the resignations of dr gioia and dr herschel do victoria agreed cordially you could also tell them the reason you got to stay for this discussion was because murray ryerson at the heraldstar was doing a little checking for me here in chicago he found out that part of the reason you were so jealous of caudwells collection is that youre living terribly in debt i wont humiliate you in public by telling people what your money has gone to but youve had to sell your husbands art collection and you have a third mortgage on your house a valuable statue with no documented history would have taken care of everything martha gildersleeve shrank inside her sable you dont know anything about this well murray talked to pablo and eduardo yes i wont say anything else so anyway murray checked whether either gioia or mrs gildersleeve had the statue they didnt so youve been in my house mrs gildersleeve shrieked v i shook her head not me murray ryerson she looked apologetically at the sergeant i knew youd never get a warrant for me since youd made an arrest and youd never have got it in time anyway she looked at her coffee cup saw it was empty and put it down again max took it from the table and filled it for her a third time his fingertips were itching with nervous irritation some of the coffee landed on his trouser leg i talked to murray saturday night from little rock when he came up empty here i headed for north carolina to havelock where griffen and lewis caudwell grew up and where mrs caudwell still lives and i saw the house where griffen lives and talked to the doctor who treats mrs caudwell and you really are a pooper snooper arent you steve said pooper snooper pooper snooper deborah chanted dont get enough thrills of your own so you have to live on other peoples shit yeah the neighbors talked to me about you two victoria looked at them with contemptuous indulgence youve been a twoperson wolf pack terrifying most of the people around you since you were three but the folks in havelock admired how you always stuck up for your mother you thought your father got her addicted to tranquilizers and then left her high and dry so you brought her newest version with you and were all setyou just needed to decide when to give it to him dr herschels outburst over the statue played right into your hands you figured your father had stolen it from your uncle to begin withwhy not send it back to him and let dr herschel take the rap it wasnt like that steve said red spots burning in his cheeks what was it like son mcgonnigal had moved next to him dont talk to themtheyre tricking you deborah shrieked the pooper snooper and her gopher gooper shemommy used to love us before daddy made her take all this shit then she went away we just wanted him to see what it was like we started putting xanax in his coffee and stuff we wanted to see if hed fuck up during surgery let his life get ruined but then he was sleeping there in the study after his stupidass party and we thought wed just let him sleep through his morning surgery sleep forever you know it was so easy we used his own harvard necktie i was so fucking sick of hearing early to bed early to rise from him and we sent the statue to uncle grif i suppose the pooper snooper found it there he can sell it and mother can be all right again grandpa stole it from jews and daddy stole it from grif so we thought it worked out perfectly if we stole it from daddy deborah cried she leaned her blond head next to her brothers and shrieked with laughter v max watched the une of lottys legs change as she stood on tiptoe to reach a brandy snifter short muscular from years of racing at top speed from one point to the next maybe they werent as svelte as the long legs of modern american girls but he preferred them he waited until her feet were securely planted before making his announcement the board is bringing in justin hardwick for a final interview for chief of staff max she whirled the bengal fire sparkling in her eyes i know this hardwick and he is another like caudwell looking for costcutting and no poverty patients i wont have it weve got you and gioia and a dozen others bringing in so many nonpaying patients that were not going to survive another five years at the present rate i figure its a balancing act we need someone who can see that the hospital survives so that you and art can practice medicine the way you want to and when he knows what happened to his predecessor hell be very careful not to stir up our resident tigress max she was hurt and astonished at the same time oh youre joking i see its not very funny to me you know my dear weve got to learn to laugh about it its the only way well ever be able to forgive ourselves for our terrible misjudgments he stepped over to put an arm around her now where is this remarkable surprise you promised to show me she shot him a look of pure mischief lotty on a dare as he first remembered meeting her at eighteen his hold on her tightened and he followed her to her bedroom in a glass case in the corner complete with a humiditycontrol system stood the pietro andromache max looked at the beautiful anguished face i understand your sorrows she seemed to say to him i understand your grief for your mother your family your history but its all right to let go of them to live in the present and hope for the future its not a betrayal tears pricked his eyelids but he demanded how did you get this i was told the police had it under lock and key until lawyers decided on the disposition of caudwells estate victoria lotty said shortly i told her the problem and she got it for me on the condition that i not ask how she did it and max you knowdamned wellthat it was not caudwells to dispose of it was lottys of course it was max wondered briefly how joseph the second had come by it to begin with for that matter what had lottys greatgreatgrandfather done to earn it from the emperor max looked into lottys tiger eyes and kept such reflections to himself instead he inspected hectors foot where the filler had been carefully scraped away to reveal the old chip strung out i people born near the corner of th and commercial used to have fairly predictable futures the boys grew up to work in the mills the girls took jobs in the bakeries or coffee shops they married each other and scrimped to make a down payment on a neighborhood bungalow and somehow fit their large families into its small rooms now that the mills are history the script has changed kids are still marrying still having families but without the certainty of the steel industry to buoy their futures the one thing that seems to stay the same though is the number who stubbornly cling to the neighborhood even now that the jobs are gone its a clannish place south chicago and people dont leave it easily when monica larush got pregnant our senior year in high school and married football hero gary oberst we all just assumed they were on their way to becoming another large family in a small bungalow she wasnt a friend of mine so i didnt worry about the possible ruin of her life anyway having recently lost my own mother to cancer i wasnt too concerned about other girls problems monicas and my lives only intersected on the basketball court like me she was an aggressive athlete but she clearly had a high level of talent as well in those days though a pregnant girl couldnt stay in school so she missed our championship winter the team brought her a game ball we found her fat and pasty eating fritos in angry frustration in front of the tv in her mothers kitchen when we left we made grotesque jokes about her swollen face and belly our only way of expressing our embarrassment and worry gary and monica rewrote their script though gary got a job on the night shift at inland steel and went to school during the day after the babygary juniorwas born monica picked up her ged the two of them scrimped not for a down payment but to make it through the university of illinois s chicago campus gary took a job as an accountant with a big loop firm monica taught high school french and they left the neighborhood moved north was what i heard and that was pretty much all i knewor caredabout them before lily obersts name and face started popping up in the papers she was apparently mopping up junior tennis competition tennis boosters and athleticapparel makers were counting the minutes until she turned pro i actually first heard about her from my old basketball coach mary ann mcfarlane mary anns first love had always been tennis when she retired from teaching at sixty she continued to act as a tennis umpire at local high school and college tournaments i saw her once a year when the virginia slims came to chicago she worked as a linesperson there for the pittance the tour paidnot for the bucks but for the excitement i always came during the last few days and had dinner with her in greek town at the end of the finals ive been watching lily oberst play up at the skokie valley club mary ann announced one year kids got terrific stuff if they dont ruin her too young she could bewell i wont say another martina martinas come once a century but a great one lily oberst i shook my head fishing for why the name sounded familiar you dont remember monica didnt you girls keep in touch after your big year lily is her and gary s daughter i used to coach monica in tennis besides basketball but i guess that wasnt one of your sports after that i read the stories in detail and got caught up on twenty years of missing history lily grew up in suburban glenview the second of two children the heraldstar explained that both her parents were athletic and encouraged her and her brother to go out for sports when a camp coach brought back the word that lily might have some tennis aptitude her daddy began working with her every day she had just turned six then gary put up a net for her in the basement and would give her an ice cream bar every time she could hit the ball back twentyfive times without missing he got mad when it got too easy for me lily said giggling to the reporter then hed raise the net whenever i got to twentyfour when it became clear that they had a major tennis talent on their hands monica and gary put all their energy into developing it monica quit her job as a teacher so that she could travel to camps and tournaments with lily gary by then regional director for a pharmaceutical firm persuaded his company to put in the seed money for lilys career he himself took a leave of absence to work as her personal trainer even now that she was a pro monica and gary went with her everywhere of course lily had a professional coach but her day always started with a workout with daddy gary junior didnt get much print attention he apparently didnt share the familys sports mania five years older than lily he was in college studying for a degree in chemical engineering and hoping to go off to procter gamble in cincinnati lily turned pro the same year jennifer capriati did since capriati was making history joining the pros at thirteen lily two years older didnt get the national hoopla but chicago went wild her arrival in the wimbledon quarterfinals that year was frontpage news all over town her loss there to monica seles was shown live in every bar in the city freshfaced and smiling under a spiky blond hairdo she grinned through her braces and said it was just a thrill to be on the same court with players like seles and graf the city fell in love so when it was announced that she was coming to chicago to play in the slims in february the tournament generated more publicity than it had ever known after a year and a half on the pro circuit lily was ranked eighth in the world but the pictures of her arrival at the family home still showed an ingenuous grin her great dane standing on his hind legs with his paws on her shoulders was licking her face mary ann mcfarlane called me a few days after the obersts arrived back in town want to come up to glenview and watch the kid work out you could catch up with monica at the same time that sounded like a treat that would appeal to monica about as much as it did to me but i had never seen a tennis prodigy in the making i agreed to drive out to glenview on friday morning mary ann and i would have lunch with monica after lilys workout the skokie valley tennis club was just off the edens expressway at dempster lilys workout started at eight but i hadnt felt the need to watch a sixteenyearold however prodigious run laps i arrived at the courts a little after ten when i asked a woman at the reception desk to direct me to lily she told me the stars workout was offlimits to the press today i explained who i was she consulted higher authority over the phone mary ann had apparently greased the necessary skids i was allowed past a bored guard lounging against a hall door after showing him my drivers license i was directed down the hall to the private court where lily was practicing a second guard there looked at my license again and then opened the door for me lily had the use of three nets if she needed them a small grandstand held only three people mary ann and monica and a young man in a workout suit with artemis blazoned across the back i recognized monica from the newspaper photos but they didnt do justice to her perfectly styled gold hair the makeup enhancing her oval face or the casual elegance of her clothes i had a fleeting memory of her fat pasty face as she sat eating fritos twenty years ago i would never have put those two images together as the old bromide has it living well is the best revenge mary ann squeezed my hand as i sat on her other side good to see you vic she whispered monicaheres vic we exchanged confused greetings across our old coach me congratulating her on her daughters success she exclaiming at how i hadnt changed a bit i didnt know if that was a compliment or not the man was introduced as monte allison from artemis products marketing department artemis supplied all of lilys tennis clothes and shoes as well as a sevenfigure endorsement contract allison was just along to protect the investment mary ann explained the equipment maker heard her and ostentatiously turned his left shoulder to us on the court in front of us lily was hitting tennis balls a kid in white shorts was serving to her backhand a dark man in shabby gray sweats stood behind her encouraging her and critiquing her stroke and a third man in bright white clothes offered more forceful criticisms from the sidelines get into the shot lily comen honey youre not concentrating gary mary ann muttered at me thats paco callabrio behind her i dont know much about tennis but even id heard of callabrio after dominating mens tennis in the sixties he had retired to his family home in majorca but five years ago hed come out of seclusion to coach a few selected players lily had piqued his interest when he saw her at the french open last year monica had leaped at the opportunity to have her daughter work with him apparently gary was less impressed as the morning wore on gary s advice began clashing with pacos more and more often in the midst of a heated exchange over lilys upswing i sensed someone moving onto the bench behind me i turned to see a young woman leaning at her ease against the bleacher behind her she was dressed in loosefitting trousers that accentuated the long lean lines of her body lily saw the newcomer at the same time i did she turned very red then very white while paco and gary continued arguing she signaled to the young man to start hitting balls to her again shed been too tired to move well a minute ago but the womans arrival infused her with new energy mary ann had also turned to stare nicole rubova she muttered to me i raised my eyebrows another of the dazzling czech players whod come to the states in martinas wake she was part of the generation between martina and capriati a year or so older than graf but with time ahead of her still to fight for the top spots her dark vivid beauty made her a mediagenic foil to grafs and lilys blondness but her sardonic humor kept her from being really popular with the press gary s afraid shes going to rape his baby he wont let lily go out alone with any of the women on the circuit mary ann continued to mutter at me i raised my brows again this time amazed at mary anns pithy remarks shed never talked so bluntly to me when she was my basketball coach by now gary had also seen rubova in the stands like lily he changed color then grew even more maniacal in his demands on his daughter when paco advised a rest around eleventhirty gary shook his head emphatically you cant spoil her paco believe me i know this little girl shes got great talent and a heart of gold but shes lazy youve got to drive her lily was gray with exhaustion while they argued over her she leaned over her hands on her knees and gasped for air mr oberst paco said his chilly formality emphasizing his dislike you want lily to be a great star but a girl who plays when she is this fatigued will only injure herself if she doesnt burn out completely first i say the workout is over for the day and i say she got to wimbledon last year thanks to my methods gary yelled and she almost had to forfeit her round of sixteen match because you were coaching her so blatantly from the seats paco shouted back your methods stink oberst gary stepped toward the catalan then abruptly turned his back on him and yelled at his daughter lily pick up your racket come on girl you know the rules really oberst monte allison called tentatively down to the floor from the stands we cant injure lilythat wont help any of us monica nodded in emphatic agreement but gary paid no attention to either of them lily looked imploringly from paco to gary when the coach said nothing else she bent to pick up her racket and continued returning balls she was missing more than she was hitting now and was moving leadenly around the court paco watched for about a minute then turned on his heel and marched toward a door in the far wall as he disappeared through it monica got up from mary anns left and hurried after him i noticed a bright pink anorak with rabbit fur around the hood next to where shed been sitting and two furry leather mittens with rabbits embroidered on them thats lilys mary ann said monica must have forgotten she was holding them for her ill give them to the kid if she makes it through this session my old coachs face was set in angry lines i felt angry too and kept half rising from my seat wondering if i ought to intervene pacos departure had whipped gary into a triumphant frenzy he shooed the kid serving balls away and started hitting ground strokes to his daughter at a furious pace she took it for about five minutes before collapsing on the floor in tears i just cant do it anymore daddy i just cant gary put his own racket down and smiled in triumph a sharp clap came from behind me making me jump bravo gary nicole cried what a man you are yes indeed youve proved you can frighten your little girl now the question is which matters more to you that lily become the great player her talent destines her to be or that you prove that you own her she jumped up lightly from the bench and ran down to the court she put an arm around lily and said something inaudible to the girl lily looked from her to her father and shook her head flushing with misery nicole shrugged before leaving the court she and gary exchanged a long look only an optimist would have found the seeds of friendship in it ii the slims started the next monday the events at the skokie valley tennis club made me follow the newspaper reports eagerly but the tournament seemed to be progressing without any open fireworks one or two of the higher seeds were knocked out early but martina rubova lily and one of the maleeva sisters were all winning on schedule along with zina garrison indeed martina coming off knee surgery seemed to be playing with the energy of a woman half her age i called mary ann mcfarlane thursday night to make sure she had my pass to the quarterfinal matches on friday lily was proving such a hit that tickets were hard to get oh yes she assured me we linespersons dont have much leverage but i got monica to leave a pass for you at the willcall window dinner sunday night i agreed readily driving down to the pavilion on friday i was in good time for the noon match which pitted martina against frederica lujan lujan was seeded twelfth to martinas third in world rankings but the gap between their games seemed much wider than those numbers in fact halfway through the first set martina suddenly turned her game up a notch and turned an even match into a rout she was all over the court going down for shots that should have been unhittable an hour later we got the quarterfinal meeting the crowd had come to see lily against nicole rubova when lily danced onto the court a vision in pink and white with a sweatband pulling her blond spikes back from her face the stands roared with pleasure nicole got a polite round of applause but she was only there to give their darling a chance to play a couple of minutes after theyd started their warmup monica came in she sat close to the court about ten rows in front of me the man she joined was paco callabrio he had stood next to lily on the court as she came out for her warmups patted her encouragingly on the ass and climbed into the stands monica must have persuaded him not to quit in fury last week at first i assumed gary was boycotting the match either out of dislike of paco or for fear his overt coaching would cause lily to forfeit as play progressed though i noticed him on the far side of the court behind the chair umpire making wild gestures if lily missed a close shot or if he thought the linespersons were making bad calls when play began rubovas catlike languor vanished she obviously took her conditioning seriously moving well around the court and playing the net with a brilliant ferocity mary ann might be rightshe might have designs on lilys bodybut it didnt make her play the youngster with any gentleness lily too had a range of motion that was exciting to watch she was big already five ten with long arms and a phenomenal reach whether due to gary s drills or not her backhand proved formidable unlike most women on the circuit she could use it one handed lily pushed her hard but rubova won in three sets earning the privilege of meeting navratilova the next afternoon it seemed to me that lily suddenly began hitting the ball rather tentatively in the last few games of the final set i wasnt knowledgeable enough to know if she had suddenly reached her physical limit or if she was buckling under rubovas attack the crowd disappointed in their favorites loss gave the czech only a lukewarm hand as she collected her rackets and exited paco monica and gary all disappeared from the stands as lily left the court to a standing ovation mary ann had been a linesperson on the far sideline during the rubova match neither of the players had given the umpire a hard time rubova at one point drew a line on the floor with her racket a sarcastic indicator of where she thought mary ann was spotting lily another time lily cried out in frustration to the chair umpire i saw monicas shoulders tense and wondered if the prodigy was prone to tantrums more likely she was worried by what gary turning puce on the far sidemight do to embarrass her other than that the match had gone smoothly doubles quarterfinals were on the agenda for late afternoon i wasnt planning on watching those so i wandered down to the court to have a word with mary ann before i left she tried to talk me into staying garrison has teamed up with rubova they should be fun to watchboth are real active girls enough for me for one day whatd you think of the kid in tournament play mary ann spread her hands shes going to go a long way nicole outplayed her today but she wont forever althoughi dont knowit looked to me in the last couple of games as though she might have been favoring her right shoulder i couldnt be sure i just hope gary hasnt got her to injure herself with his hittillyoudrop coaching methods im surprised pacos hanging on through it i grinned suggestively at her maybe monica has wonderful powers of persuasion mary ann looked at me calmly youre trying to shock me vic but believe me i was never a maiden aunt and anyway nothing on this circuit would shock me they have free refreshments downstairs for players and crew and press and hangerson want to come have some coffee before you go some of the girls might even be there and be a hangeron sure why not who knows maybe martina would meet me and remember an urgent need for some detective work a freight elevator protected by guards carried the insiders to the lower depths mary ann in her linespersons outfit didnt need to show any identification i came in for more scrutiny but my playersguest badge got me through the elevator decanted us onto a grubby corridor young people of both sexes hurried up and down its length carrying clipboards at which they frowned importantly pr staff mary ann explained they feed all the statistics from the match to different wire services and try to drum up local interest in the tournament tieins with the auto show that kind of thing older fatter people stood outside makeshift marquees with coffee and globular brownies at the end of the hall i could see paco and monica huddled together gary wasnt in sight lily may have gone back in for a massage i think she already did her press interview gary must be inside with her he wont let her get a workover alone inside the locker room i echoed i know shes daddys darling but dont the other women object to him being there while theyre changing and can she really stand having him watch her get massaged theres a lounge mary ann shepherded me into the refreshment tentreally a niche roped off from the cement corridor with a rather pathetic plastic canopy overhead friends and lovers of the stars can sit there while the girls dress inside i dont expect he actually hangs around the massage table dont go picturing some fabulous hideaway though this is a gym at a relatively poor university its purely functional but they do have a cement cubbyhole for the masseusethat sets it apart from the normal school gym i suddenly realized i was hungryit was long past lunchtime the slims catering was heavy on volume and carbohydrates i rejected fried chicken wings and rice and filled a plastic bowl with some doubtfullooking chili mary ann picked up a handful of cookies to eat with her coffee we settled at an empty table in the far corner and ate while mary ann pointed out the notables to me zina garrisons husband was at the buffet next to katarina maleeva the two were laughing together trying to avoid a fat reporter who was unabashedly eavesdropping on them a wellgroomed woman near the entrance to the marquee was clare rutland the doyenne of the tour mary ann explained she had no formal tide with the slims but seemed to be able to keep its temperamental stars happy or at least functioning as i ate my chili six or seven people stopped to talk to rutland theyd nod at her remarks and race off again i imagined tennis stars wishes from lotus blossoms to lotus racers being satisfied at the wave of her hand mary ann talking to acquaintances began picking up some of the gossip buzzing the room lily might have strained her shoulder maybe torn her rotator cuff in this kind of environment the worst scenarios are generated rapidly from the whiff of an idea and gary apparently had been thrown out of lilys press conference and was now sulking in the womens lounge a collective cry from the group across the room made me jerk my head around nicole rubova was sprinting down the hall wet a towel haphazardly draping her midriff clare she gasped clare rutland was on her feet as soon as she heard the outcry almost before rubova came into view she took off her cardigan and draped it across the players shoulders rubova was too far from us for me to be able to hear her but the reporters in the room crowded around her tournament etiquette forgotten it only took a minute for mary ann to get the main point of the story from one of them gary oberst was on the couch in the players lounge someone had wrapped a string from a tennis racket around his neck a few times it was only later that everyone realized lily herself had disappeared iii clare rutland curled one foot toward her chin and massaged her stockinged toes her face rubbed free of makeup showed the strain of the day in its sharply dug lines this could kill the slims she remarked to no one in particular it was past midnight i was in the windowless press room with her mary ann and a bunch of men including jared brookings who owned the pr firm handling the slims in chicago brookings had come in in person around nine to see what could be done to salvage the tournament hed sent his freshfaced minions packing long ago theyd phoned him in terror when the police arrested nicole rubova and clearly were not up to functioning in the crisis arnold krieger was there too with a handful of other reporters whose names i never learned krieger was the fat man whod been listening in on zina garrisons husband earlier in the dining area he covered tennis for one of the wire services and had made himself at home in the press room when the cops commandeered it for their headquarters shell be out on bond in the morning right krieger palmed a handful of nuts into his mouth as he started to talk so his words came out clogged so she can play martina at one per the schedule clare looked at him in dismay but didnt speak brookings put his fingertips together it all depends doesnt it we cant be too careful weve spent two decades building these girls up but the whole fabric could collapse at any minute i could see mary anns teacher instincts debating whether to correct his mixed metaphors and deciding against it the problem isnt just having one of the stars arrested for murder she said bluntly lily oberst is a local heroine and now everyone is going to read that an evil lesbian who had designs on her killed her father because he stood between them chicago might rip nicole apart they certainly wont support the tournament besides clare rutland added in a dull voice two of the top seeds withdrew when they heard about rubovas arrest theyve gone off to locate a lawyer to handle the defense the other czechs may not play any more slims this year if a cloud hangs over rubova neither will freddie lujan if they drop out others may follow suit if a cloud hangs over rubova its over the whole tour monte allison the artemis products representative spoke for the first time we may withdraw our sponsorship for the rest of the yeari cant speak for philip morris of course thats a corporate decision naturally not mine but well be making it tomorrow orno tomorrows saturday well make it monday early id never yet known a corporation that could make an important decision early monday just because one of its vice presidents said so in a forceful voice but allison was fretful because none of the tennis people was paying attention to him since artemis also helped philip morris promote the tour allison was likely to urge that they withdraw their sponsorship just because he didnt like the way clare rutland kept snubbing him i muttered as much to mary ann if they have to make a decision monday it gives you two days to solve the crime vic she said loudly you dont believe rubova killed oberst i asked her still sotto voce i believe the police wanted to arrest her because they didnt like her attitude mary ann snapped the investigation had been handled by john mcgonnigal a violent crimes sergeant i know hes a good cop but a soignée sardonic woman does not bring out the best in him and by the time hed arrived nicole had dressed in a crimson silk jumpsuit that emphasized the pliable length of her body and withdrawn from shock into mockery when mcgonnigal saw me slide into the interrogation room behind rubova he gave an exaggerated groan but didnt actively try to exclude me from his questioning sessions those gave me a sense of where everyone claimed to have been when gary was killed but no idea at all if mcgonnigal was making a mistake in arresting nicole rubova police repugnance at femalefemale sexuality might have helped him interpret evidence so that it pointed at her i hadnt been able to get the forensic data but the case against rubova seemed to depend on two facts she was the only person known to be alone with gary in the locker room and one of her rackets had a big section of string missing from it this last seemed to be a rather slender thread to hang her on it would have taken a good while to unthread enough string from a racket to have enough for a garrote i didnt see where shed had the time to do it mcgonnigal insisted shed spent lilys press conference at it dismissing claims from frederica lujan that shed been talking to nicole while it was going on some helpful person had told him that frederica and nicole had had an affair last year so mcgonnigal decided the spanish player would say anything to help a friend none of the slims people questioned my sitting in on the inquirythey were far too absorbed in their woes over the tournament the men didnt pay any attention to mary anns comment to me now but clare rutland moved slightly on the couch so that she was facing my old coach directly who is this mary ann v i warshawski about the best private investigator in the city mary ann continued to speak at top volume is that why you came to the matches today the large hazel eyes looked at me with intense interest i felt the power she exerted over tennis divas directed at me i came because i wanted to watch lily oberst i grew up playing basketball with her mother mary ann here was our coach after watching gary train lily last week i would have thought the kid might have killed him herselfhe seemed extraordinarily brutal clare smiled for the first time since nicole rubova had come running down the hall in her towel ten hours ago if every tennis kid killed her father because of his brutal coaching we wouldnt have any parents left on the circuit which might only improve the game but oberst was one of the worst onlywhy did she have to do it here she must have knownonly i suppose when youre jealous you dont think of such things so you think rubova killed the guy clare spread her hands appealing for support you dont you know her and i dont so i assume youre a better judge of her character but she seems too cool too poised to kill a guy for the reason everyones imputing to her maybe she was interested in lily but i find it impossible to believe shed kill the girls father because he tried to shortcircuit her shes very sophisticated very smart and very cool if she really wanted to have an affair with lily shed have figured out a way im not sure she wanted toi think it amused her to see lily blush and get flustered and to watch gary go berserk but if she did want to kill gary shed have done so a lot more subtly not in a fit of rage in the locker room one other thing ififshe killed him like that on the spot it must have been for some other reason than lily like what arnold krieger had lost interest in monte allison and was eavesdropping on me still chewing cashews i hunched a shoulder you guys tell me youre the ones who see these prima donnas week in and week out clare nodded i see what you mean but then who did kill oberst i dont know the players and i dont have access to the forensic evidence butwell lily herself would be my first choice a furious uproar started from allison and brookings with clare chiming in briefly mary ann silenced them all with a coachs whistleshe still could put her fingers in her mouth and produce a sound like a steam engine she must have been awfully tired of gary sitting in her head i continued when mary ann had shut them up she could hardly go to the bathroom without his permission i learned today that he chose her clothes her friends ran her practice sessions drove away her favorite coaches you name it the police had found lily quickly enoughshed apparently had a rare fight with gary and stormed away to northwestern hospital without telling monica without her entourage it had taken her a while to persuade the emergency room that her sore shoulder should leap ahead of other emergencies once they realized who she was though they summoned their sports medicine maven at once he swept her off in a cloud of solicitude for x rays then summoned a limo to take her home to glenview there still would have been plenty of time for her to kill gary before she left the pavilion then theres monica i went on she and paco callabrio have been pretty friendlyseveral people hinted at it during their interviews this afternoon she and gary started dating when they were fifteen thats twentyfour years with a bully maybe she figured shed had enough i dont like paco for the spot very well hes like nicolehes got a life and an international reputation he didnt need to ruin it by killing the father of one of his pupils although apparently he came out of retirement because of financial desperation so maybe he was worried about losing lily as a client and his affair with monica deranged him enough that he killed oberst so you think its one of those three clare asked i shrugged could be could be allison here worried about his endorsement contract he watched gary driving lily to the breaking point artemis could lose seven eight million dollars if lily injured herself so badly she couldnt play anymore allison broke off his conversation with brookings when he heard his name what the hell are you saying thats outrageous were behind lily all the way i could sue you control yourself monte clare said coldly no ones accusing you of anything except highlevel capitalism the detective is just suggesting why someone besides nicole might have killed gary oberst anything else the hottest outsider is arnold krieger here two of the anonymous reporters snickered krieger muttered darkly but didnt say anything the tale of lilys interview with him had come out very early in mcgonnigals questioning tennis etiquette dictates that the loser meet journalists first the winner can then shower and dress at her leisure after her match lily had bounced out surrounded by paco gary and monica shed giggled with the press about her game said she didnt mind losing to nicole because nicole was a great player but she lily had given the game her best and anyway she was glad to have a few extra days at home with ninja her great dane before flying off to palm springs for an exhibition match people asked about her shoulder shed said it was sore but nothing serious she was going over to northwestern for x rays just to be on the safe side arnold krieger then asked whether she felt she ever played her best against rubova after all most people know shes just waiting for the chance to get you alone doesnt that unnerve you lily started to giggle again but gary lost his temper and jumped krieger on the spot security guards pried his hands from the journalists throat gary was warned out of the press room in fact he was told that one more episode would get him barred from the tour altogether the cops loved that but they couldnt find anyone whod seen krieger go into the locker room afterwards in fact most of us could remember his staying near the food playing tag team with garrisons husband dont forget it was rubovas racket the string was missing from krieger reminded me belligerently clare eyed krieger as though measuring him for an electric chair then turned back to me what do you charge fifty dollars an hour plus any unusual expensesthings above the cost of gas or local phone bills im hiring you clare said briskly to do what clear nicoles name or guarantee the tour can go on i can only do the firstif shes not guilty if it turns out to be lily or any of the other players the slims are going to be under just as much of a cloud as they are now clare rutland scowled but she was used to being decisive clear nicole for me ill worry about the slims after that what do you need me to do to make it official ill bring a contract by for you tomorrow but right now what i really want is to take a look at the womens locker room you cant do that one of the anonymous reporters objected the police have sealed it the police are through with it i said theyve made their arrest i just need someone with a key to let me in clare pinched the bridge of her nose while she thought about it maybe it was the objections the men kept hurling at her that made her decide she stood up briskly slipped her feet into their expensive suede pumps and told me to follow her mary ann and i left the press room in her wake behind us i could hear allison shouting you cant do this iv i tore the police seal without compunction if theyd been in the middle of an investigation i would have honored it but theyd had their chance made their arrest the locker room was a utilitarian set of cement cubes the attempt to turn the outermost cube into a lounge merely made it look forlorn it held a few pieces of secondhand furniture a large bottle of spring water and a telephone gary had been sitting on a couch plunked into the middle of the floor whoever killed him had stood right behind him wrapping the racket string around his throat before he had time to reactthe police found no evidence that he had been able even to lift a hand to try to pull it loose a smear of dried blood on the back cushion came from where the string had cut through the skin of his neck whoever had pulled the garrote must have cut heror hishands as well i bummed a pad of paper from clare and made a note to ask mcgonnigal whether nicole had any cuts and whether hed noticed them on anyone else it was quite possible he hadnt bothered to look the lounge led to the shower room as mary ann had warned the place was strictly functionalno curtains no gleaming fittings just standard brown tile that made my toes curl inside my shoes as i felt mold growing beneath them and a row of small whitecrusted shower heads beyond the showers was a bare room with hooks for coats or equipment bags and a table for the masseuse a door led to the outer hall its locked at all times though clare said all the time i expect someone has a key she took the notepad from me and scribbled on it ill track that down for you in the morning a barrel of used towels stood between the showers and the massage room for want of anything better to do i poked through them but nothing unusual came to light normally all the laundry is cleared out at the end of the day along with the garbage but the maintenance crews couldnt come in tonight of course clare explained the garbage bins were built into the walls it was easy to lift the swinging doors off and pull the big plastic liners out i took them over to the masseuses corner and started emptying them onto the table piece by piece i did them in order of room starting with the lounge police detrituscoffee cups ashes crumpled formsmade up the top layer in the middle of the styrofoam and ash i found two leather mittens with bunnies embroidered on them the palms were cut to ribbons i went through the rest of the garbage quickly so quickly i almost missed the length of nylon wrapped in paper towels one end poked out as i perfunctorily shook the papers i saw it just as i was about to sweep everything off the massage table back into the bag its racket string mary ann said tersely yes i agreed quietly it was a piece about five inches long i unrolled all the paper toweling and newsprint a sheet at a time by the time i finished i had three more little pieces since the garrote that killed gary had been deeply embedded in his throat these might have been cut from nicoles racket to point suspicion at her but the mittens my old coach couldnt bring herself to say more clare rutland was watching me her face frozen the mittens are lilys arent they her brother got them for her for christmas she showed them off to everyone on the tour when we had our first postchristmas matches why dont you give them to me vic the string should be enough to save nicole i shook my head unhappily could be wed have to have the lab make sure these pieces came from her racket anyway i cant do that clare im not gary obersts judge and jury i cant ignore evidence that ive found myself but vic mary ann said hoarsely how can you do that to lily turn on her i always thought you tried to help other women and you saw yourself what her life was like with gary how can you blame her i felt the muscles of my face distort into a grimace i dont blame her but how can you let her go through her life without confronting herself its a good road to madness seeing yourself as above and beyond the law the special treatment she gets as a star is bound to make her think that way to some degree already if we let her kill her father and get away with it were doing her the worst possible damage mary anns mouth twisted in misery she stared at me a long minute oh damn you vic she cried and pushed her way past me out of the locker room the last vestiges of clare rutlands energy had fallen from her face making her cheeks look as though they had collapsed into it i agree with mary ann vic we ought to be able to work something out something that would be good for lily as well as nicole no i cried she lunged toward me and grabbed the mittens but i was not only younger and stronger my nikes gave me an advantage over her high heels i caught up with her before shed made it to the showerroom door and gently took the mittens from her will you let me do one thing will you let me see lily before you talk to the police what about nicole i demanded doesnt she deserve to be released as soon as possible if the lawyer the other women have dug up for her doesnt get her out you can call sergeant mcgonnigal first thing in the morning anyway go ahead and give him the string now wont that get her released i cant do that i cant come with two separate pieces of evidence found in the identical place but delivered to the law eight hours apart and no i damned well will not lie about it for you ill do this much for you ill let you talk to lily but ill be with you anyway once the cops have made an arrest they dont like to go back on it they were just as likely to say that nicole had cut the string out herself as part of an elaborate bluff clare smiled affably okay well go first thing in the morning no ms rutland youre a hell of a woman but youre not going to run me around the way you do the rest of the tour if i wait until morning youll have been on the phone with lily and monica and theyll be in majorca we go tonight or i stick to you like your underwear until morning her mouth set in a stubborn une but she didnt waste her time fighting lost battles well have to phone first theyre bound to be in bed and they have an elaborate security system ill have to let them know were coming i breathed down her neck while she made the call but she simply told monica it was important that they discuss matters tonight before the story made national headlines im sorry honey i know its a hell of an hour and youre under a hell of a lot of strain but this is the first moment ive had since nicole found gary and we just cant afford to let it go till morning monica apparently found nothing strange in the idea of a two am discussion of lilys tennis future clare told her i was with her and would be driving so she turned the phone over to me for instructions monica also didnt question what i was doing with clare for which i was grateful my powers of invention werent very great by this point v a single spotlight lit the gate at nine nightingale lane when i leaned out the window and pressed the buzzer monica didnt bother to check that it was really us she released the lock at once the gate swung in on welloiled hinges inside the gate the house and drive were dark i switched my headlights on high and drove forward cautiously trying to make sure i stayed on the tarmac my lights finally picked out the house the drive made a loop past the front door i pulled over to the edge and turned off the engine any idea why the place is totally dark i asked clare maybe lilys in bed and monica doesnt want to wake her up lily cant sleep just knowing theres a light on somewhere in the house try a different theory i dont have any theories clare said sharply im as baffled as you are and probably twice as worried could someone have come out here and jumped her be lying in ambush for us my mouth felt dry the thought had occurred to me as well anyone could have lifted lilys mittens from the locker room while she was playing maybe arnold krieger had done so gotten someone to let him in through the permanently locked end of the womens locker room lifted the mittens garroted gary and slipped out the back way again while rubova was still in the shower when he realized we were searching the locker room he came to glenview ahead of us hed fought hard to keep me from going into the locker room now that i thought about it my gun of course was locked away in the safe in my bedroom no normal person carries a smith wesson to a virginia slims match can you drive a stick shift i asked clare im going inside but i want to find a back entrance avoid a trap if i can if im not out in twenty minutes drive off and get a neighbor to call the cops and lock the car doors whoevers in the house knows were here they released the gate for us the mittens were zipped into the inside pocket of my parka i decided to leave them there clare might still destroy them in a moment of chivalry if i put them in the trunk for safekeeping i took a pencil flash from the glove compartment using it sparingly i picked my way around the side of the house a dog bayed nearby ninja the great dane but he was in the house if arnold krieger or someone else had come out to get a jump on us they would have killed the dog or the dog would have disabled them i felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck a cinderblock cube had been attached to the back of the house i shone the flash on it cautiously it had no windows it dawned on me that they had built a small indoor court for lily for those days when she couldnt get to the club it had an outside door that led to the garden when i turned the knob the door moved inward im in here vic monicas voice came to me in the darkness i figured youd avoid the house and come around the back are you all right i whispered loudly whos inside with lily monica laughed just her dog you worried about paco interrupting us hes staying downtown in a hotel mary ann called me she told me youd found lilys mittens she wanted me to take lily and run but i thought id better stay to meet you ive got a shotgun vic gary was obsessive about lilys safety except of course on the court where he hoped shed run herself into early retirement you going to kill me to protect your daughter that wont help much i mean ill be dead but then the police will come looking and the whole ugly story will still come out you always were kind of a smart mouth i remember that from our high school days and how much i hated you the day you came to see me with the rest of the team when i was pregnant with little gary her voice had a conversational quality no i can persuade the cops that i thought my home was being invaded someone coming to hurt lily on top of all shes already been through today mary ann may figure it out but she loves lily too much to do anything to hurt her clare rutlands out front with the car shes going for help before too long her story would be pretty hard to discount shes going to find the gate locked when she gets there and even clare endlessly clever will find it hard to scale a tenfoot electrified fence no it will be seen as a terrible tragedy people will give us their sympathy lilys golden up here after all i felt a jolt under my rib cage you killed gary she burst out laughing oh my goodness yes vic did you just figure that out smartass that you are i was sure you were coming up here to gun for me did you really think little lily who could hardly pee without her daddy had some sudden awakening and strangled him why monica because she may have hurt her shoulder you couldnt just get him to lay off i noticed you didnt even try at her practice session last week i always hated that about you she said her tone still flat your goddamned highandmightiness you dontdidntever stop gary from doing some damned thing he was doing how do you think i got pregnant with little gary because his daddy said lie down and spread your legs for me pretty please get out of your dream world i got pregnant the oldfashioned way he raped me we married we foughteach other and everything around us but we made it out of that hellhole down there just like you did only not as easily it wasnt easy for me i started to say but i sensed a sudden movement from her and flung myself onto the floor a tennis ball bounced off the wall behind me and ricocheted from my leg monica laughed again i have the shotgun but i kind of like working with a racket i was pretty good once never as good as lily though and when lily was bornwhen we realized what her potential wasi saw i could move myself so far from south chicago it would never be able to grab me again another thwock came in the dark and another ball crashed past me then gary started pushing her so hard i was afraid shed be like andrea jaeger injured and burned out before she ever reached her potential i begged him pleaded with him wed lose that artemis contract and everything else but gary s the kind of guy whos always right this time i was ready for the swish of her racket in the dark under cover of the balls noise i rolled across the floor in her direction i didnt speak hoping the momentum of her anger would keep her going without prompting when lily came off the court today favoring her shoulder i told him id had it that i wanted him out of her career that paco knew a thousand times more how to coach a girl with lilys talent than he did but mr everright just laughed and ranted he finally said lily could choose just like shed chosen him over nicole shed choose him over paco i kept inching my way forward until i felt the net one of the balls had stopped there i picked it up monica hadnt noticed my approach lily came up just then and heard what he said on top of the scene hed made at her little press doohickey it was too much for her she had a fit and left the room i went down the hall to an alcove where johnny lombardythe stringerkept his spool i just cut a length of racket string from his roll went back to the lounge andgod it was easy and nicoles racket i asked hoarsely hoping my voice would sound as though it was farther away just snipped a few pieces out while she was in the shower shes another one like yousnotty knowitall it wont hurt her to spend some time in jail she fired another ball at the wall and then unexpectedly flooded the room with light neither of us could see but she at least was prepared for the shock it gave her time to locate me as i scrambled to my feet i found myself tangled in the net and struggled furiously while she steadied the gun on her shoulder i wasnt going to get my leg free in time just before she fired i hurled the ball id picked up at her it hit her in the face the bullet tore a hole in the floor inches from my left foot i finally yanked my leg from the net and launched myself at her vi im sorry vic that you almost got killed i mean not that i called monicashe needed me not just then but in general she never had your oh centeredness she needed a mother mary ann and i were eating in greek town the slims had limped out of chicago a month ago but i hadnt felt like talking to my old coach since my night with monica but clare rutland had come to town to meet with one of the tour sponsors and to hand me a check in person and she insisted that the three of us get together after explaining how shed talked the sponsors and players into continuing clare wanted to know why mary ann had called monica that night everyone needs a mother mary ann thats the weakest damned excuse i ever heard for trying to help someone get away with murdering her husband mary ann looked at me strangely maybe monica is right about you victoria too highandmighty but it was lily i was trying to help i wouldnt have done it if id known monica was going to try to kill you but you can take care of yourself you survived the encounter she didnt what do you mean i demanded all i did was bruise her face getting her not to shoot me and no ones going to give her the death penalty id be surprised if she served more than four years you dont understand vic she didnt have anything besides the the scrappiness that got her and gary out of south chicago oh she learned how to dress and put on makeup and what kinds of things north shore people eat for dinner now that the fights gone out of her she doesnt have anything inside her to get her through the bad times you do clare rutland interrupted hastily the good news is that lily will recover we have her working with a splendid woman psychotherapist i mean shes playing tennis as much as she wants which turns out to be a lot and the other women on the circuit are rallying around in a wonderful way nicole is taking her to maine to spend the summer at her place near bar harbor with her artemis dropped their endorsement contract i said it was in the papers here yes but shes already made herself enough to get through the next few years without winning another tournament lets be honest she could live the rest of her life on what shes made in endorsements so far anyway i hear nike and reebok are both sniffing around no ones going to do anything until after monicas trialit wouldnt look right but lily will be fine we dropped it there except for the testimony i had to give at monicas trial i didnt think about her or lily too much as time went by sobered by my old coachs comments i kept my time on the stand brief mary ann who came to the trial every day seemed to be fighting tears when i left the courtroom but i didnt stop to talk to her the following february though mary ann surprised me by phoning me im not working on the lines this year she said abruptly ive seen too much tennis close up but lilys making her first public appearance at the slims and she sent me tickets for all the matches would you like to go i thought briefly of telling her to go to hell of saying id had enough tennisenough of the oberststo last me forever but i found myself agreeing to meet her outside the box office on harrison the next morning at the old swimming hole i the gym was dankchlorine and sweat combined in a hot sticky mass shouts from the trainers from the swimmers from the spectators bounced from the high metal ceilings and back and forth from the benches lining the pool on two sides the cacophony set up an unpleasant buzzing in my head i was not enjoying myself my shirt was soaked through with sweat anyway i was too old to sit cheering on a bleacher for two hours but alicia had been insistenti had to be there in person for her to get points on her sponsor card alicia alonso dauphine and i went to high school together her parents had bestowed a prima ballerinas name on her but alicia showed no aptitude for fine arts from her earliest years all she wanted was to muck around with engines at eighteen off she went to the university of illinois to study aeronautics despite her lack of interest in dance alicia was very athletic next to airplanes the only thing she really cared about was competitive swimming i used to cheer her when she was ncaa swimming champ always with a bit of irritation about being locked in a dank noisy gym for hours at a timeswimming is not a great spectator sport but after all what are friends for when alicia joined berman aircraft as an associate engineer we drifted our separate ways we met occasionally at weddings confirmations bar mitzvahs my how our friends were aging childlessness seemed to suspend us in time but each new ceremony in their lives marked a new milestone toward old age for the women we had played with in school then last week id gotten a call from alicia berman was mounting a team for a citywide corporate competitionmoney would be raised through sponsors for the american cancer society both alicias mother and mine had died of cancerwould i sponsor her for so many meters doubling my contribution if she won it was only after id made the pledge that i realized she expected me there in person one of her sponsors had to show up to testify that shed done it and all the others were busy with their homes and children and come on v i what do you do all day long i need you how can you know youre being manipulated and still let it happen i hunched an impatient shoulder and turned back to the starting blocks from where i sat alicia was just another bathingsuited body with a cap her distinctive cheekbones were softened and flattened by the dim fluorescence not a wisp of her thick black hair trailed around her face she was wearing a bright red tank suitno extra straps or flounces to slow her down in the water the swimmers had been wandering around the side of the pool swinging their arms to stretch out the muscles not talking much while the timers argued some inaudible point with the referee now a police whistle shrilled faintly in the din and the competitors snapped to attention moving toward the starting blocks at the far end of the pool we were about to watch the fiftymeter freestyle i looked at the handscribbled card alicia had given me before the meet after the fiftymeter she was in a relay then i could leave the swimmers were mounting the blocks when someone began complaining again the woman from the ajax insurance team seemed to be having a problem with the lane marker on the inside of her lane the referee reshuffled the swimmers leaving the offending lane empty the swimmers finally mounted the blocks again timers got into position standing to see the start of the race i was no longer certain which of the women was alicia two of the other six contenders also wore red tank suits with their features smoothed by caps and dimmed lighting they all became anonymous one red suit was in lane two one in lane three one in lane six the referee raised the starting gun swimmers got set arms swung back for the dive then the gun and seven bodies flung themselves into the water perfect dive in lane sixhad to be alicia surfacing pulling away from all but one other swimmer a fast little woman from the brokerage house of feldstein holtz and woods problems for the redsuited woman in lane two i hadnt seen her dive but she was having trouble righting herself couldnt seem to make headway in the lane now everyone was noticing her whistles were blowing the man on the loudspeaker tried ineffectually to call for silence i pushed my way through the crowds on the benches and vaulted over the barrier dividing the spectators from the water useless over the din to order someone into the pool for her useless to point out the growing circle of red i kicked off running shoes and dove from the side swimming underwater to the second lane not alicia surely not seeing the water turn red around me find the woman surface drag her to the edge where finally a few galvanized hands pulled her out i scrambled from the pool and picked out someone in a striped referees shirt get a fire department ambulance as fast as you can he stared at me with a stupid gape to his jaw dial damn it do it now i pushed him toward the door hard and he suddenly broke into a trot i knelt beside the woman she was breathing but shallowly i felt her gently hard to find the source of bleeding with the wet suit but i thought it came from the upper back demanding help from one of the bystanders i carefully turned her to her side blood was oozing now not pouring from a wound below her left shoulder pack it with towels elevate her feet keep the crowd back wait wait watch the shallow breathing turn to choking mouthtomouth does no good who knows cardiopulmonary resuscitation a muscular young man in skimpy bikini shorts comes forward and works at her chest by the time the paramedics hustle in with stretcher and equipment the shallow choking breath has stopped they take her to the hospital but we all know its no good as the stretcherbearers trotted away the rest of the room came back into focus alicia was standing at my side black hair hanging damply to her shoulders watching me with fierce concentration everyone else seemed to be shrieking in unison the sound reechoing from the rafters was more unbearable than ever i stood up put my mouth close to alicias ear and asked her to take me to whoever was in charge she pointed to a man in an izod tshirt standing on the other side of the hole left by the dead swimmers body i went to him immediately im v i warshawski im a private detective that woman was murderedshot through the back whoever shot her probably left during the confusion but youd better get the cops here now and tell everyone over your megaphone that no one leaves until the police have seen them he looked contemptuously at my dripping jeans and shirt do you have anything to back up this preposterous statement i held out my hands blood i said briefly then grabbed the microphone from him may i have your attention please my voice bounced around the hollow room my name is v i warshawski i am a detective there has been a serious accident in the pool until the police have been here and talked to us none of us must leave this area i am asking the six timers who were at the far end of the pool to come here now there was silence for a minute then renewed clamor a handful of people picked their way along the edge of the pool toward me the man in the izod shirt was fulminating but lacked the guts to try to grab the mike when the timers came up to me i said you six are the only ones who definitely could not have killed the woman i want you to stand at the exits i tapped each in turn and sent them to a posttwo to the doors on the second floor at the top of the bleachers two to the groundfloor exits and one each to the doors leading to the mens and womens dressing rooms dont let anyone regardless of anything he or she says leave if they have to use the bathroom toughhold it until the cops get here anyone tries to leave keep them here if they want to fight let them go but get as complete a description as you can they trotted off to their stations i gave izod back his mike made my way to a pay phone in the corner and dialed the eleventh street homicide number ii sergeant mcgonnigal was not fighting sarcasm as hard as he might have you sent the guy to guard the upstairs exit and he waltzed away probably taking the gun with him he must be on his knees in some church right now thanking god for sending a pushy private investigator to this race i bit my lips he couldnt be angrier with me than i was with myself i sneezed and shivered in my damp clammy clothes youre right sergeant i wish youd been at the meet instead of me youd probably have had ten uniformed officers with you who couldve taken charge as soon as the starting gun was fired and avoided this mess do any of the timers know who the man was we were in an office that the school athletic department had given the police for their investigationscene headquarters mcgonnigal had been questioning all the timers figuring their closeness to the pool gave them the best angle on what had happened one was missing the man id sent to the upper balcony exit the sergeant grudgingly told me hed been over that ground with the other timers none of them knew who the missing man was each of the companies in the meet had supplied volunteers to do the timing and other odd jobs everyone just assumed this man was from someone elses firm no one had noticed him that closely their attention was focused on the action in the pool my brief glance at him gave the police their best description medium height short brown hair wearing a pale green tshirt and faded white denim shorts yes baggy enough for a gun to fit in a pocket unnoticed you know sergeant i asked for the six timers at the far end of the pool because they were facing the swimmers so none of them could have shot the dead woman in the back this guy came forward that means theres a timer missingeither the person actually down at the far end was in collusion or youre missing a body mcgonnigal made an angry gesturenot at me himself for not having thought of it before he detailed two uniformed cops to round up all the volunteers and find out who the errant timer was any more information on the dead woman mcgonnigal picked up a pad from the paperlittered desk in front of him her name was louise carmody you know that she was twentyfour she worked for the ft dearborn bank and trust as a junior lending officer you know that her boss is very shockedyou probably could guess that and she has no enemies no dead person ever does was she working on anything sensitive he gave me a withering glance what twentyfouryearold junior loan officer works on anything sensitive lots i said firmly no senior person ever does the grubby work a junior officer crunches numbers or gathers basic data for crunching was she working on any project that someone might not want her to get data for mcgonnigal shrugged wearily but made a note on a second padthe closest he would come to recognizing that i might have a good suggestion i sneezed again do you need me for anything else id like to get home and dry off no go id just as soon you werent around when lieutenant mallory arrives anyway bobby mallory was mcgonnigals boss he was also an old friend of my father who had been a beat sergeant until his death fifteen years earlier bobby did not like women on the crime scene in any capacityvictim perpetrator or investigatorand he especially did not like his old friend tonys daughter on the scene i appreciated mcgonnigals unwillingness to witness any acrimony between his boss and me and was getting up to leave when the uniformed cops came back the sixth timer had been found in a supply closet behind the mens lockers he was concussed and groggy from a head wound and couldnt remember how he got to where he was couldnt remember anything past lunchtime i waited long enough to hear that and slid from the room alicia was waiting for me at the far end of the hall she had changed from her suit into jeans and a pullover and was squatting on her heels staring fiercely at nothing when she saw me coming she stood up and pushed her black hair out of her eyes you look a mess v i thanks im glad to get help and support from my friends after theyve dragged me into a murder investigation oh dont get angryi didnt mean it that way im sorry i dragged you into a murder investigation no im not actually im glad you were on hand can we talk after i put some dry clothes on and stop looking a mess she offered me her jacket since im five eight to her five four it wasnt much of a cover but i draped it gratefully over my shoulders to protect myself from the chilly october evening at my apartment alicia followed me into the bathroom while i turned on the hot water do you know who the dead woman was the police wouldnt tell us yes i responded irritably and if youll give me time to warm up ill tell you bathing is not a group sport in this apartment she trailed back out of the bathroom her face set in tense lines when i joined her in the living room some twenty minutes later a towel around my damp hair she was sitting in front of the television set changing channels no news yet she said briefly who was the dead girl louise carmody junior loan officer at the ft dearborn you know her alicia shook her head do the police know why she was shot theyre just starting to investigate what do you know about it nothing are they going to put her name on the news probably if the familys been notified why is this important no reason it just seems so ghoulish reporters hovering around her dead body and everything could i have the truth please she sprang to her feet and glared at me it is the truth screw that you dont know her name you spin the tv dials to see the reports and now you think its ghoulish for the reporters to hover around tell you what i think alicia i think you know who did the shooting they shuffled the swimmers nobody knew who was in which lane you started out in lane two and youd be dead if the woman from ajax hadnt complained who wants to kill you her black eyes glittered in her white face no one why dont you have a little empathy vic i might have been killed there was a madman out there who shot a woman why dont you give me some sympathy i jumped into a pool to pull that woman out i sat around in wet clothes for two hours talking to the cops im beat you want sympathy go someplace else the little i have is reserved for myself tonight id really like to know why i had to be at the pool if it wasnt to ward off a potential attacker and if youd told me the real reason louise carmody might still be alive damn you vic stop doubting every word i say i told you why i needed you theresomeone had to sign the card millie works during the day so does fredda katie has a new baby elene is becoming a grandmother for the first time get off my goddamn back if youre not going to tell me the truth and if youre going to scream at me about it id just as soon you left she stood silent for a minute sorry vic ill get a better grip on myself great you do that im fixing some supperwant any she shook her head when i returned with a plate of pasta and olives joan druggen was just announcing the top local story alicia sat with her hands clenched as they stated the dead womans name after that she didnt say much just asked if she could crash for the nightshe lived in warrenville a good hours drive from town near bermans aeronautic engineering labs i gave her pillows and a blanket for the couch and went to bed i was pretty angry i figured she wanted to sleep over because she was scared and it infuriated me that she wouldnt talk about it when the phone woke me at my throat was raw the start of a cold brought on by sitting around in wet clothes for so long a heavy voice asked for alicia i dont know who youre talking about i said hoarsely be your age warshawski she brought you to the gym she isnt at her own place shes gotta be with you you dont want to wake her up give her a message she was lucky tonight we want the money by noon or she wont be so lucky a second time he hung up i held the receiver a second longer and heard another click the living room extension i pulled on a dressing gown and padded down the hallway the apartment door shut just as i got to the living room i ran to the top of the stairs alicias footsteps were echoing up and down the stairwell alicia aliciayou cant go out there alone come back here the slamming of the entryway door was my only answer iii i didnt sleep well my cold mixing with worry and anger over alicia at eight i hoisted my aching body out of bed and sat sneezing over some steaming fruit juice while i tried to focus my brain on possible action alicia owed somebody money that somebody was pissed off enough to kill because he didnt have it bankers do not kill wayward loan customers loan sharks do but what could alicia have done to rack up so much indebtedness berman probably paid her seventy or eighty thousand a year for the special kinds of designs she did on aircraft wings and she was the kind of client a bank usually values so what did she need money for that only a shark would provide the clock was ticking i called her office shed phoned in sick the secretary didnt know where she was calling from but had assumed home on a dim chance i tried her home phone no answer alicia had one brother tom an insurance agent on the far south side after a few tries i located his office in flossmoor he hadnt heard from alicia for weeks and no he didnt know who she might owe money to reluctantly tom gave me their fathers phone number in florida mr dauphine hadnt heard from his daughter either if she calls you or if she shows up please let me know shes in trouble up here and the only way i can help her is by knowing where she is i gave him the number without much expectation of hearing from him again i did know someone who might be able to give me a line on her debts a year or so earlier id done a major favor for don pasquale a local mob leader if she owed him money he might listen to my intercession if not he might be able to tell me whom she had borrowed from torfinos an elmwood park restaurant where the don had a parttime office put me through to his chief assistant ernesto a wellremembered gravel voice told me i sounded awful thank you ernesto i snuffled did you hear about the death of louise carmody at the university of illinois gym last night she was probably shot by mistake poor thing the intended victim was a woman named alicia dauphine we grew up together so i feel a little solicitous on her behalf she owes a lot of money to someone i wondered if you know who name isnt familiar warshawski ill check around and call you back my cold made me feel as though i was at the bottom of a fish tank i couldnt think fast enough or hard enough to imagine where alicia might have gone to ground perhaps at her house believing if she didnt answer the phone no one would think she was home it wasnt a very clever idea but it was the best i could do in my muffled snuffled state the old farmhouse in warrenville that alicia had modernized lay behind the local high school the boys were out practicing football they were wearing light jerseys i had on my winter coateven though the day was warm my cold made me shiver and want to be bundled up although we were close enough that i could see their mouthpieces they didnt notice me as i walked around the house looking for signs of life alicias car was in the garage but the house looked cold and unoccupied as i made my way to the back a blackandwhite cat darted out from the bushes and began weaving itself around my ankles mewing piteously alicia had three cats this one wanted something to eat alicia had installed a sophisticated burglar alarm systemshe had an office in her home and often worked on preliminary designs there an expert had gotten through the system into the pantrysome kind of epoxy had been sprayed on the wires to freeze them then somehow disabling the phone link the intruder had cut through the wires my stomach muscles tightened and i wished futilely for the smith wesson locked in my safe at home my cold really had addled my brains for me not to take it on such an errand still where burglars lead shall pis hesitate i opened the window slid a leg over and landed on the pantry floor my feline friend followed more gracefully she promptly abandoned me to start sniffing at the pantry walls cautiously opening the door i slid into the kitchen it was deserted the refrigerator and clock motors humming gently a dry dishcloth draped over the sink in the living room another cat joined me and followed me into the electronic wonderland of alicias study she had used builtin bookcases to house her computers and other gadgets the printers were tucked along a side wall and wires ran everywhere whoever had broken in was not interested in merchandisethe street value of her study contents would have brought in a nice return but they stood unharmed by now i was dreading the trek upstairs the second cat a tabby trotted briskly ahead of me tail waving like a flag alicias bedroom door was shut i kicked it open with my right leg and pressed myself against the wall nothing dropping to my knees i looked in the bed tidily covered with an oldfashioned white spread was empty so was the bathroom so was the guest room and an old sun porch glassed in and converted to a solarium the person who broke in had not come to stealeverything was preternaturally tidy so he she had come to attack alicia the hair stood up on the nape of my neck where was he not in the house hiding outside i started down the stairs again when i heard a noise a heavy scraping i froze trying to locate the source a movement caught my eye at the line of vision the hatch to the crawl space had been shoved open an arm swung down for a split second only i stared at the arm and the gun in its grip then leaped down the stairs two at a time a heavy thudthe man jumping onto the upper landing the crack as the gun fired a jolt in my left shoulder and i gasped with shock and fell the last few steps to the bottom righted myself reached for the deadlock on the front door heard an outraged squawk loud swearing and a crash that sounded like a man falling downstairs then i had the door open and was staggering outside while an angry bundle of for poured past me one of the cats a heroine tripping my assailant and saving my life iv i never really lost consciousness the football players saw me stagger down the sidewalk and came trooping over in their concern for me they failed to tackle the gunman but they got me to a hospital where a young intern eagerly set about removing the slug from my shoulder the winter coat had protected me from major damage between my cold and the gunshot i was just as happy to let him incarcerate me for a few days they tucked me into bed and i fell into a heavy uneasy sleep i had jumped into the black waters of lake michigan in search of alicia trying to reach her ahead of a shark she was lurking just out of reach she didnt know that her oxygen tank ran out at noon when i finally woke soaked with sweat it was dark outside the room was ht faindy by a fluorescent light over the sink a lean man in a brown wool business suit was sitting next to the bed when he saw me looking at him he reached into his coat if he was going to shoot me there wasnt a thing i could do about iti was too limp from my heavy sleep to move instead of a gun though he pulled out an id case miss warshawski peter carlton federal bureau of investigation i know youre not feeling well but i need to talk to you about alicia dauphine so the shark ate her i said what he demanded sharply what does that mean nothing where is she we dont know thats what we want to talk to you about she went home with you after the swimming meet yesterday correct gosh mr carlton i love watching my tax dollars at work if youve been following her you must have a better fix on her whereabouts than i do i last saw her around twothirty this morning if its still today that is what did she talk to you about my mind was starting to unfog why is the bureau interested in ms dauphine he didnt want to tell me all he wanted was every word alicia had said to me when i wouldnt budge he started in on why i was in her house and what i had noticed there finally i said mr carlton if you cant tell me why youre interested in ms dauphine theres no way i can respond to your questions i dont believe the bureauor the policeor anyone come to thathas any right to pry into the affairs of citizens in the hopes of turning up some scandal you tell me why youre interested and ill tell you if i know anything relevant to that interest with an ill grace he said we believe she has been selling defense department secrets to the chinese no i said flatly she wouldnt some wing designs she was working on have disappeared shes disappeared and a chinese functionary in st charles has disappeared sounds pretty circumstantial to me the wing designs might be in her home they could easily be on a disk someplaceshe did all her drafting on computer theyd been through her computer files at home and at work and found nothing her boss did not have copies of the latest design only of the early stuff i thought about the heavy voice on the phone demanding money but loyalty to alicia made me keep it to myselfgive her a chance to tell her story first i did give him everything alicia had said her nervousness and her sudden departure that i was worried about her and went to see if she was in her house and was shot by an intruder hiding in the crawl space who might have taken her designs although nothing looked pilfered he didnt believe me i dont know if he thought i knew something i wasnt telling or if he thought i had joined alicia in selling secrets to the chinese but he kept at me for so long that i finally pushed my call button when the nurse arrived i explained that i was worn out and could she please show my visitor out he left but promised me that he would return cursing my weakness i fell asleep again when i next awoke it was morning and both my cold and my shoulder were much improved when the doctors came by on their morning visit i got their agreement to a discharge before i bathed and left the warrenville police sent out a man who took a detailed statement i called my answering service from a phone in the lobby ernesto had been in touch i reached him at torfinos saw about your accident in the papers warshawski how you feeling about dauphine apparently shes signed a note for seven hundred fifty thousand dollars to art smollensk cant do anything to help you out the don sends his best wishes for your recovery art smollensk gambling king when i worked for the public defender id had to defend some of his smalltime employeespeople at the level of smashing someones fingers in a car door the ones who did hits and arson usually could afford their own attorneys alicia as a gambler made no sense to mebut we hadnt been close for over a decade there were lots of things i didnt know about her at home for a change of clothes i stopped in the basement where i store useless mementos in a locked stall after fifteen minutes of shifting boxes around i was sweating and my left shoulder was throbbing and oozing stickily but id located my high school yearbook i took it upstairs with me and thumbed through it trying to gain inspiration on where alicia might have gone to earth none came i was about to leave again when the phone rang it was alicia talking against a background of noise thank god youre safe vic i saw about the shooting in the paper please dont worry about me im okay stay away and dont worry she hung up before i could ask her anything i concentrated not on what shed said but what had been in the background metal doors banging open and shut lots of loud wild talking not an airportthe talking was too loud for that and there werent any intercom announcements in the background i knew what it was if id just let my mind relax it would come to me idly flipping through the yearbook i looked for faces alicia might trust i found my own staring from a group photo of the girls basketball team id been a guardvictoria the protectress from way back on the next page alicia smiled fiercely holding a swimming trophy her coach who also taught latin had desperately wanted alicia to train for the olympics but alicia had had her heart set on the u of i and engineering suddenly i knew what the clanking was where alicia was no other sound like that exists anywhere on earth v alicia and i grew up under the shadow of the steel mills in south chicago nowhere else has the deterioration of american industry shown up more clearly wisconsin steel is padlocked shut the south works are a fragment of their former monstrous grandeur unemployment is over percent and the number of jobless youths lounging in the bars and on the streets had grown from the days when i hurried past them to the safety of my mothers house the high school was more derelict than i remembered many windows were boarded over the asphalt playground was cracked and covered with litter and the bleachers around the football field were badly weathered the guard at the doorway demanded my business i showed her my pi license and said i needed to talk to the womens gym teacher on confidential business after some dickeringhostile on her side snuffly on mineshe gave me a pass i didnt need directions down the scuffed corridors past the battered lockers past the smell of rancid oil coming from the cafeteria to the noise and life of the gym teenage girls in gold shirts and black shortsthe school colorswere shrieking jumping wailing in pursuit of volleyballs i watched the pandemonium until the buzzer ended the period then walked up to the instructor she was panting and sweating and gave me an incurious glance looking only briefly at the pass i held out for her yes you have a new swimming coach dont you just a volunteer are you from the union she isnt drawing a paycheck but miss finley the head coach is desperately shorthandedshe teaches latin you knowand this woman is a big help im not from the union im her trainer i need to talk to herfind out why shes dropped out and whether she plans to compete in any of her meets this fill the teacher gave me the hard look of someone used to sizing up fabricated excuses i didnt think she believed me but she told me i could go into the pool area and talk to the swim coach the pool dated to the time when this high school served an affluent neighborhood it was twentyfive yards long built with skylights along the outer wall you reached it through the changing rooms separate ones with showers for girls and boys it didnt have an outside hallway entrance alicia was perched alone on the high dive a few students boys and girls were splashing about in the pool but no organized training was in progress alicia was staring at nothing i cupped my hands and called up to her youre not working very hard at your new job at that she turned and recognized me vic her cry was enough to stop the splashing in the pool howare you alone im alone come down i took a slug in the shoulderid rather not climb up after you she shot off the board in a perfect arc barely rippling the surface of the water the kids watched with envy i was pretty jealous myselfnothing i do is done with that much grace she surfaced near me but looked at the students i want you guys swimming laps she said sharply what do you think this issummer camp they left us reluctantly and began swimming how did you find me it was easy i was looking through the yearbook trying to think of someone you would trust miss finley was the simple answeri remembered how you practically lived in her house for two years you liked to read jane eyre together and she adored you you are in deep trouble smollensk is after you and so is the fbi you cant hide here forever youd better talk to the bureau guys they wont love you but at least theyre not going to shoot you the fbi whatever for your designs sweetie pie your designs and the chinese the fbi are the people who look into that kind of thing vic i dont know what youre talking about the words were said with such slow deliberateness that i was almost persuaded the seven hundred fifty thousand dollars you owe art smollensk she shook her head then said oh yes that yes that i guess it seems like more money to me than it does to you or had you forgotten louise carmody getting shot anyway a known chinese spy left fermilab yesterday or the day before and youre gone and some of your wing designs are gone and the fbi thinks youve sold them overseas and maybe gone east yourself i didnt tell them about art but theyll probably get to him before too long how sure are they that the designs are gone your boss cant find them maybe you have a duplicate set at home nobody knows about she shook her head again i dont leave that kind of thing at home i had them last saturday working but i took the diskettes back her voice trailed off as a look of horror washed across her face oh no this is worse than i thought she hoisted herself out of the pool ive got to go got to get away before someone else figures out im here alicia for christs sake what has happened she stopped and looked at me tears swimming in her black eyes if i could tell anyone it would be you vic then she was jogging into the girls changing room leaving the students in the pool swimming laps i stuck with her where are you going the feds have a hook on any place you have friends or relations smollensk does too that stopped her tom too tom first last and foremost hes the only relative you have in chicago she was starting to shiver in the bare corridor i grabbed her and shook her tell me the truth alicia i cant fly blind i already took a bullet in the shoulder suddenly she was sobbing on my chest oh vic its been so awful you cant know you cant understand you wont believe she was hiccuping i led her into the shower room and found a towel rubbing her down i got the story in choking bits and pieces tom was the gambler hed gotten into it in a small way in high school and college after he went into business for himself the habit grew hed mortgaged his insurance agency assets taken out a second mortgage on the house but couldnt stop he came to me two weeks ago told me he was going to start filing false claims with his companies collect the money she gave a twisted smile he didnt have to put that kind of pressure oni cant help helping him but alicia why and how does art smollensk have your name is that the man tom owes money to i think he uses my namealonso my middle namei know he does i just dont like to think about it someone came around threatening me three years ago i told tom never to use my name again and he didnt for a long time but now i guess he was desperateseven hundred fifty thousand dollars you know as to why i help him you never had any brothers or sisters so maybe you cant understand when mom died i was thirteen he was six i looked after him got him out of trouble all kinds of stuff it gets to be a habit i guess or an obligation thats why ive never married you know never had any children of my own i dont want any more responsibilities like this one and the designs she looked horrified again he came over for dinner on saturday id been working all day on the things and he came into the study when i was logging off i didnt tell him it was defense department work but its not too hard to figure out what i do is defenserelatedafter all thats all berman does we dont make commercial aircraft i havent had a chance to look at the designs sincei worked out all day sunday getting ready for that damned meet monday tom must have taken my diskettes and swapped the labels with some othersive got tons of them lying around she gave a twisted smile it was a gamble a gamble that thered be something valuable on them and a gamble i wouldnt discover the switch before he got rid of them but hes a gambler i see look alicia you can only be responsible for tom so far even if you could bail him out this timeand i dont see how you possibly cantherell be a next time and you may not survive this one to help him again lets call the fbi she squeezed her eyes shut you dont understand vic you cant possibly understand while i was trying to reason her into phoning the bureau miss finley swim coachcumromanticlatinteacher came briskly into the locker room allie one of the girls came to get me are you all she did a double take victoria good to see you have you come to help allie i told her she could count on you have you told her whats going on i demanded of alicia yes miss finley knew most of the story agreed that it was very worrying but said allie could not possibly turn in her own brother she had given allie a gym mat and some bedding to sleep onshe could just stay at the gym until the furor died down and they could think of something else to do i sat helplessly as miss finley led alicia off to get some dry clothes at last when they didnt rejoin me i sought them out poking through halfremembered halls and doors until i found the staff coaching office alicia was alone looking about fifteen in an old cheerleaders uniform miss finley had dug up for her miss finley teaching i asked sharply alicia looked guilty but defiant yes twothirty class look the critical thing is to get those diskettes back i called tom explained it to him told him id try to help him raise the money but that we couldnt let the chinese have those things he agreed so hes bringing them out here the room rocked slightly around me no i know you dont have much of a sense of humor but this is a joke isnt it she didnt understand wouldnt understand that if the chinese had already left the country tom no longer had the material that if tom was coming here she was the scapegoat at last despairing i said where is he meeting you here i told him id be at the pool will you do one thing my way will you go to miss finleys class and conjugate verbs for fortyfive minutes and let me meet him at the pool please at last her jaw set stubbornly she agreed she still wouldnt let me call the bureau though not until ive talked to tom myself it may all be a mistake you know we both knew it wasnt but i saw her into the latin class without making the phone call i knew it was my duty to make and returned to the pool driving out the two students still splashing around in the water i put signs on the locker room doors saying the water was contaminated and there would be no swimming until further notice i turned out the lights and settled in a corner of the room remote from the outside windows to wait and go over and over the story in my mind i believed it was i fooling myself was that why she wouldnt call the feds at last tom came in through the boys locker room entrance allie allie his voice bounced off the high rafters and echoed around me i was well back in the shadows my smith wesson in hand he didnt see me after half a minute or so another man joined him i didnt recognize the stranger but his baggy clothes marked him as part of smollensks group not the bureau he talked softly to tom for a minute then they went into the girls locker room together whey they returned i had moved part way up the side of the pool ready to follow them if they went back into the main part of the high school looking for alicia tom i called its v i warshawski i know the whole story give me the diskettes warshawski he yelled what the hell are you doing here i sensed rather than saw the movement his friend made i shot at him and dived into the water his bullet zipped as it hit the tiles where id been standing my wet clothes and my sore shoulder made it hard to move another bullet hit the water by my head and i went under again fumbling with my heavy jacket getting it free surfacing hearing alicias sharp tom why are you shooting at vic stop it now stop it and give me back the diskettes another flurry of shots this time away from me giving me a chance to get to the side of the pool to climb out alicia lay on the floor near the door to the girls locker room tom stood silently by the gunman was jamming more bullets into his gun as fast as i could in my sodden clothes i lumbered to the hit man grabbing his arm squeezing feeling blood start to seep from my shoulder stepping on his instep putting all the force of my body into my leg tom though tom was taking the gun from him tom was going to shoot me drop that gun tom dauphine it was miss finley years of teaching in a tough school gave creditable authority to her tom dropped the gun vi alicia lived long enough to tell the truth to the fbi it was small comfort to me small consolation to see toms statement he hoped he could get smollensk to kill his sister before she said anything if that happened he had a good gamble on her dying a traitor in everyones eyesafter all her designs were gone and her name was in smollensks files maybe the truth never would have come out worth a gamble to a betting man the feds arrived about five minutes after the shooting stopped theyd been watching tom just not closely enough they were sore that theyd let alicia get shot so they dumped some charges on meobstructing federal authorities not telling them where alicia was not calling as soon as i had the truth from her god knows what else i spent several days in jail it seemed like a suitable penance just not enough of one the maltese cat i her voice on the phone had been soft and husky with just a whiff of the south laid across it like a rare perfume id rather come to your office i dont want people in mine to know ive hired a detective id offered to see her at her home in the eveningmy spartan office doesnt invite client confidences but she didnt want to wait until tonight she wanted to come today almost at once and no she wouldnt meet me in a restaurant far too hard to talk and this was extremely personal you know my specialty is financial crime dont you i asked sharply yes thats how i got your name one oclock fourth floor of the pulteney right and shed hung up without telling me who she was an errand at the county building took me longer than id expected it was close to onethirty by the time i got back to the pulteney my callers problem apparently was urgent she was waiting outside my office door tapping one high heel impatiently on the floor as i trudged down the hall in my running shoes ms warshawski i thought you were standing me up no such luck i grunted opening my office door for her in the dimly lit hall shed just been a slender silhouette under the office lights the set of the shoulders and signature buttons told me her suit had come from the hands of someone at chanel its blue enhanced the cobalt of her eyes soft makeup hid her natural skin tonesi couldnt tell if that dark red hair was natural or merely expertly painted she scanned the spare furnishings and picked the cleaner of my two visitor chairs my time is valuable ms warshawski if id known you were going to keep me waiting without a place to sit i would have finished some phone calls before walking over here id dressed in jeans and a work shirt for a day at the recorder of deeds office feeling dirty and outclassed made me grumpy you hung up without giving me your name or number so there wasnt much i could do to let you know youd have to stand around in your pointy little shoes my times valuable too why dont you tell me where the fire is so i can start putting it out she flushed when i turn red i look blotchy but in her it only enhanced her makeup its my sister the whiff of southern increased corinne shes run off to jamy exhusband and i need someone to tell her to come back i made a disgusted face i cant believe i raced back from the county building to listen to this its not you know she may be making a mistake but presumably she can sort it out for herself her flush darkened im not being very clear im sorry im not used to having to ask for things my sistercorinneshes only fourteen shes my ward im sixteen years older than she is our parents died three years ago and shes been living with me since then its not easy not easy for either of us moving from mobile to here was just the beginning when she got here she wanted to run around do all the things you cant do in mobile she waved a hand to indicate what kinds of things those might be she thinks im a tough bitch and that i was too hard on my exhusband shes known him since she was three and he was a big hero she couldnt see hed changed or not changed just not had the chance to be heroic anymore in public so when she took off two days ago i assumed she went there hes not answering his phone or the doorbell i dont know if theyve left town or hes just playing possum or what i need someone who knows how to get people to open their doors and knows how to talk to people at least if i could see corinne i mighti dont know she broke off with a helpless gesture that didnt match her sophisticated looks nothing like responsibility for a minor to deflate even the most urbane i grimaced more ferociously why dont we start with your name and your husbands name and address and then move on to her friends her friends the deep blue eyes widened id just as soon this didnt get around people talk and even though its not it could be hard on her when she gets back to school i suppressed a howl you cant come around demanding my expertise and then tell me what or what not to do what if shes not with your husband what if i cant get in touch with you when ive found that out and shes in terrible trouble and her life depends on my turning up some new leads if you cant bring yourself to divulge a few namesstarting with your ownyoud better go find yourself a more pliant detective i can recommend a couple who have waiting rooms she set her lips tightly whatever she did she was in commandpeople didnt talk to her that way and get away with it for a few seconds it looked as though i might be free to get back to the recorder of deeds that afternoon but then she shook her head and forced a smile to her lips i was told not to mind your abrasiveness because you were the best im brigitte leblanc my sisters name is corinne also leblanc and my exhusband is charles pierce she scooted her chair up to the desk so she could scribble his address on a sheet of paper torn from a memo pad in her bag she scrawled busily for several minutes then handed me a list that included corinnes three closest school friends along with pierces address im late for a meeting ill call you tonight to see if youve made any progress she got up not so fast i said i get a retainer you have to sign a contract and i need a number where i can reach you i really am late and im really too busy to hunt for your sister if you have a sister you cant be that worried if your meeting is more important than she is her scowl would have terrified me if id been alone with her in an alley after dark i do have a sister and i spent two days trying to get into my exhusbands place and then in tracking down people who could recommend a private detective to me i cant do anything else to help her except go earn the money to pay your fee i pulled a contract from my desk drawer and stuck it in the manual olivetti that had belonged to my mothera typewriter so old that i had to order special ribbons for it from italy a word processor would be cheaper and more impressive but the wrist action keeps my forearms strong i got ms leblanc to give me her address to sign on the dotted line for a day plus expenses to write in the name of a guaranteeing financial institution and to hand over a check for two hundred when shed left i wrestled with my office windows hoping to let some air in to blow her pricey perfume away carbon flakes from the el would be better than the lingering scent but the windows painted over several hundred times wouldnt budge i turned on a desktop fan and frowned sourly at her bold black signature what was her exhusbands real name shed bitten off ja could be james or jake but it sure wasnt charles did she really have a sister was this just a ploy to get back at a guy late on his alimony although pierces address on north winthrop didnt sound like the place for a man who could afford alimony maybe everything went to keep her in chanel suits while he lived on skid row she wasnt in the phone book so i couldnt check her own address on belden the operator told me the number was unlisted i called a friend at the ft dearborn trust the bank brigitte had drawn her check on and was assured that there was plenty more where that came from my friend told me brigitte had parlayed the proceeds of a highpriced modeling career into a successful media consulting firm and if you ever read the fashion pages youd know these things get your nose out of the sports section from time to time vicitll help with your career thanks eva i hung up with a snap at least my client wouldnt turn out to be named something else always a good beginning to a tawdry case i looked in the little mirror perched over my filing cabinet a dust smudge on my right cheek instead of peach blush was the only distinction between me and ms leblanc since i was dressed appropriately for north winthrop i shut up my office and went to retrieve my car ii charles pierce lived in a dismal tenflat built flush onto the uptown sidewalk ragged sheets made haphazard curtains in those windows that werent boarded over empty bottles lined the entryway but the smell of stale ripple couldnt begin to mask the stench of fresh urine if corinne leblanc had run away to this place life with brigitte must be unmitigated hell my clients exhusband lived in e i knew that because shed told me those few mailboxes whose doors still shut wisely didnt trumpet their owners identities the filthy brass nameplate next to the doorbells was empty and the doorbells didnt work pushing open the rickety door to the hall i wondered again about my clients truthfulness she told me jahadnt answered his phone or his bell a rheumyeyed woman was sprawled across the bottom of the stairs sucking at a halfpint she stared at me malevolently when i asked her to move but she didnt actively try to trip me when i stepped over her it was only my foot catching in the folds of her overcoat the original building probably held two apartments per floor at least on the third floor only two doors at either end looked as though they went back to the massive elegant construction of the buildings beginnings the other seven were flimsy newcomers that had been hastily installed when an apartment was subdivided peering in the dark i found one labeled b and counted off three more to the right to get to e after knocking on the peeling veneer several times i noticed a button imbedded in the grime on the jamb when i pushed it i heard a buzz resonate inside no one came to the door with my ear against the filthy panel i could hear the faint hum of a television i held the buzzer down for five minutes its hard on the finger but harder on the ear if someone was really in there he should have come boiling to the door by now i could go away and come back but if pierce was lying doggo to avoid brigitte that wouldnt buy me anything she said shed tried off and on for two days the television might be running as a decoy ori pushed more lurid ideas from my mind and took out a collection of skeleton keys the second worked easily in the insubstantial lock in two minutes i was inside the apartment looking at an illustration from house beautiful in hell it was a single room with a countertop kitchen on the left side a tidy person could pull a corrugated screen to shield the room from signs of cooking but pierce wasnt tidy ten or fifteen stacked pots festooned with rotting food and roaches trembled precariously when i shut the door dominating the place was a murphy bed with a grotesquely fat man sprawled in at an ominous angle hed been watching tv when he died he was wearing frayed shiny pants with the fly lying carelessly open and a lumberjack shirt that didnt quite cover his enormous belly his monstrous size and the horrible angle at which his bald head was tilted made me gag i forced it down and walked through a pile of stale clothes to the bed lifting an arm the size of a tree trunk i felt for a pulse nothing moved in the heavy arm but the skin while clammy was firm i couldnt bring myself to touch any more of him but stumbled around the perimeter to peer at him from several angles i didnt see any obvious wounds let the medical examiner hunt out the obscure ones by the time i was back in the stairwell i was close to fainting only the thought of falling into someone elses urine or vomit kept me on my feet on the way down i tripped in earnest over the rheumyeyed womans coat sprawled on the floor at the bottom i couldnt keep from throwing up myself it didnt make me feel any better i dug a water bottle out of the detritus in my trunk and sponged myself off before calling the police they asked me to stay near the body i thought the front seat of my car on winthrop would be close enough while i waited for a meat wagon i wondered about my client could brigitte have come here after leaving me killed him and taken off while i was phoning around checking up on her if she had the rheumyeyed woman in the stairwell would have seen her would the bond forged by my tripping over her and vomiting in the hall be enough to get her to talk to me i got out of the car but before i could get back to the entrance the police arrived when we pushed open the rickety door my friend had evaporated i didnt bother mentioning her to the boysand girlin blue her description wouldnt stand out in uptown and even if they could find her she wouldnt be likely to say much we plodded up the stairs in silence there were four of them the woman and the youngest of the three men seemed in good shape the two older men were running sadly to flab i didnt think theyd be able to budge my clients exhusbands right leg let alone his mammoth redwood torso i got a feeling about this the oldest officer muttered more to himself than the rest of us i got a feeling when we got to e and he looked across at the mass on the bed he shook his head a couple of times yup i kind of knew as soon as i heard the call knew what tom the woman demanded sharply jade pierce he said knew he lived around here been a lot of complaints about him thought it might be him when i heard we was due to visit a real big guy the woman stopped her brisk march to the bed the rest of us looked at the behemoth in shared sorrow jade not james or jake but jade once the most famous down lineman the bears had ever fielded now i shuddered when he played for alabama some reporter said his bald head was as smooth and cold as a piece of jade and went on to spin some tiresome simile relating it to his play when he signed with the bears i was as happy as any other chicago fan even though his reputation for offfield violence was pretty unappetizing no wonder brigitte leblanc hadnt stayed with him but why hadnt she wanted to tell me who he really was i wrestled with that while tom called for reinforcements over his lapel mike so what were you doing here he asked me his exwife hired me to check up on him i dont usually tell the cops my clients business but i didnt feel like protecting brigitte she wanted to talk to him and he wasnt answering his phone or his door she wanted to check up on him the fit younger officer a man with high cheekbones and a welltended mustache echoed me derisively what i hear that split up was the biggest fight jade was ever in only big fight he ever lost too i smiled shes doing well he isnt wasnt maybe her conscience pricked her or maybe she wanted to rub his nose in it hard youd have to ask her all i can say is she asked me to try to get in i did and i called you guys while tom mulled this over i pulled out a card and handed it to him you can find me at this number if you want to talk to me he called out after me but i went on down the hall my footsteps echoing hollowly off the bare walls and ceiling iii brigitte leblanc was with a client and couldnt be interrupted the news that her exhusband had died couldnt pry her loose not even the idea that the cops would be around before long could move her after a combination of cajoling and heckling the receptionist leaned across her blond desk and whispered at me confidentially the vice president of the united states had come in for some private media coaching brigitte had said no interruptions unless it was the president or the popetwo people i wouldnt even leave a dental appointment to see when they made me unwelcome on the fortythird floor i rode downstairs and hung around the lobby at fivethirty a bevy of secret service agents swept me out to the street with the other loiterers fifteen minutes later the vice president came out his boyish face set in purposeful lines even though this was a private visit the vigilant television crews were waiting for him he grinned and waved but didnt say anything before climbing into his limo brigitte must be really good if shed persuaded him to shut up at seven i went back to the fortythird floor the double glass doors were locked and the lights turned off i found a key in my collection that worked the lock but when id prowled through the miles of thick gray plush explored the secured studios looked in all the offices i had to realize my client was smarter than me shed left by some back exit i gave a highpitched snarl i didnt lock the door behind me let someone come in and steal all the video equipment i didnt care i swung by brigittes threestory brownstone on belden she wasnt in the housekeeper didnt know when to expect her she was eating out and had said not to wait up for her how about corinne i asked sure that the woman would say corinne who shes not here either i slipped inside before she could shut the door on me im v i warshawski brigitte hired me to find her sister said shed run off to jade i went to his apartment corinne wasnt there and jade was dead ive been trying to talk to brigitte ever since but shes avoiding me i want to know a few things like if corinne really exists and did she really run away and could either she or brigitte have killed jade the housekeeper stared at me for a few minutes then made a sour face you got some id i showed her my pi license and the contract signed by brigitte her sour look deepened but she gave me a few spare details corinne was a fat unhappy teenager who didnt know how good she had it brigitte gave her everything taught her how to dress sent her to st scholastica even tried to get her to special diet clinics but she was never satisfied always whining about her friends back home in mobile trashy friends to whom she shouldnt be giving the time of day and yes she had run away three days ago now and she the housekeeper said good riddance but brigitte felt responsible and she was sorry that jade was dead but he was a violent man corinne had overidealized him she didnt realize what a monster he really was they cant turn it off when they come off the field you know as for who killed him he probably killed himself drinking too much i always said it would happen that way corinne couldnt have done it she doesnt have enough oomph to her and brigitte doesnt have any call toshe already got him beat six ways from sunday maybe she thought hed molested her sister shed have taken him to court and enjoyed seeing him humiliated all over again what a lovely cast of characters it filled me with satisfaction to think id allied myself to their fates i persuaded the housekeeper to give me a picture of corinne before going home she was indeed an overweight unhappylooking child it must be hard having a pictureperfect older sister trying to turn her into a junior deb i also got the housekeeper to give me brigittes unlisted home phone number by telling her if she didnt id be back every hour all night long ringing the bell i didnt turn on the radio going home i didnt want to hear the ghoulish excitement lying behind the unctuousness the reporters would bring to discussing jade pierces catastrophic fall from grace a rehashing of his nine seasons with the bears from the glory years to the last two where nagging knee and back injuries grew too great even for the painkillers and then to his harsh retirement putting seventy or eighty pounds of fat over his playing weight of the barroom fights the guns fired at other drivers from the front seat of his ferrari daytona then the sale of the ferrari to pay his legal bills and finally the threering circus that was his divorce ending on a murphy bed in a squalid uptown apartment i shut the trans ams door with a viciousness it didnt deserve and stomped up the three flights to my apartment fatigue mixed with bitterness dulled the sixth sense that usually warns me of danger the man had me pinned against my front door with a gun at my throat before i knew he was there i held my shoulder bag out to him be my guest then leave ive had a long day and i dont want to spend too much of it with you he spat i dont want your stupid little wallet youre not going to rape me so you might as well take my stupid little wallet im not interested in your body open your apartment i want to search it go to hell i kneed him in the stomach and swept my right arm up to knock his gun hand away he gagged and bent over i used my handbag as a clumsy bolas and whacked him on the back of the head he slumped to the floor unconscious i grabbed the gun from his flaccid hand feeling gingerly inside his coat i found a wallet his drivers license identified him as joel sirop living at a pricey address on dearborn parkway he sported a highend assortment of credit cardsbonwit neiman marcus an american express platinumand a card that said he was a member in good standing of the feline breeders association of north america i slid the papers back into his billfold and returned it to his breast pocket he groaned and opened his eyes after a few diffuse seconds he focused on me in outrage my head youve broken my head ill sue you go ahead ill hang on to your pistol for use in evidence at the trial ive got your name and address so if i see you near my place again ill know where to send the cops now leave not until ive searched your apartment he was unarmed and sickly but stubborn i leaned against my door out of reach but poised to stomp on him if he got cute what are you looking for mr sirop it was on the news how you found jade if the cat was there you must have taken it rest your soul there were no cats in that apartment when i got there had he stolen yours he shut his eyes apparently to commune with himself when he opened them again he said he had no choice but to trust me i smiled brightly and told him he could always leave so i could have dinner but he insisted on confiding in me do you know cats ms warshawski only in a manner of speaking i have a dog and she knows cats he scowled this is not a laughing matter have you heard of the maltese cat i guess ive heard of them theyre the ones without tails right he shuddered no you are thinking of the manx the maltesethey are usually a bluish gray very rarely will you see one that is almost blue brigitte leblanc hasor hadsuch a cat lady iva of cairo great i presume she got it to match her eyes he waved aside my comment as another frivolity her motives do not matter what matters is that the cat has been very difficult to breed she has now come into season for only the third time in her fouryear life brigitte agreed to let me try to mate lady iva with my sire casper of valletta it is imperative that she be sent to stay with him and soon but she has disappeared it was my turn to look disgusted i took a step down from my usual practice to look for a runaway teenager today im damned if im going to hunt a missing cat through the streets of chicago your sire will find her faster than i will matter of fact thats my advice drive around listening for the yowling of mighty sires and eventually youll find your maltese this runaway teenager this corinne it is probable that she took lady iva with her the kittens if they are born if they are purebred could fetch a thousand or more each she is not ignorant of that fact but if lady iva is out on the streets and some other sire finds her first they would be halfbreeds not worth the price of their veterinary care he spoke with the intense passion i usually reserve for discussing cubs or bears trades keeping myself turned toward him i unlocked my front door he flung himself at the opening with a ferocity that proved his long years with felines had rubbed off on him i grabbed his jacket as he hurtled past me but he tore himself free i am not leaving until i have searched your premises he panted i rubbed my head tiredly go ahead then i could have called the cops while he hunted around for lady iva instead i poured myself a whiskey and watched him crawl on his hands and knees making little whistling soundsperhaps the mating call of the maltese he went through my cupboards my stove the refrigerator even insisted his eyes wide with fear that i open the safe in my bedroom closet i removed the smith wesson i keep there before letting him look when hed inspected the back landing he had to agree that no cats were on the premises he tried to argue me into going downtown to check my office at that point my patience ran out i could have you arrested for attempted assault and criminal trespass so get out now while the goings good take your guy down to my office if shes in there and in heat hell start carrying on and you can call the cops just dont bother me i hustled him out the front door ignoring his protests i carefully did up all the locks i didnt want some other deranged cat breeder sneaking up on me in the middle of the night iv it was after midnight when i finally reached brigitte yes shed gotten my message about jade she was terribly sorry but since she couldnt do anything to help him now that he was dead she hadnt bothered to try to reach me were about to part company brigitte if you didnt know the guy was dead when you sent me up to winthrop youre going to have to prove it not to me but to the cops im talking to lieutenant mallory at the central district in the morning to tell him the rigmarole you spun me theyll also be able to figure out if you were more interested in finding corinne or your cat there was a long silence at the other end when she finally spoke the hint of southern was pronounced can we talk in the morning before you call the police maybe i havent been as frank as i should have id like you to hear the whole story before you do anything rash just say no just say no i chanted to myself you be at the belmont diner at eight brigitte you can lay it out for me but im not making any promises i got up at seven ran the dog over to belmont harbor and back and took a long shower i figured even if i put a half hour into grooming myself i wasnt going to look as good as brigitte so i just scrambled into jeans and a cotton sweater it was almost ten minutes after eight when i got to the diner but brigitte hadnt arrived yet i picked up a heraldstar from the counter and took it over to a booth to read with a cup of coffee the headline shook me to the bottom of my stomach football hero survives fate worse than death charles jade pierce once the smoothest man on the bears fearsome defense eluded offensive blockers once again this time the stakes were higher than a touchdown though the offensive lineman was death i thought jeremy logan was overdoing it by a wide margin but i read the story to the end the standard procedure with a body is to take it to a hospital for a death certificate before it goes to the morgue the patrol team hauled jade to beth israel for a perfunctory exam there the intern noticing a slight sweat on jades neck and hands dug deeper for a pulse than id been willing to go shed found faint but unmistakable signs of life buried deep in the mountain of flesh and had brought him back to consciousness jade whos had substance abuse problems since leaving the bears had mainlined a potent mixture of ether and hydrochloric acid before drinking a quart of bourbon when he came to his first words were characteristic get the f out of my face logan then concluded with the obligatory rundown on jades career and its demise with a pious sniff about the use and abuse of sports heroes left to die in the gutter when they could no longer please the crowd i read it through twice including the fulsome last line before brigitte arrived you see jades still alive so i couldnt have killed him she announced sweeping into the booth in a cloud of chanel did you know he was in a coma when you came to see me yesterday she raised plucked eyebrows in hauteur are you questioning my word one of the waitresses chugged over to take our order you want your fruit and yogurt right vic and what else green pepper and cheese omelet with rye toast thanks barbara whatll yours be brigitte dry toast and black coffee no doubt is your fruit really fresh she demanded barbara rolled her eyes honey the melon pinched me so hard im blackandblue better not take a chance if youre sensitive brigitte set her shouldercovered today in green broadcloth with black pipingand got ready to do battle i cut her off before the first how dare you rolled to its ugly conclusion this isnt the kind of place where the maître d wilts at your frown and races over to make sure madam is happy they dont care if you come back or not in fact about now theyd be happier if youd leave you can check out my fruit when it comes and order some if it tastes right to you ill just have wheat toast and black coffee she said icily and make sure they dont put any butter on it right barbara said wheat toast margarine instead of butter just kidding hon she added as brigitte started to tear into her again you gotta learn to take it if you want to dish it out did you bring me here to be insulted brigitte demanded when barbara had left i brought you here to talk it didnt occur to me that you wouldnt know diner etiquette we can fight if you want to or you can tell me about jade and corinne and your cat i had a visit from joel sirop last night she swallowed some coffee and made a face they should rinse the pots with vinegar well keep it to yourself they wont pay you a consulting fee for telling them about it joel tell you hed come around hunting lady iva she frowned at me over the rim of the coffee cup then nodded fractionally why didnt you tell me about the damned cat when you were in my office yesterday her poise deserted her for a moment she looked briefly ashamed i thought youd look for corinne i didnt think i could persuade you to hunt down my cat anyway corinne must have taken iva with her so i thought if you found her youd find the cat too which one do you really want back she started to bristle again then suddenly laughed it took ten years from her face you wouldnt ask that if youd ever lived with a teenager and corinnes always been a stranger to me she was eighteen months old when i left for college and i only saw her a week or two at a time on vacations she used to worship me when she moved in with me i thought it would be a piece of cake id get her fixed up with the right crowd and the right school shed do her best to be like me and the system would run itself instead she put on a lot of weight wont listen to me about her eating slouches around with the kids in the neighborhood when my back is turned the whole nine yards jades influence it creeps through every now and then when im not thinking she looked at my blueberries i offered them to her and she helped herself to a generous spoonful and that was the other thing jade we got together when i was an alabama cheerleader and he was the biggest hero in town i thought id really caught me a prize my yes a big prize but the first last and only thing in a marriage with a football player is football and him of course how many sacks he made how many yards he allowed all that boring crap and if he has to sit out a game or he gives up a touchdown or he doesnt get the glory watch out jade was mean he was mean on the field he was mean off it he broke my arm once her voice was level but her hand shook a little as she lifted the coffee cup to her mouth i got me a gun and shot him in the leg the next time he came at me they put it down as a hunting accident in the papers but he never tried anything on me after thatnot physical i mean until his career ended then he got real real ugly the papers crucified me for abandoning him when his career was over they never had to live with him she was panting with emotion by the time she finished and corinne shared the papers views i asked gently she nodded we had a bad fight on sunday she wanted to go to a sleepover at one of the girls in the neighborhood i dont like that girl and i said no we had a galeforce battle after that when i got home from work on monday shed taken off first i figured shed gone to this girls place they hadnt seen her though and she hadnt shown up at school so i figured shed run off to jade now i dont know i would truly appreciate it if youd keep looking though just say no vic i chanted to myself ill need a thousand up front and more names and addresses of friends including people in mobile ill check in with jade at the hospital she might have gone to him you know and he sent her on someplace else i stopped by there this morning they said no visitors i grinned ive got friends in high places i signaled barbara for the check speaking of which how was the vice president she looked as though she were going to give me one of her stiff rebuttals but then she curled her lip and drawled just like every other good old boy honey just like every other good old boy v lotty herschel an obstetrician associated with beth israel arranged for me to see jade pierce they tell me hes been difficult dont stand next to the bed unless youre wearing a padded jacket you want him you can have him the floor head told me hes going home tomorrow morning frankly since he wont let anyone near him they ought to release him right now my palms felt sweaty when i pushed open the door to jades room he didnt throw anything when i came in didnt even turn his head to stare through the restraining rails surrounding the bed his mountain of flesh poured through them ebbing away from a rounded summit in the middle the back of his head smooth and shiny as a piece of polished jade reflected the ceiling light into my eyes i dont need any goddamned ministering angels so get the fuck out of here he growled to the window thats a relief my angel act never really got going he turned his head at that his black eyes were mean narrow slits if i were a quarterback id hand him the ball and head for the showers what are you the goddamned social worker nope im the goddamned detective who found you yesterday before you slipped off to the great huddle in the sky come on over then so i can kiss your ass he spat venomously i leaned against the wall and crossed my arms i didnt mean to save your life i tried getting them to send you to the morgue the meat wagon crew doublecrossed me the mountain shook and rumbled it took me a few seconds to realize he was laughing youre right detective you aint no angel so what do you want true confessions on why i was such a bad boy the name of the guy who got me the stuff as long as youre not hurting anyone but yourself i dont care what you do or where you get your shit im here because brigitte hired me to find corinne his face set in ugly lines again get out i didnt move i said get out he raised his voice to a bellow just because i mentioned brigittes name just because if youre pally with that broad youre a snake by definition im not pally with her i met her yesterday shes paying me to find her sister it took an effort not to yell back at him corinnes better off without her he growled turning the back of his head to me again i didnt say anything just stood there five minutes passed finally he jeered without looking at me did the sweet little martyr tell you i broke her arm she mentioned it yes she tell you how that happened please dont tell me how badly she misunderstood you i dont want to throw up my breakfast at that he swung his gigantic face around toward me again comere when i didnt move he sighed and patted the bed rail im not going to slug you honest if were going to talk you gotta get close enough for me to see your face i went over to the bed and straddled the chair resting my arms on its back jade studied me in silence then grunted as if to say id passed some minimal test i wont tell you brigitte didnt understand me broad had my number from day one i didnt break her arm though that was b b wilder old gunshot thought he was my best friend on the club but it turned out he was brigittes and then when i come home early from a hunting trip and found her in bed with him we all got carried away she loved the excitement of big men fighting its what made her a football groupie to begin with down in alabama i tried to imagine icecold brigitte flushed with excitement while the bears right tackle and defensive end fought over her it didnt seem impossible so b b broke her arm but i agreed to take the rap her little old modeling career was just getting off the ground and she didnt want her good name sullied and besides that she kept hoping for a reconciliation with her folks at least with their wad and theyd never fork over if she got herself some ugly publicity committing violent adultery and me i was just the baddest boy the bears ever fielded one more mark didnt make that much difference to me the jeering note returned to his voice she told me it was when you retired that things deteriorated between you things deterioratedwhat a way to put it look detective what did you say your name was v i thats a hell of a name for a girl what did your mamma call you victoria i said grudgingly and no one calls me vicki so dont even think about it i prefer not to be called a girl either much less a broad but jade didnt seem like the person to discuss that particular issue with victoria huh things deteriorated yeah like they was a picnic starting out i was born dumb and i didnt get smarter for making five hundred big ones a year but i wouldnt hit a broad even one like brigitte who could get me going just looking at me i broke a lot of furniture though and that got on her nerves i couldnt help laughing yeah i can see that itd bother me too he gave a grudging smile see the trouble is i grew up poor i mean dirt poor i used to go to the projects here with some of the black guys on the squad you know christmas appearances shit like that those kids live in squalor but i didnt own a pair of shorts to cover my ass until the county social worker come round to see why i wasnt in school so you broke furniture because you grew up without it and didnt know what else to do with it dont be a wiseass victoria im sure your mamma wouldnt like it i made a facehe was right about that you know the leblancs right oh youre a yankee yankees dont know shit if they havent stepped in it themselves leblanc gas theyre one of the biggest names on the gulf coast theyre a long long way from the pierces of florette i muscled my way into college played football for old bear bryant met brigitte she liked raw meat and mine was just about the rawest in the south so she latched on to me when she decided to marry me she took me down to mobile for christmas there i was the hulk in miz effies lace and crystal palace they hated me knew i was trash told brigitte theyd cut her out of everything if she married me she figured she could sweettalk her daddy into anything we got married and it didnt work not even when i was a national superstar to them i was still the dirt i used to wipe my ass with so she divorced you to get back in their will he shrugged a movement that set a tidal wave going down the mountain oh that had something to do with it sure it had something but i was a wreck and i was hell to live with even if shed been halfway normal to begin with it would have gone bust cause i didnt know how to live with losing football i just didnt care about anyone or anything not even the daytona i couldnt help saying his black eyes disappeared into tiny dots dont you go lecturing me just when were starting to get on im not asking you to cry over my sad jock story im just trying to give you a little different look at sweet beautiful brigitte sorry its just ill never do anything to be able to afford a ferrari daytona it pisses me to see someone throw one away he snorted if id known you five years ago id of given it to you too late now anyway brigitte waited too long to jump ship she was still in negotiations with old man leblanc when he and miz effie dropped into the gulf of mexico with the remains of their little cessna everything that wasnt tied down went to corinne brigitte being her guardian gets a chunk for looking after her but you ask me if corinnes gone missing its the best thing she could do ill bet you well i dont have anything left to bet ill hack off my big toe and give it to you if brigittes after anything but the money he thought for a minute no she probably likes corinne some or would like her if shed lose thirty pounds dress like a mobile debutante and hang around with a crowd of snotnoses ill hack off my toe if the money aint number one in her heart thats all i eyed him steadily wondering how much of his story to believe its why i stay away from domestic crime everyone has a story and it wears you out trying to match all the different pieces together i could check the leblancs will to see if theyd left their fortune the way jade reported it or if they had a fortune at all maybe he was making it all up did corinne talk to you before she took off on monday his black eyes darted around the room i havent laid eyes on her in months she used to come around but brigitte got a peace bond on me i get arrested if im within thirty feet of corinne i believe you jade i said steadily i believe you havent seen her but did she talk to you like on the phone maybe the ugly look returned to his face then the mountain shook again as he laughed you dont miss many signals do you victoria you oughta run a training camp yeah corinne calls me monday morning why dont you have your cute little ass in school i says even with all your family dough thats the only way to get aheadtheyll ream you six ways from sunday if you dont get your education so you can check out what all your advisers are up to he shook his head broodingly i know what im talking about believe me the lawyers and agents and financial advisers they all made out like hogs at feeding time when i was in the money but come trouble it wasnt them it was me hung out like a slab of pork belly to dry on my own so what did corinne say to your good advice i prompted him trying not to sound impatient i could well be the first sober person to listen to him in a decade oh shes crying she cant stand it why cant she just run home to mobile and i tell her cause shes underage and rich the cops will all be looking for her and just haul her butt back to chicago and when she keeps talking wilder and wilder i tell her theyll be bound to blame me if something happens to her and does she really need to run away so bad that i go to jail or something so i thought that calmed her down think of it like rookie camp i told her they put you through the worst shit but if you survive it you own them i thought she figured it out and was staying he shut his eyes im tired detective i cant tell you nothing else you go away and detect if she went back to mobile who would she stay with wouldnt nobody down there keep her without calling brigitte too many of them owe their jobs to leblanc gas he didnt open his eyes and up here he shrugged a movement like an earthquake that rattled the bed rails you might try the neighbors seems to me corinne mentioned a miz hellman who had a bit of a soft spot for her he opened his eyes maybe corinnell talk to you you got a good ear thanks i got up what about this famous maltese cat what about it it went missing along with corinne think shed hurt it to get back at brigitte how the hell should i know those leblancs would do anything to anyone even corinne now get the fuck out so i can get my beauty rest he shut his eyes again yeah youre beautiful all right jade why dont you use some of your old connections and get yourself going at something its really pathetic seeing you like this you wanna save me along with the daytona the ugly jeer returned to his voice dont go all dogooder on me now victoria my daddy died at forty from too much moonshine they tell me im his spitting image i know where im going its trite jade lots of people have done it theyll make a movie about you and little kids will cry over your sad story but if they make it honest theyll show that youre just plain selfish i wanted to slam the door but the hydraulic stop took the impact out of the gesture goddamned motherfucking waste i snapped as i stomped down the corridor the floor head heard me jade pierce youre right about that vi the hellmans lived in an apartment above the tv repair shop they ran on halsted mrs hellman greeted me with some relief i promised corinne i wouldnt tell her sister as long as she stayed here instead of trying to hitchhike back to mobile but ive been pretty worried its just that to brigitte leblanc i dont exist my daughter lily is trash that she doesnt want corinne associated with so it never even occurred to her that corinne might be here she took me through the back of the shop and up the stairs to the apartment its only five rooms but were glad to have her as long as she wants to stay im more worried about the cat she doesnt like being cooped up in here she got out tuesday night and we had a terrible time hunting her down i grinned to myself so much for the thoroughbred descendants pined for by joel sirop mrs hellman took me into the living room where they had a sofa bed that corinne was using this here is a detective corinne i think youd better talk to her corinne was hunched in front of the television an outsize console model far too large for the tiny room in her mans white shirt and tattered blue jeans she didnt look at all like her svelte sister her complexion was a muddy color that matched her lank straight hair she clutched lady iva of cairo close in her arms both of them looked at me angrily if you think you can make me go back to that coldassed bitch youd better think again mrs hellman tried to protest her language its okay i said she learned it from jade but jade lost every fight he ever was in with brigitte corinne maybe you ought to try a different method brigitte hated jade she hates anyone who doesnt do stuff just the way she wants it so if youre working for brigitte you dont know shit about anything i responded to the first part of her comments is that why you took the cat so you could keep her from having purebred kittens like brigitte wants her to a ghost of a smile twitched around her unhappy mouth all she said was they wouldnt let me bring my dogs or my horse up north ivas kind of a snoot but shes better than nothing jade thinks brigittes jealous because you got the leblanc fortune and she didnt she made a disgusted noise jade worries too much about all that shit yeah daddy left me a big fat wad but the company went to daddys cousin miles you cant inherit leblanc gas if youre a girl and brigitte knew that same as me i mean they told both of us growing up so we wouldnt have our hearts set on it the money they left me brigitte makes that amount every year in her business she doesnt care about the money and you does it bother you that the company went to your cousin she gave a long ugly sniffno doubt another of jades expressions who wants a company that doesnt do anything but pollute the gulf and ream the people who work for them i considered that at fourteen it was probably genuine bravado so what do you care about she looked at me with sulky dark eyes for a minute i thought she was going to tell me to mind my own goddamned business and go to hell but she suddenly blurted out its my horse they left the house to miles along with my horse they didnt think about it just said the house and all the stuff that wasnt left special to someone else went to him and they didnt even think to leave me my own horse the last sentence came out as a wail and her angry young face dissolved into sobs i didnt think shed welcome a friendly pat on the shoulder i just let the tears run their course she finally wiped her nose on a frayed cuff and shot me a fierce look to see if i cared if i could persuade brigitte to buy your horse from miles and stable him up here would you be willing to go back to her until youre of age you never would nobody ever could make that bitch change her mind but if i could her lower lip was hanging out maybe if i could have my horse and go to school with lily instead of fucking st scholastica ill do my best i got to my feet in return maybe you could work on jade to stop drugging himself to death it isnt romantic you know its horrible painful about the ugliest thing in the world she only glowered at me its hard work being an angel no one takes at all kindly to it vii brigitte was furious her cheeks flamed with natural color and her cobalt eyes glittered i couldnt help wondering if this was how she looked when jade and b b wilder were fighting over her so he knew all along where she was i ought to have him sent over for that cant i charge him with contributing to her delinquency not if youre planning on using me as a witness you cant i snapped she ignored me and her too taking lady iva off like that mating her with some alley cat as if on cue casper of valletta squawked loudly and started clawing the deep silver plush covering brigittes living room floor joel sirop picked up the torn and spoke soothingly to him it is bad brigitte very bad maybe you should let the girl go back to mobile if she wants to so badly after three days you know its too late to give lady iva a shot and corinne is so wild so uncontrollablewhat would stop her the next time lady iva comes into season brigittes nostrils flared i should send her to reform school show her what discipline is really like why in hell do you even want custody over corinne if all you can think about is revenge i interrupted she stopped swirling around her living room and turned to frown at me why i love her of course she is my sister you know concentrate on that keep saying it to yourself shes not a cat that you can breed and mold to suit your fancy i just want her to be happy when shes older she wont be if she cant learn to control herself look at what happened when she started hanging around trash like that lily hellman she would never have let lady iva breed with an alley cat if she hadnt made that kind of friend i ground my teeth just because lily lives in five rooms over a store doesnt make her trash look brigitte you wanted to lead your own life i expect your parents tried keeping you on a short leash hell maybe they even threatened you with reform school so you started fucking every hulk you could get your hands on are you so angry about that that you have to treat corinne the same way she gaped at me her jaw worked but she couldnt find any words finally she went over to a burled oak cabinet that concealed a bar she pulled out a chilled bottle of sancerre and poured herself a glass when shed gulped it down she sat at her desk is it that obvious why i went after jade and b b and all those boys i hunched a shoulder it was just a guess brigitte a guess based on what ive learned about you and your sister and jade the last two days hes not such an awful guy you know but he clearly was an awful guy for you and corinnes lonely and miserable and needs someone to love her she figures her horse for the job and me her cobalt eyes glittered again what do i need the embraces of my cat to shed some of those porcupine quills so someone can love you too you couldve offered me a glass of wine for example she started an ugly retort then went over to the liquor cabinet and got out a glass for me so i bring flitcraft up to chicago and stable her i put corinne into the filthy public high school and then well all live happily ever after she might graduate i swallowed some of the wine it was cold and crisp and eased some of the tension the leblancs and pierces were putting into my throat and in another year she wont run away to lilys but shell go off to mobile or hit the streets nows your chance oh all right she snapped youre some kind of saint i know who never said a bad word to anyone you can tell corinne ill cut a deal with her but if it goes wrong you can be the one to stay up at night worrying about her i rubbed my head send her back to mobile brigitte there must be a grandmother or aunt or nanny or someone who really cares about her with your attitude life with corinne is just going to be a bomb waiting for the fuse to blow you can say that again detective it was jade his bulk filling the double doors to the living room behind him we could hear the housekeeper without being able to see her i tried to keep him out brigitte but corinne let him in you want me to call the cops get them to exercise that peace bond i have a right to ask whoever i want into my own house came corinnes muffled shriek squawking and yowling casper broke from joel sirops hold he hurtled himself at the doorway and stuffed his body through the gap between jades feet on the other side of the barricade we could hear lady ivas answering yodel and a scream from corinnepresumably shed been clawed why dont you move jade so we can see the action i suggested he lumbered into the living room and perched his bulk on the edge of a pale gray sofa corinne stumbled in behind him and sat next to him her muddy skin and lank hair looked worse against the sleek modern lines of brigittes furniture than they had in mrs hellmans crowded sitting room brigitte watched the blood drip from corinnes right hand to the rug and jerked her head at the housekeeper hovering in the doorway can you clean that up for me grace when the housekeeper left she turned to her sister next time youre that angry at me take it out on me not the cat did you really have to let her breed in a back alley its all one to iva corinne muttered sulkily just as long as shes getting some she dont care whos giving it to her just like you brigitte marched to the couch jade caught her hand as she was preparing to smack corinne now look here brigitte he said you two girls dont belong together you know that as well as i do maybe you think you owe it to your public image to be a mamma to corinne but youre not the mamma type never have been why should you try now brigitte glared at him and youre mister wonderful who can sit in judgment on everyone else he shook his massive jade dome nope i wont claim that but maybe corinne here would like to come live with me he held up a massive palm as brigitte started to protest not in uptown i can get me a place close to here corinne can have her horse and see you when you feel calm enough and when your pure little old cat has her halfbreed kittens they can come live with us on corinnes money brigitte spat jade nodded shed have to put up the stake but i know some guys whod back me to get started in somethin commodities somethin like that youd be drunk or doped up all the time and then youd rape her she broke off as he did his uglyblackslit number with his eyes youd better not say anything else brigitte leblanc damned well better not say anything you want me to get up in the congregation and yell that i never touched a piece of ass that shoved itself in my nose i aint going to but you know bettern anyone that i never in my life laid hands on a girl to hurt her as for the rest his eyes returned to normal and he put a redwood branch around corinnes shoulders first time im drunk or shooting somethin corinne comes right back here we can try it for six months brigitte just a trial rookie camp you know how it goes the football analogy brought her own mean look to brigittes face before she could say anything joel bleated in the background it sounds like a good idea to me brigitte really you ought to give it a try lady ivas nerves will never be stable with the fighting that goes on around her when corinne is here no one asked you brigitte snapped and no one asked me either corinne said if you dont agree iim going to take lady iva and run away to new york and send you pictures of her with litter after litter of alley cats the threat uttered with all the venom she could muster made me choke with laughter i swallowed some sancerre to try to control myself but i couldnt stop laughing jades mountain rumbled and shook as he joined in joel gasped in horror only the two leblanc women remained unmoved glaring at each other what i ought to do i ought to send you to reform school corinne alton leblanc what you ought to do is cool out i advised putting my glass down on a chrome table its a good offer take it if you dont shell only run away brigitte tightened her mouth in a narrow line i didnt hire you to have you turn on me you know yeah well you hired me you didnt buy me my job is to help you resolve a difficult problem and this looks like the best solution youre going to be offered oh very well she snapped pettishly pouring herself another drink for six months and if her grades start slipping or i hear shes drinking or doping or anything like that she comes back here i got up to go corinne followed me to the door im sorry i was rude to you over at lilys she muttered shyly when the kittens are born you can have the one you like best i gulped and tried to smile thats very generous of you corinne but i dont think my dog would take too well to a kitten dont you like cats the big brown eyes stared at me poignantly really cats and dogs get along very well unless their owners expect them not to like leblancs and pierces huh she bit her lip and turned her head then said in a startled voice youre teasing me arent you just teasing you corinne you take it easy things are going to work out for you and if they dont give me a call before you do anything too rash okay and you will take a kitten just say no vic just say no i chanted to myself let me think about it ive got to run now i fled the house before she could break my resolve any further settled score i its such a difficult concept to deal with i just dont like to use that word paul servino turned to me his mobile mouth pursed consideringly i put it to you victoria youre a lawyer would you not agree i agree that the law defines responsibility differently than we do when were talking about social or moral relations i said carefully no states attorney is going to try to get mrs hampton arrested but does that you see servino interrupted thats just my point but its not mine lotty said fiercely her thick dark brows forming a forbidding line across her forehead and if you had seen claudia with her guts torn out by lye perhaps you would think a little differently the table was silenced for a moment we were surprised by the violent edge to lottys anger penelope herschel shook her head slightly at servino he caught her eye and nodded sorry lotty i didnt mean to upset you so much lotty forced herself to smile paul you think you develop a veneer after thirty years as a doctor you think you see people in all their pain and that your professionalism protects you from too much feeling but that girl was fifteen she had her life in front of her she didnt want to have a baby and her mother wanted her to not for religious reasons evenshes english with all their contempt for catholicism but because she hoped to continue to control her daughters life claudia felt overwhelmed by her mothers pressure and swallowed a jar of oven cleaner now dont tell me the mother is not responsible i do not give one damn if no court would try her to me she caused her daughters death as surely as if she had poured the poison into her servino ignored another slight headshake from lottys niece it is a tragedy but a tragedy for the mother too you dont think she meant her daughter to kill herself do you lotty lotty gave a tense smile what goes on in the unconscious is surely your department paul but perhaps that was mrs hamptons wish of course if she didnt intend for claudia to die the courts would find her responsibility diminished am i not right vic i moved uneasily in my chair i didnt want to referee this argument it had all the earmarks of the kind of domestic fight where both contestants attack the police besides while the rest of the dinner party was interested in the case and sympathetic to lottys feelings none of them cared about the question of legal versus moral responsibility the dinner was in honor of lotty herschels niece penelope making one of her periodic scouting forays into chicago s fashion scene her fatherlottys only brotherowned a chain of highpriced womens dress shops in montreal quebec and toronto he was thinking of making chicago his us beachhead and penelope was out looking at locations as well as previewing the chicago designers spring ideas lotty usually gave a dinner for penelope when she was in town servino was always invited an analyst friend of lottys he and penelope had met on one of her first buying trips to chicago since then theyd seen as much of each other as two busy professionals half a continent apart could manage although their affair now had five years of history to it penelope continued to stay with lotty when she was in town the rest of the small party included max loewenthal the executive director of beth israel where lotty treated perinatal patients and chaim lemke a clarinetist with the aeolus woodwind quintet a slight melancholy man he had met lotty and max in london where theyd all been refugees chaims wife greta who played harpsichord and piano for an early music group didnt come along lotty said not to invite her because she was seeing paul professionally but anyway since she was currently living with aeolus oboist rudolph strayarn she probably wouldnt have accepted we were eating at my apartment lotty had called earlier in the day rattled by the young girls death and needing help putting the evening together she was so clearly beside herself that id felt compelled to offer my own place with cheese and fruit after dinner lotty had begun discussing the case with the whole group chiefly expressing her outrage with a legal system that let mrs hampton off without so much as a warning for some reason servino continued to argue the point despite penelopes warning frowns perhaps the fact that we were on our third bottle of barolo explained the lapse from pauls usual sensitive courtesy mrs hampton did not point a gun at the girls head and force her to become pregnant he said the daughter was responsible too if you want to use that word and the boythe father whoever that was lotty normally abstemious had drunk her share of the wine her black eyes glittered and her viennese accent became pronounced i know the argument believe you me paul its the old who pulled the triggerthe person who fired the gun the person who manufactured it the person who created the situation the parents who created the shooter to me that is scholastic hairsplittingyou know all that crap they used to teach us a thousand years ago in europe who is the ultimate cause the immediate cause the sufficient cause and on and on its dry theory not life it takes people off the hook for their own actions you can quote heinz kohut and the rest of the selfpsychologists to me all night but you will never convince me that people are unable to make conscious choices for their actions or that parents are not responsible for how they treat their children its the same thing as saying the nazis were not responsible for how they treated europe penelope gave a strained smile she loved both lotty and servino and didnt want either of them to make fools of themselves max on the other hand watched lotty affectionatelyhe liked to see her passionate chaim was staring into space his lips moving i assumed he was reading a score in his head i would say that servino snapped his own italian accent strong and dont look at me as though i were joseph goebbels chaim and i are ten years younger than you and max but we share your story in great extent i do not condone or excuse the horrors our families suffered or our own dispossession but i can look at himmler or mussolini or even hitler and say they behaved in such and such a way because of weaknesses accentuated in them by history by their parents by their culture you could as easily say the french were responsible the french because their need forforrappresagliawhat am i trying to say victoria reprisal i supplied now you see lotty now i too am angry i forget my english but if they and the english had not stretched germany with reparations the situation might have been different so how can you claim responsibilityfor one person or one nation you just have to do the best you can with what is going on around you lottys face was set yes paul i know what you are saying yes the french created a situation and the english wished to accommodate hitler and the americans would not take in the jews all these things are true but the germans chose nonetheless they could have acted differently i will not take them off the hook just because other people should have acted differently i took her hand and squeezed it at the risk of being the neville chamberlain in the case could i suggest some appeasement chaim brought his clarinet and max his violin paul if youll play the piano penelope and i will sing chaim smiled relaxing the sadness in his thin face he loved making music whether with friends or professionals gladly vic but only a few songs its late and we go to california for a twoweek tour tomorrow the atmosphere lightened we went into the living room where chaim flipped through my music pulling out wolfs spanisches liederbuch in the end he and max stayed with lotty playing and talking until three in the morning long after servino and penelopes departure ii the detective business is not as much fun in january as at other times of the year i spent the next two days forcing my little chevy through unplowed side streets trying to find a missing witness who was the key to an eighteenmilliondollar fraud case i finally succeeded tuesday evening a little before five by the time id convinced the terrified woman who was hiding with a niece at sixtyseventh and honore that no one would shoot her if she testified gotten her to the states attorney and seen her safely home again it was close to ten oclock i fumbled with the outer locks on the apartment building with my mind fixed on a hot bath lots of whiskey and a toasted cheese sandwich when the groundfloor door opened and mr contreras popped out to meet me i ground my teeth hes a retired machinist with more energy than navratilova i didnt have the stamina to deal with him tonight i mumbled a greeting and headed for the stairs there you are doll the relief in his voice was marked i stopped wearily some crisis with the dog something involving lugging a sixtypound retriever to the vet through snowpacked streets i thought i ought to let her in you know i told her there was no saying when youd be home sometimes youre gone all night on a casea delicate reference to my love lifebut she was all set she had to wait and sheda been sitting on the stairs all this time she wont say what the problem is but youd probably better talk to her you wanna come in here or should i send her up in a few minutes not the dog then uh who is it arent i trying to tell you that beautiful girl you know the docs niece penelope i echoed foolishly she came out into the hall just then ducking under the old mans gesticulating arms vic thank god youre back ive got to talk to you before the police do anything stupid she was huddled in an anklelength silver fur ordinarily elegant with exquisite makeup and jewelry and the most modern of hairstyles she didnt much resemble her aunt but shock had stripped the sophistication from her making her dark eyes the focus of her face she looked so much like lotty that i went to her instinctively come on up with me and tell me whats wrong i put an arm around her mr contreras closed his door in disappointment as we disappeared up the stairs penelope waited until we were inside my place before saying anything else i slung my jacket and down vest on the hooks in the hallway and went into the living room to undo my heavy walking shoes penelope kept her fur wrapped around her her highheeled kid boots were not meant for street wear they were rimmed with salt stains she shivered slightly despite the coat havehave you heard anything i shook my head rubbing my right foot stiff from driving all day its paul hes dead buthes not that old and i thought he was very healthy because of his sedentary job servino always ran the two miles from his loop office to his apartment in the evening penelope gave a little gulp of hysterical laughter oh he was very fit but not healthy enough to overcome a blew to the head could you tell the story from the beginning instead of letting it out in little dramatic bursts as id hoped my rudeness got her angry enough to overcome her incipient hysteria after flashing me a lottylike look of royal disdain she told me what she knew pauls office was in a building where a number of analysts had their practices a sign posted on his door this morning baldly announced that he had canceled all his days appointments because of a personal emergency when a janitor went in at three to change a lightbulb hed found the doctor dead on the floor of his consulting room colleagues agreed theyd seen servino arrive around a quarter of eight as he usually did theyd seen the notice and assumed hed left when everyone else was tied up with appointments no one thought any more about it penelope had learned of her lovers death from the police who picked her up as she was leaving a realtors office where shed been discussing shop leases two of the doctors with offices near servinos had mentioned seeing a darkhaired woman in a long fur coat near his consulting room penelopes dark eyes were drenched with tears its not enough that paul is dead that i learn of it in such an unspeakable way they think i killed himbecause i have dark hair and wear a fur coat they dont know what killed himsome dreary blunt instrumentit sounds stupid and banal like an old agatha christie theyve pawed through my luggage looking for it theyd questioned her for three hours while they searched and finally reluctantly let her go with a warning not to leave chicago shed called lotty at the clinic and then come over to find me i went into the dining room for some whiskey she shook her head at the bottle i poured myself an extra slug to make up for missing my bath and and i want you to find who killed him the police arent looking very hard because they think its me do they have a reason for this she blushed unexpectedly they think he was refusing to marry me not much motive in these times one would have thought and you with a successful career to boot was he refusing no it was the other way around actually i feltfelt unsettled about what i wanted to docome to chicago to stay you know i havefriends in montreal too you know and ive always thought marriage meant monogamy i see my focus on the affair between penelope and paul shifted slightly you didnt kill him did youperhaps for some other reason she forced a smile because he didnt agree with lotty about responsibility no and for no other reason are you going to ask lotty if she killed him lotty would have mangled him sunday night with whatever was lying on the dining room tableshe wouldnt wait to sneak into his office with a club i eyed her thoughtfully just out of vulgar curiosity what were you doing around eight this morning her black eyes scorched me i came to you because i thought you would be sympathetic not to get the same damned questions i had all afternoon from the police and what were you doing at eight this morning she swept across the room to the door then thought better of it and affected to study a nell blaine poster on the nearby wall with her back to me she said curtly i was having a second cup of coffee and no there are no witnesses as you know by that time of day lotty is long gone perhaps someone saw me leave the building at eightthirtyi asked the detectives to question the neighbors but they didnt seem much interested in doing so dont sell them short if youre not under arrest theyre still asking questions but you could ask questions to clear me theyre just trying to implicate me i pinched the bridge of my nose trying to ease the dull ache behind my eyes you do realize the likeliest person to have killed him is an angry patient dont you despite your fears the police have probably been questioning them all day nothing i said could convince her that she wasnt in imminent danger of a speedy trial before a kangaroo court with execution probable by the next morning she stayed until past midnight alternating pleas to hide her with commands to join the police in hunting down pauls killer she wouldnt call lotty to tell her she was with me because she was afraid lottys home phone had been tapped look penelope i finally said exasperated i cant hide you if the police really suspect you you were tailed here even if i could figure out a way to smuggle you out and conceal you someplace i wouldnt do itid lose my license on obstruction charges and id deserve to i tried explaining how hard it was to get a court order for a wiretap and finally gave up i was about ready to start screaming with frustration when lotty herself called devastated by servinos death and worried about penelope the police had been by with a search warrant and had taken away an array of household objects including her umbrella such an intrusion would normally have made her spitting mad but she was too upset to give it her full emotional attention i turned the phone over to penelope whatever lotty said to her stained her cheeks red but did make her agree to let me drive her home when i got back to my place exhausted enough to sleep round the clock i found john mcgonnigal waiting for me in a blueandwhite outside my building he came up the walk behind me and opened the door with a flourish i looked at him sourly thanks sergeant its been a long dayim glad to have a doorman at the end of it its kind of cold down here for talking vic how about inviting me up for coffee because i want to go to bed if youve got something you want to say or even ask spit it out down here i was just ventilating and i knew itif a police sergeant wanted to talk to me at one in the morning wed talk mr contrerass coming out in a magenta bathrobe to see what the trouble was merely speeded my decision to cooperate while i assembled cheese sandwiches mcgonnigal asked me what id learned from penelope she didnt throw her arms around me and howl vic i killed him youve got to help me i put the sandwiches in a skillet with a little olive oil whatve you guys got on her the receptionist and two of the other analysts whod been in the hall had seen a small darkhaired woman hovering in the alcove near servinos office around twenty of eight neither of them had paid too much attention to her when they saw penelope they agreed it might have been she but they couldnt be certain if theyd made a positive id shed already have been arrested even though they couldnt find the weapon they had a shouting match at the filigree last night the maître d was quite upset servino was a regular and he didnt want to offend him but a number of diners complained the herschel girlmcgonnigal eyed me warilywoman i mean stormed off on her own and spent the night with her aunt one of the neighbors saw her leave around seven the next morning not at eightthirty as she says i didnt like the sound of that i asked him about the cause of death someone gave him a good crack across the side of the neck close enough to the back to fracture a cervical vertebra and sever one of the main arteries it would have killed him pretty fast and as you know servino wasnt very tallthe herschel woman could easily have done it with what i demanded that was the stumbling block it could have been anything from a baseball bat to a steel pipe the forensic pathologist whod looked at the body favored the latter since the skin had been broken in places theyd taken away anything in lottys apartment and penelopes luggage that might have done the job and were having them examined for traces of blood and skin i snorted if you searched lottys place you must have come away with quite an earful mcgonnigal grimaced she spoke her mind yes any ideas on what the weapon might have been i shook my head too nauseated by the thought of pauls death to muster intellectual curiosity over the choice of weapon when mcgonnigal left around twothirty i lay in bed staring at the dark unable to sleep despite my fatigue i didnt know penelope all that well just because she was lottys niece didnt mean she was incapable of murder to be honest i hadnt been totally convinced by her histrionics tonight who but a lover could get close enough to you to snap your neck i thrashed around for hours finally dropping into an uneasy sleep around six lotty woke me at eight to implore me to look for servinos killer the police had been back at seventhirty to ask penelope why shed forgotten to mention shed been at pauls apartment early yesterday morning why was she there i asked reasonably she says she wanted to patch things up after their quarrel but hed already left for the office when the police started questioning her she was too frightened to tell the truth vic im terrified theyre going to arrest her i mumbled something it looked to me like they had a pretty good case but i valued my life too much to say that to lotty even so the conversation deteriorated rapidly i come out in any wind or weather to patch you up with never a word of complaint that wasnt exactly true but i let it pass now when i beg you for help you turn a deaf ear to me i shall remember this victoria giant black spots formed and reformed in front of my tired eyes great lotty her receiver banged in my ear iii i spent the day doggedly going about my own business turning on wbbm whenever i was in the car to see if any news had come in about penelopes arrest despite all the damaging eyewitness reports the states attorney apparently didnt want to move without a weapon i trudged up the stairs to my apartment a little after six my mind fixed on a bath and a rare steak followed immediately by bed when i got to the top landing i ground my teeth in futile rage a furcoated woman was sitting in front of the door when she got to her feet i realized it wasnt penelope but greta schipauer chaim lemkes wife the dark hallway had swallowed the gold of her hair vic thank god youve come back ive been here since four and i have a concert in two hours i fumbled with the three stiff locks i have an office downtown just so that people wont have to sit on the floor outside my home i said pointedly you do ohit never occurred to me you didnt just work out of your living room she followed me in and headed over to the piano where she picked out a series of fifths you really should get this tuned vic is that why youve been here for two hours to tell me to tune my piano i slung my coat onto a hook in the entryway and sat on the couch to pull off my boots no no she sat down hastily its because of paul of course i spoke to lotty today and she says youre refusing to stir yourself to look for his murderer why vic we all need you very badly you cant let us down now the police were questioning me for two hours yesterday it utterly destroyed my concentration i couldnt practice at all i know the recital tonight will be a disaster even chaim has been affected and hes out on the west coast i was too tired to be tactful how do you know that i thought youve been living with rudolph strayarn she looked surprised what does that have to do with anything im still interested in chaims music and its been terrible rudolph called this morning to tell me and i bought an la paper downtown she thrust a copy of the la times in front of me it was folded back to the arts section where the headline read aeolus just blowing in the wind theyd used chaims publicity photo as an inset i scanned the story chaim lemke one of the nations most brilliant musicians must have left his own clarinet at home because he played as though hed never handled the instrument before aeolus manager claudia laurents says the group was shattered by the murder of a friend in chicago the rest of the quintet managed to pull a semblance of a concert together but the performance by america s top woodwind group was definitely offkey i handed the paper back to greta chaims reputation is too strongan adverse review like this will be forgotten in two days dont worry about itgo to your concert and concentrate on your own music her slightly protuberant blue eyes stared at me i didnt believe lotty when she told me i dont believe im hearing you now vic we need you if its money name your figure but put aside this coldness and help us out greta the only thing standing between the police and an arrest right now is the fact that they cant find the murder weapon im not going to join them in hunting for it the best we can hope for is that they never find it after a while theyll let penelope go back to montreal and your lives will return to normal no no youre thinking penelope committed this crime never vic never ive known her since she was a small childyou know i grew up in montreal its where i met chaim believe me i know her she never committed this murder she was still arguing stubbornly when she looked at her watch gave a gasp and said she had to run or shed never make the auditorium in time when id locked the door thankfully behind her i saw shed dropped her paper i looked at chaims delicate face again sad as though he knew he would have to portray mourning in it when the picture was taken iv when the police charged penelope late on thursday i finally succumbed to the alternating pleas and commands of her friends to undertake an independent investigation the police had never found a weapon but the states attorney was willing to believe it was in the chicago river i got the names of the two analysts and the receptionist whod seen servinos presumed assailant outside his office on tuesday they were too used to seeing nervous people shrinking behind partitions to pay much attention to this woman neither of them was prepared to make a positive id in court that would be a help to freeman carter handling penelopes defense but it couldnt undo the damage caused by penelopes original lies about her tuesday morning activities she was free on bond swinging between depression and a kind of manic rage she didnt tell a very convincing story still i was committed to proving her innocence i did my best with her and trusted that freeman was too savvy to let her take the witness stand herself i got a list of pauls patients both current and former from a contact at the police lotty max and greta were bankrolling both freeman and me to any amount we needed so i hired the streeter brothers to check up on patient alibis i talked to all of them myself trying to ferret out any sense of betrayal or rage urgent enough to drive one of them to murder with a sense of shameful voyeurism i even read pauls notes i was fascinated by his descriptions of greta her total selfabsorption had always rubbed me the wrong way paul while much more empathic seemed to be debating whether she would ever be willing to participate in her own analysis how did paul feel about your affair with rudolph i asked greta one afternoon when she had made one of her frequent stops for a progress report oh you know paul he had a great respect for the artistic temperament and what someone like me needs to survive in my work besides he convinced me that i didnt have to feel responsibleyou know that my own parents cold narcissism makes me crave affection and rudolph is a much more relaxing lover than poor chaim with his endless parade of guilt and selfdoubt i felt my skin crawl slightly i didnt know any psychoanalytic theory but i couldnt believe paul meant his remarks on personal responsibility to be understood in quite this way meanwhile chaims performance had deteriorated so badly that he decided to cancel the rest of the west coast tour the aeolus found a backup the second clarinet in the chicago symphony but their concert series got mediocre reviews in seattle and played to halffull houses in vancouver and denver greta rushed to the airport to meet chaim on his return i knew because shed notified the local stations and i found her staring at me on the ten oclock news escorting chaim from the baggage area with a maternal solicitude she shed the cameras before decamping for rudolphsshe called me from there at tenthirty to make sure id seen her wifely heroics i wasnt convinced by gretas claims that chaim would recover faster on his own than with someone to look after him the next day i went to check on him for myself even though it was past noon he was still in his dressing gown i apologized for waking him but he gave a sweet sad smile and assured me hed been up for some time when i followed him into the living room a light bright room facing lake michigan i was shocked to see how ill he looked his black eyes had become giant holes in his thin face he apparently hadnt slept in some time chaim have you seen a doctor no no he shook his head its just that since pauls death i cant make music i try to play and i sound worse than i did at age five i dont know which is harderlosing paul or having them arrest penelope such a sweet girl ive known her since she was born im sure she didnt kill him lotty says youre investigating yeah but not too successfully the evidence against her is very sketchyits hard for me to believe theyll get a conviction if the weapon turns up i let the sentence trail away if the weapon turned up it might provide the final caisson to shore up the states platform i was trying hard to work for penelope but i kept having disloyal thoughts you yourself are hunting for the weapon do you know what it is i shook my head the states attorney gave me photos of the wound i had enlargements made and i took them to a pathologist i know to see if he could come up with any ideas some kind of pipe or stick with spikes or something on itlike a cavemans clubim so out of ideas i even went to the field museum to see if they could suggest something or were missing some oldfashioned lethal weapon chaim had turned green i felt contritehe had such an active imagination i should have watched my tongue now hed have nightmares for weeks and would wait even longer to get his music back i changed the subject and persuaded him to let me cook some lunch from the meager supplies in the kitchen he didnt eat much but he was looking less feverish when i left v chaims cleaning woman found him close to death the morning penelopes trial started lotty max and i had spent the day in court with lottys brother hugo and his wife we didnt get any of gretas frantic messages until lotty checked in at the clinic before dinner chaim had gone to an aeolus rehearsal the night before his first appearance at the group in some weeks he had bought a new clarinet thinking perhaps the problem lay with the old one wind instruments arent like violinsthey deteriorate over time and an active clarinetist has to buy a new one every ten years or so despite the new instrument a buffet he had flown to toronto to buy the rehearsal had gone badly he left early going home to turn on the gas in the kitchen stove he left a note which simply said i have destroyed my music the cleaning woman knew enough about their life to call greta at rudolphs apartment since greta had been at the rehearsalwaiting for the oboistshe knew how badly chaim had played im not surprised she told lotty over the phone his music was all he had after i left him with both of us gone from his life he must have felt he had no reason to live thank god i learned so much from paul about why we arent responsible for our actions or i would feel terribly guilty now lotty called the attending physician at the university of chicago hospital and came away with the news that chaim would live but hed ruined his lungshe could hardly talk and would probably never be able to play again she reported her conversation with greta with a blazing rage while we waited for dinner in her brothers suite at the drake the wrong persons career is over she said furiously its the one thing i could never understand about chaimwhy he felt so much passion for that selfcentered whore marcella herschel gave a grimace of distasteshe didnt deal well with lotty at the best of times and could barely tolerate her when she was angry penelope pale and drawn from the days ordeal summoned a smile and patted lottys shoulder soothingly while max tried to persuade her to drink a little wine freeman carter stopped by after dinner to discuss strategy for the next days session the evening broke up soon after all of us too tired and depressed to want even a pretense of conversation the trial lasted four days freeman did a brilliant job with the states sketchy evidence the jury was out for only two hours before returning a not guilty verdict penelope left for montreal with hugo and marcella the next morning lotty much shaken by the winters events found a locum for her clinic and took off with max for two weeks in portugal i went to michigan for a long weekend with the dog but didnt have time or money for more vacation than that monday night when i got home i found hugo wolfs spanisches liederbuch still open on the piano from januarys dinner party with chaim and paul between pauls murder and preparing for penelopes trial i hadnt sung since then i tried picking out in dem schatten meiner locken but greta was right the piano needed tuning badly i called mr fortieri the next morning to see if he could come by to look at it he was an old man who repaired instruments for groups like the aeolus quintet and their ilk he also tuned pianos for them he only helped me because hed known my mother and admired her singing he arranged to come the next afternoon i was surprisedusually you had to wait four to six weeks for time on his schedulebut quickly reshuffled my own tuesday appointments to accommodate him when he arrived i realized that he had come so soon because chaims suicide attempt had shaken him i didnt have much stomach for rehashing it but i could see the old man was troubled and needed someone to talk to what bothers me victoria is what i should do with his clarinet ive been able to repair it but they tell me hell never play againsurely it would be too cruel to return it to him even if i didnt submit a bill his clarinet i asked blankly when did he give it to you after that disastrous west coast tour he said he had dropped it in some mudi still dont understand how that happened why he was carrying it outside without the case but he said it was clogged with mud and hed tried cleaning it only hed bent the keys and it didnt play properly it was a wonderful instrument only a few years old and costing perhaps six thousand dollars so i agreed to work on it hed had to use his old one in california and i always thought that was why the tour went so badly that and pauls death weighing on him of course so you repaired it and got it thoroughly clean i said foolishly oh yes of course the sound will never be as good as it was originally but it would still be a fine instrument for informal use onlyi hate having to give him a clarinet he can no longer play leave it with me i said gently ill take care of it mr fortieri seemed relieved to pass the responsibility on to me he went to work on the piano and tuned it back to perfection without any of his usual criticisms on my failure to keep to my mothers high musical standard as soon as hed gone i drove down to the university of chicago hospital chaim was being kept in the psychiatric wing for observation but he was allowed visitors i found him sitting in the lounge staring into space while peoples court blared meaninglessly on the screen overhead he gave his sad sweet smile when he saw me and croaked out my name in the hoarse parody of a voice can we go to your room chaim i want to talk to you privately he flicked a glance at the vacant faces around us but got up obediently and led me down the hall to a spartan room with bars on the window mr fortieri was by this afternoon to tune my piano he told me about your clarinet chaim said nothing but he seemed to relax a little how did you do it chaim i mean you left for california monday morning what did you docome back on the redeye redeye he croaked hoarsely even in the small space i had to lean forward to hear him the night flight oh the redeye yes yes i got to ohare at six came to pauls office on the el and was back at the airport in time for the ten oclock flight no one even knew id left la we had a rehearsal at two and i was there easily his voice was so strained it made my throat ache to listen to him i thought i hated paul you know all those remarks of his about responsibility i thought hed encouraged greta to leave me he stopped to catch his breath after a few gasping minutes he went on i blamed him for her idea that she didnt have to feel any obligation to our marriage then after i got back i saw lotty had been right greta was just totally involved in herself she should have been named narcissus she used pauls words without understanding them but penelope i said would you really have let penelope go to jail for you he gave a twisted smile i didnt mean them to arrest penelope i just thoughtive always had trouble with cold weather with chicago winters ive worn a long fur for years because im so small people often think im a woman when im wrapped up in it i just thought if anyone saw me they would think it was a woman i never meant them to arrest penelope he sat panting for a few minutes what are you going to do now vic send for the police i shook my head sadly youll never play againyoud have been happier doing life in joliet than you will now that you cant play i want you to write it all down though the name you used on your night flight and everything i have the clarinet even though mr fortieri cleaned it a good lab might still find blood traces the clarinet and your statement will go to the papers after you die penelope deserves that muchto have the cloud of suspicion taken away from her and ill have to tell her and lotty his eyes were shiny you dont know how awful its been vic i was so mad with rage that it was like nothing to break pauls neck but then after that i couldnt play anymore so you are wrong even if i had gone to joliet i would still never have played i couldnt bear the naked anguish in his face i left without saying anything but it was weeks before i slept without seeing his black eyes weeping onto me skin deep i the warning bell clangs angrily and the submarine dives sharply everyone to battle stations the nazis pursuing closely the bell keeps up its insistent clamor loud urgent filling my head my hands are wet i cant remember what my job is in this cramped tiny boat if only someone would turn off the alarm bell i fumble with some switches pick up an intercom the noise mercifully stops vic vic is that you what i know its late im sorry to call so late but i just got home from work its sal sal barthele oh sal sure i looked at the orange clock readout it was fourthirty sal owns the golden glow a bar in the south loop i patronize its my sister vic theyve arrested her she didnt do it i know she didnt do it of course not saldidnt do what theyre trying to frame her maybe the manager i dont know i swung my legs over the side of the bed where are you she was at her mothers house th and vincennes her sister had been arrested three hours earlier they needed a lawyer a good lawyer and they needed a detective a good detective whatever my fee was she wanted me to know they could pay my fee im sure you can pay the fee but i dont know what you want me to do i said as patiently as i could shethey think she murdered that man she didnt even know him she was just giving him a facial and he dies on her sal give me your mothers address ill be there in forty minutes the little house on vincennes was filled with neighbors and relatives murmuring encouragement to mrs barthele sal is very black and statuesque close to six feet tall with a majestic carriage she can break up a crowd in her bar with a look and a gesture mrs barthele was slight frail and lightskinned it was hard to picture her as sals mother sal dispersed the gathering with characteristic firmness telling the group that i was here to save evangeline and that i needed to see her mother alone mrs barthele sniffed over every sentence why did they do that to my baby she demanded of me you know the police you know their ways why did they come and take my baby who never did a wrong thing in her life as a white woman i could be expected to understand the machinations of the white mans law and to share responsibility for it after more of this meandering sal took the narrative firmly in hand evangeline worked at la cygnette a highprestige beauty salon on north michigan in addition to providing facials and their own brandname cosmetics at an exorbitant cost they massaged the bodies and feet of their wealthy clients stuffed them into steam cabinets ran them through a bataaninspired exercise routine and fed them herbal teas signor giuseppe would style their hair for an additional charge evangeline gave facials the previous day she had one client booked after lunch a mr darnell men go there a lot i interrupted sal made a face thats what i asked evangeline i guess its part of being a yuppiego spend a lot of money getting cream rubbed into your face anyway darnell was to have had his hair styled before his facial but the hairdresser fell behind schedule and asked evangeline to do the guys face first sal struggled to describe how a la cygnette facial workedneither of us had ever checked out her sisters job you sit in something like a dentists chair lean back relaxyoure naked from the waist up lying under a big down comforter the facial expertcosmetician was evangelines official tideputs cream on your hands and sticks them into little electrically heated mitts so your hands are out of commission if you need to protect yourself then she puts stuff on your face covers your eyes with heavy pads and goes away for twenty minutes while the face goo sinks into your hidden pores apparently while this darnell lay back deeply relaxed someone had rubbed some kind of poison into his skin when evangeline came back in to clean his face he was sickheaving throwing up it was awful she screamed for help and started trying to clean his faceit was terrible he kept vomiting on her they took him to the hospital but he died around ten tonight they came to get baby at midnightyouve got to help her v ieven if the guy tried something on her she never did a thing like thatshed haul off and slug him maybe but rubbing poison into his face you go help her ii evangeline barthele was a younger darker edition of her mother at most times she probably had sals energysparks of it flared now and then during our talkbut a night in the holding cells had worn her down i brought a clean suit and makeup for her justice may be blind but her administrators arent we talked while she changed this darnellyou sure of the namehad he ever been to the salon before she shook her head i never saw him and i dont think the other girls knew him either you know if a clients a good tipper or a bad one theyll comment on it be glad or whatever that hes come in nobody said anything about this man where did he live she shook her head i never talked to the guy v i what about the pestfree id read the arrest report and talked briefly to an old friend in the mes office to keep roaches and other vermin out of their posh michigan avenue offices la cygnette used a potent product containing a wonder chemical called chorpyrifos my informant had been awestruckonly an operation that didnt know shit about chemicals would leave chorpyrifos lying around its got a toxicity rating of fiveit gets you through the skinyou only need a couple of tablespoons to kill a big man if you know where to put it whoever killed darnell had either known a lot of chemistry or been luckyinto his nostrils and mouth with some rubbed into the face for good measure the pesticide had made him convulsive so quickly that even if he knew who killed him hed have been unable to talk or even reason evangeline said she knew where the poison was kepteveryone who worked there knew knew it was lethal and not to touch it but it was easy to get at just in a little supply room that wasnt kept locked so why you they have to have more of a reason than just that you were there she shrugged bitterly im the only black professional at la cygnette the other blacks working there sweep rooms and haul trash im trying hard not to be paranoid but i gotta wonder she insisted darnell hadnt made a pass at her or done anything to provoke an attackshe hadnt hurt the guy as for anyone else who might have had opportunity salon employees were always passing through the halls going in and out of the little cubicles where they treated clientsshed seen any number of people all with legitimate business in the halls but she hadnt seen anyone emerging from the room where darnell was sitting when we finally got to bond court later that morning i tried to argue circumstantial evidenceany of la cygnette s fifty or so employees could have committed the crime since all had access and no one had motive the prosecutor hit me with a very unpleasant surprise the police had uncovered evidence linking my client to the dead man he was a furniture buyer from kansas city who came to chicago six times a year and the doorman and the maids at his hotel had identified evangeline without any trouble as the woman who accompanied him on his visits bail was denied i had a furious talk with evangeline in one of the interrogation rooms before she went back to the holding cells why the hell didnt you tell me i walked into the courtroom and got blindsided theyre lying she insisted three people identified you if you dont start with the truth right now youre going to have to find a new lawyer and a new detective your mother may not understand but for sure sal will you cant tell my mother you cant tell sal im going to have to give them some reason for dropping your case and knowing sal its going to have to be the truth for the first time she looked really upset youre my lawyer you should believe my story before you believe a bunch of strangers you never saw before im telling you evangeline im going to drop your case i cant represent you when i know youre lying if you killed darnell we can work out a defense or if you didnt kill him and knew him we can work something out and i can try to find the real killer but when i know youve been seen with the guy any number of times i cant go into court telling people you never met him before tears appeared on the ends of her lashes the whole reason i didnt say anything was so mama wouldnt know if i tell you the truth youve got to promise me you arent running back to vincennes avenue talking to her i agreed whatever the story was i couldnt believe mrs barthele hadnt heard hundreds like it before but we each make our own separate peace with our mothers evangeline met darnell at a party two years earlier she liked him he liked hernot the romance of the century but they enjoyed spending time together shed gone on a twoweek trip to europe with him last year telling her mother she was going with a girlfriend first of all she has very strict morals no sex outside marriage im thirty mind you but that doesnt count with her second hes white and shed murder me she really would i think thats why i never fell in love with himif we wanted to get married id never be able to explain it to mama this latest trip to chicago darnell thought it would be fun to see what evangeline did for a living so he booked an appointment at la cygnette she hadnt told anyone there she knew him and when she found him sick and dying shed panicked and lied and if you tell my mother of this v iill put a curse on you my father was from haiti and he knew a lot of good ones i wont tell your mother but unless they nuked lebanon this morning or murdered the mayor youre going to get a lot of lines in the paper its bound to be in print she wept at that wringing her hands so after watching her go off with the sheriffs deputies i called murray ryerson at the heraldstar to plead with him not to put evangelines liaison in the paper if you do shell wither your testicles honest i dont know vic you know the suntimes is bound to have some kind of screamer headline like dead man found in facelicking sex orgy i cant sit on a story like this when all the other papers are running it i knew he was right so i didnt push my case very hard he surprised me by saying tell you what you find the real killer before my deadline for tomorrows morning edition and ill keep your clients personal life out of it the sex scoop came in too late for todays paper the trib prints on our schedule and they dont have it and the suntimes runs older slower presses so they have to print earlier i reckoned i had about eighteen hours sherlock holmes had solved tougher problems in less time iii roland darnell had been the chief buyer of livingroom furnishings for alexander dumas a highclass kansas city department store he used to own his own furniture store in the nearby town of lawrence but lost both it and his wife when he was arrested for drug smuggling ten years earlier because of some confusion about his guilthe claimed his partner who disappeared the night he was arrested was really responsiblehed only served two years when he got out he moved to kansas city to start a new life i learned this much from my friends at the chicago police at least my acquaintances i wondered how much of the story evangeline had known or her mother if her mother didnt want her child having a white lover how about a white excon ex presumably drugsmuggling lover i sat biting my knuckles for a minute it was eleven now say they started printing the morning edition at two the next morning id have to have my story by one at the latest i could follow one line and one line onlyi couldnt afford to speculate about mrs bartheleand anyway doing so would only get me killed by sal so i looked up the area code for lawrence kansas and found their daily newspaper the lawrence daily journalworld had set up a special number for handling press inquiries a friendly woman with a strong drawl told me darnells age fortyfour place of birth eudora kansas exwifes name ronna perkins and expartners name john crenshaw ronna perkins was living elsewhere in the country and the journalworld was protecting her privacy john crenshaw had disappeared when the police arrested darnell crenshaw had done an army stint in southeast asia in the late sixties since much of the bamboo furniture the store specialized in came from the far east some people speculated that crenshaw had set up the smuggling route when he was out there in the service especially since kansas city immigration officials discovered heroin in the hollow tubes making up chair backs if darnell knew anything about the smuggling he had never revealed it thats all we know here honey of course you could come on down and try to talk to some people and we can wire you photos if you want i thanked her politelymy paper didnt run too many photographs or even have wire equipment to accept them a pityi could have used a look at crenshaw and ronna perkins la cygnette was on an upper floor of one of the new marble skyscrapers at the top end of the magnificent mile tall white doors opened onto a hushed waiting room reminiscent of a highclass funeral parlor the undertaker a middleaged highly madeup woman seated at a table that was supposed to be french provincial smiled at me condescendingly what can we do for you id like to see angela carlson im a detective she looked nervously at two clients seated in a far corner i lowered my voice ive come about the murder butbut they made an arrest i smiled enigmatically at least i hoped it looked enigmatic the police never close the door on all options until after the trial if she knew anything about the police shed know that was a lieonce theyve made an arrest you have to get a presidential order to get them to look at new evidence the undertaker nodded nervously and called angela carlson in a whisper on the house phone evangeline had given me the names of the key players at la cygnette carlson was the manager she met me in the doorway leading from the reception area into the main body of the salon we walked on thick silver pile through a white maze with little doors opening onto it every now and then wed pass a whitecoated attendant who gave the manager a subdued hello when we went by a door with a police order slapped to it carlson winced nervously when can we take that off everybodys on edge and that sealed door doesnt help our bookings are down as it is im not on the evidence team ms carlson youll have to ask the lieutenant in charge when theyve got what they need i poked into a neighboring cubicle it contained a large white dentists chair and a tray covered with crimson pots and bottles all with the cutaway swans which were the salons trademark while the manager fidgeted angrily i looked into a tiny closet where clients changedit held a tiny sink and a few coat hangers finally she burst out didnt your people get enough of this yesterday dont you read your own reports i like to form my own impressions ms carlson sorry to have to take your time but the sooner we get everything cleared up the faster your customers will forget this ugly episode she sighed audibly and led me on angry heels to her office although the thick carpeting took the intended ferocity out of her stride the office was another of the small treatment rooms with a desk and a menacing phone console photographs of a youthful mme de leon founder of la cygnette covered the walls ms carlson looked through a stack of pink phone messages i have an incredibly busy schedule officer so if you could get to the point i want to talk to everyone with whom darnell had an appointment yesterday also the receptionist on duty and before i do that i want to see their personnel files really all these people were interviewed yesterday her eyes narrowed suddenly are you really with the police youre not are you youre a reporter i want you out of here now or ill call the real police i took my license photostat from my wallet im a detective thats what i told your receptionist ive been retained by the barthele family ms barthele is not the murderer and i want to find out who the real culprit is as fast as possible she didnt bother to look at the license i can barely tolerate answering police questions im certainly not letting some snoop for hire take up my time the police have made an arrest on extremely good evidence i suppose you think you can drum up a fee by getting evangelines family excited about her innocence but youll have to look elsewhere for your money i tried an appeal to her compassionate side using halfforgotten arguments from my court appearances as a public defender outstanding employee widowed mother sole support intense family pride no prior arrests no motive no sale ms carlson you the owner or the manager here why do you want to know just curious about your stake in the success of the place and your responsibility for decisions its like this youve got a lot of foreigners working here the immigration people will want to come by and check out their papers youve got lots and lots of tiny little rooms are they sprinklered do you have emergency exits the fire department can make a decision on that and how come your only black professional employee was just arrested and youre not moving an inch to help her out there are lots of lawyers around whod be glad to look at a discrimination suit against la cygnette now if we could clear up evangelines involvement fast we could avoid having all these regulatory people trampling around upsetting your staff and your customers how about it she sat in indecisive rage for several minutes how much authority did i have really could i offset the munificent fees the salon and the building owners paid to various public officials just to avoid such investigations should she call headquarters for instruction or her lawyer she finally decided that even if i didnt have a lot of power i could be enough of a nuisance to affect business her expression compounded of rage and defeat she gave me the files i wanted darnell had been scheduled with a masseuse the hair expert signor giuseppe and with evangeline i read their personnel files along with that of the receptionist who had welcomed him to la cygnette to see if any of them might have hailed from kansas city or had any unusual traits such as an arrest record for heroin smuggling the files were very sparse signor giuseppe fruttero hailed from milan he had no nextofkin to be notified in the event of an accident not even a good friend bruna the masseuse was lithuanian unmarried living with her mother other than the fact that the receptionist had been born as jean evans in hammond but referred to herself as monique from new orleans i saw no evidence of any kind of coverup angela carlson denied knowing either ronna perkins or john crenshaw or having any employees by either of those names she had never been near lawrence herself she grew up in evansville indiana came to chicago to be a model in couldnt cut it and got into the beauty business angrily she gave me the names of her parents in evansville and summoned the receptionist monique was clearly close to sixty much too old to be roland darnells exwife nor had she heard of ronna or crenshaw how many people knew that darnell was going to be in the salon yesterday nobody knew she laughed nervously i mean of course i knewi made the appointment with him and signor giuseppe knew when i gave him his schedule yesterday and bruna the masseuse of course and evangeline well who else could have seen their schedules she thought frantically her heavily mascaraed eyes rolling in agitation with another nervous giggle she finally said i suppose anyone could have known i mean the other cosmeticians and the makeup artists all come out for their appointments at the same time i mean if anyone was curious they could have looked at the other peoples lists carlson was frowning so was i im trying to find a woman whod be forty now who doesnt talk much about her past shes been divorced and she wont have been in the business long any candidates carlson did another mental search then went to the file cabinets her mood was shifting from anger to curiosity and she flipped through the files quickly pulling five in the end how long has signor giuseppe been here when we opened our chicago branch in he came to us from mirandasi guess hed been there for two years he says he came to the states from milan in he a citizen has he got a green card oh yes his papers are in good shape we are very careful about that at la cygnette my earlier remark about the immigration department had clearly stung and now i really need to get back to my own business you can look at those files in one of the consulting roomsmonique find one that wont be used today it didnt take me long to scan the five files all uninformative before returning them to monique i wandered on through the back of the salon in the rear a small staircase led to an upper story at the top was another narrow hall lined with small offices and storerooms a large mirrored room at the back filled with hanging plants and bright lights housed signor giuseppe a darkhaired man with a pointed beard and a bright smile he was ministering gaily to a thin middleaged woman talking and laughing while he deftly teased her hair into loose curls he looked at me in the mirror when i entered you are here for the hair signora you have the appointment no signor giuseppe sono qui perchè la sua fama se è sparsa ai fronte a lei milano è una bella città non è vero he stopped his work for a moment and held up a deprecating hand signora it is my policy to speak only english in my adopted country una vera stupida e ignorante usanza io direi i beamed sympathetically and sat down on a high stool next to an empty customer chair there were seats for two clients since signor giuseppe reigned alone i pictured him spinning at high speed between customers snipping here pinning there signora if you do not have the appointment will you please leave signora dotson here she does not prefer the audience sorry mrs dotson i said to the ladys chin im a detective i need to talk to signor giuseppe but ill wait i strolled back down the hall and entertained myself by going into one of the storerooms and opening little pots of la cygnette creams and rubbing them into my skin i looked in a mirror and could already see an improvement if i got evangeline sprung maybe shed treat me to a facial signor giuseppe appeared with a plastically groomed mrs dotson he had shed his barbers costume and was dressed for the street i followed them down the stairs when we got to the bottom i said in case youre thinking of going back to milan or even to kansas i have a few questions mrs dotson clung to the hairdresser ready to protect him i need to speak to him alone mrs dotson i have to talk to him about bamboo ill get miss carlson signor giuseppe his guardian offered no no signora i will deal with this crazed woman myself a million thanks grazie grazie remember no italian in your adopted america i reminded him nastily mrs dotson looked at us uncertainly i think you should get ms carlson i said also a police escort fast she made up her mind to do something whether to get help or flee i wasnt sure but she scurried down the corridor as soon as she had disappeared he took me by the arm and led me into one of the consulting rooms now who are you and what is this his accent had improved substantially im v i warshawski roland darnell told me you were quite an expert on fitting drugs into bamboo furniture i wasnt quite prepared for the speed of his attack his hands were around my throat he was squeezing and spots began dancing in front of me i didnt try to fight his arms just kicked sharply at his shin following with my knee to his stomach the pressure at my neck eased i turned in a half circle and jammed my left elbow into his rib cage he let go i backed to the door keeping my arms up in front of my face and backed into angela carlson what on earth are you doing with signor giuseppe she asked talking to him about furniture i was out of breath get the police and dont let him leave the salon a small crowd of whitecoated cosmeticians had come to the door of the tiny treatment room i said to them this isnt giuseppe fruttero its john crenshaw if you dont believe me try speaking italian to himhe doesnt understand it hes probably never been to milan but hes certainly been to thailand and he knows an awful lot about heroin iv sal handed me the bottle of black label its yours vic kill it tonight or save it for some other time how did you know he was roland darnells expartner i didnt at least not when i went to la cygnette i just knew it had to be someone in the salon who killed him and it was most likely someone who knew him in kansas and that meant either darnells exwife or his partner and giuseppe was the only man on the professional staff and then i saw he didnt know italianafter praising milan and telling him he was stupid in the same tone of voice and getting no response it made me wonder we owe you a lot vic the police would never have dug down to find that you gotta thank the lady mama mrs barthele grudgingly gave me her thin hand but how come those police said evangeline knew that darnell man my baby wouldnt know some convict some drug smuggler he wasnt a drug smuggler mama it was his partner the police have proved all that now roland darnell never did anything wrong evangeline chic in red with long earrings that bounced as she spoke made the point hotly sal gave her sister a measuring look all i can say evangeline is its a good thing you never had to put your hand on a bible in court about mr darnell i hastily poured a drink and changed the subject three dot po cinda goodrich and i were jogging acquaintances a professional photographer she kept the same erratic hours as a private investigator we often met along belmont harbor in the late mornings by then we had the lakefront to ourselves the hip young professionals run early so they can make their important eight oclock meetings cinda occasionally ran with her boyfriend jonathan michaels and always with her golden retriever threedot po or po the dogs name meant something private to her and jonathan they only laughed and shook their heads when i asked about it jonathan played the piano often at latenight private parties he was seldom up before noon and usually left exercise to cinda and po cinda was a diligent runner even on the hottest days of summer and the coldest of winter i do twentyfive miles a week in a grudging fight against age and calories but cinda made a tenmile circuit every morning with religious enthusiasm one december i didnt see her out for a week and wondered vaguely if she might be sick the following saturday however we met on the small promontory abutting belmont harbor she returning from her jaunt three miles farther north and i just getting ready to turn around for home as we jogged together she explained that eli burton the fancy north michigan avenue department store had hired her to photograph children talking to santa she made a face not the way eric lieberman got his start but itll finance january in the bahamas for jonathan and me she called to po who was inspecting a dead bird on the rocks by the water and moved on ahead of me the week before christmas the temperature dropped suddenly and left us with the bitterest december on record my living room was so cold i couldnt bear to use it i handled all my business bundled in bed even moving the television into the bedroom i didnt go out at all on christmas eve christmas day i was supposed to visit friends in one of the northern suburbs i wrapped myself in a blanket and went to the living room to scrape a patch of ice on a window i wanted to see how badly snowed over halsted street was assuming my poor little omega would even start i hadnt run for five days since the temperature first fell i was feeling flabby knew i should force myself outside but felt too lazy to face the weather i was about to go back to the bedroom and wrap some presents when i caught sight of a golden retriever moving smartly down the street it was po behind her came cinda warm in an orange down vest face covered with a ski mask ah nuts i muttered if she could do it i could do it layering on thermal underwear two pairs of wool socks sweatshirts and a down vest i told myself encouragingly quitters never win and winners never quit and its not the size of the dog in the fight that counts but the size of the fight in the dog the slogans got me out the door but they didnt prepare me for the shock of cold the wind sucked the air out of my lungs and left me gasping i staggered back into the entry way and tied a scarf around my face adjusted earmuffs and a wool cap and put on sunglasses to protect my eyes even so it was bitter going after the first mile the blood was flowing well and my arms and legs were warm but my feet were cold and even heavy muffling couldnt keep the wind from scraping the skin on my cheeks few cars were on the streets and no other people it was like running through a wasteland this is what it would be like after a nuclear war no people freezing cold snow blowing across in fine pelting particles like a desert sandstorm the lake made an even eerier landscape steam rose from it as from a giant cauldron the water was invisible beneath the heavy veils of mist i paused for a moment in awe but the wind quickly cut through the layers of clothes the lake path curved around as it led to the promontory so that you could only see a few yards ahead of you i kept expecting to meet cinda and po on their way back but the only person who passed me was a solitary male jogger anonymous in a blue ski mask and khaki down jacket at the far point of the promontory the wind blew unblocked across the lake it swept snow and frozen mist pellets with it blowing in a high persistent whine i was about to turn and go home when i heard a dog barking above the keening wind i hesitated to go down to the water but what if it was po separated from her mistress the rocks leading down to the lake were covered with ice i slipped and slid down trying desperately for handand toeholdseven if someone were around to rescue me i wouldnt survive a bath in subzero water i found po on a flat slab of rock she was standing where its edge hung over the mistcovered water barking furiously i called to her she turned her head briefly but wouldnt come by now i had a premonition of what would meet me when id picked my way across the slab i lay flat on the icy rock gripping my feet around one end and leaned over it through the mist to peer in the water as soon as i showed up po stopped barking and began an uneasy pacing and whining cindas body was just visible beneath the surface it was a fourfoot drop to the water from where i lay i couldnt reach her and i didnt dare get down in the water i thought furiously and finally unwound a long muffler from around my neck tying it to a jagged spur near me i wrapped the other end around my waist and prayed leaning over from the waist gave me the length i needed to reach into the water i took a deep breath and plunged my arms in the shock of the water was almost more than i could bear i concentrated on cinda on the dog thought of christmas in the northern suburbs of everything possible but the cold which made my arms almost useless you only have one chance vic dont blow it the weight of her body nearly dragged me in on top of cinda i slithered across the icy rock scissoring my feet wildly until they caught on the spur where my muffler was tied po was no help either she planted herself next to me whimpering with anxiety as i pulled her mistress from the water with water soaked in every garment cinda must have weighed two hundred pounds i almost lost her several times almost lost myself but i got her up i tried desperately to revive her po anxiously licking her face but there was no hope i finally realized i was going to die of exposure myself if i didnt get away from there i tried calling po to come with me but she wouldnt leave cinda i ran as hard as i could back to the harbor where i flagged down a car my teeth were chattering so hard i almost couldnt speak but i got the strangers to realize there was a dead woman back on the promontory point they drove me to the town hall police station i spent most of christmas day in bed layered in blankets drinking hot soup prepared by my friend dr lotty herschel i had some frostbite in two of my fingers but she thought they would recover lotty left at seven to eat dinner with her nurse carol alvarado and her family the police had taken cinda away and jonathan had persuaded po to go home with him i guess it had been a fairly tragic scenejonathan crying the dog unwilling to let cindas body out of her sight i hadnt been there myself but one of my newspaper friends told me about it it was only eight oclock when the phone next to my bed began ringing but i was deep in sleep buried in blankets it must have rung nine or ten times before i even woke up and another several before i could bring myself to stick one of my sore arms out to answer it hello i said groggily vic vic i hate to bother you but i need help who is this i started coming to jonathan michaels theyve arrested me for killing cinda i only get the one phone call he was trying to speak jauntily but his voice cracked killing cinda i echoed i thought she slipped and fell apparently someone strangled her and pushed her in after she was dead dont ask me how they know dont ask me why they thought i did it the problem isthe problem is po i dont have anyone to leave her with where are you now i swung my legs over the bed and began pulling on longjohns he was at their apartment four buildings up the street from me on his way downtown for booking and then to cook county jail the arresting officer not inhuman on christmas day would let him wait for me if i could get there fast i was half dressed by the time i hung up and quickly finished pulling on jeans boots and a heavy sweater jonathan and two policemen were standing in the entryway of his building when i ran up he handed me his apartment keys in the distance i could hear po s muffled barking do you have a lawyer i demanded ordinarily a cheerful bearded young man with long golden hair jonathan now looked rather bedraggled he shook his head dismally you need one i can find someone for you or i can represent you myself until we come up with someone better i dont practice anymore so you need someone whos active but i can get you through the formalities he accepted gratefully and i followed him into the waiting police car the arresting officers wouldnt answer any of my questions when we got down to the eleventh street police headquarters i insisted on seeing the officer in charge and was taken in to sergeant john mcgonnigal mcgonnigal and i had met frequently he was a stocky young man very able and i had a lot of respect for him im not sure he reciprocated it merry christmas sergeant its a terrible day to be working isnt it merry christmas miss warshawski what are you doing here i represent jonathan michaels seems someone got a little confused and thinks he pushed ms goodrich into lake michigan this morning were not confused she was strangled and pushed into the lake she was dead before she went into the water he has no alibi for the relevant time no alibi who in this city does have an alibi there was more to it than that he explained stiffly michaels and cinda had been heard quarreling late at night by their neighbors across the hall and underneath they had resumed their fight in the morning cinda had finally slammed out of the house with the dog around ninethirty he didnt follow her sergeant how do you know i explained that i had watched cinda from my living room and i didnt run into mr michaels out on the point i only met one person he pounced on that how could i be sure it wasnt jonathan finally agreeing to get a description of his clothes to see if he owned a navy ski mask or a khaki jacket mcgonnigal also pointed out that there were two ways to leave the lakefrontjonathan could have gone north instead of south maybe but youre spinning a very thin thread sergeant its not going to hold up now i need some time alone with my client he was most unhappy to let me represent michael but there wasnt much he could do about it he left us alone in a small interrogation room im taking it on faith that you didnt kill cinda i said briskly but for the record did you he shook his head no way even if i had stopped loving her which i hadnt i dont solve my problems that way he ran a hand through his long hair i cant believe this i cant even really believe cinda is dead its all happened too fast and now theyre arresting me his hands were beautiful with long strong fingers strong enough to strangle someone certainly what were you fighting about this morning fighting dont play dumb with me jonathan im the only help youve got your neighbors heard youthats why the police arrested you he smiled a little foolishly it all seems so stupid now i keep thinking if i hadnt gotten her mad she wouldnt have gone out there shed be alive now maybe maybe not what were you fighting about he hesitated those damned santa claus pictures she took i never wanted her to do it anyway shes too goodshe was too good a photographer to be wasting her time on that kind of stuff then she got mad and started accusing me of being lawrence welk and who was i to talk it all started because someone phoned her at one this morning id just gotten back from a gig he grinned suddenly painfully a lawrence welk gig and this call came in someone who had been in one of her santa shots said he was very shy and wanted to make sure he wasnt in the picture with his kid so would she bring him the negatives she had the negatives not burton s yeah stupid idiot she was developing the film herself apparently this guy called burton s first anyway to make a long story short she agreed to meet him today and give him the negatives and i was furious first of all why should she go out on christmas to satisfy some morons whim and why was she taking those dumbassed pictures anyway suddenly his face cracked and he started sobbing she was so beautiful and i loved her so much why did i have to fight with her i patted his shoulder and held his hand until the tears stopped you know if that was her caller she was going to meet thats probably the person who killed her i thought of that and thats what i told the police but they say its the kind of thing id be bound to make up under the circumstances i pushed him through another half hour of questions what had she said about her caller had he given his name she didnt know his name then how had she known which negatives were his she didntjust the day and the time hed been there so she was taking over the negatives for that morning thats all he knew shed been too angry to tell him what she was taking with her yes she had taken negatives with her he gave me detailed instructions on how to look after po just dry dog food no table scraps as many walks as i felt like giving hershe was an outdoor dog and loved snow and water she was very well trained they never walked her with a leash before i left i talked to mcgonnigal he told me he was going to follow up on the story about the man in the photograph at burton s the next day but he wasnt taking it too seriously he told me they hadnt found any film on cindas body but that was because she hadnt taken any with herjonathan was making up that too he did agree though to hold jonathan at eleventh street overnight he could get a bail hearing in the morning and maybe not have to put his life at risk among the gang members who run cook county jail disguised as prisoners i took a taxi back to the north side the streets were clear and we moved quickly every mile or so we passed a car abandoned on the roadside making the arctic landscape appear more desolate than ever once at jonathans apartment it took a major effort of will to get back outside with the dog po went with me eagerly enough but kept turning around looking at me searchingly as though hoping i might be transformed into cinda back in the apartment i had no strength left to go home i found the bedroom let my clothes drop where they would on the floor and tumbled into bed holy innocents day lavishly celebrated by my polish catholic relatives was well advanced before i woke up again i found po staring at me with reproachful brown eyes panting slightly all right all right i grumbled pulling the covers back and staggering to my feet id been too tired the night before even to locate the bathroom now i found it part of a large darkroom cinda apparently had knocked down a wall connecting it to the dining room she had a sink and builtin shelves all in one handy location prints were strung around the room and chemicals and lingerie jostled one another incongruously i borrowed a toothbrush cautiously smelling the toothpaste tube to make sure it really held crest not developing chemicals i put my clothes back on and took po around the block the weather had moderated considerably a bank thermometer on the corner stood at degrees po wanted to run to the lake but i didnt feel up to going that far this morning and called her back with difficulty after lunch if i could get my car started we might see whether any clues lay hidden in the snow i called lotty from cindas apartment explaining where i was and why she told me i was an idiot to have gotten out of bed the night before but if i wasnt dead of exposure by now i would probably survive until someone shot me somehow that didnt cheer me up while i helped myself to coffee and toast in cindas kitchen i started calling various attorneys to see if i could find someone to represent jonathan tim oldham whod gone to law school with me handled a goodsized criminal practice he wasnt too enthusiastic about taking a client without much money but i put on some not very subtle pressure about a lady id seen him with on the gold coast a few weeks ago who bore little resemblance to his wife he promised me jonathan would be home by supper time called me some unflattering names and hung up besides the kitchen bedroom and darkroom the apartment had one other room mostly filled by a grand piano stacks of music stood on the floorjonathan either couldnt afford shelves or didnt think he needed them the walls were hung with postersized photographs of jonathan playing taken by cinda they were very good i went back into the darkroom and poked around at the pictures cinda had put all her santa claus photographs in neatly marked envelopes shed carefully written the name of each child next to the number of the exposure on that role of film i switched on a light table and started looking at them shed taken pictures every day for three weeks which amounted to thousands of shots it looked like a needleinthehaystack type task but most of the pictures were of children the only others were ones cinda had taken for her own amusement panning the crowd or artsy shots through glass at reflecting lights presumably her caller was one of the adults in the crowd after lunch i took po down to my car she had no hesitation about going with me and leaped eagerly into the backseat you have too trusting a nature i told her she grinned at me and panted heavily the omega started after a few grumbling moments and i drove north to bryn mawr and back to get the battery well charged before turning into the lot at belmont harbor po was almost beside herself with excitement banging her tail against the rear window until i got the door open and let her out she raced ahead of me on the lake path i didnt try to call her back i figured id find her at cindas rock i moved slowly carefully scanning the ground for traces ofwhat film a business card the wind was so much calmer today and the air enough warmer that visibility was good but i didnt see anything at the lake the mist had cleared away leaving the water steely gray moving uneasily under its iron bands of cold po stood as i expected on the rock where id found her yesterday she was the picture of dejection she clearly had expected to find her mistress there i combed the area carefully and at last found one of those gray plastic tubes that film comes in it was empty i pocketed it deciding i could at least show it to mcgonnigal and hope he would think it important po left the rocks with utmost reluctance back on the lake path she kept turning around to look for cinda i had to lift her into the car during the drive to police headquarters she kept turning restlessly in the back of the car a trying maneuver since she was bigger than the seat mcgonnigal didnt seem too impressed with the tube id found but he took it and sent it to the forensics department i asked him what hed learned from burton s they didnt have copies of the photographs cinda had all those if someone ordered one they sent the name to cinda and she supplied the picture they gave mcgonnigal a copy of the list of the seven hundred people requesting pictures and he had someone going through to see if any of them were known criminals but he obviously believed it was a waste of time if it werent for the fact that his boss lieutenant robert mallory had been a friend of my fathers he probably wouldnt even have made this much of an effort i stopped to see jonathan who seemed to be in fairly good spirits he told me tim oldham had been by he thinks im a hippy and not very interesting compared to some of the mob figures he represents but i can tell hes doing his best he was working out the fingering to a schubert score using the side of the bed as a keyboard i told him po was well but waiting for me in the car outside so id best be on my way i spent the rest of the afternoon going through cindas santa photographs id finished about a third of them at five when tim oldham phoned to say that jonathan would have to spend another night in jail because of the christmas holidays he hadnt been able to arrange for bail you owe me vic this has been one of the more thankless ways ive spent a holiday youre serving justice tim i said brightly what more could you ask for think of the oath you swore when you became a member of the bar im thinking of the oaths id like to swear at you he grumbled i laughed and hung up i took po for one last walk gave her her evening food and drink and prepared to leave for my own place as soon as the dog saw me putting my coat back on she abandoned her dinner and started dancing around my feet wagging her tail to show that she was always ready to play i kept yelling no to her with no effect she grinned happily at me as if to say this was a game she often playedshe knew humans liked to pretend they didnt want her along but they always took her in the end she was very upset when i shoved her back into the apartment behind me as i locked the door she began barking retrievers are quiet dogs they seldom bark and never whine but their voices are deep and fullbodied coming straight from their huge chests good diaphragm support the kind singers seldom achieve cindas apartment was on the second floor when i got to the ground floor i could still hear po from the entryway she was clearly audible outside the front door ah nuts i muttered how long could she keep this up were dogs like babies did you just ignore them for a while and discipline them into going to sleep did that really work with babies after standing five minutes in the icy wind i could still hear po i swore under my breath and let myself back into the building she was totally ecstatic at seeing me jumping up on my chest and licking my face to show there were no hard feelings youre shameless and a fraud i told her severely she wagged her tail with delight still youre an orphan i cant treat you too harshly she agreed and followed me down the stairs and back to my apartment with unabated eagerness i took a bath and changed my clothes made dinner and took care of my mail then walked po around the block to a little park and back up the street to her own quarters i brought my own toothbrush with me this time there didnt seem much point in trying to leave the dog until jonathan got out of jail cinda and jonathan had few furnishings but they owned a magnificent stereo system and a large record collection i put some britten quartets on found a novel buried in the stack of technical books next to cindas side of the bed and purloined a bottle of burgundy i curled up on a beanbag chair with the book and the wine po lay at my feet panting happily altogether a delightful domestic scene maybe i should get a dog i finished the book and the bottle of wine a little after midnight and went to bed po padded into the bedroom after me and curled up on a rug next to the bed i went to sleep quickly a single sharp bark from the dog woke me about two hours later what is it girl nightmares i started to turn over to go back to sleep when she barked again quiet now i commanded i heard her get to her feet and start toward the door and then i heard the sound that her sharper ears had caught first someone was trying to get into the apartment it couldnt be jonathan i had his keys and this was someone fumbling trying different keys trying to pick the lock in about thirty seconds i pulled on jeans boots and a sweatshirt ignoring underwear my intruder had managed the lower lock and was starting on the upper po was standing in front of the door hackles raised on her back obedient to my whispered command she wasnt barking she followed me reluctantly into the darkroombathroom i took her into the shower stall and pulled the curtain across as quietly as i could we waited there in the dark while our intruder finished with locks it was an unnerving business listening to the rattling knowing someone would be on us momentarily i wondered if id made the right choice maybe i should have dashed down the back stairs with the dog and gotten the police it was too late now however we could hear a pair of boots moving heavily across the living room po gave a deep mean growl in the back of her throat doggy doggy are you in here doggy the man knew about po but not whether she was here he must not have heard her two short barks earlier he had a high tenor voice with a trace of a spanish accent po continued to growl very softly at last the far door to the darkroom opened and the intruder came in he had a flashlight which he shone around the room through the curtain i could see its point of light bobbing satisfied that no one was there he turned on the overhead switch this was connected to a ventilating fan whose noise was loud enough to mask po s continued soft growling i couldnt see him but apparently he was looking through cindas photograph collection he flipped on the switch at the light table and then spent a long time going through the negatives i was pleased with po i wouldnt have expected such patience from a dog the intruder must have sat for an hour while my muscles cramped and water dripped on my head and she stayed next to me quietly the whole time at last he apparently found what he needed he got up and i heard more paper rustling then the light went out now i shouted at po she raced out of the room and found the intruder as he was on his way out the far door blue light flashed a gun barked po yelped and stopped momentarily by that time i was across the room too the intruder was on his way out the apartment door i pulled my parka from the chair where id left it and took off after him po was bleeding slightly from her left shoulder but the bullet must only have grazed her because she ran strongly we tumbled down the stairs together and out the front door into the icy december night as we went outside i grabbed the dog and rolled over with her i heard the gun go off a few times but we were moving quickly too quickly to make a good target street lamps showed our man running away from us down halsted to belmont he wore the navy ski mask and khaki parka of the solitary runner id seen at the harbor yesterday morning hearing po and me behind him he put on a burst of speed and made it to a car waiting at the corner we were near the omega now i bundled the dog into the backseat sent up a prayer to the patron saint of delco batteries and turned on the engine the streets were deserted i caught up with the car a dark lincoln where sheridan road crossed lake shore drive at belmont instead of turning onto the drive the lincoln cut straight across to the harbor this is it girl i told po you catch this boy then we take you in and get that shoulder stitched up and then you get your favorite dinnereven if its a whole cow the dog was leaning over the front seat panting her eyes gleaming she was a retriever after all the lincoln stopped at the end of the harbor parking lot i halted the omega some fifty yards away and got out with the dog using a row of parked cars as cover we ran across the lot stopping near the lincoln in the shelter of a van at that point po began her deep insistent barking this was a sound which would attract attention possibly even the police so i made no effort to stop her the man in the lincoln reached the same conclusion a window opened and he began firing at us this was just a waste of ammunition since we were sheltered behind the van the shooting only increased po s vocal efforts it also attracted attention from lake shore drive out of the corner of my eye i saw the flashing blue lights which herald the arrival of chicago s finest our attacker saw them too a door opened and the man in the ski mask slid out he took off along the lake path away from the harbor entrance out toward the promontory i clapped my hands at po and started running after him she was much faster than me i lost sight of her in the dark as i picked my way more cautiously along the icy path shivering in the bitter wind shivering at the thought of the dark freezing water to my right i could hear it slapping ominously against the icecovered rocks could hear the man pounding ahead of me no noise from po her tough pads picked their way sure and silent across the frozen gravel as i rounded the curve toward the promontory i could hear the man yelling in spanish at po heard a gun go off heard a loud splash in the water rage at him for shooting the dog gave me a last burst of speed i rounded the end of the point saw his dark shape outlined against the rocks and jumped on top of him he was completely unprepared for me we fell heavily rolling down the rocks the gun slipped from his hand banged loudly as it bounced against the ice and fell into the water we were a foot away from the water fighting recklesslythe first person to lose a grip would be shoved in to die our parkas weighted our arms and hampered our swings he lunged clumsily at my throat i pulled away grabbed hold of his ski mask and hit his head against the rocks he grunted and drew back trying to kick me as i moved away from his foot i lost my hold on him and slid backwards across the ice he followed through quickly giving a mighty shove which pushed me over the edge of the rock my feet landed in the water i swung them up with an effort two icy lumps and tried to back away as i scrabbled for a purchase a dark shape came out of the water and climbed onto the rock next to me po not killed after all she shook herself spraying water over me and over my assailant the sudden bath took him by surprise he stopped long enough for me to get well away and gain my breath and a better position the dog shivering violently stayed close to me i ran a hand through her wet fur soon kid well get you home and dry soon just as the attacker launched himself at us a searchlight went on overhead this is the police a loudspeaker boomed drop your guns and come up the dark shape hit me knocked me over po let out a yelp and sunk her teeth into his leg his yelling brought the police to our sides they carried strong flashlights i could see a sodden mass of paper a small manila envelope with teethmarks in it po wagged her tail and picked it up again give me that our attacker yelled in his high voice he fought with the police to try to reach the envelope i threw that in the water how can this be how did she get it shes a retriever i said later at the police station we looked at the negatives in the envelope po had retrieved from the water they showed a picture of the man in the ski mask looking on with intense brooding eyes while santa claus talked to his little boy no wonder cinda found him worth photographing hes a cocaine dealer sergeant mcgonnigal explained to me he jumped a tenmilliondollar bail no wonder he didnt want any photographs of him circulating around were holding him for murder this time a uniformed man brought jonathan into mcgonnigals office the sergeant cleared his throat uncomfortably looks like your dog saved your hide mr michaels po who had been lying at my feet wrapped in a police horse blanket gave a bark of pleasure she staggered to her feet trailing the blanket and walked stiffly over to jonathan tail wagging i explained our adventure to him and what a heroine the dog had been what about that empty film container i gave you this afternoon sergeant apparently cinda had brought that with her to her rendezvous not knowing how dangerous her customer was when he realized it was empty hed flung it aside and attacked cinda we got a complete confession mcgonnigal said he was so rattled by the sight of the dog with the envelope full of negatives in her mouth that he completely lost his nerve i know hes got good lawyersone of thems your friend oldhambut i hope we have enough to convince a judge not to set bail jonathan was on his knees fondling the dog and talking to her he looked over his shoulder at mcgonnigal im sure oldham s relieved that you caught the right mana murderer who can afford to jump a tenmilliondollar bail is a much better client than one who can hardly keep a retriever in dog food he turned back to the dog but well blow our savings on a steak you get the steak and ill eat butchers blend tonight miss threedot po of blackstone peoples heroine and winner of the croix de chien for valor po panted happily and licked his face the takamoku joseki i mr and mrs takamoku were a quiet hardworking couple although they had lived in chicago since the s when they were relocated from an arizona detention camp they spoke only halting english occasionally i ran into mrs takamoku in the foyer of the old threeflat we both lived in on belmont or at the corner grocery store we would exchange a few stilted sentences she knew i lived alone in my thirdfloor apartment and she worried about it although her manners were too perfect for her to come right out and tell me to get myself a husband as time passed i learned about her son akira and her daughter yoshio both professionals living on the west coast i always inquired after them which pleased her with great difficulty i got her to understand that i was a private detective this troubled her she often wanted to know if i was doing something dangerous and would shake her head and frown as she asked i didnt see mr takamoku often he worked for a printer and usually left long before me in the morning unlike the de paul students who formed an everchanging collage on the second floor the takamokus did little entertaining or at least little noisy entertaining every sunday afternoon a procession of asians came to their apartment spent a quiet afternoon and left one or more caucasians would join them incongruous by their height and color after a while i recognized the regulars a tall bearded white man and six or seven japanese and koreans one sunday evening in late november i was eating sushi and drinking sake in a storefront restaurant on halsted the takamokus came in as i was finishing my first little pot of sake i smiled and waved at them and watched with idle amusement as they conferred earnestly darting glances at me while they argued a waitress brought them bowls of noodles and a plate of sushi they were clearly regular customers with regular tastes at last mr takamoku came over to my table i invited him and his wife to join me thank you thank you he said in an agony of embarrassment we only have question for you not to disturb you youre not disturbing me what do you want to know you are familiar with american customs that was a statement not a question i nodded wondering what was coming when a guest behaves badly in the house what does an american do i gave him my full attention i had no idea what he was asking but he would never have brought it up just to be frivolous it depends i said carefully did they break up your sofa or spill tea mr takamoku looked at me steadily fishing for a cigarette then he shook his head slowly not as much as breaking furniture not as little as tea on sofa in between id give him a second chance a slight crease erased itself from mr takamokus forehead a second chance a very good idea a second chance he went back to his wife and ate his noodles with the noisy appreciation that showed good japanese manners i had another pot of sake and finished about the same time as the takamokus we left the restaurant together i topped them by a good five inches and perhaps twenty pounds so i slowed my pace to a crawl to keep step with them mrs takamoku smiled you are familiar with go she asked giggling nervously im not sure i said cautiously wondering if they wanted me to conjugate an intransitive irregular verb its a game you have time to stop and see sure i agreed just as mr takamoku broke in with vigorous objections i couldnt tell whether he didnt want to inconvenience me or didnt want me intruding however mrs takamoku insisted so i stopped at the first floor and went into the apartment with her the living room was almost bare the lack of furniture drew the eye to a beautiful japanese doll on a stand in one corner with a bowl of dried flowers in front of her the only other furnishings were six little tables in a row they were quite thick and stood low on carved wooden legs their tops about eighteen inches square were crisscrossed with black lines which formed dozens of little squares two covered wooden bowls stood on each table goban mrs takamoku said pointing to one of the tables i shook my head in incomprehension mr takamoku picked up a covered bowl it was filled with smooth white disks the size of nickels but much thicker i held one up and saw beautiful shades and shadows in it clamshell mr takamoku said they cut then polish he picked up a second bowl filled with black disks slate he knelt on a cushion in front of one of the tables and rapidly placed black and white disks on intersections of the lines a pattern emerged this is go black play then white then black then white each try to make territory to make eyes he showed me an eyea clear space surrounded by black stones white cannot play here black safe now white must play someplace else i see i didnt really but i didnt think it mattered this afternoon someone knock stones from table turn upside down and scrape with knife this table i asked tapping the one he was playing on yes he swept the stones off swiftly but carefully and put them in their little pots he turned the board over in the middle was a hole carved and sanded the wood was very thicki suppose the hole gave it resonance i knelt beside him and looked i was probably thirty years younger but i couldnt tuck my knees under me with his grace and ease i sat crosslegged a faint scratch marred the sanded bottom was he american mr and mrs takamoku exchanged a look japanese but born in america she said like akira and yoshio i shook my head i dont understand its not an american custom i climbed awkwardly back to my feet mr takamoku stood with one easy movement he and mrs takamoku thanked me profusely i assured them it was nothing and went to bed ii the next sunday was a cold gray day with a hint of snow i sat in front of the television in my living room drinking coffee dividing my attention between novembers income and watching the bears both were equally feeble i was trying to decide on something friendlier to do when a knock sounded on my door the outside buzzer hadnt rung i got up stacking loose papers on one arm of the chair and balancing the coffee cup on the other through the peephole i could see mrs takamoku i opened the door her wrinkled ivory face was agitated her eyes dilated oh good good you here you must come she tugged at my hand i pulled her gently into the apartment whats wrong let me get you a drink no no she wrung her hands in agitation repeating that i must come i must come i collected my keys and went down the worn uncarpeted stairs with her her living room was filled with cigarette smoke and a crowd of anxious men mr takamoku detached himself from the group and hurried over to his wife and me he clasped my hand and pumped it up and down good good you come you are a detective yes you will see the police do not arrest naoe and me whats wrong mr takamoku hes dead hes killed naoe and i were in camp during world war they will arrest us whos dead he shrugged helplessly i dont know name i pushed through the group a white man lay sprawled on the floor his face had contorted in dreadful pain as he died so it was hard to guess his age his fair hair was thick and unmarked with gray he must have been relatively young a small dribble of vomit trailed from his clenched teeth i sniffed at it cautiously probably hydrocyanic acid not far from his body lay a teacup a japanese cup without handles the contents sprayed out from it like a rorschach without touching it i sniffed again the fumes were still discernible i got up has anyone left since this happened the tall bearded caucasian id noticed on previous sundays looked around and said no in an authoritative voice and have you called the police mrs takamoku gave an agitated cry no police no you are detective you find murderer yourself i shook my head and took her gently by the hand if we dont call the police they will put us all in jail for concealing a murder you must tell them the bearded man said ill do that who are you im charles welland im a physicist at the university of chicago but on sundays im a go player i see im v i warshawski i live upstairs im a private investigator the police look very dimly on all citizens who dont report murders but especially on pis welland went into the dining room where the takamokus kept their phone i told the takamokus and their guests that no one could leave before the police gave them permission then followed welland to make sure he didnt call anyone besides the police or take the opportunity to get rid of a vial of poison the go players seemed resigned albeit very nervous all of them smoked ferociously the thick air grew bluer four of them stood apart arguing in korean a lone man fiddled with the stones on one of the gobans none of them spoke english well enough to give a clear account of how the young man died when welland came back i asked him for a detailed report the physicist claimed not to know his name the dead man had only been coming to the go club the last month or two did someone bring him or did he just show up one day welland shrugged he just showed up word gets around among go players im sure he told me his nameit just didnt stick i think he worked for hansen electronic the big computer firm i asked if everyone there was a regular player welland knew all of them by sight if not by name they didnt all come every sunday but none of the others was a newcomer i see okay what happened today welland scratched his beard he had bushy arched eyebrows which jumped up to punctuate his stronger statements kind of like sean connery i found it pretty sexy i pulled my mind back to what he was saying i got here around onethirty i think three games were in progress this guyhe jerked his thumb toward the dead manarrived a bit later he and i played a game then mr hito arrived and the two of them had a game dr han showed up and he and i were playing when the whole thing happened mrs takamoku sets out tea and snacks we all wander around and help ourselves about four this guy took a swallow of tea gave a terrible cry and died is there anything important about the game they were playing welland looked at the board a handful of blackandwhite stones stood on the corner points he shook his head theyd just started it looks like our dead friend was trying one of the takamoku josekis thats a complicated oneive never seen it used in actual play before whats that anything to do with mr takamoku the joseki are the beginning moves in the corners takamoku is this onehe pointed at the far sidewhere black plays on the fivefour pointthe point where the fourth and fifth lines intersect it wasnt named for our host thats just coincidence iii sergeant mcgonnigal didnt find out much more than i did a thickset young detective he had a lot of experience and treated his frightened audience gently he was a little less kind to me demanding roughly why i was there what my connection with the dead man was who my client was it didnt cheer him up any to hear i was working for the takamokus but he let me stay with them while he questioned them he sent for a young korean officer to interrogate the koreans in the group welland who spoke fluent japanese translated the japanese interviews dr han the lone chinese struggled along on his own mcgonnigal learned that the dead mans name was peter folger he learned that people were milling around all the time watching each other play he also learned that no one paid attention to anything but the game they were playing or watching the japanese say the go player forgets his fathers funeral welland explained its a game of tremendous concentration no one admitted knowing folger outside the go club no one knew how he found out that the takamokus hosted go every sunday my clients hovered tensely in the background convinced that mcgonnigal would arrest them at any minute but they could add nothing to the story anyone who wanted to play was welcome at their apartment on sunday afternoon why should he show a credential if he knew how to play that was the proof mcgonnigal pounced on that was folger a good player everyone looked around and nodded yes not the bestthat was clearly dr han or mr kim one of the koreansbut quite good enough perhaps first kyu whatever that was after two hours of this mcgonnigal decided he was getting nowhere someone in the room must have had a connection with folger but we werent going to find it by questioning the group wed have to dig into their backgrounds a uniformed man started collecting addresses while mcgonnigal went to his car to radio for plainclothes reinforcements he wanted everyone in the room tailed and wanted to phone in the command in privacy a useless precaution i thought the innocent wouldnt know they were being followed and the guilty would expect it mcgonnigal returned shortly his face angry he had a blandfaced squarejawed man in tow derek hatfield of the fbi he did computer fraud for them our paths had crossed a few times on whitecollar crime id found him smart and knowledgeable but also humorless and overbearing hello derek i said without getting up from the cushion i was sitting on what brings you here he had the place under surveillance mcgonnigal said biting off the words he wont tell me who he was looking for derek walked over to folgers body covered now with a sheet which he pulled back he looked at folgers face and nodded im going to have to phone my office for instructions just a minute mcgonnigal said you know the guy right you tell me what you were watching him for derek raised his eyebrows haughtily ill have to make a call first dont be an ass hatfield i said you think youre impressing us with how mysterious the fbi is but youre not really you know your boss will tell you to cooperate with the city if its murder and we might be able to clear this thing up right now glory for everyone we know folger worked for hansen electronic he wasnt one of your guys working undercover was he hatfield glared at me i cant answer that look i said reasonably either he worked for you and was investigating problems at hansen or he worked for them and you suspected he was involved in some kind of fraud i know theres a lot of talk about hansens new series j computerwas he passing secrets hatfield put his hands in his pockets and scowled in thought at last he said to mcgonnigal is there someplace we can go and talk i asked mrs takamoku if we could use her kitchen for a few minutes her lips moved nervously but she took hatfield and me down the hall her apartment was laid out like mine and the kitchens were similar at least in appliances hers was spotless mine had that livedin look mcgonnigal told the uniformed man not to let anyone leave or make any phone calls and followed us hatfield leaned against the back door i perched on a bar stool next to a high wooden table mcgonnigal stood in the doorway leading to the hall you got someone here named miyake hatfield asked mcgonnigal looked through the sheaf of notes in his hand and shook his head anyone here work for kawamoto kawamoto is a big japanese electronics firm one of mitsubishis peers and a strong rival of hansen in the megacomputer market hatfield are you trying to tell us that folger was passing series j secrets to someone from kawamoto over the go boards here hatfield shifted uncomfortably we only got onto it three weeks ago folger was just a gobetween we offered him immunity if he would finger the guy from kawamoto he couldnt describe him well enough for us to make a pickup he was going to shake hands with him or touch him in some way as they left the building the judas trick i remarked huh hatfield looked puzzled mcgonnigal smiled for the first time that afternoon the man i kiss is the one you want you shouldve gone to catholic school hatfield yeah anyway folger mustve told this guy miyake we were closing in hatfield shook his head disgustedly miyake must be part of that group just using an assumed name we got a tail put on all of them he straightened up and started back toward the hall how was folger passing the information i asked it was on microdots stay where you are i might be able to tell you which one is miyake without leaving the building of course both hatfield and mcgonnigal started yelling at me at once why was i suppressing evidence what did i know theyd have me arrested calm down boys i said i dont have any evidence but now that i know the crime i think i know how it was done i just need to talk to my clients mr and mrs takamoku looked at me anxiously when i came back to the living room i got them to follow me into the hall theyre not going to arrest you i assured them but i need to know who turned over the go board last week is he here today they talked briefly in japanese then mr takamoku said we should not betray guest but murder is much worse man in orange shirt named hamai hamai or miyake as hatfield called him resisted valiantly when the police started to put handcuffs on him he popped a gelatin capsule into his mouth he was dead almost before they realized what he had done hatfield impersonal as always searched his body for the microdot hamai had stuck it to his upper lip where it looked like a mole against his dark skin iv how did you know mcgonnigal grumbled after the bodies had been carted off and the takamokus efforts to turn their life savings over to me successfully averted he turned over a go board here last week that troubled my clients enough that they asked me about it once i knew we were looking for the transfer of information it was obvious that folger had stuck the dot in the hole under the board hamai couldnt get at it so he had to turn the whole board over today folger must have put it in a more accessible spot hatfield left to make his topsecret report mcgonnigal followed his uniformed men out of the apartment welland held the door for me was his name hamai or miyake oh i think his real name was hamaithats what all his identification said he must have used a false name with folger after all he knew you guys never pay attention to each others namesyou probably wouldnt even notice what folger called him if you could figure out who folger was welland smiled his busy eyebrows danced how about a drink id like to salute a lady clever enough to solve the takamoku joseki unaided i looked at my watch three hours ago id been trying to think of something friendlier to do than watch the bears get pummeled this sounded like a good bet i slipped my hand through his arm and went outside with him sara paretsky
