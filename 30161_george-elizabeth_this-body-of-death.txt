elizabeth george this body of death book in the inspector lynley series for gaylynnie what a wretched man i am who will rescue me from this body of death romans beginnings reports from the investigating officers who interviewed both michael spargo and his mother prior to charges being filed against him all suggest that the morning of the boys tenth birthday began badly while such reports might well be deemed suspect considering the nature of michaels crime and the strength of the antipathy felt towards him by police and by members of his community one cannot ignore the fact that the extensive document written by the social worker who sat with him during his interrogations and his subsequent trial reveal the same information there will always be details that remain unavailable to the student of childhood abuse family dysfunction and the psychopathology that such abuse and dysfunction ultimately engender but major facts cannot be hidden because they will necessarily be witnessed or directly experienced by those who come into contact with individuals in the midst of displayingwhether consciously or unconsciouslytheir mental psychological and emotional disturbances such was the case with michael spargo and his family as one of nine boys michael had five older brothers two of these boys richard and pete ages eighteen and fifteen at the time as well as their mother sue each had an asbo filed against them as a result of ongoing disputes with their neighbours harassment of pensioners living on the council estate public drunkenness and destruction of public and private property there was no father present in the home four years prior to michaels tenth birthday donovan spargo had deserted wife and children and taken up life in portugal with a widow fifteen years his senior leaving a note of farewell and five pounds in coins on the kitchen table he had not been seen or heard of since he made no appearance at michaels trial sue spargo whose employment skills were minimal and whose education was limited to a failure to pass any one of her gcses readily admits that she took to the drink a bit too hard as a result of this desertion and was consequently largely unavailable to any of her boys from that time forward prior to donovan spargos desertion it seems that the family maintained some degree of external stability as indicated both by school reports and by anecdotal evidence from neighbours and the local police but once the head of the household departed whatever dysfunction had been hidden from the community came spilling out the family lived in buchanan estate a dreary sprawl of grey concreteandsteel tower blocks and unappealing terrace houses in a section of town fittingly called the gallows which was known for street fights muggings carjackings and burglaries murder was rare here but violence was common the spargos were among the luckier inhabitants because of the size of the family they lived in one of the terrace houses and not in one of the tower blocks they had a garden in the back of their house and a square of earth in the front although neither of these was kept up for planting the house contained a sitting room and kitchen four bedrooms and one bathroom michael shared a room with the younger boys there were five of them in all distributed in two sets of bunk beds three of the older boys shared an adjoining bedroom only richard the eldest had his own room a privilege apparently having to do with richards propensity for committing acts of violence upon his younger brothers sue spargo had a separate bedroom as well curiously in interviews she repeated several times that when any of the boys became ill they slept with her and not with that lout richard on michaels tenth birthday the local police were called shortly after seven in the morning a family dispute had escalated to the point of causing a disturbance in the immediate neighbourhood when the occupants of the house adjoining the spargos dwelling had attempted to intervene their later claim was that they were merely seeking peace and quiet this is in opposition to sue spargos allegation that they attacked her boys however a careful reading of everyones ensuing interview with the police shows that a brawl between richard and pete spargo began in the upstairs corridor of the spargo house and grew from the latter boys unhurried vacating of the bathroom richards subsequent attack upon pete was brutal as he was quite a bit larger and stronger than his fifteenyearold brother it brought sixteenyearold doug to his assistance which seems to have turned richard and pete into allies who then attacked doug by the time sue spargo waded into the fray it had spilled down the stairs when it appeared that she too was going to come under attack from richard and pete twelveyearold david sought to protect her with a butcher knife from the kitchen where hed gone allegedly to make his breakfast it was at this point that the neighbours became involved roused by the noise which they could hear through the badly insulated walls of the adjoining houses unfortunately the neighboursthree in allcame to the spargo residence armed with a cricket bat a tyre iron and a hammer and according to richard spargos account it was the sight of these that enflamed him going after the family they were was his direct statement the words of a boy who saw himself as the man of the house whose duty it was to protect his mother and siblings into this developing imbroglio michael spargo awakened richard and pete was going at it with mum his statement recounts we could hear them me and the little ones but we didnt want nothing to do with it he indicates that he wasnt frightened but when probed for more information its clear that michael did his best to give his older brothers a wide berth so as to avoid a thumping if i looked at them crosswise that he wasnt always able to avoid the thumping is a fact attested to by his teachers three of whom reported to social workers bruises scratches burns and at least one black eye seen on michaels body other than a single visit to the home however nothing more came of these reports the system it seems was overburdened there is some suggestion that michael passed on this abuse to his younger brothers indeed from accounts gathered once four of the children went into care it seems that michael was given the responsibility of seeing to it that his sibling stevie did not wee the sheets without resources as to how this was supposed to be accomplished he apparently administered regular thrashings to the sevenyearold who in turn took out his own rage on the other boys further down the line whether michael abused any of the littler boys that morning is not known he reports only that once the police arrived he got out of bed dressed in his school uniform and went down to the kitchen with the intention of having his breakfast he knew it was his birthday but he had no expectation of the day being acknowledged didnt care did i was how he later put it to the police breakfast consisted of frosted flakes and jam rolls there was no milk for the cerealmichael brings up this point twice in his earliest interviewsso michael ate the frosted flakes dry leaving most of the jam rolls for his younger brothers he put one of these into the pocket of his mustardcoloured anorak both the jam roll and the anorak becoming crucial details as things developed and he left the house through the back garden he said his intention was to go directly to school and in his first interview with the police he claims he did go there this was a story he did not change until he was read the statement made by his teacher attesting to his truancy that day at which point he changed his story to confess that he went into the allotments which were a feature of the buchanan estate and which were positioned behind the terrace where the spargos lived there he mightve give a bit of aggro to an old bugger working in a patch of veg and he mightve bashed in some shed door or something where he couldve nicked some secateurs maybe only i didnt keep them i never kept them the old bugger in question does verify michaels presence in the allotment at eight in the morning although its doubtful that the small enclosures of raised beds held much attraction for the boy who seems to have spent some fifteen minutes tramping them about according to the pensioner until i gave him a right proper talking to he swore like a little thug and scarpered it seems at this point that michael headed in the general direction of his school some half mile from the buchanan estate it was somewhere on this route however that he encountered reggie arnold reggie arnold was quite a contrast to michael spargo where michael was tall for his age and rake thin reggie was squat and had carried baby fat well beyond babyhood his head was regularly shaved to the skull which made him the subject of considerable teasing at school he was generally referred to as that slaphead wanker but unlike michaels his clothing was usually neat and clean his teachers report that reggie was a good boy but with a short fuse and when pressed they tend to identify the cause of this short fuse as dad and mums troubles and then theres the trouble with his sis and brother from this it is probably safe to assume that the unusual nature of the arnold marriage in addition to the disability of an older brother and the mental incapacity of a younger sister put reggie in a position of getting lost in the shuffle of daily life rudy and laura arnold it must be said had been dealt a difficult hand of cards their older son was permanently wheelchair bound from severe cerebral palsy and their daughter had been deemed unfit for a normal classroom education these two elements of the arnolds life had the effect of simultaneously focusing nearly all parental attention on the two problematic children and burdening what was already a rather fragile marriage in which rudy and laura arnold had separated time and again putting laura in the position of coping on her own caught up in the middle of trying familial circumstances reggie was unlikely to receive much attention laura readily confesses that she didnt do right by the boy but his father claims that he had him over the flat five or six times in apparent reference to meeting his paternal obligations during those periods when he and his wife were living apart as can be imagined reggies unmet need for nurturing metamorphosed into common attempts at gaining adult attention in the streets he evidenced this through petty thievery and the occasional bullying of younger children in the classroom he acted up this acting up was seen by his teachers unfortunately as the aforementioned short fuse and not as the cry for help it actually was when thwarted he was given to throwing his desk beating his head upon it and upon the walls and falling to the floor in a tantrum on the day of the crime accounts have itand cctv films confirmthat michael spargo and reggie arnold encountered each other at the corner shop nearest the arnold home and on michaels route to school the boys were acquainted and had evidently played together in the past but were as yet unknown to each others parents laura arnold reports that shed sent reggie to the shops for milk and the shopkeeper confirms that reggie purchased a half liter of semiskimmed he also apparently stole two mars bars for a bit of a laugh according to michael michael attached himself to reggie along the route back to the arnold house the boys extended their enjoyment of reggies errand by opening the milk and dumping its contents into the petrol tank of a harleydavidson motorcycle an act of mischief witnessed by the motorcycles owner who chased them unsuccessfully afterwards he was later to remember the mustardcoloured anorak that michael spargo was wearing and although he was not able to identify either boy by name he recognised a photo of reggie arnold when the police presented it to him along with other faces reaching home without the milk hed been sent out to fetch reggie reported to his motherwith michael spargo as putative witnessthat hed been bullied by two boys who took the money intended for the milk he cried and was getting himself into one of his states laura arnold reports and i believed him what else was there to do this is indeed a relevant question for without her husband in the home and considering that she was attempting alone to care for two disabled children a missing carton of milk no matter how needed it might have been that morning would have seemed a very small matter to her she did however want to know who michael spargo was and she asked her son that question reggie identified him as a mate from school and he took michael along to do his mothers next bidding which was evidently to get his sister out of bed by now it was in the vicinity of eight fortyfive and if the boys planned to go to school that day they were going to be late doubtless they knew this as michaels interview details an argument that reggie had with his mother following her instructions to him reggie started whingeing about how it would make him late but she didnt care she told him to get his bum upstairs and fetch his sister she said he was to pray to god and say thanks that he wasnt like the other two by which she likely was referring to the disabilities of his brother and sister this last remark from laura arnold appears to have been a common refrain despite the command reggie did not fetch his sister rather he told his mother to do the bad thing to herself these are michaels words as reggie seems to have been more direct and the boys left the house back in the street however they saw rudy arnold who during the time theyd spent in the kitchen with laura had arrived by car and was hanging bout outside like he was afraid to come in he and reggie exchanged a few words which seem to have been largely unpleasant at least on reggies part michael claims he asked who the man was assuming it was his mums boyfriend or something and reggie told him the stupid git was his father and followed this declaration with a minor act of vandalism he took a milk basket from a neighbours front step and threw it into the street where he jumped on it and crushed it according to michael he took no part in this his statement asserts that at this point he had every intention of going to school but that reggie announced he was doing a bunk and having some bloody fun for once it was reggie michael says and not michael himself who came up with the idea of including ian barker in what was to follow at eleven years of age ian barker had already been labeled as damaged difficult troubled dangerous borderline angry and psychopathic depending upon whose report is read he was at this time the only child of a twentyfouryearold mother his paternity remains unknown to this day but hed been brought up to believe that this young woman was his older sister he seems to have been quite fond of his grandmother who he naturally assumed was his mother but he apparently loathed the girl hed been taught to believe was his sister at the age of nine he was considered old enough to learn the truth however it was a truth he did not take well to hearing especially as it came hard on the heels of tricia barkers being asked to leave her mothers house and being told to take her son with her in this ians grandmother now says she was doing her best to practise the tough love i was willing to keep both of themthe lad and tricia tooas long as the girl worked but she wouldnt hold on to a job and she wanted parties and friends and staying out all hours and i reckoned if she had to bring up the boy on her own shed change her ways she didnt courtesy of the government tricia barker was given accommodation although the flat was small and she was forced to share a tiny bedroom with her son it was evidently in this room that ian began to witness his mother engaging in sexual acts with a variety of men and on at least four occasions with more than one man its worthy of note that ian consistently refers to her neither as his mother nor as tricia but rather through the use of pejorative terms such as slag cunt gash tart and minge bag his grandmother he doesnt refer to at all michael and reggie seem to have had no trouble locating ian barker that morning they did not go to his houseaccording to reggie his mum was pissed most of the time and she yelled abuse out the doorbut rather they came upon him in the act of shaking down a younger boy on the route to school ian had dumped the kids rucksack out on the pavement and was in the process of going through its contents to find anything of value but most particularly money there being nothing of value for him to take from the child ian shoved him meanlike against the side of a house in michaels words and started going at him neither reggie nor michael attempted to stop the harassment reggie says that it were only a bit of fun i could see he werent going to hurt him while michael claims he couldnt see xackly what he was up to a rather doubtful claim as all of the boys were in plain sight on the pavement nonetheless whatever ians full intentions were they came to nothing further a motorist stopped and demanded to know what they were doing and the boys ran off there have been suggestions that ians desire to hurt something that day having been thwarted became the root of what occurred later indeed under questioning reggie arnold seems only too eager to point the finger in ians direction but while ians anger had in the past certainly led him to commit acts the reprehensible nature of which caused him to be hated even more than the other two boys when the truth came out the evidence ultimately shows that he was an equal participant emphasis mine in what followed june the new forest hampshire chance alone brought her into his orbit later he would think that had he not looked down from the scaffolding at that precise moment had he taken tess directly home and not to the wood that afternoon she might not have come into his life but that idea comprised the very substance of what he was supposed to think which was a realisation he would only come to once it was far too late the time was midafternoon and the day was hot june generally prompted torrents of rain mocking anyones hope for summer but this year the weather was setting itself up to be different days of sun in a cloudless sky made the promise of a july and an august during which the ground would bake and the vast lawns within the perambulation would brown over sending the new forest ponies deep within the woodlands to forage he was high up on the scaffolding getting ready to climb to the peak of the roof where hed begun to apply the straw far more pliable than the reeds that comprised the rest of the materials the straw could be bent to form the ridge some people thought of this as the pretty bit on a thatched roof the scalloped pattern crisscrossed with spars in a decorative fashion but he thought of it as what it was that which protected the top layer of reeds from weather and avian damage hed got to the knuckle he was feeling impatient theyd been working on the enormous project for three months and hed promised to begin another in two weeks time the finishing work still needed doing and he could not hand off that part of the job to his apprentice cliff coward was not ready to use the leggett on the thatch that work was crucial to the overall look of the roof and it required both skill and a properly honed eye but cliff could hardly be trusted to do this level of work when so far he hadnt managed to stay on task with even the simplest job like the one he was meant to be doing just now which was hauling another two bundles of straw up to the ridge as hed been instructed and why had he not managed this most mundane of tasks seeking an answer to that question was what altered gordon jossies life he turned from the ridge calling sharply cliff what the bloody hells happened to you and he saw below him that his apprentice was no longer standing by the bundles of straw where he was supposed to be anticipating the needs of the master thatcher above him rather hed gone over to gordons dusty pickup some yards away there tess sat at attention happily wagging her bushlike tail while a womana stranger and clearly a visitor to the gardens if the map she held and the clothing she wore were anything to go bypatted her golden head oy cliff gordon jossie shouted both the apprentice and the woman looked up gordon couldnt see her face clearly because of her hat which was broad brimmed and fashioned from straw with a fuchsia scarf tied round it as a band this same colour was in her dress as well and the dress was summery showing off tanned arms and long tanned legs she wore a gold bracelet round her wrist and sandals on her feet and she carried a straw handbag tucked under her arm its strap looped over her shoulder cliff called out sorry i was helping this lady as the woman said ive got myself completely lost with a laugh she went on im awfully sorry he offered she gestured with the map she was holding as if to explain what was patently obvious shed somehow wandered from the public gardens to the administrative building which gordon was reroofing ive never actually seen someone thatch a roof before she added perhaps in an effort to be friendly gordon however wasnt feeling friendly he was feeling sharp all edges and most of them needing to be smoothed he had no time for tourists shes trying to get to monets pond cliff called out and im trying to get a bloody ridge put onto this roof was gordons reply although he made it in an undertone he gestured northwest theres a path up by the fountain the nymphs and fauns fountain youre meant to turn left there you turned right did i the woman called back wellthats typical i spose she stood there for a moment as if anticipating further conversation she was wearing dark glasses and it came to gordon that the entire effect of her was as if she was a celebrity a marilyn monroe type because she was shapely like marilyn monroe not like the pinthin girls one generally saw indeed he actually thought at first that she might be a celebrity she rather dressed like one and her expectation that a man would be willing to stop what he was doing and eagerly converse with her suggested it as well he replied briefly to the woman with you should find your way easy enough now were that only the truth she said she added rather ridiculously he thought there wont be anywell any horses up there will there he thought what the hell and she added its onlyim actually rather afraid of horses ponies wont hurt you he replied theyll keep their distance less you try to feed them oh i wouldnt that she waited for a moment as if expecting him to say more which he was not inclined to do finally she said anywaythank you and that was the end of her she set off on the route that gordon had indicated and she removed her hat as she went and swung it from her fingertips her hair was blond cut like a cap round her head and when she shook it it fell neatly back into place with a shimmer as if knowing what it was supposed to do gordon wasnt immune to women so he could see she had a graceful walk but he felt no stirring in his groin or in his heart and he was glad of this untouched by women was how he liked it cliff joined him on the scaffolding two bundles of straw on his back he said tess quite liked her as if in explanation of something or perhaps in the womans defence and he added could be time for another go mate as gordon watched the woman gain distance from them but gordon wasnt watching her out of fascination or attraction he was watching to see if she made the correct turn at the fountain of nymphs and fauns she did not he shook his head hopeless he thought shed be in the cow pasture before she knew it but he fully expected she would also be able to find someone else to help her there cliff wanted to go for a drink at the end of the day gordon did not he did not drink at all he also never liked the idea of becoming chummy with his apprentices beyond that the fact that cliff was only eighteen made gordon thirteen years his senior and most of the time he felt like his father or he felt the way a father might feel he supposed as he had no children and possessed neither the desire nor the expectation of having them he said to cliff got to give tess a run she wont settle tonight if she doesnt work off some energy cliff said you sure then mate gordon said reckon i know my dog he knew that cliff hadnt been talking about tess but he liked the way his remark served to cut off conversation cliff enjoyed talking far too much gordon dropped him at the pub in minstead a hamlet tucked into a fold of land consisting of a church a graveyard a shop the pub and a cluster of old cob cottages gathered round a small green this was shaded by an ancient oak and near it a piebald pony grazed its clipped tail grown out in the time that had passed since the last autumn drift when it had been marked the pony didnt look up as the pickup rumbled to a stop not terribly far from its hind legs longtime denizen of the new forest the animal knew that its right to graze wherever it wished long preceded the pickups right to travel the hampshire roads cliff said morrow then and went off to join his mates in the pub gordon watched him go and for no particular reason waited till the door closed behind him then he put the pickup into gear once more he went as always to longslade bottom over time hed learned there was security in being a creature of habit at the weekend he might well choose another spot to exercise tess but during the week at the end of his workday he liked a place that was closer to where he lived he also liked the openness of longslade bottom and in moments when he felt a need for seclusion he liked the fact that hinchelsea wood climbed the hillside just above it the lawn stretched out from an uneven car park over which gordon jounced with tess in the back of the pickup yelping happily in anticipation of a run on a fine day like this gordons wasnt the only vehicle nosing the edge of the lawn six cars lined up like nursing kittens against the sprawl of open land upon which in the distance a herd of ponies grazed five foals among them used to both people and the presence of other animals the ponies remained undisturbed by the barking of the dogs already at play on the lawn but when gordon saw them some hundred yards away he knew that a free run on the closely cropped grass was not on the cards for his own dog tess had a thing about the wild new forest ponies and despite having been kicked by one nipped by another and thoroughly scolded by gordon time and again she refused to understand that she had not been created for the purpose of chasing them already she was itching to do so she was whining and licking her chops as if in anticipation of a challenge that she assumed lay before her gordon could almost read her canine mind and foals as well wicked what fun he said dont even think about it and he reached inside the pickup bed for her lead he clipped it on and then released her she made a hopeful lunge when he brought her up short heavy drama ensued as she coughed and gagged it was he thought with resignation a typical late afternoon with his dog dont have the brains god gave you do you he asked her tess looked at him wagged her tail and dogsmiled that may have worked at one time he went on but it wont work now were not going that direction he led the golden retriever northeast determinedly away from the ponies and their offspring she went but she was not averse to what manipulation she could manage she looked repeatedly over her shoulder and whined obviously in the hope that this would move him to change his mind it did not longslade bottom comprised three areas the lawn upon which the ponies were grazing a heath to the northwest that budded with crossleaved heather and purple moorgrass and a central bog between the two where amorphous cushions of sphagnum moss soaked up moving water while bogbean flowers grew in pink and white bursts from rhizomes that rose from shallow pools a path from the car park led walkers on the safest route through the bog and along this route the feathery seed heads of cotton grass formed great white tussocks in the peaty soil gordon headed in this last direction for the path across the bog would take them up the slope to hinchelsea wood in the wood he could release the dog the ponies would be out of sight and for tess out of sight was decidedly out of mind she possessed that most admirable of qualities she could live entirely in the moment summer solstice was not far off so the sun was still high in the cloudless sky despite the hour of the day its light flashed against the iridescent bodies of dragonflies and upon the bright plumage of lapwings taking to the air as gordon and the dog passed by a slight breeze bore the rich scent of peat and the decomposing vegetation that had created it the entire atmosphere was alive with sounds from the gravelly courlee call of curlews to the cries of dog owners out on the lawn gordon kept tess close they began the ascent towards hinchelsea wood and left both bog and lawn behind them when he thought about it gordon decided the wood was better for an afternoon walk anyway with the beeches and oaks in full summer leaf and the birches and sweet chestnuts providing additional cover it would be cool on the paths beneath the trees after a day in the heat hauling about reeds and straw on a rooftop gordon was ready for a respite from the sun he released the dog when they reached the two cypresses that marked the official entrance to the wood and he watched her till she disappeared entirely into the trees he knew that shed return eventually dinner wasnt far off and tess wasnt a dog to miss her meals he himself walked along and kept his mind occupied here in the wood he named the trees hed been a student of the new forest since coming to hampshire and after a decade he knew the perambulation its character and its heritage better than most natives after a bit he sat on the trunk of a downed alder not far from a grove of holly sunlight filtered through the tree branches here dappling ground that was spongy with years of natural composting gordon continued to name the trees as he saw them and went on to the plants but there were few of these as the wood was part of the grazing land and as such was fed upon by ponies donkeys and fallow deer in april and may they would have made a feast of the tender spring growth of ferns happily moving on from these to wildflowers juvenile alders and the shoots of new brambles the animals thus made gordons occupation of mind a challenge even as they sculpted the landscape in such a way that walking beneath the trees in the wood was a simple thing and not a challenge described by beating a path through undergrowth he heard the dog bark and roused himself he wasnt worried for he recognised the different kinds of barks that tess produced this was her happy bark the one she used to greet a friend or a stick thrown into hatchet pond he rose and looked in the direction from which the barking continued it came nearer and as it did so he heard a voice accompanying it a womans voice soon enough he saw her emerge from beneath the trees he did not recognise her at first for shed changed her clothes from the summer frock the sunhat and the sandals shed altered her getup to khaki trousers and a shortsleeved shirt she still had on her sunglassesso did he for that matter for the day continued brightand her footwear was again largely inappropriate for what she was doing while shed given up the sandals shed replaced them with wellingtons a very odd choice for a summer stroll unless she intended to trek through the bog she spoke first saying i thought this was the same dog shes the sweetest thing he might have thought shed followed him to longslade bottom and hinchelsea wood save for the obvious fact that shed got there before him she was on her way out he was on his way in he was leery of people but he refused to be paranoid he said youre the woman looking for monets pond i did find it she replied though not without ending in a cow pasture first yes he said she tilted her head her hair caught the light again just as it had done at boldre gardens he wondered stupidly if she put sparkles in it hed never seen hair with such a sheen yes she repeated he stammered i know i mean yes i know i could tell from how you were going oh you were watching me from the rooftop were you i hope you didnt laugh that would be too cruel no he said well im wretched at map reading and not much better with verbal directions so its no surprise i got lost again at least i didnt run into any horses he looked round them not a good place to be this is it if youre bad with maps and directions in the wood you mean but ive had help she gestured to the south and he saw she was pointing to a distant knoll where an enormous oak stood beyond the wood itself i very carefully kept that tree in sight and on my right as i came into the wood and now that its on my left i feel fairly sure im heading in the direction of the car park so you see despite stumbling onto a thatching site and into a cow pasture im not entirely hopeless thats nelsons he said what dyou mean someone owns the tree its on private property no its on crown land all right its called nelsons oak supposedly he planted it lord nelson that is ah i see he looked at her more closely shed sucked in on her lip and it came to him that she might not actually know who lord nelson was some people didnt in this day and age to help her out while not embarrassing her he said admiral nelson had his ships built over bucklers hard beyond beaulieu you know the place on the estuary they were using up a hell of a lot of timber so they had to start replanting nelson probably didnt put any acorns in the ground himself but the trees associated with him anyway im not from this place she told him but i expect you worked that out yourself she extended her hand gina dickens she said no relation i know this is tess with a nod at the dog whod settled herself happily at ginas sidebut i dont know you gordon jossie he told her and clasped her hand the soft touch of it brought to mind how work roughened he himself was how filthy as well considering hed spent all day on a rooftop i reckoned as much what that you werent from round here yes well i suppose the natives dont get lost as easily as i do do they not that your feet she looked down whats wrong with them the sandals you were wearing at boldre gardens and now those he said whyve you got on wellies you going into the bog or something she did that bit with her mouth again he wondered if it meant she was trying not to laugh youre a country person arent you so youll think im foolish its the adders she said ive read theyre in the new forest and i didnt want to run into one now youre going to laugh at me arent you he did have to smile expect to run into snakes in the forest then he didnt wait for an answer theyre out on the heath theyll be where theres more sun could be you might run into one on the path as you cross the bog but its not very likely i can see i should have consulted you before i changed my clothes have you lived here forever ten years i came down from winchester but so have i she gave a look in the direction shed come from and said shall i walk with you for a while gordon jossie i know no one in the area and id love to chat and as you look harmless and youre out here with the sweetest dog he shrugged suit yourself but im just following tess we dont need to walk at all shell take herself into the wood and come back when shes readyi mean if youd rather sit instead of walk oh i would actually truth to tell ive had quite a ramble already he nodded to the log on which he himself had been seated when shed first emerged from the trees they sat a careful few feet from each other but tess didnt leave them as hed thought she would rather she settled next to gina she sighed and put her head on her paws likes you he noted empty places need filling how true she said she sounded regretful so he asked her the obvious it was unusual for someone her age to move into the country young adults generally migrated in the other direction she said well yes it was a relationship gone very bad but she said it with a smile so here i am im hoping to work with pregnant teenagers thats what i did in winchester did you you sound surprised why you dont look much moren a teenager yourself she lowered her sunglasses down her nose and looked at him over their tops are you flirting with me mr jossie she asked he felt a rush of heat in his face sorry didnt mean to if thats what it was oh pooh i rather thought you might she shoved her sunglasses to the top of her head and looked at him frankly her eyes he saw were neither blue nor green but something in between indefinable and interesting she said youre blushing ive never made a man blush before its rather sweet do you blush often he grew hotter still he didnt have these sorts of conversations with women he didnt know what to make of them the women or the conversations im embarrassing you im sorry i didnt intend to i tease sometimes its a bad habit perhaps you can help me break it teasings all right he said im moreim a bit at sixes and sevens mostly welli thatch roofs day in and day out thats bout it and for entertainment for relaxation for a diversion a break he tilted his chin to indicate the dog thats what shes for hmmm i see she bent to tess and petted the dog where she liked it best just outside her ears if the retriever could have purred she would have done so gina seemed to reach a decision for when she looked up her expression was thoughtful would you like to come out for a drink with me as i said i know no one in the area and as you do continue to seem quite harmless and as im harmless and as you have a lovely dogwould you like to i dont drink actually she raised her eyebrows you take in no liquids at all that cant be the case he smiled in spite of himself but he made no reply i was going to have a lemonade she said i dont drink either my dadhe hit it rather hard so i stay away from the stuff it made me a misfit in school but in a good way i think ive always liked to be different from others she rose then and brushed off the seat of her trousers tess rose as well and wagged her tail it was clear that the dog had accepted gina dickens impulsive invitation what was left for gordon was simply to do likewise still he hesitated he preferred to keep himself distant from women but she wasnt proposing involvement was she and for gods sake she looked safe enough her gaze was frank and friendly he said theres a hotel in sway she looked startled and he realised how that declaration had sounded ears burning he hastened to add i mean sways closest to here and theyve got no pub in the village everyone uses the hotel bar you can follow me there we can have that drink her expression softened you are really the loveliestseeming man oh i dont expect thats true it is really they began to walk tess loped ahead and then in a marvel that gordon would not soon forget the dog waited at the edge of the wood where the path curved down the hill in the direction of the bog she was he saw pausing to have the lead attached to her collar that was a first he wasnt a man to look for signs but this seemed to be yet another indication of what he was meant to do next when they reached the dog he attached her to her lead and handed it over to gina he said to her what did you mean no relation she drew her eyebrows together he went on no relation thats what you said when you told me your name again that expression it was softness and something more and it made him wary even as he wanted to approach it charles dickens she said the writer im no relation to him oh he said i donti never read much do you not she asked as they set off down the hillside she put her hand through his arm as tess led them on their way i expect well have to do something about that july chapter one when meredith powell awakened and saw the date on her digital alarm clock she absorbed four facts in a matter of seconds it was her twentysixth birthday it was her day off from work it was the day for which her mum had suggested a granspoilstheonlygrandchild adventure and it was the perfect opportunity for apologising to her best and oldest friend for a row that had kept them from being best and oldest friends for nearly a year this last realisation came about because meredith shared her birthday with that best and oldest of friends she and jemima hastings had been thick as thieves from the time they were six years old and theyd celebrated their birthdays together from their eighth one on meredith knew that if she didnt make things right with jemima today she probably wouldnt ever do it and if that happened a tradition that shed long held dear was going to be destroyed she didnt want that dear friends werent easy to come by the how of the apology took a little thought which meredith engaged in as she showered she settled on a birthday cake she would bake it herself take it to ringwood and present it to jemima along with her heartfelt apology and her admission of wrongdoing what she would not include in the apology and the admission was any mention of jemimas partner whod been the source of their row in the first place for meredith now understood that would be pointless one simply had to face the fact that jemima had always been a romantic when it came to blokes whereas shemeredithhad the complete and utterly undeniable experience of knowing men were essentially animals in human clothing they wanted women for sex childbearing and housewiving if they could just say that instead of pretending they were desperate for something else women who involved themselves with them could then make an informed choice about how they wanted to live their lives instead of believing they were in love meredith poohpoohed the entire idea of love been there done that and cammie powell was the result five years old the light of her mothers life fatherless and likely to remain that way cammie was at that moment bashing away on the bathroom door calling mummy mummmmmmmmeeeeeee gran says were going to see the otters today n well have ice lollies n beef burgers will you come s well cos theres owls too she says someday well go to the hedgehog hospital but thats for an overnight trip and she says i got to be older for that she thinks ill miss you thats what she says but you could come couldnt you couldnt you mummy mummmmmeeeee meredith chuckled cammie awakened every morning in fullmonologue mode and she generally did not cease talking until it was time to go to bed meredith said as she toweled herself off have you had your breakfast already luv i forgot cammie informed her meredith could hear some scuffling and knew her daughter was shuffling her slippered feet on the floor but anyways gran says theyve got babies baby otters she says when their mums die or when they get eaten their babies need someone to look after them properly and they do that at the park the otter park what eats an otter mummy dont know cam something has to everything eats everything or something mummy mummmeee meredith shrugged into her dressing gown and pulled the door open cammie stood there the mirror image of meredith at the very same age she was too tall for five and like meredith far too thin it was a real gift meredith thought that cammie did not resemble her worthless father in the slightest this was beyond good since her father had sworn he would never see her should meredith be pigheaded and carry on with this pregnancy because for gods sake ive a wife you little fool and two children and you bloody well knew that meredith give us our morning hug cam meredith said to her daughter then wait for me in the kitchen ive a cake to bake dyou want to help grans making breakfast in the kitchen i expect theres room for another two cooks that turned out to be the case while merediths mother worked at the cooker turning eggs and overseeing bacon meredith herself began the cake it was simple enough as she used a boxed mix which her mother tuttutted as meredith emptied its contents into a bowl its for jemima meredith told her bit like taking you know what to newcastle janet powell noted well of course it was but that couldnt be helped besides it was the thought that mattered not the cake itself beyond that even working from scratch with ingredients provided by some goddess of the pantry meredith would never have been able to match what jemima could fashion out of flour eggs and all the rest so why try it wasnt a contest after all it was a friendship in need of rescue gran and granddaughter were off on their adventure with the otters and granddad had taken himself to work when meredith finally had the cake completed shed chosen chocolate with chocolate frosting and if it was just a tiny bit lopsided and a tinier bit sunken in the middlewell that was what frosting was for wasnt it copiously used and with plenty of flourish it covered a host of errors the heat of the oven had raised the temperature in the kitchen so meredith found she had to shower another time before she could set off for ringwood then as was her habit she covered herself shoulders to toes in a caftan to disguise the beanpole nature of her body and she carried the chocolate cake to her car she placed it carefully on the passenger seat god it was hot she thought it was absolutely boiling and it wasnt even ten am shed thought the days heat had been all about having the oven blasting away in the kitchen but that was clearly not the case she lowered the windows in the car eased herself onto the sizzling seat and set out on her journey shed have to get the cake out of the car as soon as possible or shed have nothing but a pool of chocolate left the trip to ringwood wasnt overly long just a dash down the a with the wind blowing in through the windows and her affirmation tape playing at high volume a voice was intoning i am and i can i am and i can and meredith concentrated on this mantra she didnt actually believe this sort of thing really worked but she was determined to leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of her career a tailback at the ringwood exit reminded her it was market day the town centre was going to be jammed with shoppers surging towards the market square where once each week stalls spread out colourfully beneath the neonorman tower of st peter and paul parish church in addition to the shoppers there would be the tourists for at this time of year the new forest was teeming with them like crows on roadkill campers walkers cyclists amateur photographers and all other forms of outdoor enthusiasts meredith gave a glance at her chocolate cake it had been a mistake to place it on the seat and not on the floor the sun was blasting fully upon it and the chocolate frosting wasnt benefiting from the experience meredith had to admit that her mother had been right what on earth was she thinking bringing jemima a cake well it was too late now to change her plans perhaps they could laugh about it together when she finally managed to get herself and her cake to jemimas shop this was the cupcake queen located in hightown road and meredith herself had been instrumental in jemimas finding the vacant space hightown road was a bit of a mixed bag which made it perfect for the cupcake queen on one side of the street redbrick residences took the form of terraces and semis that curved along in a pleasant bow of arched porches bay windows and dormer windows with white gingerbread woodwork forming their lacy peaks an old inn called the railway hotel stood farther along this side of the street with plants tumbling from wroughtiron containers that hung above its windows spilling colour towards the pavement below on the other side things automotive offered services from car repair to fourbyfour sales a hair salon occupied space next to a launderette and when meredith had first seen adjacent to this an empty establishment with a dusty to let sign in the window shed thought at once of jemimas cupcake business which had been going great guns from her cottage near sway but was in need of expansion shed said to her jem itll be grand i can walk over in my lunch hour and we can have a sandwich or something besides it was time shed told her friend did she want to operate her fledgling business out of a cottage kitchen forever or did she want to take the leap you can do this jem i have faith in you faith with regard to business matters was what she didnt add when it came to personal matters she had no faith in jemima at all it hadnt taken much convincing and jemimas brother had provided part of the cash as meredith had known he would but soon after jemima had signed the lease meredith and she had parted ways in their friendship because of a hot and frankly stupid discussion about what meredith saw as jemimas eternal need for a man youll love anyone wholl love you back had been the way meredith had concluded her passionate denunciation of jemimas most recent partner one in a long line of men whod come into and gone out of her life come on jem anyone with eyes and half a brain can see theres something off about him not the best way to assess a man whom ones best friend declares shes determined to marry living with him was bad enough as far as meredith was concerned hooking up permanently was another matter so it had been a double insult both to jemima and to the man she ostensibly loved thus meredith had never seen the fruits of jemimas labours when it came to launching the cupcake queen unfortunately she didnt see the fruits of those labours now either when meredith parked scooped up the chocolate cakeit was looking ever more as if the chocolate itself were actually perspiring she thought which could not have been a very good signand carried her offering to the door of the cupcake queen she found the shop locked tightly its windowsills grimy and its interior speaking of a business failed meredith could see an empty display case along with a dusty selling counter and an oldfashioned bakers étagère showing off neither utensils nor baked goods and this waswhat ten months after shed opened six months after eight meredith couldnt remember exactly but she certainly didnt like what she saw and she had difficulty believing that jemimas business could have gone under so quickly shed had more than a score of regular customers she had served from her cottage alone and they would have followed her to ringwood so what had happened meredith decided she would seek out the one person who could probably explain she had her own immediate theory about matters but she wanted to be forearmed when she finally saw jemima herself ultimately meredith found lexie streener at jean michels hair styling in the high street she went first to the teenagers home where the girls mother stopped what she was doingtyping a lengthy tract on the third beatitudeto expound in some tedious detail what it truly meant to be among the meek when pressed for information she revealed that lexie was washing hair at jean michels theres no jean michel she pointed out sharply thats a lie that is which is against gods law at jean michels hair styling meredith had to wait for lexie streener to finish scrubbing energetically at the scalp of a heavyset lady whod already had more than enough summer sun and was currently showing far too much flesh as an illustration of this troubling fact meredith wondered if lexie was planning on a career of styling hair she hoped not for if the girls own head was any indication of her talents in this area no one with any sense would allow her near them as long as she had either scissors or dye in hand her locks were pink blond and blue theyd either been cropped to a punitive lengthone thought at once of head liceor theyd broken off incapable of anything else after repeated exposures to bleach and to colour she just phoned up one day lexie said when meredith had the girl to herself shed had to wait for lexies break and it had cost her a coke but that was fine by her if the minimal expense provided her with maximum details i reckoned id been doing a good job wif everthing but alls of a sudden she phones me up and she says not to come to work tomorrow i aksed her was it summick i done like smoke a fag too close to the door like i might of done you know or what have you but all she says islike no its not you so i reckon its my mum or dad with all their bible stuff and i reckon they been preaching at her or leaving you know those tracks mum writes like under her windscreen wipers but she says its me its not you its not them thingss changed i say what things but she wont tell me she says shes sorry and not to aks her nuffink else did the business go bad meredith asked dont think so there was always people there buying stuff you aks me it was weird she wanted to close up and i knew that innit so i rang her bout a week after she talked to me maybe more dunno exactly i ring her on her mobile to find out whats what but alls i get is just her voice mail i leave a message at least twice this was but she never rang me back and when i tried another time the phone wasthere was nothing like she lost it or summick did you phone her at home lexie shook her head she picked at a healing cut on her arm it was what she didcutting herselfand meredith knew this for lexies aunt owned the graphic design company where meredith worked while she waited to break into what she really wanted to do which was fabric design and as meredith greatly admired lexies aunt and as lexies aunt worried about the girl and talked about her and wondered wasnt there something that could get her out of the house and away from her halfmad parents for a few hours each daymeredith had suggested lexie to jemima as the cupcake queens first employee the plan had been for her to help jemima in setting up the shop first and then behind the counter second jemima couldnt do everything herself and lexie needed the job and meredith wanted to score points with her employer it had all seemed perfect but something clearly had not worked out right meredith said so you didnt talk towell to him she didnt say anything about what might have been going on at home and you didnt ring her there lexie shook her head just reckoned she dint want me the girl replied no one genrally does so really she had to go to jemimas home there was nothing else for it meredith didnt actually like this idea because she felt it gave jemima a sort of advantage over her in the conversation that was to come but she knew that if she was going to be serious about making up with her friend then she was going to have to do what it took jemima lived with her partner between sway and mount pleasant there she and gordon jossie had somehow lucked their way into the rights of a commoner so there was land attached to the holding true there was not a lot of it but still twelve acres were nothing to sniff at there were buildings as well an old cob cottage a barn and a shed part of the land comprised ancient paddocks to serve the needs of the holdings ponies should they get out of condition during the winter the rest of it was vacant land characterised largely by a heath that in the distance gave way to woodland which was not part of the holding the buildings on the property were shaded by sweet chestnut trees all of them pollarded long ago so that now their branches grew above head height from the bulbous remains of those early amputations which had saved the trees in their youth from the hungry mouths of animals they were huge those chestnuts in summer they lowered the temperature around the cottage and they scented the air with a heady fragrance as she pulled past the tall hawthorn hedge and into the drive that sketched a pebbled line between the cottage and the west paddock meredith saw that beneath one of the chestnut trees in front of the house a rusty iron table four chairs and a wheeled tea trolley formed a picturesque summer dining area complete with potted ferns candles on the table colourful cushions on the chairs and three ornate torchères all of it giving the place the look of a photo from a home living magazine this was not like jemima at all meredith thought she wondered how else her friend had changed in the months that had passed since theyd last seen each other she pulled to a stop not far from the cottage just behind the second sign of change this constituted a latemodel mini cooper bright red with white striping newly polished its chrome agleam and its convertible top lowered meredith stirred a bit in her seat when she saw this vehicle it brought home to her what shed arrived in an old polo held together by duct tape and dreams the passengers seat of which was currently beginning to accept an ooze of melted chocolate from the cake that sat upon it the cake seemed like a truly ridiculous offering now meredith thought she should have listened to her mother not that shed ever listened to her mother before which in itself was a thought that brought jemima even more firmly into her mind how shed always said at least you have a mum whenever meredith complained about the good woman and that made her miss jemima with a stab to the heart so she gathered her courage and her lopsided cake and she made her way to the cottage door not the front door which shed never used but the door at the back the one that led out from a leanto laundry room into an open space edged by the cottage the barn the shed a little farm lane and the east paddock there was no answer to her knock there was no reply to her call of jem hey hullo birthday girl where are you she was thinking of letting herself insideno one locked doors in this part of the worldand leaving the cake along with a note when she heard someone call in return hello cn i help you im over here it was not jemima meredith knew that at once from the voice without having to turn from the door but turn she did and it was to see a young blonde coming round the side of the barn shaking off a straw sunhat which she then put on her head as she drew near she was saying sorry i was having a go with the horses its the oddest thing for some reason this hat seems to frighten them so i take it off when i go near the paddock perhaps meredith thought she was someone theyd hired gordon and jemima with common rights they were allowed to keep wild ponies and they were also required to care for them if the animals werent able to graze freely on the forest for some reason with gordons work and jemimas work keeping them busy it wasnt completely out of the question that theyd had to bring along someone in the event they were forced to keep ponies on the holding exceptthis woman didnt look like a stablegirl true she wore blue jeans but they were of the designer sort one saw on celebrities hugging her curves she wore boots but they were polished leather and very stylish not boots for mucking out in she wore a work shirt but its sleeves were rolled to show tanned arms and its collar stood up to frame her face she looked like someones image of a countrywoman not like an actual countrywoman at all hullo meredith felt awkward and ungainly she and the other woman were of similar height but that was the extent of their similarities meredith wasnt put together like this vision of lifeinhampshire approaching her in her bodyshrouding caftan she felt like a giraffe in draperies sorry i think ive blocked you in she tilted her head in the direction of her car no worries the woman replied im not going anywhere not meredith hadnt thought that jemima and gordon might have moved house but that seemed to be the case she said do gordon and jemima not live here any longer gordon certainly does the other replied but whos jemima in looking at everything that happened to john dresser one must begin with the canal part of the nineteenth centurys means of transporting goods from one area of the uk to another the particular section of the midlands transcountry canal that concerns us bisects the city in such a way as to create a divide between socioeconomic areas threequarters of a mile of its length runs along the north boundary of the gallows as is the case with most of the canals in great britain a towpath gives walkers and cyclists access to the canal and various types of housing back onto the waterway one might harbour romantic images invoked by the word canal or by canal life but there is little romantic about the length of the midlands transcountry canal that flows just north of the gallows its a greasy strip of water uninhabited by ducks swans or any other sort of aquatic life and there are no reeds willow trees wildflowers or grasses growing along the towpath what bobs at the canals edges is usually rubbish and its water carries a putrid odour suggestive of faulty sewer pipes the canal has long been used by residents of the gallows as a dumping ground for items too bulky to be taken away by the rubbish collectors when michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker arrived there at roughly ninethirty am they found a shopping trolley in the water and they commenced using it as a target at which they threw rocks bottles and bricks found along the towpath going to the canal appears to have been reggies idea one initially rejected by ian who accused the other two boys of wanting to go there to wank each other or do it like doggies which can be seen as an apparent reference to what he himself had witnessed in the bedroom he was forced to share with his mother he also seems to have harassed michael about his right eye as reported by reggie the nerves of his cheek having been damaged during a forceps delivery at his birth michaels right eye drooped and did not blink in concert with his left eye but reggie indicates he himself sorted ian proper and the boys went on to other things as the back gardens of the houses along the towpath are separated from it only by wooden fences the boys had easy access to properties where the wooden fences were in disrepair once they exhausted the possibilities presented by throwing things at and into the shopping trolley they wandered along the towpath and found mischief where they were able they removed fresh washing from a line behind one house and dumped this in the canal at another they found a lawn mower but it were rusty michael explains and did the same with it perhaps the perambulator gave them the ultimate idea they found this object sitting next to the back door of yet another of the houses unlike the lawn mower the perambulator was not only new but it also had a metallic blue helium balloon attached to it on this balloon was printed its a boy and the boys knew the words referred to a brandnew baby the perambulator was more difficult to get their hands on because the fence here was not in bad condition thus it is suggestive of a sort of escalation of intent that two of the boys ian and reggie according to michael ian and michael according to reggie reggie and michael according to ian climbed over the fence stole the perambulator and hoisted it over and onto the towpath there the boys pushed each other for perhaps one hundred yards before tiring of this game and shoving the perambulator into the canal michael spargos interview indicates that at this point ian barker said too bad it werent a baby inside thatd make a lovely splash eh ian barker denies this and when questioned reggie arnold becomes hysterical shrieking there werent no baby ever mum there werent no baby according to michael ian went on to talk about how wicked itd be to get a baby from somewheres they could he suggested take it to that bridge over west town road and we could drop it on its head and see it splat blood and brainsd come out thats what he said michael reports michael goes on to insist that he spoke hotly against this idea as if he knows where his interview with the police is heading when they get to this topic ultimately the boys grew tired of playing in the environs of the canal michael reports ian barker he tells the police was the one to suggest they clear out of here and go to the barriers it should be noted that not one of the boys denies being in the barriers that day although all of them repeatedly change their stories when it comes to what they did when they got there west town road arcade has been known as the barriers for such a length of time that most people have no idea that the shopping arcade actually has another name early in its commercial lifetime it developed this appellation because it sprawls neatly between the bleak world of the gallows and an orderly grid of semidetached and detached houses occupied by middleclass working families these buildings comprise the windsor mountbatten and lyon housing estates while there are four distinct entrances to the barriers the two most commonly used are those giving access to residents of the gallows and to residents of the windsor estate the shops at these entrances are rather depressingly indicative of the expected clientele for example at the gallows entrance one finds a william hill betting lounge two offlicences a tobacconist an itemsforapound shop and several takeaway food enterprises featuring fish and chips jacket potatoes and pizza at the windsor estate entrance on the other hand one can shop in marks spencer boots russell bromley accessorize rymans and independent shops offering lingerie chocolates tea and clothing while its true that nothing stops someone from entering at the gallows and traversing the arcade to shop where she pleases the implication is clear if you are poor on benefits or working class youre likely to be interested in spending your money on cholesterolladen food tobacco alcohol or gambling all three of the boys agree that when they entered the barriers they went into the video arcade at the centre of the place they had no money but this did not stop them from driving the jeep in the lets go jungle video game or piloting the ocean hunter on a search for sharks its an interesting fact that the participatory video games allowed for only two players at one time although as previously noted they had no money when they pretended to play it was michael and reggie who manned the controls leaving ian the odd man out he claims he was not bothered by this exclusion and all the boys declare themselves unbothered by the fact that they had no money to spend in the video arcade but one cannot help speculating if the day would have turned out differently had the boys been able to sublimate pathological tendencies through engaging in some of the bellicose activities provided by the video games they encountered but were not able to use i dont mean to imply here that video games can or should take the place of parenting but as an outlet for young boys with limited resources and even less insight into their individual dysfunction they might have been helpful unfortunately their time in the video arcade came to a precipitate end when a security guard noticed them and shooed them on their way it was still school hours the cctv film has it at halfpast ten and he told them he would phone the police the schools or the truant officer if he saw them again on the premises his interview with the police has him claiming that he never saw the little yobs again but this seems more like an effort to relieve himself of guilt and responsibility than the truth the boys did nothing to hide from him once they left the video arcade and had he only made good on his threat the boys would never have encountered little john dresser john dresseror johnny as he was termed by the tabloid presswas twentynine months old he was the only child of alan and donna dresser and on a working day he was normally minded by his fiftyeightyearold grandmother he walked perfectly well but like many toddler boys he was slow to develop language his vocabulary at twentynine months consisted of mummy da and lolly this last referring to the family dog he could not say his name on this particular day his grandmother had gone to liverpool for an appointment with a specialist to discuss her failing vision as she could not drive herself her husband took her this placed alan and donna dresser in the position of having no child care and when this occurred as it did occasionally it was their habit to take turns minding john since neither of them found it easy to take time off from work to see to him donna dresser was at this time a secondary school chemistry teacher and her husband a solicitor specialising in property sales by all accounts they were excellent parents and john had been a muchanticipated addition to their lives donna dresser had not found it easy to become pregnant in the first place and had taken great care during her pregnancy to ensure the birth of a healthy baby while she came under scrutiny and criticism for being a working mother who allowed her husband to care for their child on this particular day it should not be assumed that she was anything other than a devoted mother to john alan dresser took the toddler to the barriers at midday he used the little boys push chair and he walked the half mile from their home to get there the dressers lived on the mountbatten housing estate the most upmarket of the three neighbourhoods that touched on the barriers and the one farthest from that shopping arcade prior to johns birth his parents had purchased a detached threebedroom home there and on the day of johns disappearance they were still in the process of renovating one of the two bathrooms in his statement to the police alan dresser explains that he went to the barriers at his wifes request to fetch paint samples from stanley wallingfords an independent diy shop not far from the gallows end of the shopping arcade he also goes on to say that he wanted a bit of air for me and the boy a reasonable desire considering the thirteen days of bad weather that had preceded this outing evidently at some point while in stanley wallingfords alan dresser promised john the treat of a mcdonalds lunch this seems to have been at least partially an attempt to settle the child a fact which the shop assistant later verified to the police for john was restless unhappy in his pushchair and difficult to keep occupied while his father chose the paint samples and made purchases relevant to the bathroom renovation by the time dresser got his son to mcdonalds john was irritable and hungry and dresser himself was annoyed parenting did not come naturally to him and he was not averse to swatting a bum when his son did not behave appropriately in public the fact that he was indeed seen just outside mcdonalds giving john a sharp smack on his bottom ultimately caused a delay in the investigation once john disappeared although its unlikely that even an immediate search for the boy would have altered the outcome of the day while ian barkers interview has him claiming that he didnt care about being excluded from the imaginary playing of video games michael spargo evidently assumed that this exclusion prompted ian to grass me and reg to the security guard an accusation that ian hotly denied however they came to the guards attention though they escaped his further attention when they next went into the itemsforapound shop even today this establishment is chockablock with goods offering everything from clothing to tea its aisles are narrow its shelves are tall its bins are a jumble of socks scarves gloves and knickers it sells overruns knockoffs seconds mislabeled items and chinese imports and its impossible to see how stock control is managed although the shops proprietor seems to have perfected a mental system that takes all items into account michael ian and reggie entered the shop with the intent of stealing arguably as an outlet for the displeasure they felt at having been told to leave the video arcade while the shop had two cctv cameras on this day they were not operational and had not been for at least two years this was widely known to the neighbourhood children who evidently made itemsforapound a frequent haunt ian barker was among the most regular visitors to the shop as its owner was able to name him although he was unfamiliar with ians surname while in the shop the boys managed to steal a hairbrush a bag of christmas poppers and a package of felttip marking pens but the ease of this activity either did not satisfy their need for antisocial behaviour or lacked a suitable frisson of excitement so upon leaving they went next to a snack kiosk in the arcades centre where reggie arnold was quite well known to the proprietor a fiftysevenyearold sikh called wallace gupta mr guptas interviewtaken two days after the fact and consequently at least somewhat suspectindicates that he told the boys to clear off at once threatening them with the security guard and being labeled in turn paki wanker bumboy fucker and towelhead when the boys did not move away from the kiosk with the alacrity he desired mr gupta pulled from beneath the till a spray bottle in which he kept bleach the only weapon he had with which to defend himself or to urge their cooperation the boys reaction reported by ian barker with a fair degree of pride was laughter followed by the appropriation of five bags of crisps one of which was later found at the dawkins building site which prompted mr gupta to make good on his threat he sprayed them with the bleach hitting ian barker on the cheek and in the eye reggie arnold on the trousers and michael spargo on both trousers and anorak while both michael and reggie understood quickly that their school trousers were as good as ruined their reaction to mr guptas attack upon them was not as fierce as ians reportedly was he wanted to get that paki reggie arnold declared when questioned by the police he went mental he wanted to rubbish the kiosk but i stopped him i did an assertion unsupported by any facts that followed its likely however that ian was in pain and lacking any socially acceptable response to pain it appears unlikely that the boys sought out a public lavatory in which to wash the bleach from ians face ian reacted by blaming both reggie and michael for his situation perhaps as a means of deflecting ians anger and avoiding a thrashing reggie pointed out jonescarver pets and supplies in the window of which three persian kittens played on a carpetcovered set of platforms reggie becomes vague at this point when asked by the police what attracted him to the kittens but he later accuses ian of suggesting they steal one of the animals for a bit of fun ian denied this during his questioning but michael spargo has the other boy saying that they could cut off the cats tail or nail it to a board like jesus and he thought thatd be wicked thats what he said naturally its difficult to know who was suggesting what at this point for as the boys stories take them closer and closer to john dresser they become less and less forthright what is known is this the kittens in question were not readily available to anyone being locked inside the windowdisplay cage because of their value but standing in front of the cage was tenille cooper four years old who was watching the kittens as her mother made a purchase of dog food some six yards away both reggie and michaelinterviewed independently and in the presence of a parent and a social workeragree that ian barker grabbed little tenille by the hand and announced this is better than a cat innit with the clear intention of walking off with her in this he was thwarted by the childs mother adrienne who stopped the boys and in some outrage began to question them to demand why they werent at school and to threaten them with not only the security guard but also with the truant officer and the police she was of course crucial in identifying them later managing to pick photographs of all three of them from sixty pictures that were presented to her at the police station it must be said that had adrienne cooper gone for the security guard at once john dresser might never have come to the attention of the boys but her failureif it can even be called a failure because how indeed was she even to imagine the horrors to followis minor compared to the failure of those individuals who later saw a progressively more and more distressed john dresser in the company of the three boys and yet made no move either to alert the police or to take him from them chapter two youre up to speed about what happened to di lynley i take it hillier asked and isabelle ardery considered the man as well as the question before she replied they were in his office at new scotland yard where banks of windows looked out on the rooftops of westminster and some of the costliest real estate in the country sir david hillier was standing behind his oceanic desk looking crisp and clean and remarkably fit for a man his age he had to be somewhere in his middle sixties she decided at his insistence she herself was seated which she thought quite clever of him he wanted her to feel his dominance on the chance that she might think herself his superior this would be physically of course she was unlikely to conclude that she had some other sort of ascendancy over the assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police she was taller than he by a full three incheseven more if she wore higher heelshowever there her advantage ended she said youre referring to inspector lynleys wife yes i know what happened to her i daresay everyone in the force knows what happened how is he where is he still in cornwall as far as i know but the team want him back and youre going to feel it havers nkata haleall of them even john stewart from detectives to filing clerks the lot custodians as well i have no doubt hes a popular figure i know ive met him hes quite the gent that would be the word wouldnt it gent hillier eyed her in a way she didnt much like suggesting he had some thoughts on the wheres and hows of her acquaintance with detective inspector thomas lynley she considered an elucidation on the subject but she rejected the idea let the man think what the man would think she had her chance to capture the job she wanted and all that mattered was proving to him that she was worthy to be named permanent and not just acting detective superintendent theyre professionals the lot of them they wont make your life a misery hillier said still therere strong loyalties among them some things die hard and some dont die at all she thought she wondered if hillier intended to sit or whether this interview was going to be conducted entirely in the headmasterrecalcitrant pupil mode that his present position seemed to indicate she also wondered if shed made some sort of professional faux pas in sitting herself but it seemed to her that he had made an unambiguous gesture towards one of the two chairs that were positioned in front of his desk hadnt he wont give you a problem good man hillier was saying but john stewarts another matter he still wants the superintendents position and he didnt take it well when he wasnt named permanent superintendent at the end of his trial period isabelle brought herself round with a mental jolt the mention of di john stewarts name told her that hillier had been speaking of the others who had worked temporarily in the detective superintendents job hed have been talking about the inhouse officers she concluded mentioning those who like her had auditionedthere was no other word for itfrom outside the met would have been pointless as she was unlikely to run into them in one or another of the endless linofloored corridors in tower block or victoria block di john stewart on the other hand would be part of her team his feathers were going to need smoothing out this wasnt one of her strengths but she would do what she could i understand she told hillier ill tread carefully with him ill tread carefully with them all very good how are you settling in how are the boys twins arent they she made her lips curve as one would normally do when the children were mentioned and she forced herself to think about them exactly like that in inverted commas the inverted commas kept them at a distance from her emotions which was where she needed them she said weve decidedtheir father and ithat theyre better off remaining with him for now since im only here on trial bobs not far from maidstone he has a lovely property in the countryside and as its their summer holidays it seemed wisest to have them live with their father for a while not easy for you i expect hillier noted youll be missing them ill be busy she said and you know what boys are like eight years old they need supervising and plenty of it as both bob and his wife are at home theyre in a good position to keep them on the straight and narrow a far better position than ill be in i daresay it should be fine she made the situation sound ideal herself hard at work in london nose to the metaphorical grindstone while bob and sandra breathed copious amounts of fresh air in the countryside all the time doting on the boys and feeding them homecooked chicken pies filled with everything organic and served with icecold milk and truth be told that wasnt too far from how it likely would be bob after all adored his sons and sandra was perfectly lovely in her own way if a bit too schoolmarmish for isabelles taste she had her own two children but that hadnt meant she had no room in her home and her heart for isabelles boys for isabelles boys were bobs boys as well and he was a good dad and always had been he kept his eye on the ball did robert ardery he asked the right questions at just the right time and he never made a threat that didnt sound like an inspiration hed just been struck by hillier seemed to be reading her or at least attempting to but isabelle knew she was more than a match for anyones effort to see beyond the role she played shed made a virtual art of appearing cool controlled and completely competent and this façade had served her so well for so many years that it was second nature by now to wear her professional persona like chain mail such was the result of having ambition in a world dominated by men yes hillier drew out the word making it less confirmation than calculation youre right of course good that you have a civilised relationship with the ex as well high marks for that it cant be easy weve tried to remain friendly throughout the years isabelle told him again with that curve of her lips it seemed best for the boys warring parents thats never good for anyone is it glad to hear it glad to hear it hillier looked towards the doorway as if expecting someone to enter no one did he seemed ill at ease and isabelle didnt consider this a bad thing ill at ease could work to her advantage it suggested that the ac wasnt as dominant a male as he thought he was i expect he said in the tone of a man concluding their interview youd like to get to know the team be introduced formally get down to work i would she said im going to want individual conversations with them no time like the present hillier said with a smile shall i take you down to them brilliant she smiled back and held his gaze long enough to see him colour he was a florid man already so he coloured easily she tried to imagine what he looked like in a rage if i can just pop into the ladies sir of course he said take your time which naturally was the very last thing he actually wanted her to do she wondered if he did that often making remarks he didnt mean not that it mattered as it wasnt her intention to spend a great deal of time with the man but it was always helpful to know how people operated hilliers secretarya severelooking woman with five unfortunate facial warts in need of dermatological explorationdirected isabelle towards the ladies once inside she checked carefully to ensure that she had the room to herself she ducked into the stall farthest from the door and there she did her business but this was merely for effect her real purpose lay within her shoulder bag she found the airline bottle where shed earlier stowed it and she opened it drinking down the contents in two swift gulps vodka yes it had long been just the ticket she waited a few moments till she felt it take hold then she left the stall and went to the basin where she fished in her bag for her toothbrush and toothpaste she brushed thoroughly her teeth and her tongue finished she was ready to face the world the team of detectives shed be supervising worked in close confines so isabelle met them together first they were wary of her she was wary of them this was natural and she wasnt bothered by it introductions were made by hillier and he offered them her background chronologically community liaison officer burglary vice arson investigation and more recently mcit he didnt add the period of time shed spent in each of her positions she was on the fast track and they would know it by reckoning her age which was thirtyeight although she liked to think she looked younger the result of wisely having stayed away from cigarettes and out of the sun for most of her life the only one of them who looked impressed with her background was the departmental secretary a princessinwaiting type called dorothea harriman isabelle wondered how any young woman could look so put together on what her salary had to be she reckoned dorothea found her clothing in charity shops of the type where one could dig out timeless treasures if one was persistent had an eye for quality and looked hard enough she told the team she would like to have a word with each of them in her office she said today she would want to know what each of them was working on at present she added so do bring your notes it went much as she expected di philip hale was cooperative and professional possessing a waitandsee attitude that isabelle could not fault his notes at the ready currently at work with the cps preparing a case involving the serial killing of young adolescent boys shed have no trouble with him he hadnt applied for the superintendents position and he seemed quite happy with his place on the team di john stewart was another matter he was a nervy man if his bitten fingernails were anything to go by and his focus on her breasts seemed to indicate a form of misogyny that she particularly detested but she could handle him he called her maam she said guv would do he let a marked moment pass before he made the switch she said i dont plan to have difficulty with you john do you plan to have difficulty with me he said no not at all guv but she knew he didnt mean it she met ds winston nkata next he was a curiosity to her very tall very black scarred on the face from an adolescent street fight he was all west indies via south london tough exterior but something about the eyes suggested that inside the man a soft heart waited to be touched she didnt ask him his age but she put him somewhere in his late twenties he was one of two children who were yin and yang his older brother was in prison for murder this fact would she decided make the ds a motivated cop with something to prove she liked that this was not the case for ds barbara havers the last of the team havers slouched into the officethere could isabelle decided be absolutely no other word for how the woman presented herselfreeking of cigarette smoke and carrying a chip on her shoulder the size of a steamer trunk isabelle knew that havers had been di lynleys partner for several years preceding the death of lynleys wife shed met the sergeant before and she wondered if havers remembered she did the fleming murder were haverss first words to her when they were alone out in kent you did the arson investigation on it good memory sergeant isabelle said to her may i ask what happened to your teeth i dont recall them like this havers shrugged she said cn i sit or what and isabelle said please shed been conducting these interviews in ac hillier modealthough she was seated not standing behind her deskbut in this case she rose and moved over to a small conference table where she indicated ds havers should join her she didnt want to bond with the sergeant but she knew the importance of having with her a relationship rather different from the relationship she had with the others this had more to do with the sergeants partnership with lynley than with the fact that they were both women your teeth isabelle said again got in something of a conflict havers told her really you dont look the sort to brawl isabelle noted and while this was true it was also true that havers looked exactly the sort to defend herself if push came to shove which was apparently how her front teeth had come to be in the condition they were in which was badly broken bloke didnt like the idea of my spoiling his kidnap of a kid havers said we got into it him and me a bit of this with the fists a bit of that with the feet and my face hit the floor it was stone this happened in the past year while you were at work whyve you not had them fixed there havent been problems about the met paying have there ive been thinking they give my face character ah by which i take it youre opposed to modern dentistry or are you afraid of dentists sergeant havers shook her head im afraid of turning myself into a beauty as i dont much like the idea of fighting off hordes of admirers sides worlds full of people with perfect teeth i like to be different do you indeed isabelle decided to be rather more direct with havers that must explain your clothing then has no one ever remarked upon it sergeant havers adjusted her position in her seat she crossed a leg over her knee showinggod help us isabelle thoughta red hightop trainer and an inch of purple sock despite the hideous heat of summer shed combined this fashionable use of colour with olive corduroy trousers and a brown pullover this last was decorated with specks of lint she looked like someone involved in an undercover investigation into the horrors of life as a refugee due respect guv havers said although her tone suggested there was something of grievance attached to her words sides the fact that regulations dont allow you to give me aggro about the clothes i dont think my appearance has much to do with how i agreed but your appearance has to do with your looking professional isabelle cut in which you dont at the moment let me be frank regulations or not professional is how i expect my team to look i advise you to have your teeth fixed what today havers asked did she sound borderline insolent isabelle narrowed her eyes she responded with please dont make light of this sergeant i also recommend you alter your manner of dress to something more appropriate respect again but you cant ask me true enough very true but im not asking am i im advising im suggesting im instructing all of which i expect youve heard before not in so many words no well youre hearing them now and can you honestly tell me that di lynley never took note of your overall appearance havers was silent isabelle could tell that the mention of lynley had struck home she wondered idly if havers had beenor wasin love with the man it seemed wildly improbable ludicrous actually on the other hand if opposites did indeed attract there could not have been two people more dissimilar than barbara havers and thomas lynley whom isabelle remembered as gracious educated plummy voiced and exceedingly well dressed she said sergeant am i the only look im not much of a one for shopping havers told her ah then let me give you some pointers isabelle said first of all you need a skirt or trousers that fit are ironed and have the proper length then a jacket that is capable of being buttoned in the front after that an unwrinkled blouse tights and a pair of pumps court shoes or brogues that are polished this isnt exactly brain surgery barbara havers had been gazing at her anklehidden though it was by the top of her trainerbut now she looked up at the use of her christian name where she asked where what where m i sposed to do this shopping she made the final word sound as if isabelle had been recommending she lick the pavement selfridges isabelle said debenhams and if its too daunting a prospect to do this alone take someone with you surely youve a friend or two who know how to put together something suitable to wear to work if no ones available then browse through a magazine for inspiration vogue elle havers didnt look pleased relieved or anything close to accepting instead she looked miserable well it couldnt be helped isabelle thought the entire conversation could have been construed as sexist but for heavens sake she was trying to help the woman with that in mind she decided to go the rest of the way and while youre at it may i suggest you do something about your hair as well havers bristled but said calmly enough never been able to do much with it then perhaps someone else can do you have a regular hairdresser sergeant havers put a hand to her choppedup locks they were a decent colour pine would come closest to describing it isabelle decided but they appeared completely unstyled obviously the sergeant had been cutting her hair herself god only knew how although isabelle reckoned it involved the use of secateurs well have you isabelle asked her not as such havers said you need to find one havers moved her fingers in a way that suggested she wanted a smoke rolling a fantasy fag between them when then she asked when then what when am i sposed to take all of yoursuggestions to heart yesterday not to put too fine a point on it straight away you mean isabelle smiled i see youre going to be good at reading my every nuance nowand here they were at the real point the reason that isabelle had moved them from the desk to the conference tabletell me what do you hear from inspector lynley nothing much havers looked and sounded immediately cagey talked to him a couple times is all where is he dont know do i havers told her i expect hes still in cornwall he was walking the coast last i heard all of it quite a hike how did he seem to you when you spoke to him havers knotted her unplucked eyebrows clearly wondering about the line of questioning upon which isabelle had now embarked she said like youd expect someone to seem when hes had to pull the plug on his wifes life support i wouldnt call him chipper he was coping guv thats about all will he be returning to us here london the met havers considered this she considered isabelle as well obviously her mind clicking away with all the possibilities that might explain why the new acting detective superintendent wanted to know about the former acting detective superintendent havers said he didnt want the job he was just doing it temporarily hes not into promoting or anything its not who he is isabelle didnt like being read least of all did she like being read by another woman thomas lynley was indeed one of her worries she wasnt averse to having him back on the team but if that was going to happen she wanted it to be with her prior knowledge and on her terms the last thing she desired was his sudden appearance and everyone welcoming him with religious fervor she said to havers im concerned about his wellbeing sergeant if you hear from him id like to know it just how he is not what he says may i rely on you for that i suppose havers said but i wont be hearing from him guv isabelle reckoned she was lying on both accounts music made the ride bearable the heat was intense because while windows nearly the size of cinema screens lined both sides of the vehicle they did not open each of them had a narrow tiltout pane of glass at the top and all of these were open but that did nothing to relieve what sunlight weather and restless human bodies effected within the rolling tube of steel at least it was a bendy bus and not one of the doubledeckers whenever it stopped both its front door and its back door opened and a gust of airhot and nasty but still new airallowed him to breathe deeply and believe he could survive the ride the voices in his head kept declaring otherwise telling him that he needed to get out and get out soon because there was work to do and it was gods mighty work but he couldnt get out so he was using the music when he had it coming through his earphones loud enough it drowned out everything else voices included he would have closed his eyes to lose himself in it the sweep of the cello and its mournful tone but he had to watch her and he had to be ready when she made a move to debark so would he theyd been riding for over an hour neither of them should have been there he had his work as did she and when people didnt do what they were meant to do the world went amiss and he had to heal it he was told to heal it in fact so hed followed her careful not to be seen shed got onto one bus and then onto another and now he could see she was using an az in order to follow the route this told him that she was unfamiliar with the area through which they were riding an area that looked to him like much of the rest of london terraces of houses shops with grimy plastic signs above their front windows graffiti looping letters into meaningless words like killdick boyz chackers and porp as they wound through town on the pavements tourists morphed into students with backpacks who themselves became women in black from head to toe slits for their eyes in the company of men comfortably dressed in jeans and white tshirts and these became african children at play running in circles beneath the trees in a park and then for a time blocks of flats blended into a school and this in turn dissolved to a collection of institutionallooking buildings from which he turned his gaze finally a narrowing of the street occurred and it then curved and they came into what looked like a village although he knew it was not a village at all but rather a place that had been a village once it was another of the multitude of communities consumed over time by the creeping mass of london the street climbed a modest hill and then they were among the shops mothers pushed prams here and people mixed africans talked to whites asians shopped for halal meats oldage pensioners sipped turkish coffee in a café advertising pastries from france it was a pleasant place it made him relax and it almost made him turn his music off up ahead he saw her begin to stir she closed her az after carefully turning down the corner of a page she had nothing with her but her shoulder bag and she tucked the az into this as she made for the door he noticed they were coming to the end of the high street and its shops a wroughtiron railing atop a brick revetment suggested they had reached a park it seemed odd to him that shed come all this way by bus in order to visit a park when there was a parkor perhaps more accurately a gardennot two hundred metres from where she worked true the day was wretchedly hot and beneath the trees it would be cool and even he looked forward to the cool after that ride in the moving furnace but if cool had been her intention all along she could merely have gone into st pauls parish church which she sometimes did in her lunch hour reading the tablets on the walls or just sitting near the communion rail to gaze at the altar and the painting above it madonna and child this painting was he knew that much althoughdespite the voiceshe did not think himself a religious man he waited until the last moment to get off the bus hed placed his instrument on the floor between his feet and because hed watched her so closely as she headed in the direction of the park he nearly forgot to take it along that would have been a disastrous mistake and because hed come so close to making it he removed his earphones to silence the music the flame is come is come is here went round in his head immediately when the music ceased i call on the birds to feast on the fallen he blinked hard and shook his head roughly there was a gate of wrought iron fully open at the top of four steps leading into the park before mounting these she approached a notice board behind glass a map of the place was posted she studied this but only briefly as if verifying something that she already knew then she went inside the gate and in an instant she was swallowed up by the leafy trees he hurried to follow he glanced at the notice boardpaths wandering hither and yon a building indicated words a monumentbut he did not see the name of this park so it was only when he was on the trail leading into its depths that he first realised he was in a cemetery it was unlike any cemetery hed ever seen for ivy and creepers choked its gravestones and cloaked its monuments at the bases of which brambles and campion offered fruit and flowers people buried here had been long forgotten as had been the cemetery itself if the tombstones had once been incised with the names of the dead the carving had been worn away by weather and by the encroachment of nature seeking to reclaim what had been in this spot long before any man had contemplated burying his dead here he didnt like the place but that couldnt be helped he was her guardianyes yes you begin to understand and she was his to protect and that meant he had a duty to perform but he could hear the beginning of a wind howling in his head and i am in charge of tartarus emerged from the gale then listen just listen and we are seven and we stand at his feet and that was when he fumbled about shoved the earphones back on and raised the volume as high as it would go until he could hear nothing but the cello again and then the violins the path he walked on was studded with stones uneven and dusty and along its edges the crust of last years leaves still lay less thick here than upon the ground beneath the trees that towered over his head these made the cemetery cool and its atmosphere fragrant and he thought if he could concentrate on thatthe feel of the air and the scent of green growththe voices wouldnt matter so much so he breathed in deep and he loosened the collar of his shirt the path curved and he saw her ahead of him she had paused to gaze at a monument this one was different it was weather streaked but otherwise undamaged and clean of undergrowth it was proud and unforgotten it formed a sleeping lion atop a marble plinth the lion was life size so the plinth was large it accommodated inscriptions and family names and these too had not been left to wear away he saw her raise a hand to caress the stone animal his broad paws first and then beneath his closed eyes it looked to him like a gesture made for luck so when she walked on and he passed the monument he touched his fingers to the lion as well she took a second narrower path that veered to the right a cyclist came towards her and she stepped to one side into a mantle of ivy and sorrel where a dog rose twisted round the wings of a praying angel farther along she made way for a couple who walked arm in arm behind a pushchair that each of them guided with one hand no child was within but rather a picnic basket and bottles that shimmered when he passed she came across a bench round which a group of men were gathered they smoked and listened to music coming from a boom box the music was asian as were they and it was turned up so loud that he could hear it even above the cello and the violins he realised suddenly that she was the only woman hed seen who was walking in this place alone it came to him that this meant danger and this danger was underscored when the heads of the asian men turned to watch her they didnt move to follow her but he knew they wanted to a woman alone meant either an offering to a man or a female in need of discipline she was very foolish to have come here he thought stone angels and sleeping lions could not protect her from what might roam in this place it was broad daylight in the middle of summer but trees loomed everywhere the undergrowth was thick and it would be a small matter to surprise her to drag her off and to do to her the worst that could be done she needed protection in a world where there was none he wondered why she did not seem to know it ahead the path opened into a clearing where uncut grassbrowning from the lack of summer rainhad been beaten down as walkers sought a means to get to a chapel this was brick with a steeple that soared into the sky and with round rose windows marking both arms of the cross that the building formed but the chapel itself was not accessible it stood as a ruin only when one approached it could one see that iron bars fronted what had once been its door that sheets of metal covered its windows and that where there should have been stained glass between the tracery of the roundels at each end of its transept dead ivy clung like a grim reminder of what lay at the end of every life although he was surprised to see that the chapel was not as it had seemed from even so short a distance away as the path she did not appear to be she approached the ruin but rather than look upon it she made her way towards a backless stone bench across the uncut grass he realised she would likely turn and sit here which would make him immediately visible to her so he dashed at once for one side of the clearing where a seraph that was green with lichen curved one arm round a towering cross this provided him with the cover he required and he ducked behind it as she settled herself upon the stone bench she opened her shoulder bag and brought out a book not the az surely for at this point she must have known where she was so this would be a novel perhaps or a volume of poetry or the book of common prayer she began to read and he saw within moments that she was lost within its contents foolish he thought she calls for remiel the voices said over the cello and above the violins how had they ever become so strong she needs a guardian he told himself in answer to the voices she needed to be on her guard since she was not he would be on guard for her that and no other would be the duty which he would embrace chapter three her name was gina dickens meredith learned and it seemed that she was gordon jossies new partner although she didnt actually refer to herself as that she didnt use new because as things turned out she had no idea there was an old partner or a former partner or whatever one wanted to call jemima hastings she also didnt use partner as such as she didnt quite live there in the cottage although she had hopes she said with a smile she was there on the holding more than she was at her own place she confided which was a tiny bedsit above the mad hatter tea rooms they were in lyndhurst high street she said where frankly the noise from dawn to dusk was appalling and come to think of it the noise went on far beyond dusk because it was summer and there were several hotels a pub restaurantsand with all the tourists at this time of yearshe was lucky to average four hours of sleep a night when she was there which to be honest she tried not to be theyd gone inside the cottage it had meredith quickly saw been stripped of all things jemima at least as far as the kitchen went which was as far as meredith herself went and was also as far as she wanted to go alarm bells were ringing in her head her palms were wet and her underarms were dripping straight down her sides part of this was due to the days everincreasing heat but the rest was due to everything being absolutely wrong outside the cottage merediths throat had instantly dried to a desert as if knowing this gina dickens had ushered her within sat her down at the old oak table and brought from the fridge designer water in a frosty bottle just the sort of thing jemima would have scoffed at she poured them both a glass and said you look as if youvei dont know what to call it meredith said stupidly its our birthday yours and jemimas who is she meredith couldnt believe at first that gina dickens didnt know a thing about jemima how could one live with a woman for as long as gordon had lived with jemima and somehow manage to keep the knowledge of her existence from hiswas gina his next lover or was she one in a line of his lovers and where were the rest of them where was jemima oh meredith had known from the first that gordon jossie was bad news on legs at boldre gardens gina was saying near minstead dyou know it he was thatching a building there and id got myself lost i had a map but im completely useless even with a map spacially hopeless north west whatever none of them mean a thing to me meredith roused herself gina was telling her how she and gordon jossie had met but she didnt care about that she cared about jemima hastings she said he never mentioned jemima or the cupcake queen the shop she opened in ringwood cupcakes its what she does she had a business she ran from this cottage and itd grown so much andbakeries and hotels and catering for parties like childrens birthdays andhe never mentioned im afraid he didnt he hasnt what about her brother robbie hastings hes an agister this she waved her arm to indicate the entire holding this is part of his area it was part of his fathers area as well and his grandfathers and his greatgrandfathers thereve been agisters in their family so long that all this part of the new forest is actually called the hastings you didnt know that gina shook her head she looked mystified and now a little bit frightened she moved her chair a few inches away from the table and she glanced from meredith to the cake shed brought which ridiculously shed carried into the cottage seeing this it came to meredith that gina wasnt afraid of gordon jossieas she damn well should have beenbut of meredith herself who was talking rather like a madwoman you must think im barking meredith said no no i dont its just ginas words were quick marginally breathless and she seemed to stop herself from going on they were silent together a whinnying came from outside the ponies meredith said if youve got ponies here robbie hastings would likely have brought them in off the forest or he would have arranged with gordon to fetch them but in either case he would have come by at some point to check on them why dyou have ponies here anyway if anything gina looked more concerned than before at this pingponging of merediths conversation she clasped both hands round her water glass and said to it rather than to meredith something abouti dont exactly know are they hurt lame off their feed yes thats it isnt it gordon said they were lame he brought them in off the forestthree weeks ago something like that im not sure actually i dont care for horses ponies meredith corrected her theyre ponies oh yes i suppose ive never quite seen the difference she hesitated as if considering something he did say she took a sip of the water lifting the glass with both hands as if shed not have been able to get it to her mouth otherwise what what did he say did he tell you of course one asks eventually doesnt one gina said i mean heres a lovely man living on his own goodhearted gentle passionate when passions called for if you know what i mean meredith blinked she didnt want to know so i did ask how he happened to be alone no girlfriend no partner no wife no ones snapped you up that sort of thing over dinner yes meredith thought outside in the garden sitting at the wroughtiron table with the candles lit and the torchères blazing she said stiffly and what did he say that hed been involved once and hed been quite badly hurt and he didnt like to talk about it so i didnt want to intrude i assumed hed tell me when he was ready thats jemima meredith said jemima hastings and shes she didnt want to put it into words putting it into words might make it true and for all she knew it wasnt true at all she assessed her facts for they were few enough the cupcake queen was closed up lexie streener had made phone calls that had gone unreturned this cottage was semioccupied by another woman she said how long have you and gordon known each other been involved whatever we met early last month at boldre yes at boldre gardens what were you doing there gina looked startled clearly she hadnt expected the question and even more clearly she didnt much like it she said i was having a walk actually ive not lived in the new forest long and i like to explore she offered a smile as if to take the sting out of what she said next you know im not sure why youre asking me this dyou think somethings happened to jemima hastings that gordon did something to her or that i did something or that gordon and i together did something because i do want you to know that when i got here to this cottage there wasnt a sign that anyone shed stopped abruptly meredith saw that ginas eyes were still fixed on hers but theyd lost their focus as if she was seeing something else entirely meredith said what what is it gina dropped her gaze a moment passed the ponies whinnied outside once again and the excited warbling of pied wagtails broke into the air as if warning one another that a predator was approaching perhaps gina finally said you ought to come with me when meredith finally found robbie hastings he was standing in the car park behind the queens head in burley this was a village at the junction of three roads arranged in a line of buildings undecided between cob halftimber and redbrick all of them possessing roofs that were equally undecided between thatch and slate midsummer there were vehicles everywhere including six tour coaches that had brought visitors to this place for what would likely be their only new forest experience outside of riding through the lanes and seeing it in airconditioned comfort from wellpadded coach seats this experience would consist of snapping photos of the ponies that wandered freely through the area of having an expensive bar meal in the pub or in one of the picturesque cafés and of making purchases in one or more of the tourist shops these last largely defined the village they comprised everything from the coven of witchesproudly the former home of a bona fide witch whod had to leave the area when her fame exceeded her willingness to have her privacy invadedto burley fudge shop and everything in between the queens head presided over all of this the largest structure in the village and the offseason gathering place for those who lived in the area and who wisely avoided both it and burley itself during the summer meredith had phoned robbies home first although she knew how unlikely it was that hed be there in the middle of the day as an agister he was responsible for the wellbeing of all the freeroaming animals in his assigned areathe area that shed told gina dickens was referred to as the hastingsand hed be out on the forest either in his vehicle or on horseback making sure that the donkeys ponies cows and the occasional sheep were being left in peace for this was the biggest challenge that faced anyone who worked on the forest especially during the summer months it was appealing to see animals so unrestricted by fences walls and hedges it was even more appealing to feed them people meant well but they were alas congenitally stupid they did not understand that to feed a sweet little pony in summer conditioned the animal to think that someone was likely to be standing in the car park of the queens head ready to feed him in the dead of winter as well robbie hastings was apparently explaining this to a throng of camerawielding pensioners in bermuda shorts and laceup shoes robbie had them gathered by his land rover to which a horse trailer was attached it seemed to meredith that hed come for one of the new forest ponies which would be unusual at this time of year she could see the animal restless in the trailer robbie gestured to it as he spoke she gave a glance at her chocolate cake as she climbed out of her car its frosting had melted into it on the top and begun to pool viscously at its base several flies had managed to find it but it was like one of those insecteating plants whatever landed upon it was becoming mired in sugar and cocoa death by delight the cake was done for it no longer mattered things were wildly out of joint and robbie hastings had to be informed for hed been his sisters sole parent from her tenth year onward a car crash catapulting him into this position when he was twentyfive that same car crash had also catapulted him into the career he had thought never to attain one of only five agisters in the new forest replacing his own father for what we mustnt have is the ponies hanging about one spot robbie seemed to be completing his remarks to an audience looking rather guilty for what they apparently had stowed on themselves apples carrots sugar and whatever else might appeal to a pony otherwise meant to forage when robbie was finished with his remarksmade patiently while visitors continually snapped his picture although he wasnt wearing his formal attire but rather jeans tshirt and a baseball caphe gave a sharp nod and opened the land rovers door preparatory to driving off the tourists drifted towards the village proper and the pub and meredith worked her way through them calling robbies name he turned meredith felt the way shed always felt when she saw him warmly fond but nonetheless terribly sorry for what he looked like with those huge front teeth of his they made his mouth the only thing one noticed about him which was a shame really he was very well built tough and masculine and his eyes were uniqueone brown and one green just like jemimas his face brightened he said merry contrary its been donkeys years girl whatre you up to in this part of the world he was wearing gloves but he removed them and spontaneously held out his arms to her as hed always done she embraced him they were both hot and sweaty and he was acrid with the mixed odours of horse and man what a day eh he took off his baseball cap revealing hair that would have been thick and wavy had he not kept it shorn close to his skull it was brown flecked with grey and this served as a reminder of merediths estrangement from jemima for it seemed to meredith that his hair had been completely brown the last time she had seen him she said i phoned the verderers office they said youd be here he wiped his forehead on his arm replaced the cap and tugged it down did you now whats up he glanced over his shoulder as the pony within the horse trailer clomped restlessly and bumped against its side the trailer shuddered robbie said hey now and he made a clucking sound you know you cant stay here at the queens head mate settle settle jemima meredith said its her birthday robbie so it is which makes it yours as well which means youre twentysix years old and that means imblimey im fortyone youd think by now i wouldve found a lass willing to marry this heap of manhood eh no ones snapped you up meredith said the women of hampshire are half mad then rob he smiled you oh im full mad ive had my one man thank you very much not about to repeat the experience he chuckled damn then merry youve no idea how often ive heard that said so whyre you looking for me since its not to offer your hand in marriage its jemima robbie i went to the cupcake queen and saw it was closed then i talked to lexie streener and then i went to their placegordon and jemimasand theres this woman gina dickens there shes not exactly living there or anything but shesi spose youd call it established and she didnt know the first thing about jemima you havent heard from her then from jemima no meredith hesitated she felt dead awkward she looked at him earnestly trying to read him well she must have told you bout what happened tween the two of you he asked oh aye she told me you had a falling out some time back didnt think it was permanent though well i had to tell her i had doubts about gordon arent friends meant to do that id say they are but all shed say in return is robbie doesnt have doubts about him so why do you said that did she did you have doubts like me did you oh that i did something about the bloke i didnt dislike him xactly but if she was going to have a partner i wouldve liked it to be someone i knew through and through i didnt know gordon jossie like that but as things turned out i neednt have worriedsame applies to youbecause jemima found out whatever she needed to find out when she hooked up with him and she was clever enough to end it when it needed to be ended whats that mean exactly meredith shifted she was absolutely baking in the heat at this point she felt as if her entire body were melting like her poor chocolate cake in the car look can we get out of the sun she asked can we get a drink have you the time we need to talk i thinktheres something not quite right robbie gave a look to the pony and then a look to meredith he nodded and said not the pub though and he led them across the car park to a little arcade of shops one of which offered sandwiches and drinks they took theirs to a sweet chestnut that spread its leafy branches on the edge of the car park where a bench faced a lawn opening out in the shape of a fan a smattering of tourists were taking photos of ponies that grazed with their foals nearby the foals were especially appealing but they were also skittish which made approaching them and their dams more dangerous than usual robbie watched the action one damn well wonders he said darkly that bloke over there hes likely to be bit and then hell want the pony put down or hell want to sue god knows who not that the wanting is going to get him anywhere still i always think theres some kinds need to be permanently removed from the gene pool do you he coloured slightly at the question then he looked at her spose not he said and then shes gone to london merry she phoned me up one day somewhere near the end of october this was and she announced she was going to london i thought she meant for the day for supplies or something for the shop but she says no no its not the shop i need time to think she says gordons talking about marriage she says are you sure about that that he talked about marriage thats what she said why but what about the cupcake queen why would she leave her business just to go off and think about anything yeah bit odd that eh i tried to talk to her about that but she wasnt having anything off me london meredith worked on the word she tried to relate it to her friend think about what does she not want to marry him any longer why she wouldnt say merry she still wont say you talk to her oh aye course i do once a week or more shes that good about ringing me well she would be you know jemima she worries a bit how im doing without her coming round like she did so she stays in touch lexie told me she tried to ring jemima first she left messages and then the calls didnt go through so howre you talking to her once new mobile robbie said she didnt want gordon to have the number he kept ringing her she doesnt want him to know where she is dyou think something happened between them that i dont know and she wont say i went over there once shed gone cause shed been in a bit of a state and i thought to have a word with gordon and he shook his head nothing gordon says you know what i know mate i still feel the same as always shes the one whose feelings changed someone else on jemimas part robbie lifted his can of coke and downed most of it wasnt someone when she left i asked her that you know jemima hard to think shed leave gordon without having someone ready to partner up with yes i know that being alone business she cant cope can she whos to blame her really after mum and dad they were both silent considering this what fears that losing her parents in childhood had wrought in jemima and how those fears had played out in her life across the lawn from them an elderly man with a zimmer frame was getting too close to one of the foals its dams head snapped up but then no worries the foal scampered off and the small herd moved as well they were more than a match for a bloke with a zimmer he called out to them a carrot extended robbie sighed should have saved my breath for the porridge all the good it does to tell them eh reckon some people have cotton wool up there stead of brains look at him merry you need a loud hailer she told him i need my shotgun robbie rose he would confront the man as indeed he must but there was something more that meredith wanted him to know things might have been explained with regard to jemima but things were still not right she said rob how did jemima get up to london i expect she drove and this was the crux of the matter it was the answer shed feared it constituted the bells and whistles and it became the alarm meredith felt it in the tingling of her arms and the shiverdespite the heatthat went up her spine no she said she didnt do that what robbie turned to look at her she didnt drive up there meredith rose as well thats just it thats why ive come her cars in the barn at gordons robbie gina dickens showed it to me it was under a tarp like he was hiding it youre joking why would i joke shed asked him about it gina dickens he said it was his but he hasnt ever driven it which made her think merediths throat was dry once more desertlike as it had been during her conversation with gina robbie was frowning it made her think what whats going on merry thats what i want to know she curved her hand round his workmuscled arm because rob theres more robbie hastings tried not to be concerned he had obligations to performthe most important at the moment being the transport of the pony in the horse trailerand he needed to keep his mind on his duty but jemima was a large part of that duty despite the fact that she was now an adult for jemimas becoming an adult hadnt changed things between them he was still her father figure while to robbie shed always be his sisterchild the waif whod lost her parents after a latenight dinner on holiday in spain too much to drink confusion over which side of the road to be driving on and that had been that gone in an instant mown down by a lorry jemima hadnt been with them and thank god for that for had she been everyone hed known as family would have been wiped out instead hed been staying with her in the family home and so his stay had become permanent thus even as robbie delivered the pony to the commoner who owned her and even as he had a talk with that gentleman about what ailed the animalrobbie reckoned it was cancer sir and the pony was going to have to be put down although you might want to phone the vet for a second opinion in the matterhe still thought about jemima hed phoned her upon waking that morning because it was her birthday and he phoned her again along the road back to burley after leaving the pony with its owner but he got this second time what hed got when he phoned the first time his sisters cheerful voice on her voice mail he hadnt given that fact a thought when hed first phoned for it had been early in the day and he reckoned shed switched the mobile off for the night if she wanted a liein on her birthday but she generally phoned right back when she got a message from him so when he left a second message he became concerned he phoned her place of employment after that but he learned that shed taken a half day off on the previous day and today was not a workday for her did he want to leave a message sir he didnt he rang off and worried the tattered leather cover on his steering wheel all right he told himself merediths concerns aside it was jemimas birthday and likely she was merely having a bit of fun and she would do that wouldnt she as he recalled shed enthused about ice skating recently lessons or something so she could be off doing that it would be exactly like jemima truth of the matter was that robbie hadnt told meredith everything beneath the sweet chestnut tree in burley there hadnt seemed to be a point mostly because jemima had a history of attachments to men while meredithbless her heartdefinitely had not he hadnt wanted to rub this fact in merediths face her being a single mum as the result of the only disastrous relationship shed managed besides robbie respected meredith powell how shed stepped onto the pitch of motherhood and was making a proper job of it and anyway jemima hadnt left gordon jossie for another man so that much of what robbie had told meredith had been true but exactly in character shed found another man quickly enough robbie hadnt told meredith that afterwards he wondered if he should have hes very special rob jemima had burbled in that way she had oh im madly in love with him thats what she always was madly in love no point in like or interest or curiosity or friendship when one could be madly in love for madly in love equated warding off solitude shed gone to london to think but thinking was something that led jemima to fear and god knew shed long rather run from fear than face it headon well didnt everyone wouldnt he if he could robbie wound up the hill that was honey lane a short distance outside burley in midsummer it was a lush green tunnel sided by holly and arced by beech and oak it was packed earth onlyno paving hereand he passed along it with care doing his best to avoid the occasional pothole that made the going rough he was less than a mile outside the village but one stepped back in time in this area the trees sheltered paddocks and beyond them ancient buildings marked both common holdings and farms these were backed by a wood and the wood was thick with fragrant scotch pines with hazel and with beech providing a habitat for everything from deer to dormice from stoats to shrews one could walk the distance here from burley but people seldom did there were easier paths to follow and in robbies experience people liked their ease at the crest of the hill he made the left turn onto what had long been hastings land this comprised thirtyfive acres of paddock and wood with the rooftop of burley hill house just visible to the northeast and the peak of castle hill lane beyond it in one of the paddocks his own two horses happily grazed delighted not to be carrying his weight round the new forest on this hot summer day robbie parked near the tumbledown barn and its attendant shed trying not to see them so he would not have to think about how much work he needed to put into them he climbed out of the land rover and slammed the door the noise brought his dog loping from round the side of the house where hed no doubt been sleeping in the shade his tail wagging and his tongue hanging and all of himself looking out of character the weimaraner was normally elegant in appearance but he hated the heat and hed rolled in the compost heap as if this would help him to escape it he now wore a fragrantly decomposing mantle he paused to shake himself off think thats amusing do you frank robbie asked the dog youre a real sight you know that eh i shouldnt let you near the house but no woman lived there to admonish him or to usher frank from the house herself so when he went inside and the dog tagged along robbie allowed it and was grateful for the company he fetched the weimaraner a fresh bowl of water frank slopped it happily onto the kitchen floor robbie left him to it and went for the stairs he was sweaty and he smelled all of horse from transporting the pony but instead of heading for a showerhe could hardly be bothered with that at this time of day as hed only get sweaty and smelly againhe went into jemimas room he told himself to be calm he couldnt think if he got himself into a state and he needed to think in his experience there was an explanation for everything and there was going to be an explanation for the rest of what meredith powell had told him her clothes are there rob but not in the bedroom hes boxed them all up and hes put them in the attic gina found them because she said there was something a little strangethats how she put itwhen he was talking about jemimas car so she did what take you up to see them up to the attic she just told me about them at first meredith said i asked to look i reckoned they couldve been there awhilefrom before gordon and jemima took the placeso they couldve been someone elses but they werent the boxes werent old and there was something i recognised well it was mine actually and shed borrowed it and id never got it back so you see he did and he didnt had he not heard from his sister at least weekly since her departure he would have headed to sway at once determined to have a facetoface with gordon jossie but he had heard from her and what shed repeated at the end of each phone call had been the reassurance not to worry rob itll all come right hed said at first whatll all come right and shed sidestepped the question her avoidance had forced him more than once to ask did gordon do something to you my girl to which shed replied of course not rob robbie knew hed now have assumed the worst had jemima not stayed in touch gordon had killed her and buried her on the property somewhere or out on the forest and deep within a wood so that if her body were ever found it would be in fifty years when it was too late to matter somehow an unspoken prophecya belief or a fearwould have been fulfilled by her disappearance because the truth of the matter washe did not like gordon jossie hed said to her often enough theres something about him jemima to which shed laughed and replied you mean hes not like you hed been forced finally to agree with her it was easy to like and embrace people just like oneself it was another matter with people who were different in her bedroom now he phoned her again again no reply just the voice and he left a message once he was asked to do so he kept it cheerful to match her own tone hey birthday girl ring me eh not like you not to get back in touch and im having a bit of a worry i am merry contrary came to see me she had a cake for you luv got itself all melted in the bloody heat but its the thought eh ring me luv i want to tell you about the foals he found he wanted to go on a bit but he was talking into a void he didnt want to leave his sister a message he wanted his sister herself he walked to her bedroom window its sill yet another depository for what jemima clutterduck could not bear to part with which was nearly everything shed ever possessed in this spot it was plastic ponies crammed one upon the next and covered with dust beyond them he could see the real thing his horses in the paddock with the sunlight glowing off their wellgroomed coats the fact that jemima had not returned for the foaling season was what should have told him he thought it had long been her favourite time of year like him she was of the new forest hed sent her to college in winchester as he himself had been sent but shed come home when her course work was completed rejecting computer technology for baking i belong here shed told him as indeed she did perhaps shed gone to london not for time to think but just for time perhaps shed wanted to break it off with gordon jossie but hadnt known how else to bring it about perhaps she reckoned if she was gone long enough gordon would find someone else and she herself could then return but none of that was in character was it not to worry shed say not to worry rob what a monstrous joke chapter four david emery considered himself one of stoke newingtons very few cemetery experts which he always thought of in uppercase letters david being an uppercase sort of bloke hed made an understanding of abney park cemetery his lifes work another uppercase situation for him and it had taken him ages of wandering and getting lost and refusing to be cowed by the general creepiness of the area before he was willing to call himself its master hed been locked in more times than he could begin to count but hed never let the cemeterys nightly closure impinge upon his plans while he was there if he arrived at any of the gates and found them chained against his wishes he didnt bother to ring the hackney police for rescue as the sign on the gate recommended he do for him it was no huge matter just to hoist himself up the railings and over the top landing either in stoke newington high street or preferably in the back garden of one of the terrace houses that lined the cemeterys northeast boundary making himself a master of the park allowed him to use its paths and crannies in any number of ways but particularly in ways amorous he did this several times a month he was good with the ladiesthey often told him he had soulful eyes whatever that meantand since one thing generally led to another with women in davids life a suggestion that they take a stroll in the park was rarely refused especially since park was such awell such an innocuous word compared to cemetery wasnt it his intention was always a shag indeed taking a walk having a stroll or going for a bit of a wander were all euphemisms for shagging and the ladies knew that although they pretended not to they would always say things like oooh dave that place gives me the jumps it does or words to that effect but they were perfectly willing to accompany him there once he put an arm round themgoing for a bit of breast with his fingers if he couldand told them theyd be safe with him so in theyd go directly through the main gates which was his preferred route as the path was broad and less intimidating there than it was if they entered by means of stoke newington church road there you were beneath the trees and in the clutches of the gravestones before youd gone twenty yards on the main path you had at least the illusion of safety till you veered right or left onto one of the narrower routes that disappeared into the towering plane trees on this particular day dave had coaxed josette hendricks to come along with him at fifteen josette was a little younger than dave was accustomed to not to mention the fact that she was something of a giggler which he hadnt known until he got her onto the first of the narrow paths but she was a pretty girl with a lovely complexion and those luscious baps of hers were no small matter in more ways than one so when he said what dyou say to the park and she said all bright eyed and moist lipped oh yes dave off they went he had a little hollow in mind a place created by a fallen sycamore behind a tomb and between two gravestones there interesting developments could occur but he was too much the schemer to head to the hollow straightaway he started off with a bit of handinhand statue gazingoooh dead sad that little angel looks ehand went on from there to a hand on the back of the neck a caressdave that makes me go all tinglyand the kind of kiss that suggested but nothing more josette was a little slower than most girls probably as a result of her upbringing unlike other girls of fifteen she was something of an innocent whod never even been out on a datemum and dad say not yetand therefore she didnt pick up on the signs as well as she might have done but he was patient and when at last she was pressing against him of her own volition and clearly wanting more of his kisses and at greater length he suggested they get off the path and see if theres somewhereyou know what i mean with a wink who would have bloody thought that the hollow his own particular site of seduction would be flaming occupied it was an outrage it was but there you have it dave heard the moaning and groaning as he and josette approached and there was no mistaking the arms and legs all atangle in the undergrowth especially since there were four of each and none of them had a stitch of clothing on there was also the naked arse of the bloke pumping madly away his head turned toward them and a grimace on his facecor do we all look like that dave wondered josette giggled when she saw and this was a good thing anything else would have suggested either fear or prurience and while dave certainly didnt expect her to be some sort of shrinking puritan in this day and age one never knew he backed away from the hollow josettes hand in his and he gave some thought to where he might take her there were nooks and hollows aplenty to be sure but he wanted a location close to this one josette being on the boil and then he thought of course they were not far from the chapel at the centre of the cemetery they couldnt get inside the building but right next to itindeed built into itwas a shelter that they could easily use it offered a roof and walls and that was better than the hollow come to think of it he inclined his head in the direction of the coupling couple in the bushes and winked at josette mmmm not bad eh he said dave she gave a little gasp of faux horror how could you mention such a thing well he said you saying you dont didnt say that was how she replied as good as an invitation that was it was off to the chapel they went hand in hand and in a bit of a hurry josette dave decided was definitely a flower ready to be plucked they reached the grassy clearing where the chapel stood just round here luv dave murmured he took her beyond the chapel entrance and around its far corner and there his plans ground themselves to a sudden halt for a teenage boy with a barrel for a bum was stumbling out of daves trysting place he had such a look on his face that one almost didnt notice he was holding up his obviously unzipped trousers he dashed across the clearing and then was gone all this at first caused david emery to think the boy had relieved himself inside the trysting place this cheesed dave off as he could hardly expect josette to want to roll round in a spot reeking of piss but as she was ready and as he was ready and as there was the slightest possibility that the boy had not used the shelter as a public convenience dave shrugged and urged josette forward saying just in there luv as he followed her he was so much thinking of just one thing that he nearly jumped out of his skin he did when josette went into the shelter and started screaming no no no barbara hadiyyah said we cant just go shopping not without a plan that would be far too overwhelming first we got to make a list but before we do that we got to consider what we want and to do that we got to decide on the type of body you have its how these things are done one sees it on telly all the time barbara havers eyed her companion doubtfully she wondered whether she should be seeking sartorial advice from a nineyearold girl but aside from hadiyyah there was only dorothea harriman to turn to if she was to take isabelle arderys advice to heart and barbara wasnt about to throw herself upon the mercy of scotland yards foremost style icon with dorothea at the helm the ship of shopping was likely to sail straight down the kings road orworseinto knightsbridge where in a boutique operated by railthin shop assistants with sculptured hair and similar fingernails she would be forced to lay out a weeks pay on a pair of knickers at least with hadiyyah there was a slight chance that what had to be done could be done in marks spencer but hadiyyah was having none of that topshop she said we got to go to topshop barbara or jigsaw or maybe h and m but just maybe i dont want to look trendy barbara told her its got to be professional nothing with ruffles or spikes sprouting from it nothing with chains hadiyyah rolled her eyes barbara she said really do you think id wear spikes and chains her father would have had something to say about that barbara thought taymullah azhar kept his daughter on what had to be called a very short lead even now in her summer holidays she wasnt allowed to run about with other children her age instead she was studying urdu and cookery and when she wasnt studying urdu or cookery she was being minded by sheila silver an elderly pensioner whose brief period of gloryendlessly recountedhad occurred singing backup for a cliff richard wannabe on the isle of wight mrs silver lived in a flat in the big house as they called it an elaborate yellow edwardian structure in eton villas barbara lived behind this building on the same property in a hobbitsize bungalow hadiyyah and her father were neighbours domiciled in the groundfloor flat of the big house with an area in front of it that served as its terrace this was where barbara and hadiyyah were conferring each with a ribena in front of her both of them bent over a wrinkled section of the daily mail which hadiyyah had apparently been saving for an occasion precisely like this one shed fetched the newspaper from her bedroom once barbara had explained her wardrobe quest i have just the thing shed announced happily and her long plaits flying shed disappeared into the flat and returned with the article in question she laid this open on the wicker table to reveal a story about clothing and body types spread across two pages were models who supposedly demonstrated all possibilities of build excluding anorexia and obesity of course as the daily mail did not wish to encourage extremes hadiyyah had informed barbara that they had to begin with body type and they couldnt exactly work out barbaras body type if she didnt change into somethingwell something that would allow them to see what they were working with she dismissed barbara back to her bungalow to change her clothesits awfully hot for corduroy and wool jumpers anyway she noted helpfullyand she bent over the paper to scrutinize the models barbara did her bidding and returned although hadiyyah sighed when she saw the drawstring trousers and tshirt what barbara said oh well never mind hadiyyah told her airily well do our best their best consisted of barbara standing on a chairfeeling like a perfect foolwhile hadiyyah crossed the grass to get a bit of distance so i cn compare you to the ladies in the pictures this she did by holding up the newspaper and crinkling her nose as she switched her gaze from it to barbara to it to barbara before announcing pear i think short waisted as well cn you lift your trousersbarbara you have lovely ankles whyever dont you show them girls should always emphasise their best features you know and id do that by hadiyyah considered this high heels you have to wear high heels do you have high heels barbara oh yeah barbara said i find them just the thing for my line of work crime scenes being otherwise rather grim youre making fun you cant make fun if were to do this properly hadiyyah bounced across the lawn back to her trailing the daily mail article from her fingers she spread this out on the wicker table once again and perused it for a moment after which she announced aline skirt the staple of all wardrobes your jacket has to be a length that doesnt draw attention to your hips and as your face is roundish still working to lose the baby fat barbara said the neckline of your blouse should be soft not angular blouse necklines you see should mirror the face well the chin really i mean the whole line from the ears to the chin which includes the jaw ah got it we want the skirt midknee and the shoes to have straps thats because of your lovely ankles straps hmm it says so right here and we must accessorise as well the mistake so many women make is failure to accessorise appropriately orwhats worsefailure to accessorise at all bloody hell we dont want that barbara said fervently whats it mean exactly hadiyyah folded up the newspaper neatly running her fingers lovingly along each crease oh scarves and hats and belts and lapel pins and necklaces and bracelets and earrings and handbags gloves as well but that would be only in winter god barbara said wont i be a bit overdone with all that you dont use it all at once hadiyyah sounded like patience itself honestly barbara its not really that difficult well maybe its a bit difficult but ill help you with it itll be such fun barbara doubted this but off they went they phoned her father first at the university where they managed to catch him between a lecture and a meeting with a postgraduate student early in her relationship with taymullah azhar and his daughter barbara had learned that one did not make off with hadiyyah without bringing her father fully into the picture she hated having to admit why she wanted to take hadiyyah with her on a shopping excursion so she made do with got to buy some bits and bobs for work and i thought hadiyyah might like to come along give her something of an outing and all that thought wed stop for an ice somewhere when were finished has she completed her studies for the day azhar asked her studies barbara gave hadiyyah the eye the little girl nodded vigorously although barbara had her doubts about the cookery end of things hadiyyah had not been enthusiastic about standing in someones kitchen in the summer heat thumbsup on that she told azhar very well azhar said but not in camden market barbara last place on earth i guarantee barbara told him the nearest topshop turned out to be in oxford street a fact that delighted hadiyyah and horrified barbara the shopping mecca of london it was always an undulating mass of humanity on any day save christmas in high summer with schools on holiday and the capital city packed with visitors from around the globe it was an undulating mass of humanity squared cubed to the tenth whatever once they arrived it took them forty minutes to find a car park with space for barbaras mini and another thirty to work their way to topshop elbowing through the crowds on the pavement like salmon going home when they finally arrived at the shop barbara glanced inside and wanted to run away at once it was crammed with adolescent girls their mothers their aunts their grans their neighboursthey were shoulder to shoulder they were in queues at the tills they were jostling from racks to counters to displays they were shouting into mobiles over the pounding music they were trying on jewellery earrings to ears necklaces to necks bracelets on wrists it was barbaras worst nightmare come to life isnt it wonderful hadiyyah enthused i always want dad to bring me here but he says oxford streets mad he says nothing would drag him to oxford street he says wild horses couldnt bring him here he says oxford streets londons version ofi cant remember but its not good dantes inferno no doubt barbara thought some circle of hell into which women like herselfloathing fashion trends indifferent about apparel in general and looking dreadful no matter what she worewere thrust for their fashion sins but i love it hadiyyah said i knew i would oh i just knew it she zipped inside there was nothing for barbara to do but follow they spent a grueling ninety minutes in topshop where lack of airconditioningthis was london after all where people still believed that there were only four or five hot days each yearand what seemed like a thousand teenagers in search of bargains made barbara feel as if shed definitely paid for every earthly sin shed ever committed far beyond those that shed committed against the name of haute couture they went from there to jigsaw and from jigsaw to h m where they repeated the topshop experience with the addition of small children howling for their mothers ice cream lollies pet dogs sausage rolls pizza fish and chips and whatever else came into their feverish minds at hadiyyahs insistencebarbara just look at the name of the shop pleasethey followed these experiences with a period of time in accessorize and finally they found themselves in marks spencer although not without hadiyyahs sigh of disapproval she said this is where mrs silver buys her knickers barbara as if that information would stop barbara cold and dead in her tracks do you want to look like mrs silver at this point ill settle for looking like dame edna barbara ducked inside hadiyyah trailed her thank god for small mercies barbara noted over her shoulder not only knickers but airconditioning as well all theyd managed to accomplish so far was a necklace from accessorize that barbara thought she wouldnt feel too daft wearing and a purchase of makeup from boots the makeup consisted of whatever hadiyyah told her to buy although barbara sincerely doubted shed ever wear it shed only given in to the idea of makeup at all because the little girl had been utterly heroic in facing barbaras consistent refusals to purchase anything hadiyyah had fished out of the racks of clothing theyd seen so far thus it seemed only fair to give in on something and makeup appeared to be the ticket so shed loaded her basket with foundation blusher eye shadow eye liner mascara several frightening shades of lipstick four different kinds of brushes and a container of loose powder that was supposed to fix it all in place hadiyyah told her apparently the purchases hadiyyah directed barbara to make were heavily dependent upon her observation of her mothers daily morning rituals which themselves seemed to be heavily dependent upon pots of this and thatshe always looks brilliant barbara wait till you see her seeing hadiyyahs mother was something that had not happened in the fourteen months of barbaras acquaintance with the little girl and her father and the euphemism shes gone to canada on holiday was beginning to take on a significance difficult for barbara to continue to ignore barbara groused about the excessive expense saying cant i make do with blusher by itself to this hadiyyah scoffed most heartily really barbara she said and she left it at that once in marks spencer hadiyyah wouldnt hear of barbaras trailing off towards racks of anything the child deemed suitable for mrs silveryou know she had in mind that staple of all wardrobesthe aforementioned aline skirtand declared herself content with the fact that at least as it was high summer the autumn clothing had just been brought in thus she explained what was on offer hadnt yet been picked over by countless working mums who wear this sort of thing barbara theyll be on holiday with their kids just now so we dont have to worry about having only the pickings left thank god for that barbara said she was drifting towards twin sets in plum and olive green hadiyyah took her arm firmly and steered her elsewhere she declared herself content when they found separates barbara which we can put together to make suits oh and look theyve blouses with pussy bows thesere rather sweet arent they she lifted one for barbaras inspection barbara couldnt imagine herself in a blouse at all let alone one with a voluminous bow at the neck she said dont think thats suitable for my jawline do you what about this and she pulled a jumper off a neatly folded pile no jumpers hadiyyah told her she replaced the blouse on the rack with oh all right i spose the bows a bit much barbara praised the almighty for that declaration she began to browse through the rack of skirts hadiyyah did likewise and they ultimately came up with five upon which they could agree although theyd had to compromise each step of the way with hadiyyah firmly returning to the rack anything she considered mrs silverish and barbara shuddering at anything that might draw attention to itself off they went to the changing rooms then where hadiyyah insisted upon acting the part of barbaras dresser which exposed her to barbaras undergarments which she declared shocking barbara you got to get those stringback kind barbara wasnt willing to wander even for a moment in the land of knickers so she directed hadiyyah to dwell on the skirts theyd chosen to these the little girl flicked her hand in dismissal of anything unsuitable barbara declaring this one to be rucked round the hips that one to be tight across the bum another to be a bit nasty looking and a fourth something that even someones gran wouldnt wear barbara was considering what punishment she might be able to inflict upon isabelle ardery for the suggestion that she get herself into this glamorous position in the first place when deep within her shoulder bag her mobile phone rang bleating out the musical equivalent of the first four lines of peggy sue that shed gleefully downloaded from the internet buddy holly hadiyyah said i remain gratified to have taught you something barbara fished out the mobile and looked at the number of the caller she was either saved by the literal bell or her movements were being tracked she flipped it open guv she said where are you sergeant isabelle ardery asked shopping barbara told her for clothes as recommended tell me youre not in a charity shop and ill be a happy woman ardery said be a happy woman then do i want to know where probably not and youve managed what a necklace so far and lest the superintendent protest the oddity of this purchase and makeup as well lots of makeup ill look like she racked her brain seeking a suitable image ill look like elle macpherson when next we meet and at the moment im standing in a changing room having my knickers disapproved of by a nineyearold your companion is nine years old ardery said sergeant believe me she has definite thoughts on what i ought to be wearing guv which is why weve only managed a necklace so far i expect were about to compromise on a skirt though weve been at it for hours and i think ive worn her down well effect the compromise and get in gear somethings come up something weve got a dead body in a cemetery sergeant and its one thats not supposed to be there isabelle ardery didnt want to think of her boys but her first sight of abney park cemetery made it nearly impossible to think of anything else they were of an age when having adventures trumped everything save christmas morning and the cemetery was decidedly a place for adventures wildly overgrown with gloomy victorian funerary statues draped in ivy with fallen trees providing imaginative spots for forts and caches with tumbling tombstones and crumbling monumentsit was like something out of a fantasy novel complete with the occasional gnarled tree that had been carved at shoulder height to display huge cameos in the shape of moons stars and leering faces all this and it was just off the high street behind a wroughtiron railing accessible to anyone through various gates ds nkata had parked their car at the main entrance where already an ambulance was waiting this entrance was at the junction of northwold road and stoke newington high street an area of tarmac in front of two creamcoloured buildings whose stucco was flaking off in sheets these sat on either side of enormous wroughtiron gates which isabelle learned were normally open throughout the day but now were closed and guarded by a constable from the local station he came forward to meet their car isabelle got out into the summer heat it came off the tarmac in waves it did nothing to soothe her pounding head a pain in her skull that was immediately exacerbated by the thunkathunkathunka of a television news helicopter that was circling above them like a raptor a crowd had gathered on the pavement held back by crime scene tape that was looped tightly from a streetlamp to the cemetery fence on either side of the entrance among them isabelle saw a few members of the press recognisable by their notebooks by their recorders and by the fact that they were being addressed by a bloke who had to be the duty press officer from the stoke newington station hed glanced over his shoulder as isabelle and nkata climbed out of the car he nodded curtly as did the local constable they werent happy the mets intrusion into their patch was not appreciated blame politics isabelle wanted to tell them blame so and the continual failure of missing persons not only to find a missing person but also to strike from their list persons who were no longer missing blame yet another tedious press exposé of this fact and a consequent power struggle between the civilians running so and the frustrated officers demanding a police head to the division as if that would solve its problems above all blame assistant commissioner sir david hillier and the manner in which hed decided to fill the vacant position that isabelle was now auditioning for hillier hadnt said as much but isabelle was no fool this was her test run and everyone knew it shed commandeered ds nkata to drive her up to the crime scene like the constables at the scene he wasnt happy either clearly he didnt expect a detective sergeant to be required to act the part of chauffeur but he was professional enough to keep his feelings unspoken shed had little choice in the matter it was either select a driver from among the team or attempt to find abney park cemetery herself using the az if she was assigned permanently to her new position isabelle knew it was likely going to take her years to become familiar with the convoluted mass of streets and villages that had over the centuries been subsumed into the monstrous expansion of london pathologist she said to the constable once she had introduced herself and nkata and had signed the sheet recording those entering the site photographer soco inside theyre waiting to bag her as ordered the constable was politejust the radio on his shoulder squawked and he reached up to turn down the volume isabelle looked from him to the gawkers on the pavement and from them to the buildings across the street these comprised the ubiquitous commercial establishments of every high street in the country from a pizza hut to a newsagent all of them had living accommodation above them and above one of thema polish delicatessenan entire modern apartment block had been built countless interviews would need to be conducted in these places the stoke newington cops isabelle decided should be thanking god the met was taking the case she asked about the tree carvings once they were inside the cemetery and being led into its labyrinthine embrace their guide was a volunteer at the burial ground a pensioner of some eighty years who explained that there were no groundsmen or keepers but instead committees of people like himself unpaid members of the community devoted to reclaiming abney park from the encroachment of nature of course it wasnt ever going to be what it once had been the gentleman explained but that wasnt the point no one wanted that rather it was meant to be a nature reserve onell see birds and foxes and squirrels and the like he said onell note the wildflowers and plants we aim just to keep the paths passable and make sure the places safe for people wanting to spend some time with nature one wants that sort of thing in a city dont you agree an escape if you know what i mean as to the carvings on the trees theres a boy doing em we all know him but cant bloody catch him at it if we do one of usll let him have it he vowed isabelle doubted this he was as frail as the wild snapdragon that grew along the path they followed he took them down trails that grew increasingly narrow as they coursed their way into the heart of the cemetery where paths were wide they were stony pebbled so variously that they looked like representatives of every possible geological period where they were narrow the paths were thick with decomposing leaves and the ground was spongy and aromatic sending up the rich scent of compost at last the tower of a chapel appeared and then the chapel itself a sad ruin of brick and iron and corrugated steel its interior thick with weeds and made inaccessible by iron bars over there the pensioner told them needlessly he indicated a gathering of whitesuited crime scene officers across a parched lawn isabelle thanked the man and said to nkata track down whoever discovered the body ill want a word nkata gave a look towards the chapel isabelle knew he wanted to see the crime scene she waited for him to protest or argue he did neither he said right and she left him to it she liked him for his response she herself approached a small secondary building abutting one side of the chapel near to which a body bag waited next to a collapsed ambulance trolley the body was going to have to be carried out upon it as the uneven paths in the cemetery would make rolling the trolley impossible till they got near the exit scenes of crime officers were engaged in everything from taping and measuring to marking off footprints for what little good this would do as there appeared to be dozens only a narrow access route consisting of endtoend boards made the immediate site of the body available and isabelle donned latex gloves as she picked her way along it the forensic pathologist came out of the secondary building she was a middleaged woman with the teeth skin and disturbing cough of a chainsmoker isabelle introduced herself and said what is this place with a nod at the building no idea the pathologist said she did not give her name nor did isabelle want it no door from it into the chapel so it cant have been a vestry gardeners shed perhaps the woman shrugged it didnt really matter did it of course it didnt what mattered was the corpse and this turned out to be a young woman she was half seated and half sprawled inside the little annex in a position suggesting shed stumbled backwards upon being attacked and had subsequently slid down the wall the wall itself was mottled by the weather and above the body a graffito of an eye inside a triangle proclaimed god goes wireless the floor was stone and littered with rubbish death had come to mingle with crisps bags sandwich wrappers chocolatebar wrappers and empty coke cans there was a pornographic magazine as well a much more recent bit of rubbish than the rest of the debris as it was fresh and uncrumpled it was also open at a gleaming crotch shot of a pouting redlipsticked woman in patent leather boots a top hat and nothing else ignominious location in which to meet your end isabelle thought she squatted to have a look at the victim her stomach rolled at the scent coming off the body a smell of meat rotting in the heat thick as yellow fog newly hatched maggots writhed in the bodys nostrils and mouth and her mouth face and neckwhere they could be seenhad turned greenishred the young womans head lolled on her chest and on the chest itself a vast amount of blood had coagulated flies were doing more business there and the sound of their buzzing was like hightension wires in the close space when isabelle carefully moved the young womans head to expose her neck more flies rose in a cloud from an ugly wound it was jagged and torn suggesting a weapon wielded by a clumsy killer carotid artery the pathologist said she made a gesture towards the bodys bagged hands looks like she tried to stop the bleeding but it couldnt have done much good she would have bled out fast weapon nothing left at the scene till we get her on the table and have a close look it could be anything sharp not a knife though the wounds far too messy for a knife how long dyou reckon shes been dead difficult to say because of the heat lividitys fixed and rigors gone perhaps twentyfour hours do we know who she is theres nothing on her no handbag here either nothing to suggest who she is but the eyestheyre going to give you some help the eyes why whats wrong with them have a look for yourself the pathologist said theyre clouded over as youd expect but you can still see something of the irises very interesting you ask me dont see eyes like that very often from alan dressers account later confirmed by the takeaways employees mcdonalds was unusually crowded that day it may be that other parents of young children were also using the break in the weather to get out of the house for the morning but whatever the case most of them seem to have converged on mcdonalds at the same time dresser had a querulous toddler in tow and he was he admits anxious to appease him to feed him and to be on his way in order to put him down for a nap he established the boy at one of the three remaining available tablessecond in from the doorwayand he went to place their order although hindsight demands one castigate dresser for leaving his son unattended for so much as thirty seconds at least ten mothers were present in mcdonalds at that moment and in their company at least twentytwo small children in such a public setting in the middle of the day how was he to assume that inconceivable danger was approaching indeed if one thinks of danger at all in such a location one thinks of paedophiles lurking nearby and seeing an opportunity not of three boys under the age of twelve no one present looked the least bit dangerous indeed dresser was himself the only adult male there cctv tape shows three boys later identified as michael spargo ian barker and reggie arnold approaching mcdonalds at they had been inside the barriers for more than two hours they were doubtless hungry and although they could have assuaged their hunger with the bags of crisps theyd taken from mr guptas snack kiosk it seems to have been their intention to take food from a mcdonalds customer and to make a run for it afterwards both michaels account and ians account agree on this point in every interview reggie arnold refuses to talk about mcdonalds altogether this is likely due to the fact that no matter whose idea it was to take john dresser from the premises it is reggie arnold who has the toddler by the hand as the boys walk towards the barriers exit in looking upon john dresser ian michael and reggie would have been gazing at the very antithesis of their own past selves at the moment of his abduction the child was dressed in a new azure snowsuit with yellow ducks marching across the front of it his blond hair was freshly washed and had yet to be cut so it fell round his face in the sort of cherubic curls one associates with renaissance putti he had bright white trainers on his feet and he was carrying his favourite toy a small brownandblack dog with floppy ears and a pink tongue partially torn from its mouth a stuffed animal later found along the route the boys took once they removed john from mcdonalds this removal was apparently accomplished without difficulty it was a matter of moments and the cctv film that documents johns abduction makes for chilling viewing in it one clearly watches the three boys enter the mcdonalds which at the time did not have closedcircuit filming of its own less than one minute later out they come reggie arnold emerges first holding john dresser by the hand five seconds later ian barker and michael spargo follow michael is eating something from a conical container these appear to be mcdonalds french fries one of the questions relentlessly asked after the fact was how could alan dresser have failed to notice that his son was being taken two explanations exist one of them is the noise and the crowded conditions of the takeaway which covered any sound john dresser might have made when approached by the boys who took him the other is a mobile phone call that dresser received from his office as he reached the till to place his order the wretched timing of this call kept him with his back turned from his son longer than he might otherwise have had it turned and as many people do dresser lowered his head and maintained that position as he listened and responded to the caller likely to avoid distractions that would have made it more difficult for him to concentrate in the raucous atmosphere by the time he had concluded this phone call paid for his food and returned with it to the table john was not only gone but likely had been gone for nearly five minutes more than enough time to get him out of the barriers altogether dresser did not at first think that john had been taken indeed with the takeaway so crowded that was the last thing on his mind instead he thought the boyrestless as hed been in stanley wallingfords diy shophad climbed down from his seat and wandered off perhaps attracted by something inside mcdonalds perhaps attracted by something just outside the takeaway but still well within the arcade these were vital minutes but dresser did not see them that way not unreasonably he looked round the take away first before he began asking the adults therein if they had seen john one wonders how it is possible it is midday it is a public place it contains other people both children and adults yet three young boys are still able to walk up to a toddler take him by the hand and make off with him without anyone apparently noticing how could this happen why did it happen the how of it is i believe contained within the age of the perpetrators of this crime the fact that they were children themselves made them virtually invisible because what they did was beyond the imagination of the people present in the mcdonalds people simply did not expect malevolence to arrive in the package in which it was presented that day people tend to have predetermined mental pictures of child abductors and those pictures do not include schoolboys once it became clear that john was not in the mcdonalds and had not been noticed dresser widened his search it was only after he had checked the four nearest shops that he tracked down the arcades security force and an announcement was made over the publicaddress system alerting the patrons of the barriers to be on the lookout for a small boy in a bright blue snowsuit an hour passed during which dresser continued to look for his son accompanied by the shopping arcades manager and the head of the security team none of them considered looking at the cctv tapes because none of them at that point wished to think the unthinkable chapter five barbara havers had to use her id to convince the constable that she was a cop hed barked at her hey cemeterys closed madam as shed approached the main entrance having finally found a place for her decrepit mini just behind a skip where a building was being renovated in stoke newington church street barbara chalked it up to the outfit she and hadiyyah had managed the purchase of that staple of all womens wardrobesthe aline skirtbut that was it after returning hadiyyah to mrs silver barbara had donned the skirt in a hurry had seen it was several inches too long had decided to wear it anyway but had done nothing else about her appearance other than to loop the necklace from accessorize round her neck she said the met to the constable who gaped at her before he managed to gather his wits enough to say inside and to offer her the signin sheet on a clipboard how bloody helpful barbara thought she replaced her id in her shoulder bag fished out a packet of fags and lit up she was about to make a polite request for a wee bit more information as to the precise location of the crime scene when a slowmoving procession emerged from beneath the plane trees just beyond the cemetery fence this comprised an ambulance crew a pathologist with professional bag in hand and a uniformed constable the ambulance crew had a body bag on a trolley which theyd been carrying like a stretcher they paused to lower its legs they then continued towards the gates barbara met them just inside she said superintendent ardery and the pathologist nodded vaguely in a northern direction uniforms along the way was the limit of the guidance she gave although she added youll see them fingertip search to indicate there would be enough of them to give barbara further directions should she need them she didnt as things turned out although she was quite surprised she managed to find the crime scene at all considering the maze that constituted the cemetery but within minutes the spire of a chapel came into view and soon enough she saw isabelle ardery with a police photographer they were bent over the screen of his digital camera as barbara approached them she heard her name called winston nkata was emerging from a secondary path near a lichenous stone bench flipping closed a leather notebook in which barbara knew beautifully legible observations would be written in his maddeningly elegant cursive she said so what is it he filled her in as he was doing so isabelle arderys voice cut in with a sergeant havers which was spoken in a tone that indicated neither welcome nor pleasure despite her orders that barbara was to come posthaste to the cemetery nkata and barbara turned to see the superintendent approaching ardery stalked no walking or strolling here her face was stony are you trying to be amusing she asked barbara knew her expression was a blank she said eh she glanced at nkata he looked equally mystified is this your idea of professional ardery asked oh barbara gave a look at what she could see of her kit red hightop trainers navy blue skirt dangling a good five inches below her knees tshirt printed with talk to the fist cos the face aint listening and necklace of chain beads and a filigree pendant she saw how ardery might take her getup a bit of illshowyou she said sorry guv its as far as i got next to her she saw nkata lift his hand to his mouth she knew the lout was trying to hide a smile really she said gods truth you said to get out here so i came on the run i didnt have time thats enough ardery gave her a onceover her eyes narrowed she said remove the necklace believe me it does nothing to improve barbara did so nkata turned away his shoulders quivered slightly he coughed ardery barked at him what have you got he pivoted back to her kids who found the bodyre gone now locals took them to the station for a complete statement but i managed a word before they left its a boy and girl he recited the rest of what hed learned two adolescents had seen a boy come out of the murder site their description was so far limited to he had a huge bum and his trousers were falling but the male adolescent claimed he probably could help with an efit that was all they were able to contribute because theyd evidently been heading towards the annex for sex and likely wouldntve noticed the crucifixion if it had been going on in front of them well want whatever statement they give to the locals ardery said she filled barbara in on the details of the crime and called the photographer over to run through the digital pictures once again as nkata and barbara looked them over ardery said arterial wound whoever did it was going to be literally covered in blood unless she was taken by surprise from the back barbara pointed out her head grabbed pulled back the weapon driven in from behind youd have blood on the arm and the hands then but little enough on the body right possibly ardery said but one couldnt be taken by surprise where the body was sergeant barbara could see the secondary building from where they were standing she said taken by surprise then dragged in there no sign of dragging do we know who she is barbara looked up from the pictures no id weve got a perimeter search going on but if that doesnt turn up the weapon or something telling us who she is well do a grid of the entire place and take it in sections i want you in charge of that coordinate with the locals i want you in charge of a housetohouse as well concentrate first on the terraces bordering the cemetery handle that and well reconvene at the met barbara nodded as nkata said want me to wait for the efit guv do that as well ardery said to barbara make sure their statement gets sent over to victoria street and i want you to see if you can squeeze anything else out of them nkata said i can youll continue to drive me ardery told him she looked towards the perimeter of the clearing in which the chapel sat constables were conducting the search there theyd move outward in circles till they foundor didnt findthe weapon the victims bag or anything else that might constitute evidence it was a nightmare location that could produce too much or nothing at all nkata was silent barbara saw a muscle move in his jaw he finally said due respect guv but dont you want a constable driving you or a special even ardery said if i wanted a constable or a special id have got one do you have a problem with the assignment sergeant seems like i could best be used as i want to use you ardery cut in are we clear on that he was silent for a moment then he said guv politely in affirmation bella mchaggis was utterly drenched in sweat but in a good way shed just completed her hot yoga classalthough any yoga class would have turned into hot yoga in the current weatherand she was feeling both virtuous and peaceful she had mr mchaggis to thank for this had the poor bloke not died on the toilet seat member in hand and page three girl spread out buxomly on the floor in front of him shed have likely still been in the shape she was in on that morning shed found him gone to his eternal reward but seeing poor mchaggis like that had been a call to arms whereas before his death bella hadnt been able to climb a flight of stairs without losing her breath now she could do that and more she was particularly proud of her limber body why she could bend from the waist and put her palms on the floor she could lift her leg to the height of the fireplace mantel not at all bad for a bird of sixtyfive she was on putney high street heading for home she was still wearing her yoga kit and she had her mat rolled beneath her arm she was thinking about worms specifically the composting worms that lived in a rather complicated setup in her back garden they were amazing little creaturesbless them they ate virtually anything one handed overbut they needed some care they didnt like extremes too much hot or too much cold and off theyd go to the big compost heap in the sky so she was considering how much constituted too much heat when she passed the local tobacconist where an evening standard placard stood out front advertising the days last edition of that paper bella was used to seeing some dramatic event reduced to three or four scrawled words suitable for bringing people into the shop to purchase a paper usually she walked on by on her way to her home in oxford road because as far as she was concerned there were far too many newspapers in londonboth broadsheets and tabloidsand recycling aside they were eating up every woodland on earth so she was damned if she would contribute to them but this particular placard slowed her steps woman dead in abney park bella hadnt a clue where abney park was but she stood there on the pavement with pedestrians passing her by and she wondered if it was at all possibleshe didnt want to think it was she hated the idea that it might be but since it could be she went within and purchased a copy of the paper telling herself that at least she could shred it and feed it to the worms if it turned out that there was nothing to the story she didnt read it at once indeed since she didnt like to appear the kind of person who could be seduced into buying a tabloid because of an advertising ploy she also purchased some breath mints and a packet of wrigleys spearmint from the shop she rejected the offer of a plastic bag for these itemsone had to draw the line somewhere and bella refused to participate in the further littering and destruction of the planet through the means of the plastic carrier bags one saw blowing along high streets every dayand went on her way oxford road wasnt far from the tobacconist a narrow thoroughfare perpendicular both to putney bridge road and to the river it was less than a quarter hours walk from the yoga studio so in no time at all bella was through her front gate and dodging the eight plastic rubbish bins she used for recycling in her small front garden inside the house she went into the kitchen where she brewed one of her two daily cups of green tea she hated the stuffit tasted like what she imagined horse piss would taste likebut shed read enough about its value so she regularly plugged her nose and tossed the brew down her throat it wasnt until shed drunk the ghastly cuppa that she spread the paper on the work top and took a look at its unfolded front page the photograph was not illuminating it showed a park entrance guarded by a cop there was a secondary picture cutting into this one an aerial shot depicting a clearing in the midst of what looked like a forested area and in the centre of this clearing a church of some kind with whitesuited crime scene people crawling round it bella consumed the accompanying story seeking the relevant bits young woman murdered apparently stabbed nicely dressed no identification she made the jump to page three where she saw an efit with the words person of interest being sought beneath it efits she thought never looked like the person they turned out to be depicting and this particular one looked so universal that virtually any adolescent boy on the street could have been picked up by the police and questioned as a result of it dark hair falling over his eyes chubby face wearing a hoodieat least the hood was down and not upin spite of the heattotally useless as far as a description went shed just seen a dozen such boys on putney high street the article indicated that this particular individual had been seen leaving the crime scene in abney park cemetery and reading this bella dug out an old az from the bookshelves in the dining room she located this place in stoke newington and the very fact of stoke newington miles upon miles from putney gave her pause she was in the midst of this pause when she heard the front door being unlocked and steps coming down the corridor in her direction she said frazer luv and didnt wait for his reply she made it her business to know the comings and goings of her lodgers and it was the hour at which frazer chaplin returned from his day job to freshen up and change his clothes for his evening employment she greatly admired this about the young man the fact that he had two jobs industrious people were the sort of people she liked letting rooms to got a moment frazer came to the doorway as she looked up from the az he raised an eyebrowblack like his hair which was thick and curly and spoke of spain at the time of the moors although the boy himself was irishand he said blazing today eh every kid in bayswater was at the ice and bowl mrs mch no doubt bella said have a look in here luv she took him to the kitchen and showed him the paper he scanned the article then looked at her and he sounded perplexed what do you mean and young woman dressed nicely dead he twigged then and his expression altered oh no i don think so he said although he did sound slightly hesitant when he went on with really it cant be mrs mch why not because why would she be up in stoke newington and why in a cemetery for gods good love he looked at the photographs once again he looked at the efit as well he shook his head slowly no no truly more likely shes just gone somewhere for a break to get away from the heat to the sea or something dont you think who could blame her like she would have said she wouldnt have wanted anyone to worry i expect you know that frazer raised his head from his study of the newspaper photos alarm in his eyes a fact that bella noted with gratification there were few things in life she loathed more than a slow learner and she gave frazer high marks for his ability to infer he said ive not broken the rule again i might not be the brightest coin in the collection plate but im not i know luv bella said quickly god knew he was a good boy at heart easily led perhaps rather too much taken when it came to a bit of skirt but still good in all the important ways i know i know but sometimes young women can be barracudas as youve seen for yourself not this time and not this young woman but you were friendly with her yes like im friendly with paolo like im friendly with you given bella said although she couldnt help feeling a wee bit warmed by his declaration of friendship towards herself but being friendly gives one access to people to whats going on inside them so dont you think she seemed different lately didnt she seem to have something on her mind frazer rubbed his hand along his jaw as he considered the question bella could hear the scritch of his whiskers against his palm hed have to shave before he went off to work ive not much talent for reading people he finally said not like you he was quiet again bella liked this about him as well he didnt rush forward with foolish opinions based on nothing like so many young people he was thoughtful and unafraid to take his time he said could beif it is her and im not saying it is because it hardly makes sense reallyshe went up there to think needing a quiet place it being a cemetery to think bella said all the way to stoke newington in order to think she can think anywhere she can think in the garden she can think in her bedroom she can think if she takes a walk by the river all right then what frazer asked saying its her why would she go shes been secretive lately not her usual self if its her she went up there for no good reason such as such as meeting someone such as meeting someone who killed her thats dead mad that is it may be but im phoning anyway who the cops luv theyre asking for information and we have it you and i what that theres a lodger hasnt come home in two nights i expect theres situations like that all over town may well be but this particular lodger has a brown eye and a green one and i doubt youre going to find that description common to anyone else whos gone missing but if its her and if shes dead frazer said nothing more and bella looked up from the paper there was certainly something in his tone and bellas suspicions were roused but her concerns were assuaged when he went on with shes such a grand girl mrs mch shes always been open and friendly hasnt she shes never acted like someone with secrets so if its her the question isnt so much why was she there but who on gods green earth would want to kill her some madman luv bella replied you and i know londons crawling with them below him he could hear the usual noise acoustic guitars and electric guitars both played badly the acoustic guitars were bearable as the hesitant chords at least were not amplified as for the electric guitars it seemed to him that the worse the player the louder the amplification employed it was as if whoever the student was he or she enjoyed being bad or perhaps the instructor enjoyed allowing the student to be bad and at maximum volume as if there were a lesson being taught that had nothing to do with music he couldnt sort out why this might be the case but hed long ago given up trying to understand the people among whom he lived if you declared you would understand if you showed yourself as who you could be nine orders but we weare the highest distort gods plan and you fall like the others do you wish to a shriek from a chord gone very wrong it dispelled the voices there was blessing in that he needed to be out of this place as he usually was for the hours that the shop beneath him was open for business but he hadnt been able to leave for two days it had taken that long to remove the blood he had a bedsit and hed used its washbasin it was tiny though and tucked into the corner of the room it was also within sight of the window so hed had to be careful because although it was unlikely that someone would see him through the wispy curtains there was always a chance that a breeze could blow them away from the aperture at the moment when he was wringing cherrystained water from the shirt or the jacket or even the trousers still he wanted a breeze even as he knew a breeze would be dangerous to him hed opened the window in the first place because it was so hot in the bedsit that he hadnt been able to breathe properly and useless to us now unless you show yourself had battered against his eardrums and the thought of air had him stumbling to the window and shoving it open hed done it at night he had done it at night which meant he was able to make distinctions and we are not intended to battle each other we are meant to battle the sons of darkness do you not see he shoved the earpieces into his ears and turned up the volume intermittently hed been playing the ode to joy because he knew it was capable of taking up so much space in his brain that he could have no thoughts that were not those sounds and he could hear no voices that were not the chorus that was what he needed to see him through until he could return to the street because of the heat his clothes had dried quickly which was a blessing this had allowed him to soak them a second and third time ultimately the water had altered from bright crimson to cherry to the pale pink of spring blossoms and while the shirt would not be white again without bleaching or professional laundering the worst of the staining was gone and on the trousers and jacket it couldnt be seen at all what remained was the ironing and he had an iron because how he appeared was important to him he didnt like people to be put off he wanted them near he wanted them listening and he wanted them to know him as he really was but that couldnt happen if he was disheveled with filthy clothes suggesting poverty and sleeping rough neither of those was accurate hed chosen his life he wanted people to know that other choices here is one before you the need is great need leads to action and action to honour hed sought it honour only honour shed needed him hed heard the call it had all turned out wrong shed looked at him and hed seen the recognition in her eyes and he knew it meant surprise because she would be surprised but it also meant welcome hed walked forward and hed known what had to be done and there were no voices in the moment no chorus of sound and hed heard nothing not even the music from the earphones he wore and he had failed blood everywhere on her and on him and her hands at her throat hed run hed hidden at first rubbing himself with fallen leaves to take the blood away he removed his shirt and balled it up he turned his jacket inside out the trousers were bad but they were black and the black obscured the crimson of her that had spilled down the front of him hed had to get home which meant the bus which meant more than one bus and he hadnt known when to get off to make the switch so it had taken hours and hed been seen gawked at whispered about and it could not matter because another sign and you should have read it there are signs around you but you choose to guard when you are meant to fight it was his job to get home and to clean himself so that he could do what he had been intended to do no one he told himself would put it together in the buses of london there were so many types of people and no one paid attention to anything and even if they had paid attention and had seen and had even remarked upon or remembered what theyd seen it didnt matter nothing mattered hed failed and he had to live with that chapter six isabelle ardery wasnt pleased that ac hillier put in an appearance at the morning meeting of her team on the following day it smacked of checking up on her which she didnt like although his claim was that hed merely wanted to say well done in reference to the news conference shed held the previous afternoon she wanted to tell him that she wasnt a fool she understood exactly why hed turned up to stand importantly at the back of the incident room and she also understood that the head of an investigationthat would be me sirwas meant to listen to whatever the duty press officer advised regarding information to be imparted to the media so she hardly needed to be congratulated on having done her job but she took the compliment with a formal thank you sir and she eagerly anticipated his immediate departure hed said do keep me apprised wont you acting superintendent and again the message was received as intended acting superintendent she didnt need reminding that this was her auditionfor want of a better wordbut it appeared to be the mans intention to do that reminding at every possible opportunity shed said that the news conference and its call for information from witnesses to anything suspicious was already bearing fruit and asked if he wanted a compendium of each days phone calls sir he eyed her in a way that told her he was evaluating what lay behind her question before he declined the offer but she kept her face bland he apparently decided she was being sincere hed said well meet later shall we and that was that off he went leaving her to the unfriendly gaze of di john stewart which she happily ignored the housetohouse in stoke newington was in progress the slow process of the cemetery search was continuing phone calls were being fielded and dealt with diagrams and maps had been drawn they were bound to get something from the news conference from the resulting stories on the television news and in the daily papers and from the efit that had been provided by the two adolescents whod discovered the body thus things were clicking along as they were meant to click isabelle was satisfied with her performance so far she had her doubts about the post mortem however shed never been one for dissection the sight of blood didnt make her feel anything akin to fainting but the sight of an open body cavity and the mechanics of removing and weighing what had so recently been living organs did tend to turn her stomach to liquid for this reason she determined to take no one with her to observe the proceedings that afternoon she also skipped lunch in favour of emptying one of the three airline bottles of vodka shed tucked into her bag for this precise purpose she found the mortuary without any trouble and within it she found the home office pathologist awaiting her arrival he introduced himself as dr willefordbut do call me blakelets keep things friendly shall weand he asked her if she wanted a chair or a stool in the event that the coming exploration proves rather more than you feel able to cope with he said all of this nicely enough but there was something about his smile that she didnt trust she had little doubt that her reaction to the autopsy was going to be reported hilliers long tentacles reaching out even here she vowed to keep upright told willeford she didnt anticipate any difficulty as shed never had difficulty with autopsies beforean outright lie but how was he to knowand when he chuckled stroked his chin observed her and then happily said right then here we go she stepped right up to the stainlesssteel trolley and fixed her gaze on the body that lay there chest up and waiting for the y incision with her fatal wound making a bloody lightning bolt down the right side of her neck willeford recited the salient superficial details first speaking into the microphone that hung above the autopsy trolley he did so in a chatty fashion as if with the intention of entertaining whoever would do the transcription kathy darling he said into the microphone we have a female before us this time shes in good physical condition no tattoos and no scars she measures five feet four inches tallsort out the metrics my love as i cant be botheredand she weighs seven point eight five stone do the metrics there as well will you kath and by the way hows your mum doing darling are you ready superintendent ardery oh kath thats not for you my dear weve a new one here shes called isabelle arderywith a wink at isabelleand shes not even asked for a chair on the chance that justincase becomes the case anyway he moved to examine the wound at the neck weve got the carotid artery pierced very nasty youll be glad you werent here not that you ever are my love weve also got a tear in the wound quite jagged measuringits seven inches he moved from the victims neck along the side of her body where he picked up one of her hands and then the other excusing himself to isabelle as he passed her and letting kathy know that the superintendent was still on her feet and her colour was good but they would see wouldnt they once he cut the body open he said no defensive wounds on the hands kath no broken fingernails no scratches either blood on them both but i expect this would have come from her attempt to stop the bleeding once the weapon was withdrawn he chatted on for a few more minutes documenting everything the eye could see he put her age between twenty and thirty and then he prepared himself for the next step of the process isabelle was ready clearly he expected her to faint just as clearly she intended not to she found she could have done with another shot of vodka when after the incision and the exposure of the rib cage he took out the shears to cut through the victims chestit was the sound of metal cutting through bone that she found most repellentbut after that the rest was if not easy then at least more bearable after willeford had done his bit he said darling kath as always its been a pleasure could you type that up and get it over to superintendent ardery darling and by the way shes still upright so i daresay shes a keeper remember di shatterwhat an appropriate name ehfalling headfirst into the body cavity up in berwickontweed that time lord what an uproar ah but what do we live for but to givewhatever it is that we give to our neighbours and to laugh at them in our turn i cannot ever remember that quote adieu dear kath till next time at that point an assistant swept forward to do the cleanup and willeford stripped off his scrubs tossed them in a bin in the corner and invited isabelle to step into my parlour said the spider et cetera ive a bit more for you in here a bit more turned out to be the information that two hairs had been caught up in the victims hands and he had little doubt that soco would soon inform her that fibres aplenty had been taken from her clothing got rather close to her killer if you know what i mean willeford said with a wink isabelle wondered if this counted as sexual harassment as she asked blandly intercourse rape a struggle nothing he said absolutely no evidence she was if he might put it this way a willing participant in whatever went on between herself and the owner of the fibres likely that was why shed been found where shed been found as there was no evidence shed been dragged anywhere against her will no bruises no skin under the fingernails that sort of thing he said did he have an opinion on what position she was in when she was attacked isabelle asked the pathologist what about time of death how long had she likely lived after the assault upon her from what direction did the injury occur was the killer leftor righthanded willeford fished in the pocket of his windcheater at this pointhed left it behind a door and he fetched it over to where they were sittingand brought out a nutrition bar had to keep his blood sugar up he confessed his metabolism was the curse of his life isabelle could see this was the case out of his scrubs he was thin as a garden hoe at a height of at least six feet six inches he likely needed to keep eating all day which had to be difficult in his line of work he told her that the presence of the maggots put time of death at twentyfour to thirtysix hours before the body was found although considering the heat the closer call would be twentyfour shed have been upright when she was attacked and her assailant was righthanded toxicology would show if drugs or alcohol was involved but that would take some time as would the dna from the hair as there were follicles attached and isnt that lovely isabelle asked if he reckoned the killer had been in front of or behind the young woman definitely standing in front of her the pathologist said which meant isabelle concluded that she may have known her killer isabelle also went alone on her next call that day in advance she studied the route and she was relieved to see that the direction she needed to follow to eaton terrace was not a complicated matter the important bit was not to bollocks things up in the vicinity of victoria station if she kept her wits about her and did not become unnerved by the traffic she knew she should be able to work her way through the skein of streets without ending up either at the river orin the other directionat buckingham palace as it happened she did make one wrong turn when she got to eaton terrace choosing left over right but she saw the error of her ways when she began reading the house numbers on the stately front doors after turning round things were simple although she sat in her car for a full two minutes when she arrived at her destination considering what approach she wished to use she finally decided that the truth was best which she admitted was generally the case still in order to speak it she found that she wanted something to assist and that something was tucked into the bottom of her bag she was glad shed thought to bring more than one airline bottle along for her workday she drained the vodka she rested the last of it on her tongue for a good long while till it heated up she swallowed and then fished for a piece of juicy fruit she chewed this on her walk to the front steps of the house and on the marble draughtsboard that marked what went for the porch she removed the gum ran some gloss over her lips and touched the lapels of her jacket to smooth them then she rang the bell she knew he had a manwhat an odd term she thoughtand it was this individual who answered the door youngish owlish and dressed in tennis gear which seemed an odd enough getup for a servant personal assistant butler or whatever an earlinhiding would have for that was how isabelle thought of di thomas lynley as an earlinhiding because it was frankly inconceivable to her why someone in his social position would choose to spend his life as a cop unless it was an incognito sort of thing in which he hid himself away from the rest of his kind and his kind were the sort of people whose pictures one saw on the cover of tabloids when they got themselves into trouble or inside the pages of hello ok tatler and the like hoisting champagne flutes at the photographer they went into nightclubs and stayed till dawn they skied in the alpsfrench italian or swiss what did it matterand they traveled to places like portofino or santorini or other multisyllabic mediterranean ionian or aegean locations ending in vowels but they didnt work at ordinary jobs and if they did because they needed the money they certainly didnt choose to be coppers afternoon the tennisclad man said he was charlie denton isabelle had done her homework she showed her id and introduced herself mr denton im trying to locate the inspector is he at home by any chance if he was surprised that she knew his identity charlie denton was too careful to let it show he said as it happens and he admitted her into the house he indicated a doorway to her right which led into a reception room done up in a quite pleasant shade of green he said i expect hes in the library he gestured to a simple arrangement of furniture round a fireplace and said he could fetch her a drink if shed like one she thought about accepting the offer and tossing back a vodka martini straight up but she declined as she reckoned he was referring to something more in line with the fact that she was still on duty while he went to find hisisabelle wondered what the term was his master his employer his whatshe took in the room the building was a town house and it likely had been in lynleys family for quite some time as no one had got inside to destroy the features that had gone into its making in the nineteenth century thus it still possessed its plaster ceiling decorations along with its mouldings above below and around isabelle reckoned there were endless architectural terms for it all but she didnt know any of them although she was perfectly capable of admiring them she didnt sit but rather walked to the window overlooking the street a table sat beneath its sill and this held several framed photographs among them a wedding picture of lynley and his wife isabelle picked this up and studied it it was casual and spontaneous the bride and groom laughing and glowing amid a crowd of wellwishers shed been very attractive isabelle saw not beautiful porcelain classic dolllike or whatever else one wished to call a woman on her wedding day she was no english rose either shed been dark haired and dark eyed with an oval face and an appealing smile shed been fashionably slender as well but werent they always isabelle thought superintendent ardery she turned the picture still in her hands shed expected greyfaced griefperhaps a smoking jacket a pipe in hand and slippers on his feet or something equally and ludicrously edwardianbut thomas lynley was quite tanned his hair was lightened to blond by exposure to the sun and he wore blue jeans and a polo shirt with three buttons and a collar shed forgotten his eyes were brown they were watching her without speculation hed sounded surprised when hed said her name but whatever else he might be feeling he didnt reveal it she said acting superintendent only ive not been given the position permanently im auditioning for it for want of a better word much like you did ah he entered the room he was one of those men who always managed to move with an air of assurance looking as if theyd fit in anywhere she reckoned it had to do with his breeding there would be something of a difference he said as he joined her at the table i wasnt auditioning just helping out i didnt much want the position ive heard that but ive found it difficult to believe why climbing the greasy pole never interested me climbing the greasy pole interests everyone inspector not if they dont want the responsibility and certainly not if theyve a marked preference for woodwork woodwork what woodwork he smiled faintly the kind one can fade into he looked at her hands and she realised she was still holding his wedding picture she set it back on the table and said your wife was lovely thomas im sorry about her death thank you he said and then with a perfect frankness that startled isabelle so appealing was it we were completely wrong for each other which ultimately made us right for each other i quite adored her how lucky to love so much she said yes like charlie denton he offered her a drink and again she demurred also like charlie denton he gestured towards a seating area but this one not before the fireplace rather he chose two chairs on either side of a chessboard where a game was in progress he glanced at this frowned and after a moment made a move with his white knight that captured one of the two black bishops charlie only appears to be showing mercy lynley noted that means hes got something up his sleeve what can i do for you superintendent id like to think this is a social call but im fairly sure its not theres been a murder in abney park stoke newington its a cemetery actually the young woman yes i heard the report on the radio news youre investigating whats wrong with having a local team hillier pulled strings theres also another cockup with so i think its more of the former and less of the latter though he wants to see how i compare with you and with john stewart if it comes to it i see youve pegged hillier already not a difficult task he wears a lot on his sleeve doesnt he lynley smiled again isabelle noted however that the smile was more form than feeling he was well guarded as she supposed anyone would be in the same situation she had no real cause to call upon him he knew it and was waiting to hear the reason for her visit she said id like you to join the investigation thomas im on leave he replied i realise that but im hoping to persuade you to take a leave from your leave at least for a few weeks youre working with the team i worked with arent you i am stewart hale nkata barbara havers as well oh yes the redoubtable sergeant havers is among us aside from her deplorable fashion sense ive a feeling shes a very good cop she is he steepled his fingers his gaze went to the chessboard and he seemed to be calculating charlie dentons next move although isabelle knew it was more likely that he was calculating hers he said so clearly you dont need my presence not as an investigating officer can any murder team have enough investigating officers that smile again facile response he told her good for the politics of the met bad for he hesitated a relationship with you she stirred in her chair and leaned towards him all right i want you on the team because i want to be able to say your name without a reverential hush falling over the incident room and this is the likeliest route to get me there also because i want to get on some sort of normal footing with everyone at the met and thats because i very much want this job youre forthright enough when your backs against the wall and i always will be with you and with everyone else before my backs against the wall thatll play good and bad for you good for the team youre directing bad for your relationship with hillier he prefers kid gloves to the iron fist or have you already discovered that it seems to me the crucial association at the yard is between myself and the team and not between myself and david hillier and as for the team they want you back they want you as their superintendentwell all except john stewart but youre not to take that personally nor would i he smiled genuinely this time yes good all right they want you back and the only thing that will satisfy them is to know you dont want to be what they want you to be and youre quite happy with someone else in the position with you in the position i think you and i can work together thomas i think we can work very well together if it comes down to it he seemed to study her and she wondered what he was reading on her face a moment passed and she let it hang there and extend thinking how completely quiet it was in the house and wondering if it had been so when his wife was living theyd had no children she recalled they had been married less than a year at her death how are your boys he asked her abruptly it was a disarming question and likely intended to be so she wondered how on earth he knew that she had two sons he said as if she had spoken you were on your mobile one day when we met in kent your former husbandyou were having a discussion with himyou mentioned the boys theyre near maidstone with him as it happens that cant be a happy arrangement for you its neither happy nor unhappy there was simply no point moving them to london if ive no idea whether this job is going to be permanent she realised after shed spoken that the words had come out more stiffly than shed intended she tried to ameliorate the effect by adding i miss them naturally but their summer holidays are probably better spent with their father in the countryside than with me here in london they can run a bit wild there here that would be out of the question and if youre appointed permanently to this job he had a way of watching one when he asked a question he could probably sort out truth from lie quickly enough but in this particular case there was simply no way he would be able to suss out the reason for the lie she was about to tell him then of course they would join me in london but i dont like to make premature moves thats never seemed wise and in this case it would be completely foolhardy like counting your chickens exactly like she said so thats another reason inspector wed got to thomas thomas she said all right im laying out the truth for you i want you to be involved in this case because i want to improve my chances for a permanent assignment here with you working with me it will set minds at rest and put an end to speculation at the same time as it will demonstrate a form of cooperation that will act as she looked for the appropriate term he supplied it as an endorsement of you yes if we work together well it will do that as i said ill never lie to you and my part would be played out at your side is that how you see it for the present yes it may alter wed take it as it comes he was quiet but she could tell he was considering her request setting it against his life as he was currently living it evaluating how things would alter and whether that alteration would make a difference to whatever he was coping with now he finally said i must think about it how long have you a mobile of course give me the number then ill let you know by the end of the day the real question for him was what it meant not whether he would do it hed tried to leave police work behind him but police work had found him and was likely to continue to find him whether he willed it or not once isabelle ardery left him lynley went to the window and watched her stride back to her car she was quite tallsix feet at least because he was six feet two inches and theyd been virtually eye to eyeand everything about her shouted professional from her tailored clothing to her polished pumps to her smooth ambercoloured hair falling just below her ears and tucked behind them shed had on gold buttonshaped earrings and a necklace with a similarly shaped pendant of gold but that had been the extent of her jewellery she wore a watch but no rings and her hands were well cared for with manicured nails cut to her fingertips and skin that looked soft she was definitely a mixture of masculine and feminine as she would have to be to succeed in their world she would be regularly forced to be one of the boys while remaining at heart one of the girls it wouldnt be easy he watched her open her bag at her car she dropped her keys scooped them up and unlocked the vehicle she paused to search through her shoulder bag for something but apparently she couldnt find it because she tossed her bag inside the car and in a moment shed started it and had driven off he stood looking at the street for a moment once shed gone he hadnt done this in quite some time as it was in the street that helen had died and hed not been able to bring himself to look lest his imagination take him back to that moment but looking now he saw that the street was merely a street like so many others in belgravia stately white buildings wroughtiron railings that gleamed in the sunlight window boxes that spilled forth ivy and star jasmine in a sweet perfume he turned from the sight he made for the stairway and climbed but he did not return to the library where hed been reading the financial times instead he went to the bedroom next to the room hed shared with his wife and he opened its door for the first time since the previous february and for the first time since the previous february he also went inside it was not quite finished a cot required assembling as theyd only got it as far as unloaded from its box six rolls of wallpaper tilted against the wainscoting which had been painted once but definitely needed another coat a new ceiling light remained in its box and a changing table stood beneath one of the windows but it was still bare of appropriate padding the quilted padding was itself rolled up in a peter jones carrier bag among other carrier bags that contained pillows nappies a breast pump bottlesit was astonishing how much gear was required for a creature likely weighing upon birth seven pounds or less the room was airless and quite hot and lynley moved to the windows and shoved them open there was little breeze to mitigate the temperature and he wondered they hadnt thought of that when theyd chosen this room for their sons nursery of course it had been late autumn then and on into winter so summer heat would have been the last thing on their minds instead theyd been consumed with the fact of the pregnancy alone and not actually with what the pregnancy was going to produce he supposed many couples approached it that way get through the tough bits leading up to and through childbirth and then shift into parenting mode one couldnt be a parent or think like a parent without someone to parent he concluded m lord lynley swung around charlie denton was in the doorway he knew lynley disliked the use of his title but theyd never settled on what denton was supposed to say or do to get his attention aside from using the title in some form mumbled if necessary or said in the midst of a cough yes what is it charlie are you off then he shook his head ive been already and one never knows about these things i thought the manner of dress would do it but there were no words of approbation from the director were there not damn hmm i did hear someone murmur he has the look but that was it the rest is waiting as always lynley said how long will it take for a callback not long commercials you know theyre picky but theyre not that picky he sounded resigned it was lynley thought the way of the acting world making ones way there was a microcosm of life itself desire and compromise putting oneself in a position of chance and feeling the slap of rejection more often than the embrace of success but there was no success without taking the chance without risk and consequence without a willingness to leap he said in the meantime charlie while youre waiting to be cast as hamlet sir denton said we need to pack up this room if youll make us a jug of pimms and bring it up here we should be able to accomplish it by the end of the day chapter seven meredith finally tracked gordon jossie to fritham shed assumed hed still be working on the building in boldre gardens where gina dickens had met him but when she got there it was obvious from the state of the roof that he was long gone to another job the thatch had been dressed and gordons signature piece was in place on the ridge an elegant peacock whose tail protected the vulnerable corner of the ridge and trailed in sculpted straw several feet down the roof meredith muttered a disappointed expletivelow so that cammie couldnt hear itand said to her daughter lets wander over to the duck pond shall we cause theres supposed to be a pretty green bridge over it that we can walk on the duck pond and the bridge ate up an hour but it turned out to be well spent as things happened they stopped at the refreshment kiosk afterwards and while purchasing a cornetto for cammie and a bottle of water for herself meredith learned where she could find gordon jossie without having to ring him and thus allow him time to ready himself to see her he was working on the pub near eyeworth pond she gathered this from the girl at the till who apparently possessed the information because shed had her eye on gordons apprentice for the entire time the two men had worked at boldre gardens shed managed to make inroads into this persons affections apparently and despiteor perhaps because ofhaving legs so bowed she was shaped like a turkey wishbone thats where meredith could find the thatchers she said near eyeworth pond she narrowed her eyes and asked which one of the men meredith was looking for meredith wanted to tell her to save her anxiety for something worthwhile a man in any condition of any age and in any form was the last thing she wished to add to her life but she said she was trying to find gordon jossie at which point the girl helpfully indicated the exact location of eyeworth pond just east of fritham and the pub was nearer to fritham than it was to the pond anyway she added the idea of another pond and more ducks made it easy to get cammie from the lawns and flowers of boldre gardens into the car never her favourite place to be because she positively loathed the restrictions of her car seat and the vehicles lack of airconditioning and she had long been very happy to make her displeasure known as luck would have it though fritham was some quarter hour only from the gardens just on the other side of the a meredith drove there with all the windows rolled down and instead of her affirmation tape she popped in a cassette that was a favourite of cammies cammie was partialof all thingsto tenors and she could actually warble nessuno dorma with astonishing operatic flair it was easy enough to find the pub in question called the royal oak it was a mishmash of styles that reflected different periods when extensions had been built upon it so the place blended cob halftimber and brick and its roof was part thatch and another part slate tiles gordon had removed the old thatch right down to the rafters when meredith arrived he was in the midst of climbing down from the scaffolding where beneath the pubs eponymous oak his apprentice was organising bundles of reeds cammie was happy to play upon a swing at the far side of the pubs beer garden so meredith knew shed be well occupied while her mum had a chat with the master thatcher gordon didnt look surprised to see her meredith reckoned gina dickens had likely reported her visit and who could blame her she wondered if after making her report gina had also grilled gordon on the matter of a car that was not his and on the matter of clothing stored in his attic she thought the younger woman might have done shed seemed unnerved enough when meredith had brought her more fully into the picture of the place jemima hastings had occupied in gordon jossies life meredith wasted no time with preambles once she saw cammie climb safely onto the swing she strode up to gordon jossie and she said what id like to know is how she was supposed to get up to london without her car gordon and she waited to hear how hed answer the question and what his face would look like as he did so gordon glanced at his apprentice he said lets have a break cliff and added nothing more till the younger man had nodded and disappeared into the pub then he removed the baseball cap hed been wearing and wiped down his face and his balding pate with a handkerchief that he removed from his jeans he had his sunglasses on and he didnt remove them which meredith knew was going to make it more difficult to read him shed always thought he wore dark glasses so often because he didnt want people to see his shifty eyes but jemima had said oh thats nonsense and apparently thought there was nothing odd about a man in dark glasses rain or shine sometimes even indoors as well but that had been the problem from the first meredith had thought there were scores of things about gordon jossie that just werent right while jemima had wanted to see none of them he was after all man one of a subspecies among whom jemima had been careening for years like someone controlled by the pinball wizard now gordon removed those dark glasses but he kept them off only long enough to wipe them down with his handkerchief whereupon he replaced them shoved the handkerchief back into his pocket and said calmly what dyou have against me meredith the fact that you separated jemima from her friends he nodded slowly as if taking this in he finally said from you you mean from everyone gordon you dont deny it do you no point to denying whats dead wrong eh stupid as well if you dont mind me saying you stopped coming round didnt you so if any separating was being done youre the one who did it dyou want to talk about why what i want to talk about is why her cars in your barn i want to know why you told thatthatthat blonde at your house that the car belongs to you i also want to know why her clothesre packed up and nothing even vaguely jemima is on display anywhere why am i supposed to tell you all that because if you dont or if you do and im not satisfied with what you tell me she let the threat hang there he wasnt a fool he knew what the rest of the sentence would be still he said what he was wearing a longsleeved tshirt and from its breast pocket he took a packet of cigarettes he shook one out and lit it with a plastic lighter and then he waited for her reply he turned his head briefly to look beyond her where across the street from the pub a redbrick farmhouse stood at the edge of the heath the heath itself rolled into the distance purple with heather a wood lay beyond it the treetops seemed to shimmer in the summer heat oh just answer me meredith said where is she and whyd she not take her car his head turned towards her once again what was she to do with a car up in london she didnt take it because she didnt need it then how did she get there no idea thats absurd you cant expect me to believe train bus helicopter hang glider roller skates he cut in i dont know meredith one day she said she was going and the next day she went she was gone when i got home from work i expect she took a taxi into sway and the train from there so what you did something to her meredith hadnt intended to accuse him not like this and not so quickly but the thought of that car and the lies about it and gina dickens taking up residence while jemimas belongings languished in boxes up in the atticdidnt you she demanded robs tried to phone her and shes not answering and shes not returning his messages and interested there are you well hes always been available and all things considered i suppose its a wise move she wanted to strike him not so much for the remark which was totally ridiculous but for the fact that thats what he would think that like jemima she was always looking for a man that she was somehow incomplete and unfulfilled and otherwise sososo desperate without one that shed have her female antennae up just in case a free bloke floated by in her vicinity whichas it applied to rob hastingswas completely absurd as he was fifteen years her senior and shed known him since she was eight years old so where did this gina person come from she demanded how long have you known her you met her prior to jemima leaving didnt you gordon shes at the root of all this he shook his head eloquently communicating both disbelief and disgust he drew in deeply on his cigarette in a breath that looked angry to meredith she said you met this gina person her name is gina gina dickens full stop dont call her this gina person i dont much like it im supposed to care about what you dont like you met this person and you decided youd rather have her than jemima didnt you thats bloody rubbish im getting back to work he turned to do so meredith raised her voice you drove her off she might be in london now but there was never a reason to go there except for you she had her own business shed hired lexie streener she was making a go of the cupcake queen but you didnt like that did you you made it rough for her and somehow you used that or her interest in it or the hours she was gone or something to make her feel she had to leave and then you brought in gina it all seemed so reasonable to meredith so much the way men behave he said again im getting back to work and he walked to the ladder that gave him access to the scaffolding that stretched the length of the building before he climbed though he turned to her he said for the record meredith gina didnt live herein the new foresttill june she came down from winchester and thats where youre from you went to school in winchester you met her then she knew she sounded shrill but she couldnt help it for some reason that she couldnt identify shed begun to feel desperate to know what was going on and had been going on for the months that she and jemima had been estranged gordon waved her off believe what you want but what i want is to know why youve hated me from the first this isnt about me its all about you and sos the reason you hated me on sight think about that before you come round again and leave gina alone while youre at it jemimas the reason jemima he said evenly has easily found someone else by now you know that as well as i do and i expect it drives you mad gordon jossies pickup wasnt visible when robbie hastings pulled beyond the tall hedges and onto the driveway of the mans holding but that didnt deter him if gordon wasnt there there was still a chance that his new woman might be and robbie wanted to see her as much as he wanted to have a conversation with gordon he also wanted to have a look round and he wanted to see jemimas car with his own eyes although meredith could not have mistaken it for someone elses it was a figaro and one didnt see a vehicle like that on the road every day he had no idea what all of this would or would not prove but two more phone calls to jemimas mobile had produced no response and he was beginning to panic jemima was flighty but she wasnt one to ignore her own brother robbie walked over to the paddock where he saw that two ponies were grazing it was an odd time of year for the animals to be brought in off the forest and he wondered what was wrong with them they appeared perfectly fit he looked over his shoulder at the cottage all of its windows were open as if in hope of a breeze but there seemed to be no one about this was all to the good meredith had said that jemimas car was in the barn so he made for this hed got the door wide open when he heard a womans pleasant voice call out hullo there cn i help you with something the voice came from a second paddock this one on the barns east side across a narrow rutted farm lane that led off towards the heath robbie saw a young woman brushing fragments of weeds from the knees of her blue jeans she looked like a designer from one of those telly programmes had dressed her white shirt starched and with the collar turned up cowboy neckerchief bibbing against her throat straw hat shading her face from the sun she wore dark glasses but he could tell she was pretty prettier than jemima by several yards tall and possessing curves in places other girls her age usually didnt want to have them she said are you looking for someone my sister he said she said oh no surprise he thought well she wouldnt be surprised at this point would she meredith had been there ahead of him and what woman wouldnt ask questions of her man if another womans name came up unexpectedly as jemimas name no doubt had done he said ive been told her motors in the barn evidently she said so is mine hang on she ducked through the wire fencing it was barbed but she was wearing gloves to hold the barbs away she was also carrying a map of some sort ordnance survey by the look of it im finished here anyway she told him the cars just inside so it was not covered by a tarpaulin as it had been before according to meredith but standing there big as life battleship grey with a cream coloured roof it was an ancient thing and it was pulled far into the barn another car sat behind it a latemodel mini cooper apparently the other womans she introduced herself although he knew shed be gina dickens jemimas replacement she said frankly that shed been rather put out learning that the car wasnt gordons but his former partners shed had a few words with him about it she said about jemimas clothing boxed up in the attic as well she said he told me shes been gone for months that hes not heard a single word from her in all that time that she likely isnt coming back again that theydwell he didnt say theyd had a row just that theyd parted he said it was something coming on for ages and it had been her idea and as he was hoping to move on with his life hed boxed up everything but not thrown it away he reckons shell want her things eventually and ask to have them sent when she getssettled i suppose she removed her sunglasses and looked at him frankly im babbling she said sorry im nervous about all this i mean about how it looks and everything her car here her things boxed up you believed gordon robbie ran his hand along jemimas car it was dust free and it shone with a glossy patina shed always taken good care of it so meredith was right in this whyd she not taken it with her true it would be difficult to have a car in london but jemima wouldnt have considered that when an impulse came upon her shed never stopped to consider a thing gina said in a somewhat altered voice well i actually had no reason not to mr hastings to believe him that is do you think otherwise robbie he said names robbie you can call me that im gina yes i know he looked at her wheres gordon then working near fritham she rubbed her arms as if a chill had come over her she said would you like to come inside the house i mean he didnt particularly want to but he followed her hoping he might learn something that could settle his concern they went in through the laundry area and from there to the kitchen she set her map on the table and he saw that it was indeed an ordnance survey map as hed thought shed marked the property on it and shed attached to it a second sheet of paper with a penciled drawing this too was of the property but enlarged gina apparently saw him looking it over because she said were and she sounded hesitant as if leery of parting with the information well were thinking of making some changes round here that certainly said a great deal about jemimas absence from the scene robbie looked at gina dickens shed removed her hat her hair was pure gold it was shaped to her head like a closefitting cap in a style that brought to mind the roaring twenties she removed her gloves and tossed them on the table amazing weather she said would you like water cider a coke and when he shook his head she came to the table to stand beside him she cleared her throat he could tell she felt uncomfortable here she was with the brother of her lovers former lover it was bloody awkward he felt it as well she said i was thinking how lovely it would be to have a proper garden but i wasnt quite sure where i was trying to determine where the property actually ends and i thought the survey map would help but it doesnt actually so id decided that perhaps in the second paddockas were notas hes not using it i thought it would make a lovely garden a place where i could bring my girls youve children oh no i work with adolescent girls the sort who might get themselves into trouble if they dont have someone to take an interest girls at risk i hoped to have a place besides an office somewhere her voice drifted she used her teeth to pull on the inside of her lip he wanted to dislike her but he couldnt it wasnt her fault gordon jossie had chosen to move on once jemima had left him if indeed that was what had happened robbie looked at the map and then at ginas drawing shed created a grid from the paddock he saw and shed numbered the squares within it she said as if in explanation i was trying to get an idea of the exact size so id know what wewhat i was working with im not sure the paddock itself will do for what i have in mind so if it doesnt then perhaps part of the heath thats why im trying to sort out where the property ends in case i have to have the gardenwe have to have the garden somewhere else you do robbie said what you cant have it in the paddock she seemed surprised whyever not gordon and jemimarobbie wouldnt allow his sister not to be part of the conversationhave common rights here and the paddocks are meant for the ponies if theyre out of condition her face fell she said i had no idea that he has common rights i dont even know what the expression means to tell you the truth rob explained briefly how some of the land within the perambulation had certain rights attached to itthe right of pasture the right of mast the right of estovers or marl or turbaryand this particular property had the right of common pasture it meant that gordon and jemima had been allowed ponies which could graze freely upon the new forest but the proviso was that land near the house had to be kept free for the ponies should they need to be removed from the forest for any reason gordon didnt tell you this he said odd that hed be thinking of putting a garden in the paddock when he knows he cant she fingered the edge of the map i havent actually told him about the garden he knows id like to bring my girls out here so they can see the horses walk on the forest or in the inclosures picnic by one pond or anotherbut i hadnt really gone further than that i thought id make a plan of it first you knowsketch it out robbie nodded its not a bad idea are these city girls then from winchester or southampton or the like no no theyd be from brockenhurst i mean theyd go to school in brockenhurstthe college or the comprehensivebut they could be from anywhere in the new forest i expect hmmm except theyd be from properties just like this some of them he noted so it wouldnt be that much of a diversion for them would it she frowned i hadnt thought of that she walked to the kitchen window it overlooked the driveway into the property and the west paddock beyond the driveway she said with a sigh all this landit seemed such a shame not to put it to good use depends on how you define good use robbie said as he spoke he looked round the kitchen it was bare of those items that had belonged to jemima her set of cookbooks her colourful wall hangings and on a shelf above the table her model horsessome of that collection which shed kept at her family home his own homewere gone in their place were propped a dozen antique postcards of the sort that predated greeting cards one for easter one for valentines day two for christmas etc they were not jemimas seeing these it came to robbie that meredith powell was correct in her surmise gordon jossie had wiped robbies sister completely from his life that wasnt unreasonable but having her car and her clothing was jossie wanted talking to there was no doubt of that chapter eight gordon lay in bed the next morning with the sweats come upon him and their source had nothing to do with the summer heat as it was earlyshortly after sixand the day was not yet baking hed suffered through another nightmare he always woke with a start a gasp for air a weight on his chest like a test for witchery and then the sweats these regularly drenched him the pyjamas he wore in winter and the bedsheets and when he was drenched he began to shiver which woke gina up as it had once awakened jemima their reactions were completely different though jemima always wanted answers to the whys why do you have nightmares why are you not talking to someone about them why havent you seen a doctor about the sweats there could be something wrong she told him a sleep disorder a lung disorder a weakness of the heartgod only knew but whatever the reason he needed to take an action because this kind of thing could kill him which was how jemima always thought people dying it was her greatest fear and no one needed to explain to him the reason for this his own fears were different but no less real to him than hers were to her and that was what life was like people had fears they learned to cope hed learned to cope with his and he didnt like to talk about them gina didnt require talking about them with gina when he woke with the sweats in the morning after a night shed spent with himwhich was most nights actually and there was really no point to her keeping her place in lyndhurst any longer was thereshe rose from the bed and went to the bathroom for a flannel which she dampened and then returned to use it upon his body she brought a bowl of cool water with her and when the flannel grew too hot from his skin she dipped it in the water and then used it against him again he wore nothing in summer when he went to bed so there were no clammy pyjamas to remove she smoothed the flannel against his limbs and his face and his chest and when he became aroused by this she smiled and she mounted him or she did other things equally pleasurable and when she did this every nightmare hed had sleeping or waking was forgotten and very nearly every thought he harboured was gone from his mind except one jemima gina asked nothing of him she merely wanted to love and be with him jemima on the other hand had asked the world she had ultimately asked the impossible and when hed explained why he could not give her what she asked for that had ended everything before jemima hed kept clear of women but when hed met her hed seen the light hearted girl that she presented to the world the funloving spirit with a childlike gap between her front teeth hed thought i need someone like this in my life but hed been wrong it hadnt yet been time and it probably never would be but here he was now with another woman as unlike jemima as was humanly possible he couldnt say he loved gina he knew he ought to love her as she was certainly worthy of any mans love when theyd first gone into the hotel in sway for a drink on the afternoon hed seen her up in the woods more than one bloke had looked her over and looked at him and he knew what each of them was thinking because one thought such things about gina dickens one couldnt help it and still be a human male gina didnt seem to mind she looked at him frankly in a way that said its yours if you want it when youre ready and when hed decided that by god he was ready because he couldnt live as hed been living with jemima gone hed accepted her offer and now here she was and he didnt regret his decision in the least she bathed him now and all the rest and if he took her forcefully instead of allowing himself to be taken by her that was fine with gina she gave a breathless laugh as he moved her roughly onto her back and her legs spread and then went round him he found her mouth and it opened to him like the rest of her and he wondered how hed got lucky just this once and what he would have to pay for his good fortune afterwards they both were soaking they separated and laughed at the sucking sound that came from damp skin disengaging from other damp skin they showered together and she washed his hair and when he became aroused again she said good lord gordon with a breathless laugh and she dealt with itwith himagain he said enough but she said not enough and she proved it to him his knees went weak he said whered you learn this woman and she said did jemima not like sex he said not like this and by that he meant wanton for jemima it had been reassurance love me dont leave me but she had done the leaving it was nearly eight when they went down to the kitchen for breakfast gina talked to him about her desire for a garden he didnt want a garden with all the unnecessary disruption it would bring to his life not to mention the laying of walks the arranging of borders the digging the planting the building of sheds or greenhouses or conservatories or whatever he didnt want any of it he hadnt told her as much because he liked the look of her as she went on about what a garden would mean to her to them and to her girls as she called them but then she also brought up rob hastings and what he had told her about the land gordon confirmed this but that was all he intended to say about rob the agister had tracked him down to the royal oak pub much as meredith powell had done and just as when meredith had shown her face gordon had told cliff to take a break so that whatever rob hastings had to say could be said out of earshot of anyone to make sure this was the case theyd walked up the lane to eyeworth pond which wasnt so much a pond as it was a damming of a longago stream upon which ducks now floated placidly and on whose banks willows crowded one upon the other and draped leafy branches into the water there was a small twotiered car park nearby and a path beyond it led into the wood where the ground was thick with decades of beech and chestnut leaves they walked to the edge of the pond gordon lit a cigarette and waited whatever rob hastings had to say it would be about jemima and he had nothing to tell him about jemima beyond that which rob obviously already knew she left because of her rob said didnt she the one at your house thats how it was eh i see youve been talking to meredith gordon felt weary with the fuss but jemima wouldnt want me to know about that rob hastings said following the line of conversation that hed established she wouldnt want me to know about gina owing to the shame of it all despite himself and his reluctance to discuss jemima gordon found this an interesting theory wrong as it was he said howd you reckon then rob like this she must have seen the two of you youdve been in ringwood maybe or even winchester or southampton if shed gone for supplies for the cupcake queen like she did on occasion shedve seen something that told her what was going on between the two of you and shedve left you because of it but she couldnt bring herself to tell me because of her pride and the shame of it all what shame being cheated on shed be shamed of that knowing id warned her from the first something wasnt right about you gordon flicked ash from his cigarette onto the ground and twisted the toe of his boot upon it never much liked me then you hid it well i would do after she took up with you anyways wouldnt i i wanted her to be happy and if you were the person making her happy who was i to make it clear i smelled something bad what would that something be you tell me gordon shook his head signaling not negation but the fact that it was hopeless to attempt to explain himself since robbie hastings would be unlikely to believe whatever he said he sought to elucidate this with when a bloke like youlike any bloke reallydoesnt like someone anything looks like a reason for it rob you know what i mean truth is i dont well i cant help you jemima left me full stop if anyone had someone else on the side id reckon itd be jemima cause it wasnt me whod you have before her then gor no one gordon said ever actually come on man yourewhat rob appeared to think it over thirtyone years old and youll have me think youd not had a woman before you had my sister thats exactly what id have you think because its the truth that you were a virgin that you come to her a blank slate where no other ladies namesve been written eh thats it rob robbie gordon could tell didnt believe a word of it you queer then gor he asked you a fallen catholic priest or something gordon glanced at him you sure you want to go this way rob whats that supposed to mean oh i think you know robs face flamed see she speculated about you now and again gordon said well she would do wouldnt she all things considered its a bit unusual bloke your age fortysomething eh dont make this about me nor about me gordon said any conversation along these lines would he knew proceed in circles so he ended it there what he had to tell robbie hastings was what robbie hastings had doubtless already heard from meredith powell even from jemima herself but he found out quickly enough that that was not going to satisfy jemimas brother she left because she didnt want to be with me any longer gordon said thats it and thats an end to the matter she was in a hurry because thats what she always was and you damn well know that she made up her mind in an instant and then she acted if she was hungry she ate if she was thirsty she drank if she decided she wanted a different sort of bloke no one was going to talk her out of it thats it in a nutshell gor thats how it is happens i dont believe you rob said happens i cant do anything about it but when robbie left him back at the royal oak to which theyd returned in a silence broken only by the sound of their footfalls on the stony verge and the crying of skylarks on the heath gordon found he wanted to make him believe because anything else meant exactly what happened the next morning while he and gina were saying their goodbyes for the day outside on the driveway by gordons pickup an austin pulled directly behind the old toyota out stepped a bloke in bottlethick spectacles with clipon sunglasses covering them he had on a tie but hed loosened it to hang from his neck he took off the clipon sunglasses as if this would allow him to see gordon and gina better he nodded knowingly and said ah gordon heard gina say his name in a questioning murmur and he said to her wait here hed got the door of the pickup open but he pushed it shut and walked over to the austin morning gordon the bloke said its going to be dead hot again isnt it it is that gordon replied he said nothing more because he reckoned things about the visitor would be made clear for him soon enough and so they were the man said affably we need to have a chat you and me meredith powell had phoned in ill to her place of employment going so far as to plug her nose in order to simulate a summer cold she didnt like doing this and she certainly didnt like the example it set for cammie who watched her with wideeyed curiosity from the kitchen table where shed been spooning cheerios into her mouth but thered seemed to be no alternative meredith had paid a call at the police station the prior afternoon and had got exactly nowhere the conversation had gone a route that had ended with her feeling a perfect fool what did she have to report that equated to grave suspicions and doubts her friend jemimas car in a barn on the property where shed lived with her partner for some two years jemimas clothes boxed up in the attic jemima with a new mobile phone to prevent gordon jossie from tracking her down and the cupcake queen deserted in ringwood none of this is like jemima dont you see had hardly impressed the plod shed spoken to at the brockenhurst station where shed stopped and asked to see someone on a matter of extreme urgency shed been given to a sergeant whose name she didnt recall and didnt want to recall and at the end of her tale hed enquired rather pointedly that couldnt it be madam that these people were merely going about their daily lives without reporting their movements to her because this was none of her business of course shed prompted this remark herself by admitting to the sergeant that robbie hastings had spoken to his sister regularly since her removal to london but still there had been no reason for the sergeant to look upon her as if shed been something unsavoury that hed found on the sole of his shoe she wasnt a busybody she was a concerned citizen and wasnt a concerned citizena taxpayer mind yousupposed to let the police know when something was off nothing sounds off to me the sergeant had said one woman leaves and this bloke jossie finds another hows that measure up to fishy eh way of the world you ask me and to her declaration of for gods sake hed told her to take her troubles to the main station in lyndhurst if she didnt like what she was getting from him well she wasnt about to put herself through that meredith decided shed phone the main station but that was all then she would take matters into her own hands she knew that something was going on out there and she had a fairly good idea where to begin digging to find it to do this she needed lexie streener so she made her phone call to the graphicdesign firm where she herself was employed talked about a rotten summer cold that she didnt want to pass on to the other employees and after offering a few artificial sneezes so that cammie would not suffer damage from this brief exposure to her mothers prevarication she set out to fetch lexie streener lexie hadnt needed the slightest persuading to take a day off from the hair salon where her future as the nicky clarke of ringwood wasnt exactly arriving on the wings of mercury her dad was off selling coffee tea biscuits and such from his caravan in a layby on the a and her mum was slipping tracts on the fourth beatitude under the windscreen wipers of cars waiting for the isle of wight ferries on lymington pier where she reckoned she had a captive audience who needed to hear about what constituted righteousness in the current world situation neither of them would have any way of knowing that lexie had done a runner from worknot that it mattered much to them anyway lexie grousedso it was no big deal for her to ring jean michels hair salon groan her way through an excuse of sicking up all night long after a bad beef burger and then ring off with a lemme get meself sorted to meredith getting sorted consisted of decking herself out in platform shoes lace tights a very short skirtshe definitely wouldnt want to be bending over meredith thoughtand a blouse whose empire waist suggested jane austen films or maternity wear this last bit was a nice touch indicating that lexie had somehow worked out merediths intentions these were devious but not illegal lexie was to play the role of a girl in dire need of serious mentoring one whose elder sisterthat would be meredithhad heard of a programme being run by a very nice young woman recently down from winchester i cant do a bloody thing with her and im that worried shell go off the rails if we dont take steps was the general line meredith planned to take and she planned to take that line first at brockenhurst college where girls just lexies age took themselves after leaving the comprehensive in the hope of learning something there that would lead to future employment rather than to the dole the college was just beyond the snake catcher pub on the lyndhurst road lexies role called for her to smoke and sulk and generally act uncooperative at risk for everything from pregnancy to stds to rampant heroin addiction although meredith would never have mentioned it to the girl the fact that her shortsleeved blouse revealed several cutting scars on her arms lent credence to the story they were concocting she managed to find a shady spot to leave the car and together she and lexie made their way across the baking tarmac to the administrative offices there they spoke to a harried secretary who was trying to meet the needs of a group of foreign students with limited english she said to meredith you want what and then you need to speak with monica pattersonhughes in nursing which suggested that she didnt quite understand what meredith was driving at with regard to her younger sisters situation but monica pattersonhughes being better than no one she and lexie went in search of such a person they found her demonstrating nappy changing to a group of adolescent girls who had the distinctly attentive look of future nannies they were quite intent upon a wornlooking cabbage patch doll that was being used for the demonstration evidently anatomically correct artificial infants were beyond the limited funding of the organisation we use actual infants in part two of the course monica pattersonhughes informed meredith upon stepping aside to let the future nannies loose upon the cabbage patch doll and were encouraging the use of cloth nappies again its all about bringing up baby green she looked at lexie are you wanting to enrol my dear its quite a popular course we have girls placed all over hampshire once they finish up youd have to rethink your appearancethe hairs just a bit over the topbut with guidance as to dressing and grooming you could go far if youve an interest of course lexie looked surly without prompting meredith took monica pattersonhughes aside it wasnt that she explained it was something quite different lexie here has gone a bit wild and im the responsible adult in her life and ive been told that theres a programme for girls just like lexie girls who need to be taken in hand by someone who sets an example for them takes an interest acts like an older sister which i of course am her older sister that is but sometimes a real older sister isnt the thing a younger sister wants to listen to especially a younger sister like lexie whos already been in a bit of troublewild boys and binge drinking and such meredith murmuredand who doesnt want to listen to someone she frankly considers a bloody preaching cow id heard of a programme she repeated hopefully a young lady down fromi believe it was winchesterwhos taking on troubled girls monica pattersonhughes frowned then she shook her head there was no such programme associated with the college nor did she know of one in the process of being set up girls at riskwell generally they were dealt with at a younger age werent they mightnt this programme be something more likely to come from the new forest district council lexie apparently getting quite into her role cooperatively snarled that she wasnt having nought to do wiv no fooking council and she brought out her cigarettes as if she meant to light up there in the classroom monica pattersonhughes looked suitably appalled she said my dear you cant to which lexie informed her shed damn well do what she bloody liked meredith thought this might be smearing things on a bit thick and she got her younger sister out of the classroom posthaste lexie crowed once they were outside she said tha was great fun that and wherere we off to next and ill talk bout me boyfriend at the next place what dyou think meredith wanted to tell her that a wee bit less drama would serve them better but lexie had few enough diversions in her life and if this little jaunt of theirs had the potential of supplying her with some excitement in the absence of such from her biblethumping parents that was fine by her so at the new forest district council officeswhich they found in lyndhurst in a u of buildings called appletree courtthey put on a performance of such conviction that they were immediately ushered into the presence of a social worker called dominic cheeters who brought them coffee and lemony ginger biscuits and seemed so eager to help that meredith felt a nagging sense of guilt that they were lying to the man but here too in the council offices they learned there was no programme being established for girls at risk and definitely no programme being established by one gina dickens from winchester dominic helpful to the core of his being even went to the trouble of phoning round various of his personal sources as he called them but the result was the same nothing so then he went further afield phoning the local education offices in southampton to see if they could be of help by this time meredith reckoned she knew that they could not help and such was the case the enterprise with lexie streener ate up most of her day as things turned out but meredith considered it time well spent she now had proof positive she decided that gina dickens was a flaming liar about her life in the new forest and meredith knew from personal experience that where a person told one lie dozens of others existed when he was alone again gordon whistled urgently for tess the dog came running shed been out on the property since early morning ultimately taking herself to her favourite shady spot beneath a climbing hydrangea on the north side of the cottage there she had a lair of beaten earth kept moist even on the hottest summer days he fetched the retrievers brush and tess gave him that loopy smile and wagged her tail she leapt up onto the shortlegged table he used for this purpose and he drew his stool near and began with her ears she needed a proper brushing daily anyway and now was a good time to do it he wanted a smoke but he didnt have any fags on him so he applied himself forcefully and rapidly to the brushing of the dog he felt tight from head to toe and he wanted to get loose and be easy he didnt know how to manage that so he brushed the dog and he brushed the dog theyd walked away from the car towards and ultimately into the barn gina would have wondered why but that couldnt be allowed to matter because gina was untouched like a lily growing out of an excrement heap and he meant to keep her that way so he left her standing in the driveway looking puzzled or frightened or concerned or anxious or whatever it was that a woman might feel when the man shes opened her heart to seems to be under the thumb of someone who could hurt him or hurt them both he brushed the dog and he brushed the dog he heard tess whine he was being too rough he eased the pressure he brushed the dog so theyd gone into the barn and before they got there gordon had tried to make it look as if the call from this stranger had to do with the land hed gestured here and there and that had amused the other chuckled understand your lady loves gone missing hed said once they were within the cooler confines of the barn but looks to mewith a wink and coarse gesture that he was meant to take as sexual and didlike youve no worries on that score shes a nice bit that one nicer than the other good firm thighs i expect strong as well other one was littler wasnt she what dyou want hed asked because ive work to do and so does gina and youre blocking the driveway that does make it a bit rough doesnt it me blocking the driveway whered the other go what other you know what i mean lad the grapevine tells me someones got their knickers twisted up over you wheres the other make the leap here with me gordon i know you can hed had no choice but to tell him jemima leaving the new forest without her car for god knows what reason leaving most of her belongings as well because if he didnt tell that he knew damn well it would come out anyway and thered be hell to pay just took herself off you say hed asked thats what happened why you not doing the job on her proper gordon fine strapping man like you man with all the right parts in all the right places i dont know why she left the other examined him he took off his glasses and polished them on a special cloth he removed from his pocket dont give me that one he said and his tone of voice was no longer the spuriously jovial one hed used before but was now rather icy the way a blade is icy if someone presses it against hot skin dont you be playing me for a fool i dont like hearing your name come up in general conversation makes me feel dead uneasy it does so you still want to say she just left you and you dont know why ill not have that gordons worry had been that gina would come into the barn that she would want to know or to help to intercede or to protect for that was her nature she said she couldnt cope gordon said all right she said she couldnt cope with what and then hed smiled slowly no humour in it but there wouldnt have been cope with what my love hed repeated you bloody well know said between his teeth ahnow dont get cheeky with me lad cheekiness it doesnt become you chapter nine the stoke newington housetohouse turned up nothing as did the perimeter search of the environs of the chapel and gridding off the whole blooming cemetery and conducting a search that way they had enough manpower to carry it all offboth from the local station and from officers on loan from other areasbut the end result was no witness no weapon no handbag no shoulder bag no purse and no identification just an admirable rubbish cleanup of the cemetery on the other hand theyd had phone calls aplenty and a description shuffled to so had actually produced a possible lead in this they were assisted by the fact that the body in question had unusual eyes one green and one brown once they plugged that into the computer the field of missing persons narrowed down to one shed been reported as having disappeared from her lodgings in putney and it was to putney that barbara havers was sent two days after the discovery of the body specifically she was sent to oxford road which was equidistant from putney high street and wandsworth park there she parked illegally in a residentsonly space propped a police id in plain sight and rang the bell on a terrace house whose front garden appeared to be the streets recycling centre if the bins and plastic containers were anything to go by she was admitted to the house by an older woman with a military haircut and a bit of a military moustache she wore exercise clothing and pristine white trainers done up with pink and purple laces she said that she was bella mchaggis and it was bloody well time a copd shown up and was this sort of incompetence what her taxes paid for and the bloody government cant do a thing right can they because just look at the condition of the streets not to mention the underground and shed phoned the cops two days ago and blah blah blah barbara thought while bella mchaggis gave vent to her feelings she herself had a look round the place uncarpeted wood floor hall stand with umbrellas and coats and on the wall a framed document announcing itself as house rules for occupants with a sign saying landlady on premises posted beneath it with lodgers one cant bang on about the rules enough bella mchaggis asserted ive got them everywhere the rules that is it helps i find if people know whats what she led barbara into a dining room through a large kitchen and into a sitting room at the back of the house there she announced that her lodgerwho was called jemima hastingshad gone missing and if the body that had been found in abney park had one brown eye and one green eyehere bella stopped she seemed to try to read barbaras face barbara said have you got a picture of the young lady yes yes indeed bella said she said to come this way and she led barbara out of a door on the far side of the sitting room which took them to a narrow corridor that ran in the direction of the front door of the house to one side of this corridor the reverse side of a staircase rose and facing them beneath it was a door otherwise hidden from anyone entering the building on this door was a poster the lighting was dim but barbara could see that the poster featured a blackandwhite photograph of a young woman light hair blowing across her face she was sharing the picture with threequarters of a lions head somewhat out of focus behind her the lion was male marble slightly streaked from weather and asleep the poster itself was an advertisement for the cadbury photographic portrait of the year evidently it was some sort of contest and its winners comprised an ongoing show at the national portrait gallery in trafalgar square so is it jemima bella mchaggis said its not like her to be gone without telling any of us when i saw the story in the evening standard i reckoned if the girl had eyes like thosetwo different colours her words tapered off as barbara turned to her id like to see her room barbara said bella mchaggis made a small sound something between a sigh and a cry barbara saw that she was a decent soul she said im not actually sure mrs mchaggis its just that they become rather like family bella said most of my lodgers youve others then ill want to speak with them theyre not here at present at work you know therere just two of them beyond jemima that is young men they are quite nice young men any possibility she could have been involved with either of them bella shook her head against the rules i find its not a good thing if my gentlemen and ladies begin keeping company while living under the same roof i had no rule about it at first once mr mchaggis died and i started with lodgers but i found she looked at the poster on the door i found things became unnecessarily complicated if the lodgersshall we say if they fraternized unspoken tensions the possibility of breakups jealousy tears rows over the breakfast table so i made the rule and how do you know if the lodgers abide by it believe me bella said i know barbara wondered if this meant an examination of the bedsheets but jemima was acquainted with the male lodgers i assume course she knew paolo best i expect he brought her here thats paolo di fazio born in italy but you wouldnt know it no accent at all and nowell no odd italian habits if you know what i mean barbara didnt but she nodded helpfully she wondered what odd italian habits might be putting tomato sauce on the weetabix room nearest to hers bella was saying she worked in a shop somewhere round covent garden and paolo has a stall in jubilee market hall i had a vacant room i wanted a lodger i hoped for another female he knew she was looking for permanent lodgings and your other lodger frazer chaplin hes got the basement flat she nodded at the door on which the poster hung so thats his the poster no thats just the way to his flat she brought the poster to me jemima did i suppose she wasnt altogether happy that i hung it here where its out of sight butwell there you have it there wasnt really another suitable space barbara wondered about that it seemed to her that there was space aplenty even with the plethora of signs depicting the household rules she gave the poster a final quick glance before asking once again to see jemima hastings room she looked like the young woman whose autopsy pictures barbara had seen isabelle ardery put up only that morning in the incident room but it was as always incredible to see the difference between someone in life and someone in death she followed bella to the next floor where jemima had a bedroom at the front of the house paolos room was just along the corridor at the back bella said while her own room was yet another floor above she opened the door to jemimas room it had not been locked and there was no key stuck in the keyhole on the inside but that was not to say there wouldnt be a key somewhere in the room barbara saw although it would be a challenge worthy of hercules in the augean stables to find it she was something of a hoarder bella said which was like declaring that noah was something of a rowingboat builder barbara had never seen such clutter the room was a nice size but it contained masses of belongings clothes strewn on the unmade bed and across the floor and drooping from drawers in the chest magazines and tabloids and maps and brochures and handouts from people in the street decks of playing cards mingling with business cards and postcards stacks of photographs bound with rubber bands how long did she live here barbara asked it was inconceivable to her that one person could amass so much clobber in anything less than five solid years nearly seven months bella said i did speak to her about this she said shed get round to it but i think barbara looked at the woman bella was pulling thoughtfully at her lower lip what barbara asked i think it gave her some sort of comfort at the end of the day i daresay she couldnt let any of it go yeah well barbara gave a sigh all of its got to be gone through she dug out her mobile and flipped it open im going to have to ring for backup she told bella lynley used the car as an excuse because that was the easiest thing to tell both himself and charlie denton not that he generally told denton where he was going but he knew the young man had not yet stopped worrying about his state of mind so he popped into the kitchen where denton was applying his considerable culinary skills to making a marinade for a piece of fish and he said im off for a bit charlie over to chelsea for an hour or so and he didnt miss the look of delight that briefly touched on the others features chelsea could mean a hundred different destinations but denton would reckon there was only a single one that was taking lynley out of belgravia lynley added thought id show off the new motor and denton said mind how you go then you dont want anything marring that paint job lynley promised hed do whatever was necessary to prevent such a tragedy and he walked to the mews where he kept the car that hed finally bought to replace his bentley which had been reduced to a tangle of metallic rubble five months earlier at the hands of barbara havers he unlocked the garage and there it was and the truth of the matter was that he did feel the slightest thrill of ownership to look upon the copper beauty of the thing four wheels and it was only transportation but there was transportation and there was transportation and this was definitely transportation owning the healey elliott gave him something to think about when he was driving besides thinking of the subjects he didnt want to think about that had been one of the reasons hed purchased it one had to consider issues like where to park it and which route to choose from point a to point b in order to keep it safe from runins with cyclists taxis buses and pedestrians pulling wheeled suitcases without a mind for where they were going then there was the critical issue of keeping it clean of keeping it well within sight when parking it in a slightly less than salubrious area of keeping its oil pristine and its spark plugs practically sterilized and its wheels balanced and its tyres filled to the appropriate degree it was thus a vintage english car like all vintage english cars it required constant vigilance and just as much maintenance in short it was exactly what he required at this juncture in his life the distance from belgravia to chelsea was so minimal that he could have walked it no matter the heat and the crowds of shoppers along the kings road less than ten minutes from the moment he closed the front door of his house he was crawling along cheyne row in the hope of finding a spot to park near to the corner of lordship place as luck would have it a spot was vacated by a van making a delivery to the kings head and eight bells as he approached the pub he was at last walking towards the tall brick house on the corner of lordship place and cheyne row when he heard his name called out by a womans voice crying tommy hullo this came from the direction of the pub where he saw his friends were just rounding the corner from cheyne walk and the embankment beyond it likely theyd been for a walk along the river he decided for simon st james was carrying their doga longhaired dachshund who hated the heat as much as she hated walkiesand his wife deborah was at his side her hand through his arm and a pair of sandals dangling from her fingers isnt the pavement hot on your feet he called back absolutely horrible she admitted cheerfully i wanted simon to carry me but given the choice between peach and myself the wretch chose peach divorce is the only answer lynley said they came up to him then and peachrecognising him as she would dosquirmed to be put down so that she could jump up and demand to be held again she barked wagged her tail and jumped a few more times as lynley shook st jamess hand and accepted deborahs fierce hug he said hullo deb against her hair she said oh tommy in reply and then stepping back and scooping up the dachshund who continued to writhe bark and demand to be noticed youre looking very well its so good to see you simon doesnt tommy look well almost as well as the car st james had gone to have a look at the healey elliott he gave an admiring whistle have you brought it by to gloat he said to lynley my god its a beauty nineteen fortyeight isnt it st james had long been a lover of vintage cars and himself drove an old mg modified to cope with his braced left leg it was a td classic circa but the age of the healey elliott along with its shape made it rare and a virtual eyeful st james shook his headdark hair overlong as always and doubtless deborah was banging on daily about his need for a haircutand gave a long sigh whered you find it he asked exeter lynley said i saw it advertised poor bloke spent years of his life restoring it but his wife considered it a rival and who can blame her deborah said pointedly and wouldnt let go of the matter till hed sold it complete madness st james murmured yes well there i was with cash in hand and a healey elliott in front of me you know weve been to ranelagh gardens having a chat about some new adoption possibilities st james said to lynley thats where we were coming from just now but truth to tell babies be damned id like to adopt this motor instead lynley laughed simon deborah protested men will be men my love st james told her and then to lynley how longve you been back tommy come inside we were just talking about a pimms in the garden will you join us why else live in summer lynley replied he followed them into the house where deborah placed the dog on the floor and peach headed towards the kitchen in the eternal dachshund search for food two weeks he said to st james two weeks deborah said and youve not phoned tommy does anyone else know youre back dentons not killed the fatted calf for the neighbourhood if thats what youre asking lynley said dryly but thats at my request hed have hired skywriters if id allowed it he must be glad youre home were glad youre home youre meant to be home deborah clasped his hand briefly and then called out to her father she threw her sandals at the base of a coat rack said over her shoulder ill ask dad to do us that pimms shall i and went in the same direction as the dog down to the basement kitchen at the back of the house lynley watched her go realising hed lost touch with what it was like to be around a woman he knew well deborah st james was nothing like helen but she matched her in energy and liveliness that understanding brought with it sudden pain briefly it took his breath lets go outside shall we st james said lynley saw how well his old friend read him thank you he said they found a place beneath the ornamental cherry tree where worn wicker furniture sat round a table there deborah joined them she carried a tray on which shed placed a jug of pimms a bucket of ice and glasses displaying the requisite spears of cucumber peach followed her and in her wake came the st jameses great grey cat alaska who immediately took up slinking along the herbaceous border in pursuit of imagined rodents around them were the sounds of chelsea in summer distant cars roaring along the embankment the twittering of sparrows in the trees people calling out from the garden next door on the air the scent of a barbecue rose and the sun continued to bake the ground ive had an unexpected visitor lynley said acting superintendent isabelle ardery he told them the substance of his visit from ardery her request and his indecision what will you do st james asked you know tommy it might be time lynley looked beyond his friends to the flowers that comprised the herbaceous border at the base of the old brick wall defining the edge of the garden someonelikely deborahhad been giving them a great deal of care likely by recycling the washingup water they looked better this year than they had in the past bursting with life and colour he said i managed to cope with the nursery at howenstow and her country clothing some of the nursery here as well but ive not been able to face her things in london i thought i might be ready when i arrived two weeks ago but it seems im not he took a drink of his pimms and gazed at the garden wall on which clematis climbed in a mass of lavender blooms its all still there in the wardrobe and the chest of drawers in the bathroom as well cosmetics her scent bottles the hairbrush still has strands of her hairit was so dark you know with bits of auburn yes st james said lynley heard it in simons voice the terrible grief that st james would not express believing as he did that by rights lynleys own grief was so much greater and this despite the fact that st james too had loved helen dearly and had once intended to marry her he said my god simon but st james interrupted youre going to have to give it time he said do deborah said and she looked between them and in this lynley saw that she too knew and he thought of the ways one mindless act of violence had touched on so many people and three of them sat there in the summer garden each of them reluctant to say her name the door from the basement kitchen opened and they turned to anticipate whoever was about to come out this turned out to be deborahs father who had long run the household and just as long been an aide to st james lynley thought at first he meant to join them but instead joseph cotter said more company luv to his daughter was wondering he inclined his head a fraction towards lynley lynley said dont please turn someone away on my account joseph fair enough cotter said and to deborah cept i thought his lordship might not want why who is it deborah asked detective sergeant havers he said not sure what she wants luv but shes asking for you the last person barbara expected to see in the back garden of the st james home was her erstwhile partner but there he was and it took her only a second to process it the amazing motor out in the street had to be his it made perfect sense he suited the car and the car suited him lynley looked much better than when shed last seen him two months earlier in cornwall then hed been the walking wounded now he looked more like the walking contemplative she said to him sir are you back as in back or are you just back lynley smiled at the moment im merely back oh she was disappointed and she knew her face showed it well she said one step at a time you finished the cornwall walk i did he said without further incident deborah offered barbara a pimms which barbara would have loved to toss back either that or pour over her head because the day was broiling her inside her clothing and she was cursing di ardery once again for directing her to alter her manner of dress this was just the sort of weather that called for drawstring trousers in linen and a very loose tshirt not for a skirt tights and a blouse courtesy of another shopping event with hadiyyah this one more quickly accomplished because hadiyyah was persistent and barbara was if not amenable to hadiyyahs persistence then at least detrited by hadiyyahs persistence the small favour for which barbara thanked god was that her young friend had chosen a blouse without a pussy bow she said to deborah ta but im on duty this is a police call actually is it deborah looked at her husband and then at barbara are you wanting simon then you actually there was a fourth chair near the table and barbara took it she was acutely aware of lynleys eyes on her and she knew what he was thinking because she knew him she said to him under orders more or less well more like under serious advice you can believe i wouldntve otherwise he said ah i did wonder whose orders more or less the newest contestant for webberlys old job she didnt much like the way i looked unprofessional she told me she advised me to do some serious shopping i see woman from maidstone she is isabelle ardery she was that the di from arson you remember well done anyway it was her idea that i ought to lookwhatever this is how i look i see pardon me for asking barbara but are you wearing he was far too polite to go further and barbara knew it makeup she asked is it running down my face what with the heat and the fact that ive not the first clue how to put the bloody stuff on you look lovely barbara deborah was merely being supportive barbara knew because she herself wore nothing at all on her freckled skin and her hair unlike barbaras own comprised masses of red curls that suited her even in their habitual disarray cheers barbara said but i look like a clown and theres more to come i wont go into it though she heaved her shoulder bag onto her lap and blew a breath upward to cool her face she was carrying rolled beneath her arm a second poster from the cadbury photographic portrait of the year exhibition this one had been tacked to the back of the bedroom door belonging to jemima hastings which barbara had seen once shed shut that door to get a better look at the room the ambient light had afforded her the opportunity to study both the portrait and the information written beneath it that information had brought barbara to chelsea she said ive got something here that id like you to take a look at and she unrolled the poster for deborahs inspection deborah smiled when she saw what it was have you been to the portrait gallery for the show then she went on to speak to lynley telling him what hed missed in his time away from london a photographic competition in which her entry had been selected as one of the six pictures used for marketing the resulting exhibition its still on at the gallery deborah said i didnt win the competition was deadly but it was brilliant to be among the final sixty chosen to be hung and then shewith a nod at the picturewas selected to be on posters and postcards sold in the gift shop i was quite over the moon about that wasnt i simon deborahs had some phone calls st james told them from people wanting to see her work deborah laughed hes being far too kind it was one phone call from a bloke asking me if im interested in doing photo shoots of food for a cookbook his wife is writing sounds good to me barbara noted but then anything involving food you know well done deborah lynley leaned forward and looked at the poster whos the model shes called jemima hastings barbara told him and to deborah how did you meet her deborah said sidneysimons sisteri was looking for a model for the portrait contest and id thought at first that sidney would be perfect with all the modeling she does i did try with her but the result was too professional lookingsomething about the way sidney deals with facing a camera with showing off clothing instead of being a subject anyway i wasnt happy with it and i was casting about afterwards still looking for someone when sidney showed up with jemima in tow deborah frowned obviously putting any number of things together at once she said in a cautious voice whats this about barbara the models been murdered im afraid this poster was in her lodgings murdered deborah said lynley and st james both stirred in their chairs murdered barbara when where barbara told her the other three exchanged looks and barbara said what do you know something abney park deborah was the one to reply thats where i took the picture in the first place thats where this is she indicated the weatherstreaked lion whose head filled the frame to the left of the model this is one of the memorials in the cemetery jemima had never been there before we took the picture she told us as much us sidney went as well she wanted to watch got it well she went back barbara said jemima did she sketched a few more details just enough to put them all in the picture she said to simon where is she these days were going to need to speak to her sidney shes living in bethnal green near columbia road the flower market deborah added helpfully with her latest partner simon said dryly mothernot to mention sidis hoping this will also be her final partner but frankly its not looking that way well she does rather like them dark and dangerous deborah noted to her husband having been affected in adolescence by a plethora of romance novels yes i know ill need her address barbara told him i hope you dont think sid you know the drill every avenue and all that she rolled the poster back up and looked among them certainly there was something going on she said beyond meeting her with sidney and then taking the picture did you see her again she came to the opening at the portrait gallery all the subjectsthe modelswere invited to do that anything happen there deborah looked at her husband as if seeking information he shook his head and shrugged she said no not that iwell i think she had a bit too much champagne but she had a man with her who saw she got home thats really all a man do you know his name ive forgotten actually i didnt think id need tosimon do you remember just that he was dark and i remember that mostly he hesitated clearly reluctant to complete the thought barbara did it for him because of sidney you said she likes them dark didnt you bella mchaggis had never before been placed in the position of having to identify a body shed seen dead bodies of course shed even in the case of the departed mr mchaggis doctored the setting in which death had occurred so as to protect the poor mans reputation prior to phoning but shed never been ushered into a viewing room where a victim of violent death lay covered by a sheet now that she had done she was more than ready to engage in whatever sort of activity would scour from her mind the mental image jemima hastingsnot a single doubt that it was jemimahad been stretched out on a trolley with her neck wrapped up in thick swathes of gauze like a winter scarf as if she needed protection from the chilly room from that bella had concluded the girl had had her throat cut and shed asked if this was the case but the answer had come in the form of a question do you recognise yes yes bella had said abruptly of course its jemima shed known the minute that woman officer had come to her house and had peered at that poster the policewomanbella couldnt remember her name at the momenthadnt been able to keep her expression blank and bella had known that the girl in the cemetery was indeed the lodger gone missing from her house so to wipe it all away bella became industrious she could have gone to a session of hot yoga but she reckoned industry was the better ticket it would get her mind away from the mental picture of poor dead jemima on that cold steel trolley at the same time as it would prepare jemimas room for another lodger now the cops had carted away all her belongings and bella wanted another lodger soon although she had to admit that she hadnt had very much luck with the female variety still she wanted a woman she liked the sense of balance another woman gave to the household though women were far more complicated than men and even as she considered this she wondered if perhaps another male would keep things simpler and prevent the males already in place from preening so preening and strutting thats what they did they did it unconsciously like roosters like peacocks like virtually every male from every species on earth the calculated dance of noticeme was something bella generally found rather amusing but she realised that she had to consider whether it might be easier on everyone concerned if she removed from their household the necessity for it upon her return from viewing jemimas body shed put up her room to let sign in the dining room window and shed made her phone call to loot to run the advertisement then shed gone up to jemimas room and shed begun a thorough clean with the boxes and boxes and boxes of her belongings already removed from the house this was a job that didnt take long hoovering dusting changing sheets an application of furniture polish a beautifully washed windowbella prided herself particularly on the state of her windowsscented drawer liners removed from the chest and new ones placed there curtains taken down for cleaning every piece of furniture moved away from the wall to give the hoover accessno one bella thought cleaned a room the way she did she moved on to the bathroom generally she left their bathrooms to her lodgers but if she was going to have a new lodger soon it stood to reason that jemimas drawers and shelves were going to have to be emptied of anything left behind by the police theyd not removed every item from the bathroom since not everything within had belonged to jemima so bella concentrated on straightening the room as she cleaned it which was why she foundnot in jemimas drawer but in the top drawer marked for the other lodgera curious item that certainly did not belong there it was the result of a pregnancy test bella knew that the second she clapped her eyes on it what she didnt know was whether the result was positive or negative being of an age at which she would of course never have used such a test herself her own childrenlong gone to detroit and to buenos aireshad announced their conception in the oldfashioned manner of wracking her body with morning sickness almost from the instant of spermmeetsegg which itself had been achieved in the oldfashioned manner thank you very much mr mchaggis so bella retrieving the incriminating plastic tab from the drawer wasnt sure about what the indicator meant blue line was that negative positive she would have to find out she would also have to find out what it was doing in the drawer of her other lodger because surely he hadnt brought it home from a celebratory dinneror what was more likely a confrontational cup of coffeewith the mothertobe if a woman hed been bonking had fallen pregnant and had presented him with the evidence why would he keep it a souvenir certainly the coming infant was going to be souvenir enough no it stood to reason that the pregnancy test was jemimas and if it hadnt been in jemimas belongings or with jemimas rubbish there was a reason there seemed several possibilities but the one that bella didnt want to consider was the one telling her that once again two of her lodgers had pulled the wool over her eyes about what was going on between them bloody hell damn bella thought she had rules they were everywhere they were signed and sealed and delivered in the contract she made each lodger read and affix his or her name to the bottom of were young people so randy that they couldnt stop themselves from jumping in and out of each others knickers at the first opportunity despite her very clear rules about fraternizing with other members of the household it appeared they were it appeared they could not someone she decided was going to be talked to bella was going through the mental preparation for such a conversation when the bell went on the front door down below she gathered up her cleaning supplies removed her marigolds and huffed down the stairs the bell rang again and she shouted coming and she opened it to see a girl on her porch rucksack at her feet hopeful expression on her face she didnt look english to bella and when she spoke her voice gave her away as someone from what had once probably been czechoslovakia but was now any one of a number of countries with many syllables even more consonants and few vowels because bella could not keep track of them and no longer tried you have room the girl said hopefully gesturing in the direction of the dining room window where the roomtolet sign was displayed i see your notice there bella was about to tell her yes she had a room to let and how are you at obeying rules missy but her attention shifted to movement on the pavement as someone dodged behind what shrubbery managed to grow in her front garden among the plethora of recycling bins it was a woman moving out of sight a woman in a tailored wool suit despite the heat with a brightly patterned scarfher sodding trademark that was bella thoughtfolded into a band and holding back masses of dyed orange hair you bella shouted at her im ringing the cops i am youve been bloody told to stay away from this house and this is the limit whether the activity was going to eat up time or notand barbara havers knew which alternative was actually the casethere was no way she was going to face the sister of simon st james in her current getup and with her face attempting to divest itself of its smear of makeup through the means of excessive perspiration so instead of heading from chelsea directly to bethnal green she drove home to chalk farm first she scrubbed her face breathed a sigh of relief and decided to compromise with the weeest bit of blusher she then went for a change of apparelhallelujah to drawstring trousers and tshirtsand having thus resumed her normal state of dishabille she was ready to face sidney st james her conversation with sidney was not effected immediately however upon leaving her tiny bungalow barbara heard her name called out by hadiyyah crying from above hullo oh hullo barbara as if she hadnt seen her in an eon or so the little girl went on enthusiastically with mrs silver is teaching me how to polish silver today and barbara followed the sound of the voice to see hadiyyah hanging out of a window on the second floor of the big house were using baking powder barbara she announced and then she turned as someone within the flat said something to which the little girl corrected herself with oh baking soda barbara course mrs silver doesnt ackshully have any silver so were using her cutlery but it makes the cutlery shine so isnt that brilliant barbara whyve you not got on your new skirt end of day kiddo barbara said its mufti time and are you hadiyyahs attention was caught by something beyond barbaras line of vision because she interrupted herself with dad dad hullo hullo shll i come home now she sounded even more enthusiastic about this prospect than she had about seeing barbara which gave barbara an idea of how much the little girl was actually enjoying learning yet another of mrs silvers housewifely skills as she called them so far in the summer theyd done starching ironing dusting hoovering removing scale from toilet bowls and learning the myriad uses of white vinegar all of which hadiyyah had obediently mastered and then dutifully reported to barbara and demonstrated either for her or for her father but the bloom had faded from the rose of acquiring domestic skillshow could it be otherwise barbara thoughtand while hadiyyah was far too polite to complain to the elderly woman who could blame her for embracing the thought of escape with a joy that daily increased barbara heard taymullah azhars response muted from the direction of the street hadiyyahs hand fluttered in farewell to barbara she disappeared within the flat and barbara herself continued down the path that followed the side of the house emerging from beneath an arbour fragrant with star jasmine to see hadiyyahs father coming through the front gate several carrier bags dangling from one hand and his worn leather briefcase in the other polishing silver barbara said to him by way of greeting id no idea baking soda worked a trick on tarnish you azhar chuckled there appears to be no end to the domestic knowledge of that good woman had i had it in mind that hadiyyah should spend her life in housekeeping i could not have found her a better instructor shes quite mastered scones by the way have i mentioned that he gestured with the hand that held the carrier bags will you join us for dinner barbara its chicken jalfrezi with pilau rice and as i recallwith a smile that showed the sort of white teeth that made barbara swear she would see the dentist in the near futurethose are among your favourites barbara told her neighbour she was sorely tempted but duty called just on my way out she said both of them turned as the front door of the old house opened and hadiyyah clattered down the steps she was followed closely by mrs silver tall and angular ensconced in an apron sheila silver barbara had learned from hadiyyah possessed an entire wardrobe of aprons they were not only seasonal they were celebratory as well she had christmas aprons easter aprons halloween aprons new years aprons birthday aprons and aprons commemorating everything from guy fawkes night to the illfated marriage of charles and diana each of these was complemented by a matching turban barbara reckoned the turbans had been fashioned from tea towels by their wearer and she had little doubt that when the list of housewifely duties had been mastered by hadiyyah turban making would be among them as hadiyyah flung herself in the direction of her father barbara waved a farewell her last sight of them was of hadiyyaharms round azhars slender waistand mrs silver in gangly pursuit of her as if the girls escape had been preemptive and more information about baking soda needed to be imparted in her car barbara gave a thought to the time of day and concluded that only a bout of creative rat running would get her to bethnal green before nightfall she skirted as much of the city as she could ultimately coming on bethnal green from old street this was an area that had altered much over the years as young professionals unable to afford the prices of central londons housing moved in an everwidening circle to embrace parts of town long considered undesirable bethnal green was hence a combination of the old and the new where sari shops mingled with computer sales centres and ethnic enterprises like henna weddings stood next door to estate agents flogging properties to growing families sidney lived in quilter street a terrace of plainfronted houses constructed of london brick a mere two storeys tall they comprised the south side of a triangle at the centre of which was a common area called jesus green unlike so many small parks in town this one was neither locked nor barred it was fenced in wrought iron which was typical of londons squares but the fence was only waist high and its gate stood open to admit anyone who wanted access to its wide lawn and to the pools of shade offered by the leafy trees that towered over it children were playing noisily on the green near to where barbara parked her old mini in one corner a family was having a picnic and in another a guitarist was entertaining a young adoring female it was a very good place to escape the heat sidney answered the door to barbaras knock and barbara tried not to feel what she indeed was in the presence of st jamess younger sister a frightening contrast sidney was quite tall she was slender and she was naturally in possession of the sort of cheekbones that women happily went under the knife to acquire she had the same coalcoloured hair as her brother and the same bluetodayandgreytomorrow eyes she was wearing capris which emphasised legs that went from here to china and a cropped tank top that showed off her arms disgustingly tan like the rest of her large hoop earrings dangled from her ears and she was removing them as she said barbara i expect the traffic was a nightmare wasnt it and admitted her into the house this was small all the windows were open but that was doing little to mitigate the heat inside sidney appeared to be one of those loathsome women who did not perspire but barbara was not among their number and she could feel the sweat popping out on her face the moment the front door closed behind her sidney said sympathetically terrible isnt it we complain and complain about the rain and then we get this there should be some middle ground but there never is im just this way if you dont mind just this way turned out to be a staircase this rose towards the back of the little house where a door stood open to a small garden from which the sound of vicious pounding was emanating sidney went to the door saying over her shoulder to barbara thats just matt and into the garden matt darling come and meet barbara havers barbara looked past her to see a manburly shirtless and sweatingwho was standing with sledgehammer in hand apparently in the process of beating a sheet of plywood into submission there seemed to be no reason for this unless barbara thought he was going for a rather inefficient means of creating mulch for the single sunparched herbaceous border at sidneys call he didnt stop what he was doing rather he glanced over his shoulder and nodded curtly he was wearing dark glasses and his ears were pierced his head was shaved to the skull and like the rest of him it shone with sweat gorgeous isnt he sidney murmured it wouldnt have been barbaras word of choice whats he doing exactly she said letting it out what hmmm sidney gazed at the man appreciatively he didnt appear particularly handsome but he had a body completely defined by muscle an eyecatching chest narrow waist serious lats and a bum that would have got him pinched just about anywhere on the planet oh aggression hes letting it out he hates it when hes not working unemployed is he good heavens no he doesoh something or other for the government come up above barbara dyou mind if we talk in the bathroom i was giving myself a facial is it all right if i get on with it barbara said it was fine by her shed never seen a facial being given and now that she was on her relentless course of selfimprovement who knew what tips she might pick up from a woman whod been a professional model since she was seventeen as she followed sidney up the stairs she said like what matt sidney clarified its all top secret according to him i expect hes a spy or something he wont say but he goes off for days or weeks and when he comes home he fetches the plywood and beats the dickens out of it hes between jobs at the moment she glanced back in the direction of the pounding concluding with a casual matthew jones man of mystery jones barbara noted interesting name its probably his whateverhis cover eh makes it all rather exciting dont you think what barbara thought was that sharing lodgings and a bed with someone who pounded upon wood with a sledgehammer possessed shady employment and had a name that might or might not be his own was akin to playing russian roulette with a rusty colt but she kept that to herself everyones boat floated on different water and if the bloke below rang sidneys chimesnot to mix too many metaphors barbara thoughtthen who was she to point out that men of mystery were frequently men of mystery for reasons having nothing at all to do with james bond sidney had three brothers who were doubtless doing their share of pointing that out to her she followed sidney into the bathroom where an impressive lineup of jars and bottles awaited them sidney began with the removal of her makeup chattily explaining the processi like to tone first before i exfoliate how often dyou exfoliate barbaraas she went along barbara murmured appropriate responses although toning sounded like something one did in a gym and exfoliating surely had to do with gardening didnt it when sidney at last had smoothed on a maskmy t zone is just bloody murder she confessedbarbara brought up the reason for her journey to bethnal green she said deborah tells me you introduced jemima hastings to her sidney acknowledged this then she said it was her eyes id posed for deborahfor the portrait gallery competition you knowbut when the pictures werent what she wanted i thought of jemima because of her eyes barbara asked how shed come to be acquainted with the young woman and sidney said cigars matt likes havanasgod they smell awfuland id gone there to get him one i remembered her later because of her eyes and i reckoned shed make an interesting face for deborahs portrait so i went back and asked her and then took her along to meet deborah went back where oh sorry to covent garden theres a tobacconist in one of the courtyards round the corner from jubilee market hall its got cigars pipe tobacco snuff pipes cigarette holdersall the bits one associates with smoking matt and i stopped there one afternoon which is how i knew where it was and what he bought now whenever hes due back from one of his manofmystery jaunts i pop in and get him a welcomehome cigar bleagh barbara thought she was a smoker herselfalways intending to give it up although never quite intending enoughbut she drew the line at anything whose scent reminded her of burning dog poo sidney was saying anyway deborah quite liked the look of her when i introduced them so she asked her to pose why are you looking for her shes dead barbara said she was murdered in abney park cemetery sidneys eyes darkened exactly as her brothers did when he was struck by something barbara thought sidney said oh lord shes the woman in the paper isnt she ive seen the daily mail and when barbara confirmed this sidney went on she was the sort of woman who chatted compulsivelyutterly unlike simon whose reserve was sometimes completely unnervingand she sketched in every relevant and irrelevant detail pertaining to jemima hastings and deborah st jamess photograph of her sidney couldnt make out why deborah had chosen abney park cemetery as it wasnt exactly easy to get to but you know deborah when she set her mind to something there was no suggesting an alternative shed apparently scouted locations for weeks in advance of the photo shoot and shed read about the cemeterysomething to do with conservation sidney wondered aloudand had done an initial recce there where shed found the sleeping lion monument and decided it was just the thing she wanted for background in the photo as it turned out sidney had accompanied deborah and jemimai admit it i was a bit put out that my photo hadnt suited you knowand shed watched the subsequent photo shoot wondering why she had failed as a subject for the portrait where jemima was possibly going to succeed as a professional you know one needs to knowif im losing my edge i must get on top of my game right barbara agreed she asked had sidney seen anything that day in the cemetery had she noticed anythingdid she remember anything something unusual had anyone watched the photo shoot for example well yes of course there were always peopleand lots of men if it came down to it only sidney couldnt remember any of them because it had been ages ago and shed certainly not thought that shed have to remember and god it was dreadful that deborahs picture might have been the meansi mean wasnt it possible that someone had tracked down jemima by using that picture had found jemima had followed her to that cemeteryexcept what was she doing there did they knowor perhaps someone had kidnapped her and taken her there and how had she died who it was matt jones speaking somehow hed come silently up the stairsbarbara wondered when hed ceased pounding on the plywood and how long hed been listeningand he was a looming sweating presence in the bathroom doorway which he filled up in a fashion that barbara would have called menacing had she not also wanted to call it curious close to him now she had a sense of both danger and anger emanating from him he was sort of a mr rochester type had mr rochester been in possession of heavy weaponry in the attic and not a mad wife sidney said that girl from the cigar shop darling jemimawhat was her surname barbara hastings barbara said she was called jemima hastings what about her matt jones asked he crossed his arms beneath a set of pectorals that were tanned hairless impressive and decorated with a tattoo that said mum and was surrounded by a wreath of thorns he possessed three scars on his chest as well barbara saw a puckering of the flesh that had the suspicious look of healed bullet holes who was this bloke shes dead sidney told her lover darling jemima hastings was murdered he was silent then he grunted once he moved away from the doorway and rubbed the back of his neck what about dinner he asked the west town road arcades cctv tapes from that day are grainy making absolute identification of the boys who took john dresser impossible should such identification rely on the tapes alone indeed had it not been for michael spargos overlarge mustard anorak there is a chance that johns abductors might have gone unapprehended but enough people had seen the three boys and enough people were willing to come forward and identify them that the tapes consequently act as confirmation of their identities the films show john dresser walking away quite willingly with the boys as if he knows them as they near the arcade exit ian barker takes johns other hand and he and reggie swing the child between them perhaps in the promise of more play to come while they walk michael catches them up with a childlike skip and hop and he seems to offer the toddler some of the french fries hes been eating this offer of food to a child who was waiting hungrily for his lunch appears to have been what kept john dresser happy to go with them at least at first its interesting to note that when the boys leave the barriers they do not do so by the exit that would take them to the gallows ie by the exit most familiar to them instead they choose one of the lesserused exits as if they already have planned to do something with the toddler and wish to remain as unseen as possible when they make off with him in his third interview with the police ian barker claims that their intention was just to have a bit of fun with john dresser while michael spargo says that he didnt know what them other two wanted with that baby a term the baby that michael uses throughout his conversations with the police in reference to john dresser for his part reggie arnold will not come close to discussing john dresser until his fourth interview instead he attempts to obfuscate making repeated references to ian barker and his own confusion about what he wanted that kitten for attempting to direct the course of the conversation on to his siblings or assuring his motherwho was present for nearly all interviewsthat he didnt nick nothing never ever mum michael spargo claims that he wanted to return the toddler to the shopping arcade once they had him outside the barriers i told them we could drop him back inside just leave the baby by the door or something but they were the ones didnt want to i said wed get into trouble for nicking him wouldnt we note the objectifying use of nicking as if john dresser were something theyd pinched from a shop but they called me a wanker and asked me did i want to grass them up then whether this actually happened remains open to doubt as neither of the other two boys refers to michael having second thoughts and later nearly every witnesswho came to be known collectively as the twentyfiveconfirms that their sightings of the boys involved all three of them and john dresser and all three of them seemed to be actively involved with the little boy considering his past it seems reasonable to conclude that ian barker was the one to suggest they see what would happen if they swung john dresser as they had been doing but dropped him instead of landing him safely on his feet this they did releasing him at the apex of the swing and projecting him ahead of them at some speed with the apparent and expected effect of johns beginning to cry when he hit the pavement this fall caused the first of the bruises to johns bottom and possibly the first of the ultimately extensive damage done to his clothing with a clearly distressed toddler on their hands the boys made their first attempt to settle him down by offering him the jam roll that michael spargo had taken from his home that morning that john accepted it is clear not only from the extensive report of dr miles neff of the home office but also from witness evidence for it was at this point that the boys had their first encounter with someone who not only saw them with john dresser but who also stopped to question them about him trial transcripts show that when seventyyearold witness a all witness names will be withheld from this document for their own protection saw the boys john was upset enough to concern her i asked them what was wrong with that baby she says and one of themi think it was the fat one a reference to reggie arnoldtold me hed fallen and banged his bum well children do fall dont they i didnt thinki did offer to help i offered them my handkerchief for his face cause he was crying so but then the taller boy referring to ian barker said it was his baby brother and they were taking him home i asked them how far they had to go and they said not far just over in tideburn they said well as the baby began eating a jam roll they offered him i couldnt see there would be further trouble she goes on to say that she asked the boys why they werent at school and they told her school was finished for the day this apparently mollified witness a who told them to get the baby home then because hes obviously wanting his mum she doubtless was additionally mollified by the boys inspired use of tideburn as their putative habitation tideburn was then and is now safely middle class to upper middle class had they said the gallowswith all that saying the gallows impliedher concerns might have been triggered much has been made of the fact that the boys could have turned john dresser over to witness a at that moment saying theyd found him wandering outside the barriers indeed much has been said of the fact that the boys had repeated moments when they could have handed john dresser to an adult and gone on their way that they didnt suggests that somewhere along the line at least one of them was working on a larger plan either that or a larger plan had been earlier discussed among the three of them but if this latter is the case it is also something that not one of the boys has ever been willing to reveal the police were phoned once the cctv tapes had been viewed by the barriers head of security by the time they arrived to look at the tapes themselves and to mount a search however john dresser was approximately one mile away in the company of ian barker michael spargo and reggie arnold he had crossed two heavily trafficked roadways and he was both tired and hungry he had fallen several more times apparently and had cut his cheek on a raised piece of the pavement it was becoming trying to be in his company but still the boys did not release john dresser to anyone according to michael spargos fourth interview it was ian barker who first kicked the toddler when he fell and it was reggie arnold who hauled the little boy back on his feet and began to drag him john dresser was apparently quite hysterical at this point but this appears to have caused passersby to believe more firmly in the tale told by the boys that they were attempting to take my little brother home whose little brother john dresser supposedly was was a detail that became a shifting target dependent solely upon the speakers witnesses b c and d and while michael spargo denies in every interview that he ever claimed john dresser as a sibling this assertion is contradicted by witness e a postal worker who encountered the boys midway to the dawkins building site witness es testimony has him asking the boys whats wrong with the toddler whys he crying so and whats happened to his face he saidthis was the one in the yellow anorak mindthat it was his brother and that mum was doing the business with her boyfriend at the house and they were meant to keep the little un busy till she was finished they said theyd walked a bit too far and could i drive them home in my van this was if anything an inspired request surely the boys knew that witness e would not be able to accommodate them he was on his route and even if that had not been the case there was probably inadequate room within his vehicle but the fact that this request had been made gave legitimacy to their story witness e reports that he told them to take the tyke directly home then cause he was blubbing like nothing i ever seen and i got three of my own and the boys agreed to do this it appears possible that their intentions towards john dresser while inchoate when they first snatched him began to develop with the consecutive string of successful lies they were able to tell about him as if the easy belief of the witnesses whetted the boys appetite for abuse suffice it to say that they continued on their way managing to walk the toddler more than two miles despite his protests and his cries of mummy and da which were heard and ignored by more than one person michael spargo claims that during this period he asked again and again what they were going to do with john dresser i told them we couldnt take him home with us i told them i did the transcript of his fifth interview has him declaring he also declares that it was at this point that he brought up the idea of leaving john at a police station i said we could leave him on the steps or something we could leave him inside the door i said his mum and dadre going to be worried theyre going to think somethings happened to him ian barker michael says declared that something had happened to the toddler he said stupid git something did happen and he asked reg did he think the babyd make a splat when he hit the water was ian considering the canal at that point possibly but the fact of the matter was that the boys were nowhere near the midlands transcountry canal and they were not going to be able to get an exhausted john dresser there unless they carried him which they apparently did not wish to do but had ian barker been harbouring a desire to inflict some sort of injury upon john dresser in the environs of the canal he had now been thwarted and john himself was the reason why john dressers company becoming progressively more difficult the boys made the decision to lose the baby in a supermarket somewheres according to michael spargo because the entire affair had become dead boring innit there was no supermarket in the immediate vicinity however and the boys set out to find one it was on their way that ian as michael and reggie report in separate interviews with the police pointed out that in a shop they might be seen and even documented on cctv he indicated he knew of a much safer location he led them to the dawkins building site the site itself was a grand idea gone bad through loss of funding originally intended as three stylishly modern office blocks within a lovely parklike setting of trees gardens paths and copious outdoor seating it had been intended to infuse money into the surrounding community in order to bolster a faltering economy but poor management on the part of the contractor resulted in the project being called to a halt before the first tower was completed on the day that ian barker ushered his companions to the site it had languished untouched for nineteen months it was fenced by chain link but it was not inaccessible although signage on the fence warned that the site was under surveillance hours a day and that trespassers and vandals will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law regular incursions into the property made by children and adolescents indicated otherwise it was a tempting area both for playing and for clandestine rendezvous there were dozens of places to hide heaps of earth offered launching pads for mountain bikers discarded boards tubes and pipes could stand in for weapons in games of war small chunks of concrete substituted nicely for hand grenades and bombs while it was a dubious location in which to lose the baby if the boys intended someone to come across him and take him to the nearest police station it was a perfect spot in which the rest of the days horrors could play out chapter ten when thomas lynley pulled up to the kiosk at new scotland yard the next morning he began the process of steeling himself the constable in charge stepped forward not recognising the car when he saw lynley inside it he hesitated before bending to the lowered window and saying huskily inspector sir its very good to have you back lynley wanted to say that he wasnt back but instead he nodded he understood then what he should have understood before that people were going to react to his appearance at the yard and that he was going to have to react to their reacting so he readied himself for his next encounter he parked and went up to a set of offices in victoria block as familiar to him as his own home dorothea harriman saw him first it had been five months since hed encountered the departmental secretary but neither time nor circumstances were ever likely to alter her she was as always kitted out to perfection today in a red pencil skirt and breezy blouse a wide belt cinching in a waist that would have made a victorian gentleman swoon she was standing at a filing cabinet with her back to him and when she turned and saw him her eyes filled and she set a file on her desk and clasped both her hands at her throat she said oh detective inspector lynley oh my god how wonderful it couldnt possibly be better to see you lynley didnt think he could live through more than one greeting such as this so he said as if hed never been gone dee you look well today are they and he indicated with a nod towards the superintendents office she told him that they were gathered in the incident room and did he want a coffee tea a croissant toast theyd recently started offering muffins in the canteen and it was no trouble he was fine he told her hed had breakfast she wasnt to bother he managed a smile and set off for the incident room but he could feel her eyes on him and he knew he was going to have to get used to people assessing him considering what they should say or not say unsure how soon or even whether to mention her name it was he knew the way of all people as they navigated the waters of someone elses grief in the incident room it was much the same when he opened the door and walked in the stunned silence that fell upon the group told him that acting superintendent ardery hadnt mentioned hed be joining them she was standing to one side of a set of china boards on which photos were posted and officers actions were listed she saw him and said casually ah thomas good morning and then to the others ive asked inspector lynley to come back on board and i hope his return is going to be a permanent one meanwhile hes kindly agreed to help me learn the ropes round here i trust no one has a problem with that the way she spoke sent the message clearly lynley was going to be her subordinate and if anyone did have a problem with that that relevant anyone could request reassignment lynleys gaze took them in his longtime colleagues his longtime friends they welcomed him in their various ways winston nkata with blazing warmth on his dark features philip hale with a wink and a smile john stewart with the guarded expectancy of one who knows theres more here than meets the eye and barbara havers with confusion her face showed the question that he knew she wanted to ask him why didnt you tell me yesterday he didnt know how he could explain of everyone at the yard she was closest to him and thus she was the last person to whom he could comfortably speak she wouldnt understand this and he didnt yet possess the words to tell her isabelle ardery continued the meeting that they had been having lynley took out his reading glasses and worked his way closer to the china board upon which the victims photographs were displayed in life and in death including grisly autopsy photos an efit of a person of interest was situated near the pictures of the murder site and next to this was a closeup of what appeared to be some sort of carved stone this was an enlargement the stone was reddish and square and it had the look of an amulet in the victims pocket ardery was saying in apparent reference to this photograph it looks like something from a mans ring considering the size and the shape of it and you can see its been carved although the carving itself is quite worn its with forensics just now as to the weapon so are telling us the wound suggests something capable of piercing to a depth of eight or nine inches thats all they know there was rust left in the wound as well plenty of that on the site winston nkata pointed out old chapel locked off with iron barshas to be a mountain of clobber round that place could be used for a weapon which takes us to the possibility that this was a crime of opportunity ardery said no handbag with her philip hale said no identification on her and shedve had to have something to get up to stoke newington money travel card something couldve started with bag snatching indeedso we need to put our hands on that bag of hers if she had one ardery said in the meantime weve got two very good leads from the porn magazine left near the body called girlicious it was the type of magazine that was delivered to the point of sale encased in opaque black plastic due to the sensitiveand here ardery rolled her eyesnature of its contents this plastic served the purpose of preventing innocent children from pawing through it to have a look at the various pudenda on display it also served the less obvious purpose of preventing the fingerprints of anyone other than the purchaser to be placed upon it now they had a very good set of dabs to use in the investigation but better than that they had a shop receipt tucked within the pages as if used as a marker if this shop receipt was the point of purchase of the magazineand it likely wasthen there was a very good chance they were on the trail of whatever sod had bought it he might or might not be our killer he might or might not be this person she indicated the efit but the magazine was fresh it hadnt been there long and we want to talk to whoever took it into that chapels annex so she began the assignments they knew the drill tie first the known associates of jemima hastings had to be interviewed at covent garden where she was employed at her lodgings in putney at any other place she frequented at the portrait gallery where she had been present for the opening of the exhibition in which her picture hung all of them would need alibis that would want checking out her belongings had to be gone through as well and there were boxes upon boxes of them from her lodgings an everwidening search of the area near the cemetery had to be made to attempt to locate her bag the weapon or anything related to her journey across london to stoke newington ardery finished making the assignments she concluded these with the fact that detective sergeant havers would track down a woman called yolanda the psychic yolanda the what was havers response ardery ignored her theyd had a phone call from bella mchaggis she said jemima hastings landlady in putney a yolanda the psychic needed to be looked into it seemed shed been stalking jemimabellas word not mineso they needed to find her and give her a grilling i trust you have no difficulty with that sergeant havers shrugged she glanced at lynley he knew what her expectation was so apparently did isabelle ardery because she announced to everyone inspector lynley will work with me for the time being ds nkata youll be partnered with barbara isabelle ardery handed lynley the keys to her car she told him where it was said shed meet him down below after she popped into the ladies and then she popped into the ladies she peed and downed her vodka simultaneously but the vodka went down a bit too fast for her liking and she was glad shed brought the other bottle so as she flushed the toilet she downed the second one she tucked both bottles back into her bag she made sure they kept their distance from each other each one nicely wrapped in a tissue for it wouldnt do to go clinking and clanking about like a halfslewed tart with more where that came from especially she thought since there wasnt more where that came from unless she stopped off at a convenient offlicence which she was highly unlikely to do in the company of thomas lynley shed said you and i will take on covent garden and neither he nor anyone else had questioned her in the matter she intended to remain close to any operation if she got the superintendents position and as far as everyone was concerned lynley was there to help her learn the ropes having him take her out and about would serve to reinforce the point that she had his support for her part she wanted to get to know the man whether he realised it or not he was the competition in more ways than one and she meant to disarm him in more ways than one she paused at the line of basins to wash and she used the time also to smooth her hair and tuck it neatly behind her ears to fish her sunglasses out of her bag and to put on fresh lipstick she chewed two breath mints and placed a listerine strip on her tongue for good measure she went down to the car park where she found lynley standing alongside her toyota ever the gentlemanthe man had probably learned his manners from the cothe opened the passenger door for her she told him sharply not to do that againwere not going on a date inspectorand they set off he was a very good driver she noted from victoria street to the vicinity of covent garden lynley didnt look at anything other than the roadway the pavements or the toyotas mirrors and he didnt bother to make conversation that was fine with her driving with her former husband had always been torture for isabelle as bob was prone to believing he could multitask and the tasks he engaged in behind the wheel were disciplining the boys arguing with her driving and frequently having mobile phone conversations theyd jumped more red lights sped through more occupied zebra crossings and made right turns into more oncoming traffic than isabelle cared to remember part of the pleasure of divorce had been the novel security of driving herself covent garden was no great distance from new scotland yard but their route forced them to cope with the congestion in parliament square which was always worse in the summer months on this particular day there was a heavy police presence in the vicinity since a mass of protestors had gathered near st margarets church and constables wearing bright yellow windbreakers were attempting to herd them in the direction of victoria tower garden things werent much better in whitehall where traffic was stalled near downing street but this turned out to be not because of another protest but rather due to a plethora of gawkers swarming the iron gates in anticipation of god only knew what thus it was more than half an hour between the time lynley turned the car from broadway into victoria street and the time he managed to park in long acre with a police identification propped in the windscreen covent garden had long since morphed from the picturesque flower market of eliza doolittle fame to the commercial nightmare of globalisation run amok that it now was largely devoted to anything that tourists might be willing to purchase and largely avoided by anyone of sense who lived in the locality day workers from the area doubtless used its pubs restaurants and freestanding food stalls but its myriad doorways were otherwise undarkened by londons citizenry unless it was to make a purchase of that which could not easily be purchased elsewhere such was the case with the tobacconists where according to barbara havers report sidney st james had first come upon jemima hastings they found this establishment at the south end of the courtyard shops and they wended their way to it through what seemed to be buskers of every shape and form from individuals artfully posing as statues in long acre to magicians unicycleriding jugglers two oneman bands and one energetic air guitarist these all vied for donations in virtually every space that was not otherwise occupied by a kiosk a table chairs and people milling about eating ice lollies jacket potatoes and falafel it was just the sort of place the boys would have adored isabelle thought it was just the sort of place that made her want to run screaming for the nearest point of solitude which was likely the church at the far southwest end of the square that covent garden comprised things were marginally improved in the courtyard shops most of which were moderately high end so the ubiquitous bands of teenagers and tourists in trainers elsewhere were absent here the quality of busking was elevated as well in a lowerlevel courtyard that housed a restaurant with openair seating a middleaged violinist played to the orchestral accompaniment of a boom box a sign reading segar and snuff parlour hung above the tobacconists multipaned front window and near its door stood the traditional wooden figure of the highlander in full kilted regalia a flask of snuff in his hands printed chalkboards leaned against the door and beneath the window and they advertised exclusive tobaccos and the shops daily speciality which today was the larranaga petit corona five people could not have fitted comfortably within the cigar shop so tiny was it its air fragrant with the perfume of unsmoked tobacco it comprised a single old oak display case of pipeand cigarsmoking paraphernalia locked glassfronted oak cabinets of cigars and a small back room devoted to dozens of glass canisters filled with tobacco and labeled with various scents and flavours the paraphernalia display case also served as the shops main counter with an electronic scale a till and another smaller locked cabinet of cigars standing atop it behind this counter the shop assistant was completing a sale to a woman making a purchase of cigarillos he called out be with you presently my dears in the sort of singsong voice one might have expected from a fop of an earlier century as it was the voice was completely at odds with the age and appearance of the shop assistant he looked no older than twentyone and although he was dressed neatly in lightweight summer clothing he had gauges in his ears and hed apparently worn them long enough to have stretched his lobes to a skincrawling size during the ensuing conversation he had with isabelle and lynley he continually poked his little finger through the holes isabelle found the behaviour so repellent that it made her feel rather faint now yes yes yes he sang out happily once his customer went on her way with her cigarillos how may i help cigars cigarillos tobacco snuff what will it be conversation isabelle told him police she added and showed her id lynley did likewise im all agog the young man said he gave his name as jayson druther his father he revealed was the owner of the shop as had been his grandfather and his grandfathers father before him what we dont know about tobacco isnt worth knowing he himself was just beginning in the business having insisted on taking a degree in marketing before he joined the ranks of those who labour he wished to expand but his father disagreed heaven forbid that we should invest in something not an absolute certainty he added with a dramatic shudder now he spread his handsthey were white and smooth isabelle noted very likely the objects of weekly manicuresand he indicated he was ready for whatever they asked of him lynley stood slightly behind her which allowed her to do the honours she liked this jemima hastings she began i expect you know her dont you rather jayson extended the word into raw and thur and he gave emphasis to the second syllable he said he wouldnt mind having a word with dear jemima as she was the reason he was having to work all sorts of mad hours just now where is the wretched minx by the way the wretched minx was dead isabelle told him his jaw dropped open his jaw snapped shut good god he said not a road accident she wasnt hit by a car heavens theres not been another terrorist attack has there shes been murdered mr druther lynley said quietly jayson clocked his highbrow accent and fingered an earlobe in response in abney park cemetery isabelle added the papers have indicated a murder there do you read the papers mr druther god no he said no tabloids no broadsheets and definitely no television or radio news i vastly prefer to live in my own cloud cuckoo land anything else sends me into such depression that i cant get out of bed in the morning and the only thing that cheers me up is mums ginger biscuits but if i eat them im prone to weight gain my clothes cease to fit i must purchase anew andsurely you get the idea yes abney park cemetery wheres abney park cemetery north london north london he made it sound like pluto my god what was she doing there was she mugged kidnapped she wasntshe wasnt interfered with was she isabelle thought that having her jugular vein ripped open was fairly well interfered with although she knew that wasnt what jayson meant she said well leave it at murdered for the present how well did you know jemima not particularly well as things developed it seemed that jayson had spoken to jemima by phone but had actually only seen her twice since they shared no work hours and truth to tell nothing else either he knew her more from these than from her actual person he said these turned out to be a small stack of postcards jayson drew them from a cubbyhole near the till perhaps eight of them in all they comprised the image that deborah st james had taken of jemima hastings undoubtedly sold like other images from the collection at the national portrait gallerys gift shop someone had printed have you seen this woman in black marker pen on the front of each card on the reverse side was a telephone number with please phone scrawled above it paolo had brought them in for jemima jayson revealed he knew that much because on the days that he worked and jemima did not paolo di fazio stopped at the shop anyway if hed found more cards this particular set paolo had delivered several days ago although jemima hadnt been there to receive them jayson reckoned she had been destroying them as theyd been delivered since more than once hed found their shredded remains in the rubbish on the days when he himself worked i think it was some sort of ritual for her he said paolo di fazio he was one of the lodgers isabelle recalled the name from barbara havers report of her conversation with jemima hastings landlady she said does mr di fazio work nearby he does hes the mask man the masked man isabelle asked what on earth no no not masked mask he creates masks hes got a stall over in the market hall hes very good hes done one of me actually theyre a bit of a souvenir ofwell more than a souvenir really i think he has a bit of a thing for jemima if you ask me i mean why else would he be scurrying in and out of the shop with postcards hes collected for her anyone else come looking for her on her days off when you were here that is isabelle asked he shook his head nary a soul he told them only paolo what about people she associated with here at the market oh i wouldnt know them dear heart if there are any there may be of course but as ive said we worked on different days so he shrugged paolo could tell you if he will that is why wouldnt he is there something about paolo we ought to know before we speak to him gracious no i didnt mean to implywell i did get the impression he watched her rather closely if you know what i mean he did ask about her much like you did anyone stop in to the shop looking for her asking about her meeting her waiting for her that sort of thing how did she come to be working here lynley asked the question turning from an examination of the cuban cigars in the large display case job centre jayson said and i cant tell you which one because theyre all computerised now arent they so she could have come to us from blackpool for all i know we advertised the job with the centre and in she came dad interviewed her and hired her on the spot well want to speak to him with dad why heavens youre not thinking jayson laughed then whoopsed and covered his mouth he arranged his features into a suitably lugubrious expression sorry i was just picturing dad as a murderer i expect thats why you want to speak with him isnt it to get his alibi isnt that what you do we do indeed well need yours as well my alibi a hand pressed to his chest i have no idea where ashley park is and anyway if jemima was there and it was during shop hours that she was done in then i would have been here its abney park isabelle informed him north london stoke newington to be precise mr druther wherever i would have been here from halfpast nine until halfpast six until eight if were talking about a wednesday are we because as i told you in the beginning i dont read the papers and ive no idea start isabelle instructed what the papers start reading the papers mr druther youll be amazed by what you can find inside them now tell us again where paolo di fazio might be found he wondered if they were seraphim there was something about them that marked them as different they were not mortal he could see that the real question then was what type were they cherubim thrones dominions principalities good bad warrior guardian archangels even like raphael michael or gabriel archangels that scholars and theologians as yet knew nothing of angels of the highest order perhaps come to make war with forces so evil that only a sword held in the hand of a creature of light could possibly defeat it he didnt know he couldnt tell hed assumed guardian about himself but hed been wrong he saw that he was meant to be michaels warrior but when he saw it it was far too late but watching over has power watching over is nothing watching over is watching evil and evil destroys destruction destroys destruction begets more destruction learning is meant guarding means learning guarding means fear fear means hate fear means anger guarding means love guarding means hiding hiding means standing watch which means guarding which means love i am meant to guard you are meant to kill warriors defeat you are called upon to war i call upon you legions upon legions call upon you i guarded i guard you killed he wanted to strike his mind where the voices were they were louder today than theyd ever been louder than shouting louder than music he could see the voices as well as hear them and they filled his vision so that he finally made out the wings they were hidden angels but their wings betrayed them and they watched him and bore witness from above they lined up one right next to the other with their mouths opening and their mouths closing and celestial singing should have come from those mouths but what came instead was wind there was a howling upon it and after the wind came the voices that he knew but would not listen to so he gave himself to the warriors and the guardians and their determination to win him to causes so unlike himself he squeezed his eyes shut but still he saw them and still he heard them and still he kept on and on and on till perspiration wetted his cheeks till he realised it was not perspiration but tears and then the sound of bravo coming from somewhere but not from the angels this time for they were gone and then so was he he was stumbling climbing making his way to the churchyard and then to the quiet that was not quiet at all for there was no quiet not for him lynley wasnt bothered by the part he was playing in the investigation something between chauffeur and dogsbody to isabelle ardery the role allowed him to ease his way back into police work and if he was going to return to police work it definitely had to be a gradual movement bit of a wanker was arderys assessment of jayson druther once they left the tobacco shop lynley couldnt disagree he indicated the route they needed to take to get to jubilee market hall across the cobbles from the main area of covent garden inside the hall the noise was ear popping coming from hawkers from boom boxes set within the stalls from shouted conversations and from buyers attempting to broker deals with sellers of everything from souvenir tshirts to works of art they found the mask makers stall after elbowing their way up and down three aisles he had a good position near a far doorway making him either the first or the last stall one came to but in any case a stall one would unquestionably see for it sat at an angle with nothing on either side of it it was large as well larger than most and this was due to the fact that the mask making itself appeared to go on within it a stool for the artists subject sat beneath a tall light and next to it a table held bags of plaster and several other containers unfortunately what the stall did not hold at the present moment was the artist himself although the heavy plastic sheeting that formed its rear wall bore photographs of the masks he produced along with their subjects posed next to them a sign on a makeshift counter indicated the time when the artist would return ardery glanced at this and then at her watch after which she said to lynley lets have some refreshment they sought said refreshment back the way theyd come down below the tobacconist in the courtyard the violinist whod played there earlier was gone and it was just as well because ardery apparently wanted conversation along with her refreshment this turned out to be a glass of wine at which lynley lifted an eyebrow she saw this ive no objection to a glass of wine on duty inspector lynley we deserve one after jayson please join me i hate to feel like a lush i think i wont he said i hit it rather hard after helen died ah yes i expect you did lynley ordered mineral water in turn at which ardery lifted her own eyebrow she said to him not even a soft drink are you always this virtuous thomas only when i want to impress and do you want to impress you dont we all if youre to be the guv then it serves the rest of us to begin jockeying for positions of prominence doesnt it i have serious doubts that youve spent much time jockeying for any position unlike yourself youre climbing quickly thats what i do she looked round the courtyard in which they sat it wasnt as crowded as the area above them since here there was only the restaurant cum wine bar at the base of a wide stairway but it was crowded enough every table was taken theyd been lucky to find a spot to sit god what a mass of humanity she said why dyou reckon people come to places like these associations he said she turned back to him he fingered a crockery bowl holding cubes of sugar rotating it in his fingers as he went on history art literature the opportunity to imagine perhaps a revisiting of a place from childhood all sorts of reasons but not to buy tshirts saying mind the gap an unfortunate byproduct of rampant capitalism she smiled at this you can be mildly amusing so ive been told generally with the stress on mildly their drinks arrived he noticed that she took hers up with some alacrity she apparently noticed him noticing im trying to drown the memory of jayson it was the appalling earlobes an interesting stylistic choice he admitted one wonders what the next fad will be now that bodily mutilation is in vogue branding i daresay what did you make of him aside from his earlobes id say his alibi will be simple enough to confirm the copies of receipts from the till will have the time of day printed on them someone could have stood in his place in the shop thomas and likely theres going to be a regular customer or two not to mention another shopkeeper hereabouts wholl be able to confirm he was here i dont see him as likely to tear open someones jugular vein do you admittedly no paolo di fazio or whoever might be at the other end of the postcards that was a mobile number on it isabelle reached for her handbag and brought the postcards out jayson had given them over with a happy to be rid of them darling upon her request she said to lynley they make things interesting and then observing him which brings us to sergeant havers speaking of interesting he noted wryly have you been happy working with her i have been very despite her ardery seemed to search for a word he supplied her with several recalcitrance obstinate refusal to toe the line lack of finesse intriguing personal habits ardery brought her wine to her lips and she examined him over the glass rim as she drank youre rather oddly paired one wouldnt expect it i think you know what i mean i do know shes had professional difficulties ive read her personnel file just hers of course not ive read everyones yours as well i mean to have this job thomas i mean to have a team that works like a welloiled machine if sergeant havers turns out to be a loose screw in the works im going to get rid of her is that why youre advising change she frowned change barbaras clothing the makeup i expect to see her with her teeth repaired and sporting a designer hairdo next it doesnt hurt a woman to look her best id advise a man on my team to do something about his appearance if he came to work looking like barbara havers as it happens shes the only one who comes to work looking like shes slept rough the night before hasnt anyone ever spoken to her before didnt superintendent webberly didnt you she is who she is lynley said good mind and big heart you like her i cant work with people i dont like guv in private conversation its isabelle she said his eyes met hers he saw hers were brown as his were but not uniformly so they were richly speckled with hazel and he reckoned that if she wore different colours to what she had on at presenta creamcoloured blouse beneath a welltailored russet jacketthey might even appear green he shifted his gaze and took in their surroundings he said this is hardly private is it i think you know what i mean she glanced at her watch she still had half a glass of wine left and before she stood she tossed the rest of it down lets find paolo di fazio she told him he should be back at his stall by now he was they found him in the midst of attempting to persuade a middleaged couple to have masks made as souvenirs of their silver wedding anniversary trip to london hed brought forth his artistic instruments and laid them on the counter and hed set up a collection of sample masks as well these were mounted on rods that were fixed onto small plinths of finished wood fashioned from plaster of paris the masks were startlingly lifelike similar to the death masks that had once been created from the corpses of people of significance the perfect way for you to remember this visit to london di fazio told the couple so much more meaningful than a coffee mug with a royals face on it eh the couple hesitated they said to each other should we and di fazio waited for their decision his expression was polite and it didnt alter when they said they would have to think about it when they moved off di fazio gave his attention to lynley and ardery another finelooking couple he said each of you has a face made for sculpture your children are i expect as handsome as you lynley heard ardery snort with amusement she showed her warrant card and said superintendent isabelle ardery new scotland yard this is di lynley unlike jayson druther di fazio knew at once why they were there he took off the wireframed spectacles he wore began to polish them on the front of his shirt and said jemima you know about whats happened to her then he returned the glasses to his face and ran a hand over longish dark hair he was a goodlooking man lynley saw short and compact but with shoulders and chest suggesting that he worked with weights di fazio said abruptly of course i know whats happened to jemima all of us know all jayson druther had no idea whats happened to her he wouldnt di fazio said hes an idiot did jemima feel that way about him jemima was good to people she would never have said how did you learn of her death lynley asked bella told me he added what barbaras report had indicated that he was one of the lodgers at the home of bella mchaggis in putney in fact he was the reason he said that jemima had established a lodging place with mrs mchaggis hed told her about a vacant room there not long after hed met her when was this lynley asked a week or two after she got to london sometime last november and how did you meet her isabelle asked at the shop he went on to say that he rolled his own and he bought both his tobacco and his papers from the cigar shop usually from that idiot jayson he added pazzo uomo but one day jemima was there instead italian are you mr di fazio lynley asked di fazio took a rollie from the pocket of his shirthe wore a crisp white shirt and a very clean pair of jeansand he put it behind his ear he said with a name like di fazio thats an excellent deduction i think the inspector meant a native of italy isabelle said your english is perfect ive lived here since i was ten you were born in palermo why what does this have to do with jemima i came here legally if thats what youre interested in not that it matters much these days with the eu mess and people wandering between borders whenever they feel like it ardery lynley saw indicated a change of direction with a slight lifting of her fingers from the countertop she said we understand you were collecting national portrait gallery postcards for jemima had she asked you to do that or was it your idea why would it have been my idea perhaps you can tell us it wasnt i saw one of the cards in leicester square i recognised it from the portrait gallery showtheres a banner out front and jemimas pictures on it if you havent seen itand i picked it up where was the postcard i dont remembernear the halfprice ticket booth maybe near the odeon it was stuck up with blutack and it had the message on it so i took it down and gave it to her did you phone the number on the back of the card he shook his head i didnt know who the hell it was or what he wanted he lynley noted so you knew it was a man whod been distributing the cards it was one of those gotcha moments and di fazioclearly no foolunderstood this he took a few seconds before he answered she told me her partner was likely doing it her former partner a bloke from hampshire she knew from the phone number on the back of the card she said shed left him but he hadnt taken it well and now obviously he was trying to find her she didnt want to be found she wanted to get the cards down before someone who knew where she was saw one and phoned him so she collected them and i collected them as many as we could find and whenever we had the chance were you involved with her lynley asked she was my friend beyond friendship were you involved with her or merely hoping to be involved with her again di fazio didnt reply at once he was obviously no fool so he knew that any way he answered could make him look bad yes no maybe or whatever there was always the sexual element between men and women to consider and what the sexual element could lead to by way of motives for murder mr di fazio ardery said is there something about the question you dont understand he said abruptly we were lovers for a time ah ardery said he looked irritated this was before she came to live at bellas she had a wretched room in charing cross road up above keira news she was paying too much for it but thats where you and she ardery let him complete the thought on his own how long had you known her when you became lovers he bristled i dont know what that has to do with anything ardery said nothing in answer to this and neither did lynley di fazio finally spat out a week a few days i dont know you dont know ardery asked mr di fazio i have a feeling that i went in for tobacco she was friendly flirty you know how it is i asked her if she wanted to go for a drink after work we went to that place on long acrethe pubi dont know what its called it was packed so we had a drink on the pavement with everyone else and then we left we went to her room so you became lovers the day you met ardery clarified it happens and then you began to live together in putney lynley noted with bella mchaggis at her home no no no di fazio took up his cigarette he said if they were going to talk furtherand it was costing him in bloody customers by the waythen they were going to have to do it outside where he at least could have a fag while they spoke ardery told him it was absolutely fine to move outside and he gathered up his tools and shoved them under the counter along with the sample masks on their wooden plinths lynley noted the toolssharp and well suited for activities other than sculptingand knew ardery had done likewise they exchanged a glance and followed di fazio out into the open air there he lit his rollup and told lynley and ardery the rest hed thought theyd continue as lovers he said but he hadnt counted on jemimas desire to follow the rules no sex was how he put it bella doesnt allow it opposed to the whole idea of sex is she lynley asked sex among the lodgers di fazio told them hed tried to convince jemima that they could continue as before with no one the wiser because bella slept like the dead on the floor above them and frazer chaplinthis was the third lodgerhad the basement room two floors below so he wouldnt know what was going on either the two of themjemima and di faziooccupied the only two bedrooms on the first floor of the house there was no bloody way that bella would find out jemima wouldnt have it di fazio said when she came to see the room bella told her straightaway that shed tossed out the last lodger for getting involved with frazer caught her coming out of frazers room early one morning and that was that jemima didnt want that to happen to herdecent lodgings are not easy to findso she said no more sex at first it was no sex at bellas and then it was no sex altogether it had got to be too much trouble she said too much trouble ardery asked where were you having it not in public he replied and not in abney park cemetery if thats where youre heading at my studio he shared space with three other artists he said in a railway arch near clapham junction at first they went therehe and jemimabut after a few weeks shed had enough she said she didnt like the deception he said and did you believe her i hardly had a choice she said it was over she made it over rather like shed done with the postcard bloke according to what she told you rather like he said which gave them both a motive for murder lynley thought chapter eleven yolanda the psychic had an establishment in a market area just off queensway in bayswater barbara havers and winston nkata found it without too much trouble once they unearthed the market itself which they accessed by means of an unmarked entry between a tiny newsagent and one of the ubiquitous cheap luggage shops that seemed to pop up in every corner of london the market was the sort of place one would walk right past without noticing a lowceilinged ethnicoriented localsonly warren of passages in which russian cafés vied with asian bakeries and shops selling hookahs sat next to kiosks blaring african music a question asked in the russian café produced the information that there was within the environs of the market a location called psychic mews there barbara and nkata were told yolanda the psychic operated and considering the hour of the day she was likely to be present a little more wandering brought them to psychic mews this turned out to be what seemed likebut probably wasntan authentic old mews complete with cobbled street and buildings having the appearance of former stables like all mews in london unlike other mews however it was under the protection of a roof as was the rest of the market this afforded psychic mews an appropriate atmosphere of gloom mystery and even danger one expected barbara thought jack the ripper to leap down from a rooftop at any moment yolandas business was one of three psychic sanctuaries in the place its single windowcurtained for the privacy of clients withinbore a sill of accouterments appropriate to her line of employment a porcelain hand with its palm outward and all the lines upon it identified a similar porcelain head with various parts of the skull indicated an astrological chart a deck of tarot cards only the crystal ball was missing you believe this muck barbara asked nkata read your horoscope in the paper or anything winston compared his palm to the porcelain one in the window cording to this i shouldve died last week he noted and he shouldered open the door to the place he had to duck to get inside and barbara followed him into an anteroom in which incense burned and sitar music played against a wall the form of the elephant god was rendered in plaster and across from it a crucifix hung above what seemed to be a kachina doll while an enormous buddha on the floor appeared to serve the purpose of a doorstop yolanda looked to be someone who covered all the spiritual bases barbara concluded anyone here she called in reply a woman emerged from behind a beaded curtain she wasnt dressed as barbara had expected one somehow thought a psychic would be decked out in gypsy gear all scarves colourful skirts and heaps of gold necklaces with matching hoop earrings of massive size but instead the woman wore a business suit that isabelle ardery would have heartily approved of as it was tailored to fit her somewhat stout body and even to barbaras unschooled eyes it seemed to announce itself with the words french designer her one bow to stereotype was the scarf she used but even this shed only folded into a band to hold back her hair and instead of black the hair was orange a rather disturbing shade that suggested an unfortunate encounter with a bottle of peroxide are you yolanda barbara asked in reply she put her hands to her ears she clamped her eyes shut yes yes all right she had an odd low voice she sounded like a man i bloody well hear you dont i sorry barbara said although to her thinking she hadnt spoken loudly at all psychics she thought must be sensitive to sound i didnt mean ill tell her but you must stop roaring im not deaf you know i didnt think i was loud barbara dug out her id scotland yard she said yolanda opened her eyes she didnt cast even a glance in the direction of barbaras warrant card rather she said quite a shouter he is who he says hes your dad he says youre meant to hes dead barbara told her of course he is i could hardly hear him otherwise i hear dead people like in i see dead people dont be clever all right all right dont be so loud your dad he wasnt a shouter not ever he is now luv he says youre meant to call on your mum shes missing you barbara doubted that last time shed seen her mother the woman had believed she was looking at their longtime neighbour mrs gustafson and her resultant panicin her final years at home shed grown to fear mrs gustafson as if the old lady had somehow morphed into luciferhad not been assuaged by anything barbara had attempted from showing her identification to appealing to any of the other residents among whom mrs havers lived in a private care home in greenford barbara had not yet been back it had seemed at the time the course of wisdom what shall i tell him yolanda asked and then with her hands over her ears once again what oh of course i believe you and then to barbara james yes but he wasnt called that was he jimmy barbara shifted uncomfortably on her feet she looked at winston who himself seemed to be anticipating an unwelcome message from someone in the great beyond tell him ill go tomorrow whatever you mustnt lie to the spirit world next week then yolanda closed her eyes she says next week james and then to barbara you cant manage sooner hes quite insistent tell him im on a case hell understand apparently he did for once yolanda communicated this matter into the spirit world she breathed a sigh of relief and gave her attention to winston he had a magnificent aura she told him well developed unusual brilliant and evolved fantastic nkata said politely ta and then cn we have a word miss just yolanda she said no other name barbara asked her this would be for the record and all that because as this was a police matteryolanda would surely get the point eh police im legal yolanda said licenced whatever you need i expect you are were not here to check your business details so your full name is it turned outno surprisethat yolanda was a pseudonym sharon price not having quite the same cachet when it came to the psychic trade would that be miss or missus price nkata asked having his notebook out and his mechanical pencil poised it would be missus she confirmed mister was a driver of one of londons black cabs and the children of mister and missus were both grown and flown youre here because of her arent you yolanda said shrewdly you knew jemima hastings then yeah nkata said yolanda missed the tense of the verb she said oh i know jemima yes but i didnt mean jemima i meant her that cow over putney she actually rang you didnt she shes got her nerve they were all still standing in the anteroom and barbara asked was there a place they could sit for a proper conversation to this yolanda waved them through the beaded curtain where she had a setup that walked a tightrope between analysts office with a fainting sofa along one wall and a séance locale with a round table in the middle and a thronelike chair at twelve oclock obviously meant for the medium yolanda went for this and indicated havers and nkata were meant to sit at three and seven oclock respectively this had to do with nkatas aura evidently and with barbaras lack of one bit anxious about you i am yolanda said to her you and everyone else barbara cast a glance at nkata he gave her a look of deep and utterly spurious concern over her apparent lack of aura ill see to you later she muttered under her breath to which he stifled a smile oh i can see youre unbelievers yolanda said in her strange mans voice she reached beneath the table then whereupon barbara expected it to levitate but instead the psychic brought forth the ostensible reason for her ruined vocal cords a packet of dunhills she lit up and shoved the cigarettes towards barbara with the full knowledge it seemed that barbara was a fellow in this matter youre dying to she said go ahead and sorry luv to winston but not to worry passive smoking isnt how youre meant to go more than that however and youll have to pay me five quid reckon id like to be surprised he responded suit yourself dearie she inhaled with great pleasure and settled back into her throne for a proper natter she said i dont want her living in putney well not so much in putney itself as with her and by her i spose i mean in her house you didnt want jemima living in mrs mchaggiss house barbara said right yolanda flicked ash onto the floor this was covered by a persian carpet but she didnt seem concerned she said houses of death need to be decontaminated sage burning in every room and believe you me it doesnt do just to wave it about as one runs through the place and im not talking of the sage you get in the market mind you one doesnt buy a packet in sainsburys from the dried herb shelf and put a teaspoonful in an ashtray and light it and there you have it not by a bloody long chalk one gets the real thing bound up properly and meant to be burnt one lights it and appropriate prayers are said spirits needing to be released are then released and the place is cleansed of death and only then is it wholesome enough for someone to resume a life within it winston barbara saw was noting all this down as if with the intention of stopping off somewhere for the appropriate decontaminants she said sorry mrs price but yolanda for gods sake right yolanda are you referring to whats happened to jemima hastings yolanda looked confused im referring she said to the fact that she lives in a house of death mchaggiswas ever a woman more appropriately named i ask youis a widow her husband died in the house suspicious circumstances yolanda hmmphed youll have to ask mchaggis that i can see contagion oozing out of the windows every time i go past ive told jemima shes meant to clear out of there and all right i admit it i might have been rather insistent about it which would be why the cops were phoned barbara asked who phoned them i ask because what we know is that you were warned off stalking jemima at one point is our information thats an interpretation isnt it yolanda said ive expressed my concern its grown so ive expressed it again prhaps ive been a bitoh prhaps i took things to extremes prhaps i did a bit of lurking outside but what am i meant to do just let her languish every time i see her its shrunken more and am i meant to stand by and let that happen say nothing about it its shrunken more barbara repeated it being her aura nkata supplied helpfully obviously on top of the situation yes yolanda confirmed when i first met jemima she glowed well not like you luvthis to nkatabut still more noticeably than most people howd you meet her then barbara asked enough of auras she decided as winston was beginning to look decidedly smug about his at the ice rink well not at the ice rink per se naturally more like from the ice rink abbott introduced us we have coffee together sometimes in the café abbott and i and i run into him in the shops as well hes got something of a pleasant aura himself right barbara murmured and as he gets such grief from his wiveswell this would be his former wives wouldnt iti like to tell him not to worry so about that a man can only do what a man can do eh and if he doesnt make enough to pay them all support then he isnt to drive himself into the grave over it he does what he can he teaches doesnt he he walks dogs in the park he tutors children in reading what more can those three tarts expect from him what more indeed barbara said whod this bloke be winston asked abbott langer yolanda told them he was an instructor at the queens ice and bowl which was just up the street from this market in which they sat it turned out that jemima hastings had been taking iceskating lessons from abbott langer and yolanda had encountered the two of them having a postlesson cup of coffee in the russian café inside this very market abbott had introduced them yolanda admired jemimas aura bet you did barbara muttered and shed asked jemima a few questions which stimulated conversation which in turn prompted yolanda to hand over her business card and that was that shes come to see me three or four times yolanda said about what yolanda managed to draw in on her cigarette and look aghast simultaneously i dont speak about my clients she said this is confidential what goes on in here we need a general idea oh dont you just she blew out a thin stream of smoke generally shes like all the rest she wants to talk about a bloke well dont they all its always about a bloke eh will he wont he will they wont they should she shouldnt she my concern however is that house she lives in but has she ever wanted to hear about that has she ever wanted to hear about where she ought to be living where would that be barbara asked not there let me tell you i see danger there ive even offered her a place with my mister and me at a bargain rate weve got two spare rooms and theyve both been purified but she hasnt wanted to leave mchaggis i admit i might have been a bit persistent about the matter i might have stopped in to speak to her about it now and then but that was only because she needs to get out of that place and what am i meant to do about that say nothing let the chips fall wait until whatever is going to happen happens it came to barbara that yolanda had not caught on that jemima was dead which was rather curious since she was supposedly a psychic and here were the rozzers asking questions about one of her clients on the one hand jemimas name had not been released to the media since theyd not yet tracked down her family on the other hand if yolanda was in conversation with barbaras own father wouldnt jemimas spirit be doing some serious shouting from the netherworld as well barbara shot nkata a look upon the consideration of her father had the louse actually tracked down yolanda and phoned her in advance with pertinent details of barbaras life she wouldnt have put it past him he would have his joke she said yolanda before we go on i think i need to clarify something jemima hastings is dead she was murdered four days ago in abney park cemetery in stoke newington silence and then as if her bum were on fire yolanda shot up from her throne it toppled backwards she cast her cigarette to the carpet and ground it outat least barbara hoped she ground it out as she didnt fancy a fireand she flung out her arms she cried out as if in extremis saying i knew i knew oh forgive me immortals and then she fell straight across the table arms still extended one hand reached towards nkata and the other towards barbara when they didnt twig what she wanted she slapped her palms against the tabletop and then turned her hands towards them they were meant to clasp hers shes here among us yolanda cried oh tell me beloved one who who she began to moan jesus on white bread barbara looked at winston aghast were they meant to ring for help nine nine nine or whatever should they dash her with water was there sage anywhere handy dark as the night yolanda whispered her voice hoarser than before he is dark as the night well he would be barbara thought if for no other reason than they always were attended by his partner the sun he comes upon her together they do it he was not alone i see him i see him oh my beloved and then she screamed and then she fainted or she seemed to faint bloody hell nkata whispered the words he looked to barbara for direction she wanted to tell him that he was the one with the brilliant aura so he should damn well be able to sort out what to do but instead she got to her feet and he did likewise and together they righted yolandas throne seated her and got her head down between her knees when she came to which happened with an alacrity suggesting shed not actually fainted in the first place she moaned about mchaggis the house jemima jemimas questions about him and does he love me yolanda is he the one yolanda should i give in and do what he asks yolanda but aside from moaning dark as the night that covers me which to barbara sounded suspiciously like a line from verse yolanda was able to relay nothing else she did say that abbott langer was likely to know more because jemima had been quite regular about her skating lessons and hed been impressed with her devotion to the ice its that house yolanda said in summation i tried to warn her about that house finding abbott langer was a simple matter the queens ice and bowl was just up the street as the psychic herself had said as its name suggested it combined the pleasures of tenpin bowling and ice skating it also offered a video arcade a food bar and a noise level guaranteed to coax migraines from individuals previously immune to them this came from all directions and comprised an utter cacophony of sounds rock n roll from the bowling area shrieks bleeps bangs buzzers and bells from the video arcade dance music from the skating rink shouts and screams from the skaters on the ice because of the time of year the place was aswarm with children and their parents and with young teenagers in need of a location in which to hang round send text messages and otherwise look cool also due to the ice it was quite pleasant in the building itself and this brought in more people off the street if only to lower their body temperature perhaps four dozen people were on the ice most of them clinging to the handrails at the side the musicwhat could be heard of it above the dinseemed designed to encourage smooth strokes of the feet but it wasnt working very well no one barbara noted save the skating instructors was keeping time and there were three of these obvious by the yellow waistcoats they were wearing obvious by the fact that they were the only ones who seemed able to skate backwards which looked to barbara like an admirable feat she and winston stood against the rail watching the action for a moment several children among the skaters appeared to be taking lessons in an area in the middle of the ice reserved for them they were being coached by a largish man with a helmet of hair that made him look like an elvis impersonator he was far bigger than one associated with ice skaters well over six feet tall and built like a refrigerator not at all fat but solid he was difficult not to notice not only because of the hair but also because he wasdespite his bulkremarkably light on his feet he turned out to be abbott langer and he joined them briefly at the side of the rink when one of the other instructors went out to fetch him he had to complete the lesson he was giving he said they could wait for him herewatch that little girl in pinkshes heading for the goldor they could wait for him in the food bar they chose the food bar since it was past teatime and shed not even had lunch barbara selected a ham salad sandwich saltandvinegar crisps a flapjack and a kit kat bar for herself as well as a coke to chase everything down winstonhow could she possibly be surprised by thischose an orange juice she scowled at him anyone ever comment on your revolting personal habits she asked him he shook his head only on my aura he replied that your dinner is it barb are you out of your mind ive not yet had my lunch abbott langer joined them as barbara was finishing up her meal hed put protective covers on the blades of his ice skates he had another lesson in half an hour he said what could he do for them barbara said weve come from yolanda shes completely legitimate he said at once is this a reference dyou mean to use her like on the telly ahno barbara said she sent us to have a word with you bout jemima hastings winston said shes dead mr langer dead what happened when did she die few days ago in abney his eyes widened shes the woman in the cemetery i saw it in the papers but theres been no name wont be till we find her family nkata said well i cant help you with that i dont know who they are he looked away from them in the direction of the ice rink where a pileup had occurred at the far end instructors were hurrying over to assist god but thats bad isnt it he looked back to them murdered in a cemetery it is barbara said cn you tell me how sorry they could not regulations police work the rules of investigation theyd come to the ice rink to gather information about jemima how long had he known her how well did he know her how did they meet abbott thought about this valentines day i remember because she brought balloons in for frazer he watched nkata writing in his notebook and added hes the bloke who hands out the rental skates over by the lockers frazer chaplin i thought at first that she was a delivery girl you know making a delivery of valentine balloons from frazers girlfriend but turned out she was the new girlfriendor at least she was trying to beand shed dropped in to surprise him we got introduced and we chatted a bit she was quite keen on having lessons so we made arrangements to meet we had to work around her schedule but that wasnt difficult well i was happy to accommodate wasnt i ive got three exwives with four children among them so i dont turn away paying customers you would have otherwise barbara asked turned her away no no well i mean i might have done ultimately if my own circumstances had been differentwhat with the wives and the kidsbut as she showed up regularly and right on time and as she always paid i couldnt really quibble if her mind seemed on other things when she was here could i what sorts of things do you know he looked like a man about to say that he hated to speak ill of the dead but then he eschewed that comment for i expect it had to do with frazer i think the lessons were really an excuse to be near him and thats why she couldnt actually keep her mind on what she was doing see frazers got something that attracts the ladies and when theyre attracted he doesnt exactly fight them off if you know what i mean we dont as it happens barbara said a lie naturally but they needed as many details as they could amass at this point he makes the odd arrangement abbott said delicately now and then dont misunderstand its always on the upandup as far as the ladies ages go no underage girls or anything they turn in their skates and have a word with him they slip him a card or a note or something andwell you know he goes off for a bit with one or the other sometimes he phones in late to his night employmenthes a bartender at some posh hoteland he takes a few hours with one of them hes not a bad bloke mind you its just how he is and jemima had an idea this was going on a suspicion women arent stupid are they but the trouble for jemima was that frazers here for the earliest shift and she could only come in the evening or on her own days off work so that leaves him free to be more or less available to ladies who want to flirt or to ladies who want more what was your own relationship with jemima barbara asked for she realised that yolandas mutteringsas much as she wanted to discount themcould well apply to this man with his helmet of black hair dark as the night mine he asked fingertips to his chest oh i never get involved with my skating students that would be unethical and anyway ive three exwives and four kids yes barbara said but i expect a poke on the side wouldnt go amiss if one was on offer and there were no strings the ice skater flushed i wont say i didnt notice she was attractive she was he said unconventional you know with those eyes of hers bit on the small side not much meat on her but she had a real friendliness about her not like the typical londoner i suspect a bloke could have taken that wrong if he wanted to you didnt however as three times were not the charm for me i wasnt about to go for a fourth ive not had luck in marriage celibacy i find keeps me safe from involvement but groundwork laid you could have had her i expect barbara pointed out after all a poke isnt marriage these days groundwork or not i wouldnt have tried it a poke may not lead to marriage these days but i had the feeling that wasnt the case for jemima are you saying she was after this frazer for marriage im saying she wanted marriage full stop i got the impression it could have been frazer but it could have been anyone else as well the time of day was such that frazer chaplin was no longer at the queens ice and bowl but this was not a problem the name was an unusual one and barbara reckoned there couldnt be two frazer chaplins running round town this had to be the same bloke who lived in bella mchaggiss house barbara informed nkata they needed a word with him on their way across town she put winston in the picture with regard to bella mchaggiss rules about fraternisation among her lodgers if jemima hastings and frazer chaplin had been involved their landlady either had not known it or had turned a blind eye for reasons of her own which barbara seriously doubted in putney they found bella mchaggis just entering her property with a shopping trolley half filled with newspapers as nkata parked the car mrs mchaggis began unloading this trolley into one of the large plastic bins in her front garden she was doing her bit for the environment she informed them when they came through the gate bloody neighbours wouldnt recycle a damn thing if she didnt make an issue of it barbara made an appropriate murmur of sympathy and then asked was frazer chaplin at home this is ds nkata she added by way of introduction what dyou lot want with frazer bella said its paolo you ought to be talking to what i found i found in his cupboard not frazers beg your pardon barbara asked look could we go inside mrs mchaggis when im finished here bella said some things are important to some people miss barbara had an inclination to tell the woman that murder was definitely one of those things but instead she rolled her eyes at nkata as bella mchaggis went back to unloading her trolley of newspapers when shed accomplished this she told them to follow her inside and theyd not made it farther than the entrywith its lists of rules and its signs about the landladys presence on the propertywhen bella gave them an earful about her evidence and demanded to know why they hadnt dispatched someone at once to collect it i rang that number i did the one in the daily mail asking for information well ive got information dont i and youd think theyd come by and ask one or two of their questions about it and youd think theyd come on the run she led them into the dining room where the number of broadsheets and tabloids she had spread on the table suggested she was closely following the progress of the investigation she said they were meant to sit there while she fetched what they wanted and when barbara pointed out that what they wanted was a word with frazer chaplin if he was at home she said oh dont be such a ninny hes a man but he isnt a fool sergeant and have you done anything about that psychic i rang the police about her as well hanging about outside my property again there she was large as life weve had a word with yolanda barbara said thank god for small mercies bella seemed about to relent on the matter of frazer chaplin but then her face altered as she made the mental leap from what barbara had just said to what barbara and winston nkata wanted a word with frazer she said why that mad bloody cow shes said something about frazer hasnt she shes told you something thats brought you here on the run and you mean to arrest him well im not having that not with paolo and his five engagements and his bringing jemima here as a lodger and that argument of theirs just a friend he tells me and she agrees and then look what happens let me clarify that yolanda said nothing about frazer chaplin barbara said were coming at him from another angle so if youd fetch him because if he isnt here what other angle there is no other angle oh you wait right there and ill prove it to you she marched out of the dining room they heard her go up the stairs when she was gone winston looked at barbara felt like i ought to salute or summick shes quite the character barbara admitted then do you hear water running could frazer be having a shower his rooms below us the basement flat she doesnt seem to want us to see him does she protecting him think she fancies him it fits with what abbott langer said about frazer and the ladies eh bella returned to them a white envelope in her hand with the triumphant air of a woman whod outsherlocked the best of them she told them to have a look at that that turned out to be a thin spatulate finger of plastic with a slip of paper emerging from one end of it and a ridged area at the other in the middle were two small windows one round and one square the centre of each of these was coloured with a thin blue line one horizontal and one vertical barbara had never seen one beforeshed hardly been in a position of need when it came to such thingsbut she knew what she was looking at and so apparently did winston a pregnancy test bella announced and it wasnt among jemimas belongings was it it was in paolos clobber paolos well i daresay paolos not testing himself is he not likely barbara agreed but how do you reckon thiss jemimas i assume thats what youre thinking eh its obvious they shared the bathroom and the toilets in the bathroom she either gave this to himwith a jerk of her head towards the slip of paperor whats more likely he saw it in the rubbish and fished it out and that explains their quarrel oh he said it was due to a misunderstanding about jemimas hanging her smalls in the bath and she said it had to do with that malefemale nonsense about leaving the toilet seat up but let me tell you i had a feeling about them from the first they were butter wouldnt melt and all the rest of it friends from the workplace in covent garden i happened to have a vacant room and he happened to know of someone who was looking and could he bring her mrs mchaggis she seems a nice enough sort of girl he says and there i was ready to believe the two of them while all the time theyre sneaking round on the floor below me going at it like monkeys behind my back well let me tell you right now if she wasnt dead shed be gone out finished on her ear on the pavement right where yolanda wanted her barbara concluded all well and good but yolanda would hardly have sneaked into the house and planted a pregnancy test in the bathroom on the slight chance that bella mchaggis would find it jump to conclusions and evict the one lodger yolanda wanted to get her mitts on or would she barbara said well take this into consideration you damn well bloody will bella said its motive loud and clear and make no mistake big as life right before your eyes she leaned across the table her palm flat on the front of the daily express hes been engaged five times mind you five times and what does that say about him well ill tell you what it says it says desperate and desperate means a man wholl stop at nothing and youre talking about paolo di fazio who else anyone else barbara reckoned and she could see winston was thinking the same she said right yes they would have a word with paolo di fazio i should certainly hope you will hes got himself a lockup somewhere a place where he does his sculpting you ask me he dragged that poor girl into that place and did his worst and dumped her body yes yes whatever all of this would be checked out barbara assured her nodding towards winston to indicate that hed been scrupulously taking notes theyd be having a word with all of the lodgers and that did include paolo di fazio now as to frazer chaplin why do you want to make this about frazer bella demanded precisely because you dont barbara thought she said its a matter of putting a full stop to every possibility its what we do it was part and parcel of the job trace interview and eliminate as barbara was speaking the door leading down to the basement flat opened and shut and a mans pleasant voice called im off then mrs mch winston got to his feet he went out into the corridor that led towards the back of the house and said mr chaplin ds winston nkata wed like a word please a moment and then shll i ring dukes and let them know im expected at work in thirty minutes wont take long this nkata told him frazer followed winston into the room which gave barbara her first close look at the man dark as the night yet another she thought not that she intended to give credence to yolandas ravings but stillhe was a stone and he couldnt be left unturned he looked round thirty years old his olive skin was pockmarked but that didnt detract and while his shadowy stubble could have covered the scars if hed grown them into a beard he was wise not to have done so he looked piratical and a little dangerous which barbara knew some women found attractive he locked eyes with her then gave her a nod he was carrying a pair of shoes and he sat at the table and put these shoes on lacing them up and saying no thanks to bella mchaggiss offer of tea it was an offer that pointedly she did not make to the other two her attention to the manshe called him luvin addition to what abbott langer had told them about his effect on women made barbara want to suspect him on the spot which wasnt exactly good police work but she had an automatic aversion to men like this bloke because he had one of those unmistakable iknowwhatyouwantandivegotithereinmytrousers expressions on his face no matter the difference in their ages if he was giving it to bella on the side no wonder she was besotted and she was that much was clear far beyond the luv and the darling bella looked upon frazer with a fond expression that barbara might have considered maternal had she not been a cop whod seen just about every permutation of human entanglement in her years on the force mrs mch has told me about jemima frazer said that shes the one from the cemetery youll be wanting to know what i know and im glad to tell you i expect paolo will feel likewise as will everyone who knew her shes a lovely girl was barbara said as shes dead sorry was he looked something between bland and solemn and barbara wondered if he felt anything at all for the fact that his fellow lodger had been murdered somehow she doubted it we understand she had a bit of a thing for you barbara said winston did his part with the notebook and pencil but he was watching frazers every move balloons at valentines day and all the et ceteras what would those et ceteras be because as i see it sure theres no crime in an innocent delivery of six balloons bella mchaggiss eyes narrowed at this mention of balloons her glance went from the police to her lodger he said not to worry mrs mch i said id not be making the same mistake twice and youve got my word on it that i didnt what mistake would that be barbara asked he moved to get more comfortable in his seat he had a widelegged posture when sitting barbara noted one of those blokes who liked to show off the family jewels i had a bit of a fling at one time with a lass who lived here he said it was wrong and i know it and i did my penance mrs mch didnt toss me out on my ear as she otherwise might have done for which im grateful so i wasnt likely to go the waywardson route again considering what theyd heard from abbott langerif hed been speaking the truthbarbara had her doubts about frazers sincerity in this matter she said to him i understand you work at more than one job mr chaplin could you tell me where else youre employed besides the ice rink why bella mchaggis was the one to ask the question whats that got to do with its just procedure barbara told her what sort of procedure bella demanded its nothing mrs mch frazer said theyre just doing their jobs frazer said that he worked late afternoons and evenings in dukes hotel in st jamess he was the bartender there and had been for the last three years industrious barbara noted two jobs im saving he said its not a crime i believe saving for what hows that important bella demanded see here everythings important till we know its not barbara told her mr chaplin emigration he said to auckland why ive hopes to open a small hotel a lovely little boutique hotel as it happens anyone helping you save he frowned what dyou mean young lady prhaps contributing to your hotel fund making plans thinking shell be included youre speaking of jemima i expect why would you jump to that conclusion because otherwise youd not have the slightest interest he smiled and added unless youd like to contribute yourself no thanks alas you join the score of other ladies who allow me to build my savings on my own and that would include jemima he slapped his thighs in a gesture of finality and rose from his chair as you said this would take only a moment and as ive another job to go to you run along luv bella mchaggis told him she added meaningfully if theres anything more to be dealt with here ill see to it thanks mrs mch frazer said and he squeezed her shoulder bella looked gratified at the moment of contact barbara reckoned that was part of the frazer effect she said to both of them do stay in town i have a feeling were going to want to talk to you again when they returned to victoria street the afternoon debriefing had already begun barbara found herself looking for lynley as she entered the room and then found herself irritated for doing so shed scarcely given her former partner a thought during the day and she wanted it that way nonetheless she clocked him on the far side of the room lynley nodded at her and a smile lifted just the corners of his mouth he looked at her over the top of his reading glasses and then back down at a sheaf of papers he was holding isabelle ardery was standing at the china board listening to john stewarts report stewart and the constables working with him had been given the unenviable task of dealing with the masses of material theyd taken from jemima hastings lodgings at the moment the di was talking about rome ardery looked impatient as if waiting for a salient point to emerge that didnt seem close to happening stewart was saying the common denominator is the invasion shes got plans from both the british museum and the museum of london and the rooms circled relate to the romans the invasion the occupation the fortresses all the clobber they left behind and she bought a mass of postcards from both museums and a book called roman britain as well but you said shed also got a plan of the national gallery and the portrait gallery philip hale pointed out hed been taking notes and he referred to these and the geffrye the tate modern and the wallace collection looks to me like she was having a recce of london john sightseeing again from his notes sir john soanes house charles dickens house thomas carlyles house westminster abbey the tower of londonshe had brochures for all of them right true but if we want to find a connection the connection is that she was a tourist john isabelle ardery went on to tell them that so had sent over a report and there was good news on that front the fibres on her clothing had been identified they constituted a blend of cotton and rayon and they were yellow in colour they matched nothing that the girl herself was wearing so there was a very good chance that they had yet another connection to her killer yellow barbara said abbott langer bloke at the ice rink he wears a yellow waistcoast all of the instructors do she told them about the iceskating lessons jemima had been taking could be the fibres were left from a lesson well want that waistcoat then ardery said his or someone elses get someone to fetch one for fabric testing she went on with weve also had a curious description phoned in as a result of all the publicity it seems that a rather filthy man came out of abney park cemetery in the window of time of jemima hastings murder he was seen by an elderly woman waiting for the bus just at an entrance to the cemetery on stoke newington church street she recalled him because she saidand i spoke to her myselfhe looked as if hed been rolling in leaves he had quite long hair and he was either japanese chinese vietnamese oras she put itone of those oriental types he was wearing black trousers carrying some sort of case although she couldnt tell me what kindshe thought it might be a briefcaseand he had the rest of his clothing bundled up beneath his arm except for his jacket which he was wearing inside out weve got someone with her trying to come up with an efit and if were lucky well get some hits on that once we release it sergeants havers and nkata nkata nodded at barbara letting her do the honours decent bloke she thought and she wondered how winston had come to be so prescient and simultaneously so completely without ego she made their report yolanda the psychic a recap of abbott langer and iceskating lessons and the reason for the iceskating lessons the balloons the pregnancy testturns out it was negative she saidfrazer chaplin and paolo di fazio to this she added the argument overheard between paolo di fazio and the victim paolos ostensible lockup where he did his sculpting frazers way with the ladies bella mchaggiss possible nonmaternal interest in frazer frazers second job at dukes hotel and his plans to emigrate background checks on all of them isabelle said at the conclusion of barbaras remarks barbara said well get to that straightaway but ardery said no i want you twoyou and sergeant nkatadown in hampshire philip you and your people take the background checks hampshire barbara said whats hampshire ardery put them in the picture giving them a summary of what theyd missed during the earlier part of the debriefing she and di lynley she said had come up with these and youll need to take one along with you to hampshire she handed over a postcard which barbara saw was a smaller version of the national portrait gallery poster of jemima hastings on the front of it have you seen this woman was printed in black marker along with an arrow indicating that the card was meant to be flipped over on the reverse was a phone number a mobile number by the look of it the number ardery told her belonged to a bloke in hampshire called gordon jossie she and sergeant nkata were to go there and see what mr jossie had to say for himself pack a bag because i expect this might take more than one day she told them there were the usual hoots at this remarks of oohh holiday time you two and mind you get separate rooms winnie to which ardery said sharply thatll do as dorothea harriman came into the room she had a slip of paper in her hand a telephone message she handed this to ardery the superintendent read it she looked up satisfaction playing across her face weve got a name to attach to the first efit she announced gesturing to the china board on which hung the efit generated from the two adolescents whod stumbled on the body in the cemetery one of the volunteers at the cemetery thinks its a boy called marlon kay inspector lynley and i will see about him the rest of youyouve got your assignments any questions no all right then they would begin again in the morning she told them there were several looks of surprise exchanged an evening off what was she thinking no one questioned it however there being far too few gift horses in the midst of an investigation the team began their preparations to depart as ardery said thomas to lynley and a word in my office lynley nodded ardery left the incident room he didnt follow at once however instead he went to the china board to have a look at the photographs assembled there and barbara took the opportunity to approach him hed put his reading glasses on once again and he was observing the aerial photographs and comparing them to the drawn diagram of the crime scene she said to his back didnt have a chance earlier and he turned round from the china board barbara he said his form of greeting she gazed at him intently because she wanted to read him and what she wanted to read was the why and the how and what it all meant she said glad to have you back sir i didnt say before thank you he didnt add that it was good to be there as someone else might have done it wouldnt be good to be there she reckoned it would all be part of just soldiering on she said i just wonderedhowd she manage it what she wanted to know was what it really meant that hed come back to the met what it meant about him what it meant about her what it meant about isabelle ardery and what it meant about who had power and influence and who had nothing of the kind he said the obvious she wants the job and youre here to help her get it it just seemed like time she came to see me at home right well barbara heaved her shoulder bag into position she wanted something more from him but she couldnt bring herself to ask the question bit different is all was what she came up with im off then like i said its good that youre barbara his voice was grave it was also bloody kind he knew what she was thinking and feeling and he always had done which she truly really hated about the bloke it doesnt matter he said what this it doesnt matter actually they had one of those dueling eyeball moments he was good at reading at anticipating at understandingat all those sodding interpersonal skills that made one person a good cop and another person the metaphorical bull knocking about among mummys antique wedgwood all right she said yeah thanks another moment of locked eyes till someone said tommy will you have a look and he turned from her philip hale was approaching and that was just as well barbara took the opportunity to make herself scarce but as she drove home she wondered if hed been speaking the truth about things not mattering for the fact was that she didnt like it that her partner was working with isabelle ardery although she didnt much want to think about why this was the case chapter twelve the next morning it was largely because of what barbara didnt want to think about that she went about packing a bag for the trip shed been assigned to take by making sure that not a single item she placed within it would have met with isabelle arderys approval this was a job that took little time and less thought and she was just finishing up when a knock on her door told her that winston nkata had arrived hed wisely suggested they take his motor as hers was notoriously unreliable and besides fitting his rangy frame into an ancient mini would have created an excruciating ride for him she said s open and she lit up a fag because she knew she was going to need to toke up on the nicotine since nkata was she also knew not about to let her foul the interior of his perfectly maintained vauxhall with cigarette smoke not to mentionhorrorsa microscopic bit of ash barbara havers you know youre meant to stop smoking hadiyyah announced barbara swung round from the daybed where shed placed her holdall she saw not only her little neighbour but hadiyyahs father both of them framed in the doorway of her cottage hadiyyah with her brown arms crossed and one foot stuck out as if she was about to begin tapping it like an aggrieved schoolteacher faced with a recalcitrant pupil azhar stood behind her three plastic food boxes stacked in his hands he used them to gesture with as he smiled and said from last night barbara we decided the chicken jalfrezi was one of my better attempts and as hadiyyah herself made the chapatisperhaps for your own dinner tonight brilliant barbara said definitely better than the jar of bolognese mince with cheddar on toast which was what id had planned barbara hadiyyahs voice was saintly even in nutritional remonstration except barbara asked would it keep in the fridge as she was actually heading off for a day or so before she could explain matters further hadiyyah cried out in horror and dashed across the room where she scooted behind the television set and picked up what barbara had mindlessly hurled there whatve you done with your nice aline skirt she demanded shaking it out barbara whyre you not wearing it arent you meant to be wearing it whys it behind the telly oh look its got sluts wool all over it now barbara winced she tried to play for time by taking the plastic containers from azhar and stowing them in her fridge without allowing him to see its interior condition which looked rather like an experiment in creating a new life form she drew in on her cigarette and kept it clamped between her lips as she managed this manoeuvre inadvertently spilling ash onto her tshirt which asked the world how many toads does one girl have to kiss she brushed it off making a smear swore quietly and faced the fact that she was going to have to answer at least one of hadiyyahs questions got to have it altered she told the little girl bit overlong which is what we decided when i tried it on remember you said it needed to be middle of the knee and its definitely not that dangling round my legs in a bloody unattractive fashion it is but whys it behind the telly hadiyyah asked not illogically cause if you mean to have it altered oh that barbara did one or two mental gymnastics and came up with ill forget to do it if i put it in the wardrobe but there behind the telly turn the telly on and what do i see that skirt reminding me it needs making shorter hadiyyah didnt look convinced what about the makeup youre not wearing your makeup today either are you barbara i cn help you with it you know i used to watch mummy all the time she wears makeup mummy wears all sorts of makeup doesnt she dad barbara dyou know that mummy that will do khushi azhar told his daughter but i was only going to say barbara is busy as you can see and you and i have an urdu lesson to go to do we not he said to barbara as i have only one lecture at the university today we were going to invite you to come with us after hadiyyahs lesson a canal trip to regents park for an ice but it seems he gestured at barbaras holdall still unzipped upon her bed hampshire she said and glimpsing winston nkata approaching from beyond the cottage door which still stood open and heres my date nkata had to duck to enter the cottage and when he was inside he seemed to fill the place like her he was wearing something that would be more comfortable than his usual getup unlike her he still managed to look professional but then his sartorial mentor was thomas lynley and barbara couldnt imagine lynley ever looking anything but well put together nkata was in casual trousers and a pale green shirt the trousers had creases that would have made a military man weep with joy and hed somehow managed to drive across london without getting a single wrinkle in his shirt how barbara wondered was that even possible seeing him hadiyyahs eyes grew round and her face solemn nkata nodded a hello to her father and said to the little girl i expect youre hadiyyah eh what happened to your face she asked him youve got a scar khushi azhar sounded appalled his face spoke of a rapid assessment being made of barbaras visitor wellbroughtup young ladies do not knife fight nkata told her in a friendly fashion and he said to azhar its okay mon get asked all the time hard not to notice innit girl he squatted to give her a better look one of us had a knife see and th other had a razor now thing is this razor shes fast and she does damage but the knife shes gonna win in the end important piece of knowledge that barbara said very useful in gang warfare hadiyyah youre in a gang hadiyyah asked as nkata resumed his full height she looked up at him her expression awed was he said thas where this came from and to barbara ready want me to wait in the car barbara wondered why he asked the question and what he thought his immediate absence was meant to accomplish a fond farewell between herself and her neighbour what a ludicrous idea she considered the reasons winston might be thinking that and she took note of azhars expression which spoke of a level of discomfort that she couldnt remember having ever seen in him she sifted through various possibilities suggested by three plastic containers of leftover dinner hadiyyahs urdu lesson a canal trip and winston nkatas appearance at her cottage and she came up with something too stupid to consider in the light of day she quickly rejected it then went on to realise shed referred to winston as her date and that in combination with her packing a bag must have made azharas proper as a regency gentlemanthink she was heading off for a few days in the country with her tall nicelooking wellbuilt athletic and likely deliciousinalltherightways lover the very thought made her want to guffaw herself winston nkata candlelit dinners wine roses romance and a few nights of bouncybounce in a hotel heavily hung with wisteriashe snorted and covered the snort with a cough she made a quick introduction between the two men casually adding ds nkata weve got a case in hampshire once shed said winstons full name she turned to the daybed before azhar responded hearing hadiyyah say youre a policeman as well like barbara you mean just like nkata said barbara heaved her holdall to her shoulder as hadiyyah said to her father cn he come on the canal boat as well dad to which azhar replied barbara herself said theyre going to hampshire khushi they left the cottage all of them together they set off towards the front of the house barbara and winston were behind the others but barbara still heard hadiyyah say i forgot about hampshire i mean but if they werent what if they werent dad could he come as well barbara couldnt hear azhars reply lynley drove them once again in isabelles car and once again the arrangement seemed fine with him he didnt attempt to hold the door open for her another timehe hadnt done so since shed corrected him about thisand again he gave the driving his complete attention shed lost the plot on where in london they were just after clerkenwell so when her mobile phone rang as they were coursing by a nameless park she took the call sandra wants to know do you want a visit it was bob speaking without preamble as usual isabelle cursed herself for not having examined the number of the incoming call although knowing bob he likely would be ringing her from a phone she couldnt identify anyway hed like to do that stealth was his main weapon she said with a glance at lynley who wasnt paying attention to her anyway what dyou have in mind sunday lunch you could come out to kent the boys will be happy to with them dyou mean alone in a hotel restaurant or something obviously not he said i was going to say that the boys will be happy to have you join us sandrall do a joint of beef ginny and kate actually have a birthday party to go to on sunday so so it would be the five of us then well yes i can hardly ask sandra to leave her own house can i isabelle a hotel would be better a restaurant a pub the boys could not going to happen sunday lunch with us is the best offer ill make she said nothing she watched what went for london scenery as they passed it rubbish on the pavements bleak storefronts with grimy plastic signs naming each establishment women dressed in black bedsheets with slits for their eyes sadlooking displays of fruit and veg outside greengrocers video rental shops william hill betting loungeswhere the hell were they isabelle are you there bob asked have i lost you is the connection yes she thought thats exactly it the connections broken she closed her phone when it rang again a moment later she let it do so till her voice mail picked it up sunday lunch she thought she could picture it bob presiding over the joint of beef sandra simpering somewhere nearbyalthough truth to tell sandra didnt simper and she was a more than decent sort for which isabelle was actually grateful all things consideredthe twins scrubbed and shiny and perhaps just a little perplexed at this modern definition of family that they were experiencing with mummy dad and stepmum gathered round the dining table as if it happened every day of the week roast beef yorkshire pud and sprouts being handed round and everyone waiting for everyone else to be served and grace to be said by whoever said it because isabelle didnt know and didnt want to know and damn well did know that there was no way in bloody hell she was going to put herself through sunday lunch at her former husbands house because he didnt mean well he was out to punish her or to blackmail her further and she couldnt face that or face her boys you dont want to threaten me you dont want to take this to court isabelle she said abruptly to lynley where in gods name are we thomas how long did it take you to be able to find your way round this bloody place a glance only he was too well bred to mention the phone call he said youll sort it out faster than you think just avoid the underground im a member of the hoi polloi thomas i didnt mean it that way he said easily i meant that the undergroundthe map of the underground actuallybears no relation to the actual layout of the city its printed as it is to make it understandable it shows things north south east or west of each other when that might not necessarily be the case so take the bus instead walk drive its not as impossible as it seems youll sort it out quickly enough she doubted that it wasnt that one area looked exactly like the next on the contrary one area was generally quite distinct from the next the difficulty was in sussing out how they related each to the other why a landscape of dignified georgian buildings should suddenly morph into an area of tenements it simply made no sense when they came upon stoke newington she was unprepared there it was before her recognisable by a flower shop that she remembered from her earlier journey housed in a building with walker bros fount pen specialists painted onto the bricks between its first and second floors this would be stoke newington church street so the cemetery was just up ahead she congratulated herself on recalling that much she said the main entrance is on the high street to the left on the corner that was where lynley parked and they went into the information office just outside the gates there they explained their purpose to a wizened female volunteer and isabelle brought out the efit that had prompted the phone call to new scotland yard this individual had not made the callthat would likely have been mr fluendy she said im mrs littlejohnbut she recognised the efit herself i expect thats the boy does the carving that is she said i hope you lot are here to arrest him cos we been ringing the local coppers bout that carving since my granny was a girl let me tell you you come ere you two ill show you what im talking about she shooed them out of the information office hung a sign on the door indicating to the nonexistent hordes of visitors that shed return momentarily and toddled into the cemetery they followed she took them to one of the trees that isabelle had seen on her first visit to the place its trunk was carved with an elaborate design of quarter moon and stars with clouds obscuring part of the latter the carving went all the way down the trunk of the tree entirely baring it of bark it was not the sort of thing one could have done quickly or easily the carving measured at least four feet high and took up perhaps two feet of the trees circumference the defacing of the tree aside it was actually quite good hes done this everywhere the woman declared we been trying to catch him at it but he lives over listria park he does and that backs onto the cemetery i spect he just comes over the wall so we never know hes here easy as pie when youre young eh listria park was not as isabelle had first supposed an actual park it was instead a street comprising a curve of buildings that had once been individual homes but now were flats with windows overlooking abney park cemetery and gardens over the wall from it as mrs littlejohn had described it took some doing to find the building in which marlon kay lived but once theyd done so they discovered themselves in luck as the boy was at home so was his father and it was apparently this individual whose disembodied voice replied when they rang the buzzer next to the name d w kay he barked out yeah wha you want isabelle nodded at lynley who did the honours metropolitan police were looking for even through the crackling connection from the street to the flat they could hear the commotion lynleys words provoked a crash of furniture a pounding of feet a wha the bloody hellwhere you think yourewhad you do and then the buzzer went to open the door and they pushed their way inside they headed for the stairs just as a heavyset boy came storming down them he ploughed towards them wild eyed and sweating making for the door to the street it was an easy matter for lynley to stop him one arm did that much the other secured him lemme go the boy shrieked hell murder me he will while above a man roared get your bum back up ere rotten little lout little was hardly an accurate adjective while the boy wasnt obese he was still a sterling example of modern youths proclivity for victuals deep fried fast and loaded with various kinds of fats and sugars marlon kay isabelle said to the struggling youth being detained by lynleys grip upon him let me go he screamed hell beat me bloody you don unnerstan d w kay came hurtling down the stairs at that point cricket bat in his hands he was swinging this wildly as he shouted whad you fooking do you fooking better tell me fore these coppers do or ill smack your head from here to wales and make no mistake isabelle put herself squarely in his path she said sharply that will do mr kay put that cricket bat down before i have you in the nick for assault perhaps it was her tone it stopped the man in his tracks he stood before her breathing like a defeated racehorsewith breath however that smelled like teeth decaying straight up to his brain he blinked at her she said i assume you are mr kay and this is marlon we want a word with him marlon whimpered he shrank back from his father he said hell bash me he will hell do nothing of the sort isabelle told the boy mr kay lead us up to your flat ive no intention of having a discussion in the corridor dw looked her up and downshe could tell he was the sort of man who had what pop psychologists would refer to as woman issuesand then he looked at lynley his expression said that as far as he was concerned lynley wore lace panties if he let a woman give orders in his presence isabelle wanted to smack him into wales what century did he think they were living in she wondered she said do i have to tell you again he snarled but cooperated back up the stairs he went and the rest of them followed marlon cowering in lynleys grip a middleaged woman in cycling gear was standing at the top of the first flight of stairs she made a moue that combined dislike distaste and disgust and said about time you ask me to mr kay he shoved her out of the way and she said did you see that did you see that to lynley ignoring isabelle altogether her cry of are you finally going to do something about him was the last they heard from her as they shut the door behind them inside the flat the windows were open but as there was no cross ventilation their gaping apertures did nothing to mitigate the temperature the place itself was remarkably not a pigsty as isabelle had been expecting there was a suspicious white layer upon nearly everything but this turned out to be plaster dust as they discovered that d w kay was a plasterer by trade and hed been setting out to work when theyd rung the buzzer isabelle told him they needed a word with his son and she asked marlon how old he was marlon said sixteen and he winced as if anticipating that his age was cause for corporal punishment isabelle sighed what his age was cause for was the presence of an adult who was not police preferably a parent which meant that they were going to have to question the boy either in the presence of his glowering and explosive father or with a social worker she looked at lynley appropriately his expression said it was her call as she was his superior she said to the boys father were going to have to question marlon about the cemetery i take it you know that theres been a murder there mr kay the mans face became inflamed his eyes bulged he was isabelle thought a massive stroke waiting to happen she went on we can question him here or at the local nick if we do it here youll be required not only to keep quiet but also to keep your hands off this boy from now until eternity occurs if you do not youll be arrested at once one phone call from him from a neighbour from anyone and in you go a week a month a year ten years i cant tell you what the judge will throw at you but i can tell that what i just witnessed below is something that i will testify to and i expect your neighbours will be happy to do likewise am i being clear or do you require further elucidation on this topic he nodded he shook his head isabelle assumed he was answering both questions and said very well sit down and keep quiet he skulked to a grey sofa which was part of a sadlooking threepiece suite of a sort isabelle hadnt seen in years complete with a tasseled fringe he sat round him plaster dust rose in a cloud lynley deposited marlon in one of the two chairs and himself went to the window where he remained standing resting against the sill everything in the room faced a huge flatscreen television which was featuring a cooking programme at the moment although the sound was muted a remote lay beneath it and isabelle picked this up and switched the set off which for some reason caused marlon to whimper once again as if a lifeline had been cut his father curled a lip at him isabelle shot him a look the man rearranged his features she nodded sharply and went to sit in the other armchair dusty like everything else she told marlon the bare facts hed been seen emerging from the shelter next to the ruined chapel inside the cemetery within that shelter a young womans body had been found a magazine with one persons fingerprints on it had been dropped in the vicinity of that body an efit had been generated by the persons whod seen him coming out of that shelter and should an identity parade be needed there was little doubt that hed be picked from it although because of his age theyd likely use photographs and not require him to stand in a line did he want to talk about any of this the boy began to blub his father rolled his eyes but said nothing marlon isabelle prompted he sniveled and said its only cos i hate school they bully me its cos my bums likeits big innit an they make fun and its allas been tha way an i hate it so i wont go i got to leave here though dont i so i go there into the cemetery rather than to school thas it innit its summer holidays lynley pointed out im talkin bout school time innit marlon said now i go th cemetery cos thas what i do nuffink else round here and i dont got friends do i so you go to the cemetery and you carve on the trees isabelle said marlon shifted round on his barrel of a bum dint say have you wood carving tools lynley said i dint do nuffink to that tart she was dead when i got there want she so you did go into the shelter by the chapel isabelle said to the boy you admit youre the person our witnesses saw coming out of the shelter four days ago the boy didnt confirm but he didnt deny isabelle said what were you doing there i do the trees he said an theres no harm in it makes em pretty is all i dont mean what were you doing in the cemetery isabelle told him i mean in the shelter whyd you go into the shelter the boy swallowed this was it seemed the crux of the matter he looked at his father his father looked away marlon whispered magazine it wassee i bought it an wanted to have a glance and he gazed at her desperately casting a glance at lynley as well it was only tha when i saw them pitchers in the magazinethem womenyou know marlon are you trying to tell me you went into the shelter to masturbate over pictures of naked women isabelle asked baldly he began to weep in earnest his father said fooking twat and isabelle shot him a look lynley said thatll do mr kay marlon hid his face in his hands pinching his cheeks with his fingers saying i jus wantedso i went inside there toyou knowbut there she was an i got scared an i run off i could see she was dead couldnt i there was bugs an things an her eyes were open an the flies were crawlingi know i shoulda done summat but i couldnt cos icos icops wouldve asked what i was doing like youre askin now and id have to say like im sayin now and he already hates me and he would find out i wont go to school i wont go i wont but she was dead when i got there she was dead she was he was likely speaking the truth isabelle reckoned as she couldnt imagine the boy having the bottle to commit an act of violence he seemed the least aggressive child shed ever encountered but even a boy such as marlon could snap and one way or another he needed to be eliminated as a suspect she said all right marlon i tend to think you might be telling the truth i am im going to ask you further questions though and youre going to need to be calmer can you manage that his father blew a breath of air from his mouth not bloody likely would have been his words marlon cast a fearful look at his father and then nodded his eyes welling with more tears but he wiped his cheekshe somehow made this a heroic gestureand he sat up straight isabelle went through the questions did he touch the body no he did not did he remove anything from the site no he did not how near did he get to the body he didnt know three feet four he took a step or two inside the shelter but that was all cos he saw her anfine fine isabelle said hoping to avoid another descent into hysteria what happened then he dropped the magazine and ran he didnt mean to drop it he didnt even know hed dropped it but when he saw he didnt have it with him he was too scared to go back cos i never seen a dead person not like that he went on to say that she was all bloody down the front of her did he see a weapon isabelle asked him he didnt even see where she was cut up he told her as far as he could tell it looked to him like she was sliced up everywhere cos there was so much blood wouldnt a person have to be sliced up everywhere to have so much blood on em isabelle redirected him from inside the shelter to outside the shelter true it was at least a day after the killing itself when marlon had come upon the body as things turned out but whomever hed seen in the vicinitywhatever hed seen in the vicinitycould be important to the investigation but hed seen nothing and when it came to jemima hastings handbag or anything else she might have possessed the boy swore hed not taken a thing if she had a bag with her he knew nothing of it it mightve been right there next to her he avowed and he wouldntve even known it was there cos all he saw was her he said an all that blood but you didnt report this isabelle said the only report we had was from the young couple who saw you marlon why didnt you report it them carvings he said an the magazine ah defacing public property buying pornographic magazines masturbatingor at least intending to do soin public these had been his considerations as had no doubt been the displeasure of his father and the fact that his father seemed to express that displeasure by means of a cricket bat i see well were going to need a few things from you will you cooperate with us he nodded vigorously cooperation no problem anything at all they would need a sample of his dna which a swab from his mouth would happily provide they would also require his shoes and his fingerprints which would be easy enough to obtain and his carving tools were going to have to be handed over for inspection by forensics i expect isabelle said youve got any number of sharp objects among them yes well we need to test them all marlon the welling of eyes the whimper the fathers impatient and bulllike breath its all to prove youre telling the truth she assured the boy are you marlon are you telling the truth swear he said swear swear swear isabelle wanted to tell him that one swearing was enough but she reckoned shed be wasting her time as they walked back to the car the superintendent asked lynley what he was thinking she said to him its not entirely necessary for you to keep silent in that sort of situation you know he glanced at her considering the heat of the day and their encounter with the kays she was managing to look remarkably collected unruffled professional even cool in the blasting sun wiselyif unusuallyshe wore not a summer suit but a sleeveless dress and lynley realised it served more than one purpose in that it likely made her more comfortable at the same time as it made her less intimidating when she questioned people people like marlon he thought an adolescent boy whose trust she needed to garner he said i didnt think you needed my help she cut in sharply thats not what i was implying thomas lynley looked at her again actually i was going to say my participation he told her ah sorry youre prickly about it then not at all she fished in her bag and brought out a pair of dark glasses then she sighed and said well thats not true i am prickly but one has to be in our line of work its not easy for a woman which part isnt easy the investigation promoting navigating the corridors of power in victoria street dubious though they may be oh its easy for you to have the odd chuckle at my expense she noted but i dont expect any man comes up against the kinds of things a woman has to cope with especially a man she seemed unwilling to finish her thought he did it for her a man like me well really thomas you can hardly argue that a life of privilegethe family pile in cornwall eton oxfordremember i do know a bit about youhas made it difficult for you to succeed in your line of work and why do you do it anyway certainly you dont need to be a policeman doesnt your sort of man generally do something less she seemed to be searching for the right term and she settled on less elbow rubbing with the great unwashed such as i dont know sit on boards of hospitals and universities breed thoroughbred horses manage propertyhis own naturallyand collect rent from farmers wearing flat caps and wellingtons those would be the ones who come to the kitchen door and keep their eyes cast downward the ones who hastily remove those flat caps in my presence pulling on their forelocks and all the rest what in gods name is a forelock she asked ive always wondered i mean its clear that its hair and its in the front but how much of it constitutes a fore of it and why on earth would someone pull it its all part of the bowing and scraping he said solemnly part of the general peasantandmaster routine that comprises life for my sort of man she looked at him damn you your eyes are actually twinkling he said sorry and he smiled she said its bloody hot isnt it look i need something cool to drink thomas and we could use the time to talk theres got to be a pub nearby he reckoned there was but he also wanted to have a look at the spot where the body had been found theyd arrived back at her car at the front of the cemetery and he made his request would she take him to the chapel where jemima hastings body had been found even as he spoke the words he recognised another step being taken five months since his wifes murder on the front steps of their house in february even a hint that he might be willing to look upon a place where someone had died had been unthinkable as he reckoned she might the superintendent asked why he wanted to see it she sounded suspicious as if she thought he was checking up on her work she pointed out that the site had been checked had been cleared had been reopened to the public and he told her that it was curiosity and nothing more hed seen the pictures he wanted to see the place she acquiesced he followed her inside the cemetery and along paths that twisted into the trees it was cooler here with foliage sheltering them from the sun and no concrete pavements sending the heat upward in unavoidable waves he noticed that she was what once would have been called a fine figure of a woman as she strode ahead of him and she walked as she seemed to do everything else with confidence at the chapel she directed him round the side there the shelter stood and beyond it the baked grass of a clearing gave onto more of the graveyard a stone bench on the edge of this another stone bench was across from the first with three overgrown tombs and one crumbling mausoleum behind it fingertip perimeter and a grid producing a diligent search ardery told him nothing except what youd expect in this kind of place which would be soft drink cans and other assorted rubbish pencils pens plans of the park crisp bags chocolate wrappers old oyster cardsyes theyre being checked intoand enough used condoms to give one hope that sexually transmitted diseases might one day be a thing of the past and then oh sorry that wasnt appropriate hed been standing in the doorway to the shelter and he turned to see that a dark flush was climbing up her neck she said the condom thing other way round it could be construed as sexual harassment i apologise for the comment ah he said well no offence taken but ill be on guard in the future so take care guv isabelle she said you can call me isabelle im on duty he said what dyou make of the graffito he indicated the wall of the shelter where god goes wireless and the eye in the triangle were rendered in black old she said placed here long before her death and smacking of the masons you were of the same mind good she said and when he turned back to her he saw that the flush on her skin was receding she said if youve seen enough then id like that drink therere cafés on stoke newington church street and i expect we can find a pub as well they left the cemetery by a different route this one taking them past the monument which lynley recognised as the background that deborah st james had used for her photograph of jemima hastings it sat at the junction of two paths a marble lifesize male lion on a plinth he paused and read the monuments inscription that they would all meet again on some happy easter morning were that only the truth he thought the superintendent was watching him but she said nothing other than its this way thomas and she led him to the street they found both a café and a pub in very short order ardery chose the pub once inside she disappeared into the ladies telling him to order her a cider and saying for gods sake its mild thomas when he apparently looked surprised at her choice as they would be on duty for hours she told him that she wasnt about to police her team regarding their choice of liquid refreshment if someone wanted a lager in the middle of the day she didnt care its the work that matters she informed him and the quality of that work then off she went to the ladies for his part he ordered her ciderand make it a pint please shed saidand got a bottle of mineral water for himself he took these to a table tucked away in a corner then he changed his mind and chose another one more suitable he thought for two colleagues at work she proved herself a typical woman at least in matters pertaining to her disappearance into the ladies she was gone at least five minutes and when she returned shed rearranged her hair it was behind her ears now revealing earrings he saw they were navy edged in gold the navy matched the colour of her dress he wondered about the little vanities of women helen had never merely dressed in the morning she had put together entire ensembles for gods sake helen arent you only going out to buy petrol darling tommy i might actually be seen he blinked poured water into his glass there was lime with it and he squeezed the wedge hard ardery said thank you he said they had only one brand i didnt mean the cider i meant thank you for not standing up i expect you usually do ah that well the manners are beaten into one from birth but i reckoned youd rather i eschewed them at work have you ever had a female superior officer before and when he shook his head youre coping rather well its what i do you cope yes when he said it though he saw how it could lead to a discussion he didnt want to have so he said and what about you superintendent ardery you wont call me isabelle will you i wont whyever not this is private thomas were colleagues you and i on duty will that be your answer for everything he thought about this how convenient it was yes i expect it will and should i be offended not at all guv he looked at her and she held the look the moment became a manwoman thing that was always the risk when the sexes mixed with barbara havers it had always been something so far out of the question as to be nearly laughable with isabelle ardery this was not the case he looked away she said lightly i believed him you i realise he could have been going back to the scene of the crime checking on the body to see if shed been found yet but i dont think its likely he doesnt seem clever enough to have thought it all through you mean taking the magazine with him so it would appear he had a reason to duck into the shelter thats what i mean lynley agreed with her marlon kay was an unlikely killer the superintendent had gone the way of wisdom in dealing with the situation though before theyd left the boy and his surly father she made the arrangements for his fingerprints to be taken and his mouth to be swabbed and shed had a look through his clothing there was nothing yellow among it as for the trainers hed worn that day in the cemetery they were devoid of visible signs of blood but would be sent to forensics anyway in all of this marlon had been completely cooperative he seemed anxious to please them at the same time as he was eager to show he had nothing to do with the death of jemima hastings so were left with the sighting of the oriental man and lets hope that something comes of it ardery said or that something comes of this bloke in hampshire lynley noted theres that as well how dyou expect sergeant havers will cope with that part of the investigation thomas in her usual fashion he replied chapter thirteen bloody incredible ive never seen anything like it this was barbara havers reaction to the new forest and the herds of ponies running wild upon it there were hundreds of themthousands perhapsand they grazed freely wherever they had a mind to graze on the vast swatches of the grassland they munched on greenery with their foals nearby beneath primeval oaks and beeches and wandering among both rowan and birch they fed on the scrub growth and left in their wake a woodland floor dappled with sunlight spongy with decomposing leaves and devoid of weeds bushes and brambles it was nearly impossible not to be enchanted by a place where ponies lapped water in splashes and ponds and thatched cottages of whitewashed cob looked like buildings scrubbed on a daily basis grand vistas of hillsides displayed a patchwork in which the green of the bracken had begun to brown and the yellow of gorse was giving way to the increasing purple of heather almost makes me want to pack in london barbara declared she had the big az road atlas open upon her lap having acted as navigator for winston nkata during their drive theyd stopped once for lunch and another time for coffee and now they were wending their way from the a over to lyndhurst where they would make their presence known to the local coppers whose patch they were invading nice yeah was nkatas assessment of the new forest expect itd be a bit quiet for me though not to mention he glanced at her theres the raisin in the rice pud aspect of things oh right well barbara said and she reckoned he was correct on that score the country wasnt a place where theyd be finding a minority population and certainly not a population with nkatas background of brixton via west africa and the caribbean with a bit of a sidetrack into gang warfare on the housing estate good place for a holiday though mind how you go through town weve got a oneway system coming up they negotiated this with little trouble and found the lyndhurst police station just beyond town in the romsey road an undistinguished brick building in the tedious architectural style that fairly shouted s it squatted on the top of a small knoll with a crown of concertina wire and a necklace of cctv cameras marking it as an area of outofbounds to anyone not wishing his every movement to be monitored a few trees and a flower garden in front of the building attempted to soften the overall dismal air of the place but there was no disguising its institutional nature they showed their identification to the special constable apparently in charge of reception a young bloke who emerged from an internal room once they rang a buzzer placed on the counter for this purpose he looked interested but not overwhelmed by the idea that new scotland yard had come calling they told him they needed to speak to his chief super and he made much of going from their id pictures to their faces as if suspecting them of ill intentions he said hang on then and disappeared with their ids into the bowels of the station it was nearly ten minutes before he reappeared handed back their warrant cards and told them to follow him chief super he said was a bloke called zachary whiting hed been in a meeting but hed cut it short we wont keep him long barbara said just a courtesy call this if you know what i mean bring him into the picture so theres no misunderstanding later lyndhurst was the operational command headquarters for all the police stations in the new forest it was under the authority of a chief superintendent who himself reported to the constabulary in winchester one cop didnt wander onto another cops patch without making nice and all the et ceteras and that was what barbara and winston were there to do if anything currently going on in the area happened to apply to their investigation all the better barbara didnt expect this to be the case but one never knew where a professional obligation like this one could lead chief superintendent zachary whiting stood waiting for them at his desk behind spectacles his eyes watched them with some speculation hardly a surprising response to a call from new scotland yard when the met arrived it often meant trouble of the internal investigation sort winston gave barbara the nod so she did the honours making the introductions and then sketching out the details of the death in london she named jemima hastings as the victim she concluded with the reason for their incursion into his patch there was a mobile number on a postcard related to the victim barbara told whiting weve traced that number to a gordon jossie here in hampshire so she didnt add the rest the chief inspector would know the drill whiting said gordon jossie and he sounded thoughtful know him nkata asked whiting went to his desk and leafed through some paperwork barbara and winston exchanged glances has he been in trouble round here barbara asked whiting didnt reply directly at first he repeated the surname and then he said no not in trouble putting a hesitation before the final word as if gordon jossie had been in something else but you know the bloke nkata said again its just the name the chief superintendent apparently found what he was searching for in his stack of paperwork and this turned out to be a phone message weve had a phone call about him crank call if you ask me but evidently she was insistent so the message got passed along is that normal procedure barbara asked why would a chief superintendent want to be informed about phone calls crank or otherwise he said that it wasnt normal procedure at all but in this case the young lady wasnt taking no for an answer she wanted something done about a bloke called gordon jossie shed been asked did she want to make a formal complaint against the man but she was having none of that said she finds him a suspicious character whiting said bit odd that youd be informed sir barbara noted i wouldnt have been in the normal course of things but then a second young lady phoned saying much the same thing and thats when i learned about it seems odd to you no doubt but this isnt london its a small close place and i find it wise to know whats going on in it anticipating this bloke jossie might be up to something nkata asked nothing suggests that but thiswhiting indicated the phone messageputs him onto the radar he went on to tell the scotland yard officers they were welcome to go about their business on his patch and when they gave him jossies address he told them how to find the mans property near the village of sway if they needed his help or the help of one of his officersthere was something about the way he made the offer barbara had the feeling he was doing more than just making nice with them sway was located off the regularly traveled routes in the new forest the apex of a triangle created by itself lymington and new milton they drove there on lanes that became progressively narrower and they ended up in a stretch of road called pauls lane where houses had names but no numbers and tall hedges blocked most of them from view there were a number of cottages strung along the lane but only two substantial properties jossies turned out to be one of them they parked on the verge next to a tall hawthorn hedge they walked up the lumpy driveway and they found him within a paddock to the west of a neat cob cottage he was inspecting the rear hooves of two restless ponies under the baking sun he wore dark glasses as well as a baseball cap and he was protected further by long sleeves gloves trousers and boots this was not the case for the young woman watching him from outside the paddock she was calling out dyou think theyre ready for release yet and she was wearing a striped sundress that left her arms and legs bare despite the heat she looked fresh and cool and her head was covered by a straw hat banded by material that matched the dress hadiyyah barbara thought would have approved dead silly to be afraid of ponies gordon jossie replied im trying to make friends with them honestly she turned her head and caught sight of barbara and winston her gaze taking them both in but then going back to linger on winston she was very attractive barbara thought even with her own limited experience she could tell that the young woman wore her makeup like a pro again hadiyyah would have approved hullo the woman said to them are you lost at this gordon jossie looked up he watched their progress up the driveway and over to the fence this was barbed wire strung between wooden posts and his companion had been standing with her hands clasped on top of one of the latter jossie had the wiry sort of body that reminded barbara of a footballer when he took off his cap and wiped his brow with his arm she saw his hair was thinning but its ginger colour suited him well barbara and winston fished out their ids winston did the honours this time when hed finished the introductions he said to the man in the paddock youre gordon jossie jossie nodded he walked towards the fence nothing much showed upon his face his eyes of course they could not read the glass in his lenses was virtually black the young woman identified herself as gina dickens scotland yard she said with a smile like inspector lestrade and then to tease jossie gordon have you been naughty there was a wooden gate nearby but jossie didnt come through it rather he went to a hosepipe that was looped round a newishlooking fence post and attached to a freestanding water tap outside the paddock he removed the hosepipe and unspooled it in the direction of a stone trough absolutely pristine this was barbara saw it was either new like the fence post or the man was more than a bit compulsive about keeping things tidy the latter didnt seem likely since part of the paddock was overgrown and in disrepair as if hed given up in the midst of repairing the area he began adding water to the trough over his shoulder he said whats the trouble then interesting question barbara thought directly to trouble but then who could blame him a personal visit from the metropolitan police wasnt ones garden experience she said could we have a word mr jossie seems like were having it gordon i think they might mean gina hesitated then she said to winston weve a table and chairs beneath the tree in the garden and indicated the front of the cottage shall we meet you there works for me nkata said and went on with hot today innit giving gina dickens the benefit of his highwattage smile ill fetch something cool for us to drink she said and she went off towards the cottage but not before she cast a puzzled glance in jossies direction barbara and nkata waited for jossie the better to make sure he took a direct route from the paddock to the front garden with no sidetracking when hed finished topping off the trough for the ponies he returned the hosepipe to the post and came through the wooden paddock gate removing his gloves its this way he said to them as if they couldnt find the front garden without his help he led them to it a patch of parched lawn at this time of year but containing flower beds that were thriving he saw barbara looking at these and said gina uses the dishwater we do the washing up with special detergent as if to explain why the flowers werent dead in the middle of hose pipebans and a very dry summer nice barbara noted i kill most everything and it doesnt take special washingup soap for me to do it she got down to business as they sat at the table this looked to be part of a little outdoor dining area featuring candles a floral tablecloth and complementary cushions on the chairs someone it seemed had a flair for decorating barbara pulled the postcard photo of jemima hastings from her bag she laid it on the table in front of gordon jossie she said cn you tell us anything about this woman mr jossie why because your mobile numbershe flipped the card overis on the back here and what with have you seen this woman on the front it seems like you probably know her barbara turned the postcard faceup again sliding it within inches of jossies hand he did not touch it gina came round the side of the cottage carrying a tray on which sat a pink concoction in a squat glass jug sprigs of mint and a few pieces of ice floated in it she placed the tray on the table and her gaze took in the postcard she looked from it to jossie she said gordon is something abruptly jossie said this is jemima and indicated the picture on the card by flicking his fingers towards it gina sat slowly she looked perplexed on the card jossie didnt reply barbara didnt want to hasten to any conclusions about his reticence she reckoned among other things his lack of response might well be due to embarrassment clearly this woman gina dickens was something to jossie and shed likely be wondering why he was being faced with a postcard featuring another woman whom he clearly knew barbara waited for jossies answer to ginas question she and nkata exchanged a look they were of one mind in the matter and that mind was of the let him swing for a moment variety gina said may i and when barbara nodded she picked up the postcard she made no comment about the photo itself but her gaze took in the query at the bottom of the card and she flipped it over and saw the phone number printed across the back she said nothing instead she placed the card gently on the table and poured each of them a glass of whatever it was shed concocted the heat seemed to grow more oppressive in the silence gina herself was the one to break it she said id no idea her fingers touched her throat barbara could see her pulse beating there it put her in mind of the manner in which jemima hastings had died how long have you been looking for her gordon gina asked jossie fixed his eyes on the postcard he finally said this is months old this is i got a stack of themi dunnoround april it was i didnt know you then want to explain barbara asked him nkata opened his neat leather notebook gina said is something going on barbara wasnt about to give any more information than was necessary at this point so she said nothing nor did winston except to murmur somr jossie gordon jossie made a restless movement in his chair the story he told was brief but direct jemima hastings was his former lover shed left him after more than two years together hed wanted to find her hed seen an advertisement for the photographic portrait show in the mail on sunday by purest chance and thiswith a nod at the postcardwas the photo that had been used in the advert for that show so hed gone to london no one at the gallery would tell him where the model was and he hadnt a clue how to contact the photographer so he bought up the postcardsforty fifty or sixty because he couldnt recall but theyd had to fetch more from their storage roomand hed stuck them in phone boxes in shop windows in any spot where he thought theyd get noticed hed worked in widening rings round the gallery itself till he ran out of cards and then he waited any luck barbara asked him i never heard from anyone about her he said again to gina this was before id met you its nothing to do with you and me far as i knew far as i know wasnt anyone who ever saw them saw her and put two and two together waste of time and money it was but i felt like i had to try to find her you mean gina said in a quiet voice he said to her it was the time wed put in together over two years i just wanted to know it doesnt mean anything jossie turned to barbara whered you get this anyway whats going on she answered his question with one of her own care to tell us why jemima left you ive no bloody idea one day she decided it was over and off she went she made the announcement and the next day she was gone just like that i reckoned shed been planning it for weeks i phoned her at first once shed gone i wanted to know what the hell was going on who wouldnt after two years together when someone says its over and just disappears and youve not seen it coming but she never took the calls and she never returned them and then the mobile number got changed altogether or she got a new mobile or whatever because the phone calls stopped going through i asked her brother about it her brother nkata looked up from his notebook and when gordon jossie identified the brother as robbie hastings nkata jotted this down but he said he didnt know anything about what she was up to i didnt believe himhe never liked me and i expect he was dead chuffed when jemima ended thingsbut i couldnt get a single detail out of him i finally gave up and thenwith a look at gina dickens that had to be called gratefuli met gina last month when did you last see jemima hastings then barbara asked the morning of the day she left me which was day after guy fawkes last year he took a swig of his drink and then wiped his mouth on his arm he said now are you going to tell me what this is all about im going to ask you if youve made any journeys out of hampshire in the last week or so why will you answer the question please jossies face suffused with colour i dont think i will what the hell is going on whered you get that postcard i didnt break any laws you see postcards in phone boxes all over london and theyre a damn sight more suggestive than that one this was among jemimas belongings in her lodgings barbara told him im sorry to tell you that shes dead she was murdered in london about six days ago so again ill ask you if youve made any journeys out of hampshire barbara had heard the expression pale to the lips but shed never seen it occur so rapidly she reckoned it had to do with gordon jossies natural colouring his face gained colour quickly and it seemed to lose it in much the same manner oh my god gina dickens murmured she reached for his hand her movement made him flinch away what dyou mean murdered he asked barbara is there more than one meaning to murdered she inquired have you been out of hampshire mr jossie where did she die he asked as a response and when barbara didnt answer he said to nkata where did this happen how who she was murdered in a place called abney park cemetery barbara told him so again mr jossie ill have to ask you here he said numbly ive not left ive been here i was here here at home no course not ive been working i was he seemed dazed either that barbara reckoned or he was trying to do a mental twostep to come up with an alibi that he hadnt expected to have to give he explained that he was a thatcher and that hed been working on a job which was what he did every day except weekends and some friday afternoons when asked if someone could confirm that fact he said yes of course for gods sake he had an apprentice he gave the namecliff cowardand the phone number as well then he said how and licked his lips how did shedie she was stabbed mr jossie barbara said she bled out before anyone found her gina did clasp jossies hand at that point but she didnt say anything what really could she say given her position barbara considered this last her position its security or its lack thereof she said and you ms dickens have you been out of hampshire no of course not and six days ago im not sure six days ive been only to lymington the shoppingin lymington who can confirm that she was silent it was the moment when someone was supposed to say you arent bloody well suggesting that i had something to do with this but neither of them did instead they glanced at each other and then gina said i dont expect anyone can confirm it except gordon but why should someone be able to confirm it keep the receipts from your shopping did you i dont know i dont think so i mean one doesnt ordinarily i can look but i certainly didnt think she looked frightened ill try to find them she said but if i cant dont be stupid jossie directed this remark not to gina but to barbara and winston whats she supposed to have done obliterated the competition there isnt any we were finished jemima and me right barbara said she gave a nod to winston and he made much of flipping his notebook closed well you are now arent you you and jemima finished is definitely the word for it he went into the barn he thought to brush tessas he usually did in this kind of momentbut the dog wouldnt come despite his whistling and his calls he stood stupidly at her brushing table fruitlessly and with a very dry mouth shouting tess tess get in here dog with absolutely no result because of course animals were intuitive and tess damn well knew something wasnt right gina did come however she said quietly gordon why didnt you tell them the truth she sounded fearful and he cursed himself for that fear in her voice she would ask of course it was after all the question of the hour he wanted to thank her for having said nothing to the scotland yard cops because he knew what it must look like that hed lied to them she said you did go to holland didnt you you were there werent you that new source for reeds that site where theyre growing them because the reeds from turkey are becoming rubbish thats where you were isnt it why didnt you tell them he didnt want to look at her he heard it all in her voice so he bloody well didnt want to see it in her face but he had to look her in the eye for the simple reason that she was gina and not just anyone so he looked he saw not fear but rather concern it was for him and he knew it and knowing it made him weak and desperate he said yes you went to holland yes then why didnt you just tell them why did you say you werent at work gordon cliffll say i was hell lie for you if i ask him yes he doesnt like coppers but why would you ask him why not just tell them the truth gordon has somethingis something he wanted her to approach him as shed done before early in the morning in bed and then in the shower because although it was sex and only sex it meant more than sex and that was what he needed how odd that hed understand in that moment what jemima had wanted from him and from the act a lifting up and a carrying off and an end to that which could never be ended because it was imprisoned within and no simple conjoining of bodies could free it he set down the brush obviously the dog was not going to obeyeven for a brushingand he felt like a fool for waiting for her he said geen and gina said in return tell me the truth he said if i told them i was in holland theyd take it further what do you mean theyd want me to prove it cant you why would you not be able to prove did you not go to holland gordon of course i went but i tossed the ticket but therere records all sorts of records and theres the hotel and whoever you sawthe farmerwhoeverwho grows the reeds hell be able to sayyou can phone the police and just tell them the truth and thatll be the end its easier like this how on earth can it be easier to ask cliff to lie because if he lies and if they find out that he lied now she did look frightened but frightened was something that he could deal with frightened was something he understood he approached her the way he approached the ponies in the paddock one hand out and the other visible no surprises here gina nothing to fear he said can you trust me on this do you trust me of course i trust you why shouldnt i trust you but i dont understand he touched her bare shoulder youre here with me youve been with mewhat a month longer are you thinking i wouldve hurt jemima gone up to london found her wherever she was and stabbed her to death is that how i seem to you that sort of bloke he goes to london murders a woman for no real reason since shes already long gone out of his life then comes home and makes love to this woman this woman right here the centre of his whole flaming world why why let me look at your eyes she reached up and took off his dark glasses which he hadnt removed on coming into the barn she set them on the brushing table and then she put her hand on his cheek he met her gaze she looked at him and he didnt flinch and finally her expression softened she kissed his cheek and then his closed eyelids then she kissed his mouth then her own mouth opened and her hands went down to his arse and she pulled him close after a moment breathless she said take me right here and he did so they found robbie hastings between vinney ridge and anderwood which were two stoppingoff spots on the lyndhurst road between burley and the a they had reached him on his mobile from a number that gordon jossie had given them hell doubtless tell you the worst about me jossie said abruptly it was no easy matter to locate jemima hastings brother since so many roads in the new forest had convenient names but no signs they finally discovered exactly where he was by chance having stopped at a cottage where the road they were taking made a dogleg only to discover it was called anderwood cottage by heading farther along the route they were led to believe by the cottage owner they would locate rob hastings on a track leading to dames slough inclosure he was an agister they were told and hed been called to do the usual bit of sad business this business turned out to be the shooting of one of the new forest ponies that had been hit by a car on a the poor animal had apparently managed to stagger across acres of heath before collapsing when barbara and nkata found the agister hed put the horse to death with one merciful shot from a pistol and hed brought the animals body to the edge of the lane he was talking on his mobile and sitting attentively next to him was a majesticlooking weimaraner so well trained as to ignore not only the interlopers but also the dead pony lying a short distance from the land rover in which robbie hastings had apparently come to this lonely spot nkata pulled off the lane as far as he was able hastings nodded as they approached him theyd told him only that they wanted to speak with him at once and he looked grave it was hardly likely that he had many calls from the metropolitan police in this part of the world he said stay frank to the dog and came towards them you might want to keep back from the pony its not a happy sight he said he was waiting for the new forest hounds and then added ah here he is in reference to an openbed lorry that rumbled towards them it was pulling a low trailer with shallow sides and into this the dead animal was going to be loaded it would be used for meat to feed the dogs robbie hastings informed them as the lorry got into position at least some good would come of the reckless stupidity of drivers who thought the perambulation was their personal playground he added barbara and nkata had already decided there was no way that they were going to inform robbie hastings of his sisters death on the side of a country road but they had also reckoned that their very presence was likely to set the man on edge and it did so once the pony was loaded and the lorry from new forest hounds had negotiated a difficult turn to get back to the main road hastings swung round to them and said whats happened its bad you wouldnt be here otherwise barbara said is there somewhere we could have a conversation with you mr hastings hastings touched the top of his dogs smooth head might tell me here he said theres no place nearby for private talk less you want to go into burley and you dont want that not at this time of year do you live nearby beyond burley he took off the baseball cap he was wearing revealing a head of closecropped hair this was graying and would have been thick otherwise and he used a kerchief he had round his neck to scrub over his face his face was singularly unattractive with large buckteeth and virtually no chin his eyes however were deeply human and they filled with tears as he looked at them he said so shes dead eh and when barbaras expression told him this was so he gave a terrible cry and turned from them barbara exchanged a look with nkata neither of them moved at first then nkata was the one to put his hand on hastings shoulder and the one to say were that sorry mon s bad when someone goes like this he himself was upset barbara knew this from the way nkatas accent altered becoming less south london and more caribbean with the ths morphing into ds he said im drivin you home sergeant here she follow in my car you tell me how to go we get you there no way you need to be out here now you good to tell me how to get tyour place i can drive hastings said no way youre doing that mon nkata jerked his head at barbara and she hastened to open the land rovers passenger door on its seat were a shotgun and the pistol the man had used to shoot the pony she moved these beneath the seat and together she and nkata got hastings inside his dog followed one graceful leap and frank was leaning against his master in the silent way all dogs have of comforting they made a sad little procession out of the area proceeding not back the way they had come but rather farther along the lane through a woodland of oaks and chestnuts these afforded a canopy that arced over the lane in a verdant tunnel of leaves back out on the lyndhurst road though there was broad lawn on one side giving way to tangled heath on the other herds of ponies grazed freely here and where they wished to cross the road they simply did so once in burley it became quickly clear why hastings had said they would not want to have a private conversation there tourists were massing everywhere and they seemed to be taking their cues from the ponies and the cows wandering through the village at will they walked where their fancy took them bright sunlight falling upon their shoulders hastings lived through and beyond the village he had a holding at the top of a strip of road called honey laneactually marked with a sign barbara notedand when they finally pulled onto the property she saw it was similar to a farm with several outbuildings and paddocks one of which held two horses the door they used led directly into the kitchen of the house where barbara went to an electric kettle upended on a draining board she filled it set it to work and sorted out mugs and bags of pg tips sometimes a shot of the bloody national beverage was the only way in which fellow feeling could be expressed nkata sat hastings at an old formicatopped table where the agister took off his hat and blew his nose on his kerchief which he then balled up and shoved to one side he said sorry and his eyes filled i should have known when she didnt answer my calls on her birthday and not ringing back at once th day afterwards she always rang back within the hour generally when she didnt it was easier to think she was just busy caught up in things you know are you married mr hastings barbara brought mugs to the table along with a battered tin canister of sugar that shed found on a shelf with matching old canisters of flour and coffee as well it was an oldfashioned kitchen with oldfashioned contents from the appliances to the objects on the shelves and in the cupboards as such it looked like a room that had been lovingly preserved rather than one that had been artfully restored to wear the guise of an earlier period not very likely that was how he answered the question it seemed to be a resigned and bleak reference to his unfortunate looks that was sad barbara thought a selfprophecy fulfilled ah she said well were going to want to speak to everyone in hampshire who knew jemima we hope youll be able to help us with that why he asked because of how she died mr hastings at this point hastings seemed to realise something he hadnt yet considered despite the fact that he was being spoken to by representatives of the metropolitan police he said her deathjemimas death im very sorry to tell you that she was murdered six days ago barbara added the rest not the means of death but the place in which it had occurred and even then she kept it general by mentioning the cemetery but not its location and not the location of the body within it she finished with so everyone who knew her will have to be interviewed jossie hastings sounded numb she left him he didnt like that she said he couldnt come to terms with it he rang her and rang her and he wouldnt stop ringing her that said he raised his fists to his eyes and he wept like a child the electric kettle clicked off and barbara went to fetch it she poured water into the mugs and she found milk in the fridge a shot or two of whisky would have been better for the poor man but she wasnt up to rustling through his cupboards so the tea was going to have to do despite the heat of the day at least the interior of the cottage was cool and kept that way by its construction of thick cob walls which were rough and whitewashed outside and painted pale yellow within the kitchen it was the presence of the weimaraner that seemed to soothe robbie hastings at last the dog had placed his head on hastings thigh and the low long whine that issued from the animal roused the master robbie hastings wiped his eyes and blew his nose again he said aye frank and he cupped his hand over the dogs smooth head he lowered his own head and pressed his lips to the animal he didnt look at either barbara or nkata when he raised his head again instead he stared at the mug of tea perhaps knowing what their questions were going to be he began to talk slowly at first then with more reassurance next to him nkata took out his notebook at longslade bottom hastings began there was a wide expanse of lawn where people went regularly to exercise their dogs off lead he took his own dog there one day several years back and jemima went along thats where she met gordon jossie this would have been round three years ago somewhat new to the area he was hastings said broken away from a master thatcher round itchen abbasa bloke called heathand come down the new forest to start his own business never had much to say but jemima fancied him at once well she would do wouldnt she cause she was tweenem at that point barbara frowned wondering at the expression she reckoned it was some strange hampshirean term tweenem tween men he clarified jemima always liked to have a partner from the time she wasi dont knowtwelve or thirteenshe wanted boyfriends i always reckoned it was our dads dying like he did mum s well killed in a car crash both of them at once made her think she had to have someone that was truly and permanently hers i think more n yourself nkata clarified i reckon it seemed to jemima that she needed someone more special i was her brother see didnt mean anything if her brother loved her since he was meant to love her hastings pulled the mug towards him a bit of tea sloshed onto the table he smeared this with the palm of his hand was she promiscuous barbara asked adding when the agister looked at her sharply sorry but i have to ask and it doesnt matter mr hastings only as it might relate to her death he shook his head to her it was all about being in love with some bloke given she partnered up with one or two eventuallyif you know what i meanbut only if she thought they were in love madly in love was what she always called it were madly in love with each other rob typical young girl you ask me wellnearly nearly barbara and nkata spoke simultaneously hastings looked thoughtful as if examining his sister in a new light he said slowly she did cling i spose and could be that made it hard for her to hold on to a boy same with men she wanted a bit too much from them i think and that wouldwell it would eventually end things i wasnt much good at it but id try to explain things to her how blokes dont like someone holding on to them so but i reckon she felt alone in the world cause of our parents though she wasnt alone not ever not the way youd think but feeling that way she had to stop thethe aloneness she wanted to he frowned and seemed to consider how to put his next remarks it was a bit like she wanted to climb into their skin get that close to them be them in a manner of speaking a stranglehold barbara said she didnt intend it never but aye i spose thats what happened and when a bloke wanted his bit of space jemima couldnt cope she clung all the tighter i expect they felt like they had no air so they sloughed her off shed cry a bit then shed blame them for not being what she really wanted and shed go on to another but this didnt happen with gordon jossie the strangling part he shook his head with him she got as close as she wanted he seemed to like it how did you feel about him barbara asked and about her being involved with him i wanted to like him cause he made her happy s well as one person can make another happy you know but there was something about him didnt ever strike me right he wasnt much like blokes round here i wanted her to find someone settle down make a family for herself as thats what she wanted and i didnt see it as something could happen with him mind i didnt tell her so wouldnt have made a difference if i had why not nkata asked he had not barbara noted touched his tea but then winston had never been much of a tea man lager was more his thing but not a lot of it winston was nearly as abstemious as a monk little drinking no smoking his body a temple oh when she was madly in love the deal was sealed thered have been no point anyway i reckoned it was nothing to worry over cause jemimad likely run through him like shed done the others a few months and things would be over and shed be searching for a man again that didnt happen though soon enough she was spending whole nights with him in his lodgings then they found that property over pauls lane and they snapped it up and set up house and that was that well i wasnt bout to say anything then i just hoped for the best it looked like thats what happened for a time jemima seemed quite happy starting her business with them cupcakes and all over ringwood and he was building his thatching business they seemed good with each other cupcake business nkata asked the question whatd that be the cupcake queen sounds daft eh but thing is she was that good in the kitchen quite a hand with baking jemima she had a score of customers buying cupcakes off her fancy decorated and the like special occasions holidays birthdays anniversaries gatherings worked herself up to being able to open a business of it in ringwoodthat would be the cupcake queenand it was doing good but then it all came to naught cause she left jossie and she left the area as nkata noted this barbara said gordon jossie tells us he has no idea why jemima left him hastings snorted he told me he reckoned she had someone on the side and left him for that one what did she tell you that she was going off to think thats all is it thats the limit thats what she said she needed time to think hastings rubbed his hands on his face thing is i didnt see that as bad you know that she wanted to go off i reckoned that finally she didnt want to rush things with some bloke that she wanted to get herself sorted before she settled it permanently with someone i thought it was a good idea but she didnt indicate anything more than that nothing more than she was going off to think she stayed in touch with me regular got herself a new mobile and let me know shed done it cause gordon kept ringing her but i didnt consider what that could mean see just that he wanted her back well so did i did you i bloody well did shesshes all i had in the way of family i wanted her home here you mean barbara asked just home however she wanted that to mean long as it was hampshire barbara nodded and asked for a list of jemimas friends and acquaintances in the area as best he could give it them she also told him they would needregretfullyto know his own whereabouts on the day his sister died last they asked him what he knew of jemimas activities in london and he said that he knew little enough except that she had someone up there some new bloke that she was madly in love with as usual did she give you his name wouldnt even whisper it it was all brand new she said this relationship and she didnt want to throw a spanner in it all shed say was that she was over the moon that and this is the one well shed said that before hadnt she she always said it so i didnt take much notice thats all you know nothing at all about him hastings appeared to consider this next to him frank gave a gusty sigh hed lowered himself to the floor but when hastings moved restlessly in his chair the dog was up at once attending to him hastings smiled at the animal and pulled gently on one of his ears he said shed started taking iceskating instruction god knows why but that was jemima theres a rink named after the queen or some other royal maybe the prince of wales and he shook his head i expect it was her skating instructor thatd be just like jemima someone skating her round the rink with his arm round her waist shed fall for that shed think it meant something when all it meant was that he was keeping her on her feet like that was she nkata asked taking things wrong always taking things to mean love when they meant nothing of the sort hastings said once the police had left him robbie hastings went above stairs he wanted to remove the smell of dead pony with a shower he also wanted a place to weep he realised how little the police had told him death in a cemetery somewhere in london and that was all he also realised how little he had asked them not how she had died not where she had died within the cemetery and not even when exactly not who had found her not what did they know so far and recognising this he felt deep shame he wept for that as much as he wept for the incalculable loss of his little sister it came to him that as long as hed had jemima no matter where she was he hadnt ever been completely alone but now his life seemed finished he couldnt imagine how he would cope but that was the absolute end of what he would allow himself there were things to be done he got out of the shower put on fresh clothes and went out to the land rover frank hopped in beside him and together he and the dog traveled west towards ringwood it was slow country driving which gave him time to think what he thought of was jemima and what she had told him in their many conversations after shed gone to london what he tried to recall was anything that might have indicated she was on a path to her death it could have been a random killing but he didnt think it was not only could he not begin to face the possibility that his sister had merely been the victim of someone who had seen her and decided that she was perfect for one of those sick thrill killings so commonplace these days but also there was the matter of where she had been the jemima he knew didnt go into cemeteries the last thing she wanted was to be reminded of death she never read obituaries she didnt go to films if she knew a leading character was going to die she avoided books with unhappy endings and she turned newspapers facedown if death was on the front page as it so often was so if shed entered a cemetery on her own she had a reason for doing so and a reflection on jemimas life led him to the one reason he didnt really want to consider a rendezvous the latest bloke shed been mad about was likely married that wouldnt have mattered to jemima married or single partnered or partnerlessthese were fine distinctions she wouldnt have made where loveas she considered itwas concerned she would have seen the greater good as making a connection with a man she would have defined as love whatever it was between them she would have called it love and she would have expected it would run the course of love as she saw it two people fulfilling each other as soul matesanother daft term of hersand then having miraculously found each other walking hand in hand into happily ever after when that did not happen she would cling and demand and then what he asked himself then what jemima he wanted to blame gordon jossie for what had happened to his sister he knew that jossie had been looking for her jemima had told him as much although not how she knew this so at the time hed thought it could well be just another one of her fancies but if gordon jossie had been looking and if he had found her he could have gone up to london why was the problem jossie had another lover now so had jemima if she was to be believed so what was the point dog in the manger it had been known to happen a bloke is rejected finds another woman but still cannot rid his mind of the first one he decides the only way to scour his brain of the memories associated with her is to eliminate her so he can move on with her replacement jemima had been upon jossies own admission and despite his age his first lover and that first rejection is always the worst isnt it those eyes of his behind the dark glasses robbie thought the fact that he had so little to say hard worker jossie but what did that mean strong focus on one thingbuilding his businesscould just as easily turn into strong focus on something else robbie thought all this as he made his way to ringwood he would face off with jossie he decided but now wasnt the time he wanted to see him without jemimas replacement at his side ringwood was tricky to negotiate robbie came at it from hightown hill this forced him to drive past the abandoned cupcake queen which he couldnt bear to look at he parked the land rover not far from the parish church of st peter and paul overlooking the market square from a hillock where it rose among ancient graves from the car park robbie could hear the constant rumble and even smell the exhaust of the lorries chugging along the ringwood bypass from the market square he could see the bright flowers in the churchs graveyard and the handwashed fronts of the georgian buildings along the high street it was in the high street that gerber hudson graphic design had its small suite of offices above a shop called food for thought he told frank to stay in the doorway there and he went up the stairs robbie found meredith powell at her computer in the process of creating a poster for a childrens dance studio there in the town it wasnt he knew the job that she wanted but unlike jemima meredith had long been a realist and as a single parent forced to live with her own parents in order to save money she would know that her dream of designing fabrics was not something immediately attainable for her when she saw robbie meredith rose he saw that she wore a caftan of bright summer hues bold lime shot through with violet even he could see the colours were all wrong on her she was gawky and out of place like him the thought made him feel a sudden awkward tenderness for her he said a word merry and meredith seemed to read something on his face she went to an interior office where she popped her head in the doorway to speak briefly to someone then she came across to him he led her down the stairs and once out on ringwood high street again reckoned that the church or the churchyard was the best place to tell her she greeted frank with a hello doggiefrank and the weimaraner wagged his tail and followed them along the street she peered at robbie and said you lookhas something happened rob have you heard from her and he said that he had for indeed he had after a fashion if not from her then of her the result was the same they went up the steps and into the graveyard but it was too hot there he reckoned with the sun beating down and not a breeze stirring so he found frank a shady spot under a bench on the porch and took meredith inside the church and by then she was saying what is it its bad i can see that whats happened she didnt weep when he told her instead she went to one of the battered pews she didnt take a red leather cushion off its holder in order to kneel though rather she sat she folded her hands in her lap and when he joined her in the pew she looked at him she murmured im most horribly sorry rob this must be so awful for you i know what she means to you i know she wasshes everything he shook his head because he couldnt reply the church was cool inside but he was still hot he marveled when next to him meredith shivered why did she leave merediths voice was anguished he could tell however that she asked the question as a form of one of those universal whys why do terrible things happen at all why do people make incomprehensible decisions why does evil exist god rob why did she leave she loved the new forest she wasnt a city girl she could barely cope with college in winchester she said i know what she said you told me what she said so did he she was silent for a moment thinking then she said and this is down to him isnt it this is down to gordon oh maybe not the killing itself but part of it some small part something we cant see or understand just yet somehow some part of it and then she did begin to cry which was when she took one of the kneelers from its holder and dropped to her knees upon it he thought she intended to pray but she talked instead to him but with her face towards the altar and its reredos of carved angels holding up their quatrefoil shields these depicted the instruments of the passion interesting he thought helplessly they had nothing to do with instruments of defence meredith told him about looking into gordons new partner gina dickens about looking into the claims she had made about what she was doing in this part of hampshire there was no programme for girls at risk that anyone knew of meredith told him and she sounded bitter as she gave him the news no programme at the college in brockenhurst no programme through the district council not one anywhere at all shes lying meredith concluded she met gordon somewhere a long time ago believe me and she wanted him and he wanted her it wasnt enough that they just do it in a hotel or somethingshe said this last with the bitterness of a woman whod done exactly thatwith no one the wiser she wanted more she wanted it all but she couldnt get it with jemima round could she so she got him to drive jemima off rob she isnt who she pretends to be robbie didnt know how to respond to this so farfetched seemed the notion truth was he wondered about merediths real purpose in looking into gina dickens and into what gina dickens claimed to be doing in hampshire meredith had something of a history of disapproving of people whom she herself could not understand and more than once over the years of their friendship jemima had found herself at odds with meredith because of this because of merediths inability to see why jemima could simply not be without a man as meredith herself was fully and perfectly capable of being meredith was not a serial manhunter ergo in her mind neither should jemima be but there was more to it than that in this particular matter and robbie reckoned he knew what it was if gina had wanted gordon and had wanted him to remove jemima from his life in order to have him then gordon had done for gina what merediths longago london lover had not done for her despite what had been a greater need in the form of her pregnancy gordon had driven jemima off opening the door to ginas complete entry into his life no secret lover but rather overt life partner this would rankle with meredith she wasnt made of stone police have been to talk to gordon robbie told her i expect they talked to her as well to gina they asked me where i was when jemimawhen it happened and meredith whirled to him they didnt course they have to so they also asked him her too probably and if they didnt they will theyll come to talk to you as well me why because you were her friend i was meant to give them names of anyone who might tell them something anything thats what theyre here for what to accuse us you me no no just to make sure they know everything there is to know about her which means he hesitated she cocked her head her hair touched her shoulder he saw in places where her skin was bare that it was also freckled as her face was freckled he recalled her and his sister in a state about the spots on their young adolescent faces trying this and that product and using makeup and just being growing girls together the acuteness of the memory struck him he said ah merry and could go no further he didnt want to weep in front of her it felt weak and useless he was suddenly stupidly selfishly aware of how bloody ugly he was of how weeping would make him seem all the uglier to jemimas friend and where that had never mattered before it mattered now because he wanted comfort and he thought how there was no comfort and never had been and never would be for ugly men such as he she said i should have stayed in contact with her this last year rob if i had done she mightve not gone off you mustnt think that he said its not your doing you were her friend and the two of you were just going through a bad patch that happens sometimes it was more than a bad patch it wasi wanted her to listen rob to hear just for once but there were things she never would change her mind about and gordon was one of them because they were sexual by that time and whenever she was sexual with a bloke he gripped her arm to stop her he felt a cry building in him but he wouldnt and he couldnt let it escape he couldnt look at her so he looked at the stainedglass windows round the altar and he thought how they had to be victorian because the church had been rebuilt hadnt it and there was jesus saying it is i be not afraid and there was st peter and there the good shepherd and there oh there was jesus with the children and he was suffering the little children to come unto him and that was the problem wasnt it that the little children with all their troubles had not been suffered wasnt that the real problem when everything else was stripped away meredith was silent his hand was still on her arm and he became aware of how hard he was gripping her and how he must be hurting her actually he felt her fingers move against his where they were like claws on her bare skin and it came to him that she wasnt trying to loosen his grip but rather she was caressing his fingers and then his hand making small slow circles to tell him that she understood his grief although the truth of the matter was that she could not understand nor could anyone else what it was like to be robbed of everyone and to have no hope of filling the void chapter fourteen course he was here had been cliff cowards confirmation of gordon jossies alibi where elses he sposed to be eh a short cocky little bloke wearing crusty blue jeans and a sweatstained headband hed been leaning against the bar at his regular watering hole in the village of winstead a pint in front of him and an empty crisp bag balled up next to his fist he played with this as they spoke he gave few details they were working on a pub roof near frith and he expected hed know well enough if gordon jossie hadnt been there six days ago as it was only the two of them and someone was up on that scaffold grabbing the bundles of reeds as hed hoisted them up spect that was gordon hed said with a grin why whats he sposed tove done mugged some old lady in ringwood market square its more a question of murder barbara told him cliffs face altered but his story did not gordon jossie had been with him he said and gordon jossie was no murderer i think id bloody well know he noted been working for him over a year whos he sposed to have done jemima hastings jemima not a chance they went from winstead up to itchen abbas bypassing winchester on the motorway on a small property between itchen abbas and the hamlet of abbotstone they found the master thatcher at whose side gordon jossie had worked years earlier to learn the trade he was called ringo heathdont ask heath said sourly it might have been john paul or george and dont i bloody well know itand when they arrived he was seated on a battered bench on the shady side of a brick house he seemed to be whittling as in one hand he had a wickedlooking knife with a sharp blade curving into a hook and he was applying this to a thin switch splitting it first and then sharpening both of its ends into arrowtip points at his feet lay a pile of switches yet to be seen to in a wooden box next to him on the bench he was placing those that had already been whittled to barbara they looked like toothpicks for a giant each of them perhaps a yard or more long they also looked like potential weapons as did the knife itself which she learned was called a spar hook and the toothpicks were the spars which were used to make staples heath held one up extended between his two palms he bent it nearly double and then released it it sprang back to its original straight line pliable he told them although they hadnt asked hazel wood you cn use willow at a pinch but hazels best it would be twisted into a staple he told them and the staple would be used to hold the reed in place once it was in position on the rooftop gets buried in the reeds and eventually rots away but thats no matter reedsre all compressed by then and thats what you want compression best rooftop money can buy thatch is its not all about chocolatebox houses and front gardens done up with pansies is it i expect not barbara said cooperatively what dyou think winnie looks good to me roof like that nkata said bit of a problem with fire id spect bah nonsense heath said old wives tale barbara doubted it but they werent there to talk about the flammable nature of reeds on rooftops she stated their purpose gordon jossie and his apprenticeship with ringo heath theyd phoned heath in advance to track him down hed said scotland yard whatre you lot doing out here but otherwise hed been cooperative what could he tell them about gordon jossie barbara began did he remember him oh aye no reason to forget gordon heath continued his work as he gave his history with jossie hed come to work as an apprentice a bit older than usual hed been twentyone usually an apprentice was sixteen whichs better for training as they dont know a thing about a thing do they and theyre still at the point when they even might believe they dont know a thing about a thing eh but twentyones a bit old cause you dont want some bloke set in his ways i was a bit reluctant to take him on but take him on he did and things turned out well hard worker jossie was a bloke who talked very little and listened a lot and didnt go round wearing those sodding earphones with music blasting away like kids do now half the time you cant even get their attention eh youre up on the scaffold shouting at em and theyre down below listening to whoever and bobbing their heads to the beat he said this last word scornfully a man who obviously did not share his namesakes passion for music jossie on the other hand hadnt been like the typical apprentice and hed been willing to do anything hed been assigned to do without claiming something was beneath him or rubbish like that once he was given actual thatching jobs to dowhich by the way did not happen for the first nine months of his apprenticeshiphe wasnt ever above asking a question and it would be a good question and never once did it have to do with how much money cn i expect to make ringo like he was thinking hed be going out to buy some maserati on what a thatcher makes its a good living i tell him but its not that good so if youre specting to impress the ladies with golden cuff links or whatever youre barking up a tree with no leaves if you know what i mean what i tell him is that theres always need for a thatcher cause were talking bout listed buildings eh and theyre all round the south and up into gloucestershire and beyond and they got to stay thatched theres no replacing em with tiles or anything else so if youre goodand he meant to be good let me tell youyou work all year and youve genrally got more bookings than you cn handle gordon jossie had apparently been a model apprentice with no complaint hed started out doing nothing more than fetching carrying hoisting cleaning up burning rubbishand according to heath he did it all right mind you no cutting corners i could tell he was going to be good when i got him on the scaffold this is detail work this is oh it looks like slapping reeds onto the rafters and thats that doesnt it but its stepbystep and a decent roofa big one saytakes months to put on cause its not like laying tiles or pounding shingles is it its working with a natural product it is so theres no two reeds the same diameter and the length of thems not exact this is something takes patience and skill and it takes years to get it down so you can do a roof properly gordon jossie worked for him as an apprentice for nearly four years and by that time hed gone far beyond the apprentice stage and was more like a partner in fact ringo heath had wanted to bring him on as a bona fide partner but gordon wanted to have his own business so hed left with heaths blessing and had begun the way they all began subcontracted to someone with a larger concern till he was able to break out on his own ever since i end up with one after nother lazy sods to work as apprentices heath concluded and believe me id take nother older bloke like gordon jossie in the blink of an eye if one came round hed filled the wooden box with completed spars as they were speaking and he heaved it up and took it over to an openback lorry where he slung it alongside various crates that sat among a collection of curious implements which heath was happy to identify for them without being asked to do so he was building up a real head of steam on his topic they had shearing hooks for carving into the thatch takes about a millimeter off it does sharp as anything and you got to use it with care lest you slice into your hand leggetts which were used to dress the thatch and which to barbara looked like nothing more than an aluminium grill with a handle something one might use on the cooker to fry up bacon the dutchman which was used in place of the leggett to dress the thatch when the roof was curved barbara nodded sagely and nkata jotted everything in his notebook as if expecting hed be tested on it later she was having trouble keeping it all straight and determining how she would bring the thatcher away from his lengthy exposition on the process of thatching a roof and back to the subject of gordon jossie when heath mentioned and everone of thems different which brought her round to pay closer attention to what he was saying bits an bobs that the blacksmith provides like the crooks an the pins the crooks were curved at one endhence the name as they resembled a shepherds crook in miniatureand these were hooked round the reeds and driven into the rafters to hold them in place the pins which resembled long spikes with an eye at one end and a sharp point at the other held the reeds in place while the thatcher was working these came from the blacksmith and the interesting bit was that every blacksmith made them according to however he wanted to make them especially as far as the point was concerned forged on four sides forged on two sides cut to give it a slash tip spun on a grinding wheelwhatever the blacksmith fancies i like the dutch ones best i like a proper forging i do he said this last as if one could not expect such a thing as proper forging to go on in england any longer but barbara was taken by the very idea of blacksmithing and how it might relate to making a weapon the thatching tools themselves were weaponlike if it came to that no matter heaths referring to them dismissively as the bits and bobs of his job barbara picked one upshe chose a pinand found its tip was nice and sharp and suitable for murder she handed it to nkata and saw by his expression that they were of the same mind on the matter she said why was he twentyone years old when he came to you mr heath do you know heath took a moment apparently to adjust to the abrupt change in topic as hed been nattering on about why the dutch took more pride in their work than the english and this seemed to have to do with the eu and the mass migration of albanians and other eastern europeans into the uk he blinked and said eh who twentyone was old for an apprentice you said what had gordon jossie been doing before he came to you college ringo heath told them hed been a student in some college in winchester studying one trade or another although heath couldnt recall which it was hed brought two letters with him though recommendations these were from someone or other whod taught him it wasnt the typical way an apprentice presented himself for potential employment so hed been quite impressed with that did they want to see the letters he thought he still had them when barbara told him that they did indeed want to see them heath turned towards his house and bellowed kitten youre needed to this a most unkittenlike woman emerged she carried a rolling pin under her arm and she looked the type whod be happy to use it big brawling and muscular kitten said really pet whyve you got to yell im only just inside in the kitchen in a surprisingly genteel voice completely at odds with her appearance she sounded like an upstairs someone from a costume drama but she looked like someone whod be washing the cook pots in a decidedly downstairs scullery heath simpered at her saying darling girl dont know the strength of my own voice do i sorry have we still got them letters that gordon jossie handed over when he first wanted a job you know which ones i mean dont you the ones from his college you remember them and to barbara and winston she keeps the books and such does my kitten and the girls got a mind for facts and figures thatd make you dizzy i keep telling her to go on telly one of those quiz programmes or summat if you know what i mean i say we could be millionaires we could if she got herself on a quiz show oh you do go on ringo kitten said i made that chicken and leek pie you love by the by precious girl silly boy ill see you when i see you oh you do talk ring uhabout those letters barbara cut in she glanced at winston who was watching the exchange between man and wife like a bloke at an amorous pingpong match kitten said that she would fetch them as she reckoned they were in ringos business files she wouldnt be a moment she said because she liked to stay organised since leave things to ringo wed be living under mounds of paperwork let me tell you true enough ringo said darling girl handsome thank you mrs heath barbara said pointedly kitten made kissy noises at her husband who made a gesture that seemed to indicate hed love to swat her on the bum at which she giggled and disappeared inside the house within two minutes she was back with them and she carried a manila folder from which she extricated the aforementioned letters for their inspection these were barbara saw recommendations attesting to gordon jossies character his work ethic his pleasant demeanour his willingness to take instruction and all the et ceteras they were written on the letterhead of winchester technical college ii and one of them came from a jonas bligh while the other had been written by a keating crawford theyd both indicated knowledge of gordon jossie from within the classroom and from outside the classroom fine young man they declared trustworthy and goodhearted and well deserving of an opportunity to learn a trade like thatching one would not go wrong in hiring him he was bound to succeed barbara asked could she keep the letters shed return them to the heaths of course but for the time being if they didnt mind they didnt mind at this point however ringo heath asked what scotland yard wanted with gordon jossie anyway whats he sposed tove done he asked them were investigating a murder up in london barbara told them a girl called jemima hastings dyou know her they didnt but what they did know and were willing to assert was that gordon jossie was definitely no killer kitten however added an intriguing detail to the jossie résumé as they were about to leave he couldnt read she told them which always made her wonder at the fact that he somehow completed courses in college while obviously there were classes one took that might not require reading she had always found it a bit odd that hed managed such success at the winchester college she said to her husband you know darling boy that does suggest something not quite right about gordon doesnt it i mean if he could actually manage to get through his course work and still hide the fact that he couldnt readit does rather imply an ability to hide other things wouldnt you say what dyou mean he couldnt read ringo demanded thats rubbish that is bah no precious its the truth i saw it he absolutely could not read dyou mean he had trouble with reading nkata asked or he couldnt read he couldnt read she said in fact while he knew the alphabet he had to print it out in order to know it for certain it was the most peculiar thing shed ever seen because of this shed wondered more than once about how hed gone through school reckoned hed been performing for the instructors in ways not entirely academic she concluded if you know what i mean throughout the rest of the day meredith powell felt a dull fire burning within her it was accompanied by pounding in her head one that wasnt connected to pain but rather to the words shes dead the simple fact of jemimas death was bad it put meredith into a state of disbelief and sorrow and the sorrow was more profound than she would ever have expected to feel for someone who was not a member of her immediate family beyond the fact of her death though was the additional fact that jemima had been taken away before meredith had been able to put things right between them and this gnawed at her conscience and her heart she could no longer remember what it even was that had actually so damaged their long friendship had it been a slow chipping away of their affection for each other or had it suffered one deadly blow she couldnt recall which told her how unimportant it must have been im not like you meredith jemima had said so many times why cant you just accept that because having a mans not going to make you stop being afraid had been the answer but it had been a reply that jemima had poohpoohed as an indication of merediths jealousy except she hadnt been jealous not really shed merely been concerned shed watched jemima flit from boy to boy to man to man for years in a restless search for something not a single one of them would ever be able to give her and that had been what shed wished her friend to understand and what shed tried again and again to get across to her until finally shed thrown up her handsor jemima had done because she couldnt remember nowand that had been that as far as friendship went between them but there had been a bigger issue that meredith had failed to see till now why had it been so incredibly important to her that jemima hastings see things meredith powells way and for that question meredith had no answer but she was determined to find one she phoned gordon jossies house before leaving work at the end of the day gina dickens answered and this was good as it was gina dickens whom meredith wished to see she said i need to talk to you will you meet me im in ringwood just now but i can meet you anywhere wherever you like just not atnot at gordons please she didnt want to see the house again she didnt think she could face it just now not with another woman there happily going about a life with gordon jossie while jemima lay dead cold and murdered up in london gina said the police have been here they said that jemima meredith squeezed her eyes shut and the telephone felt cold and slick in her hand she said i need to speak with you why ill meet you you name the place why youre making me nervous meredith i dont mean to please ill meet you anywhere just not at gordons there was a pause then gina named hinchelsea wood meredith didnt want to risk a wood with all its solitude and everything that solitude suggested about danger no matter what gina dickens said about being nervous of her and all that this was supposed to imply about gina dickens apparent innocence meredith suggested a heath instead what about longslade heath there was a car park and they could not a heath gina said at once why not snakes what snakes adders therere adders on the heath you must know that i read that somewhere and i dont want to hatchet pond then meredith cut in its outside beaulieu they agreed on this there were other people at hatchet pond when meredith arrived there were ponies and foals as well the people strolled along the edge of the water they walked their dogs they sat in cars reading they fished they chatted to each other on benches the ponies lapped water and grazed the pond itself stretched out a good distance with a finger of land on the far side that reached into the water and was topped with beech and chestnut trees and a single graceful willow it was a good trysting place for young people at night tucked off the road so that parked cars could not be seen but still conveniently located at the intersection of several routes with beaulieu immediately to its east east boldre to the south and brockenhurst to the west all sorts of trouble between hotblooded adolescents could be got into here meredith knew that from jemima she waited some twenty minutes for gina to arrive she herself had barreled the distance from ringwood driven by determination it was one thing to be deeply suspicious about gordon jossie gina dickens and the fact that most of jemimas belongings were packed away in gordons house it was another thing to learn that jemima had been murdered all the way from ringwood meredith had engaged in a mental conversation with gina about these and other matters when gina finally arrived in her little red convertible with her enormous film star dark glasses covering half her face and a scarf keeping her hair in placeas if she were audrey flipping hepburn or somethingmeredith was quite ready for her gina got out of the car she cast a look at one of the ponies nearby as meredith crossed the car park to her meredith said lets walk and when gina hesitated saying im a bit leery of the horses meredith countered with oh for gods sake they wont hurt you theyre just ponies dont be stupid she took ginas arm gina pulled away i can walk on my own she said stiffly but not near the horses fine meredith headed along a path that skirted the water she cooperatively chose a direction away from the ponies towards a lone fisherman who was casting his line not far from a heron motionless as it waited to scoop up an unsuspecting eel whats this about gina demanded what do you think this is about gordon has her car he has her clothes now shes dead in london gina stopped walking and meredith turned to her gina said if youre suggesting or even trying to get me to believe that gordon wouldnt she have sent for her clothes eventually she wouldnt need her country clothing in london gina said what was she going to do with it there the same goes for her car she didnt need a car where would she keep it why would she drive it meredith tore at the skin round her fingernails there was truth here somewhere she meant to have it she said i know all about you gina theres no programme anywhere round here for young girls at risk not at the college in brockenhurst and not at the comprehensive social services havent even heard of a programme and social services havent even heard of you i know because i checked all right so why dont you tell me what youre doing here really why dont you tell me the truth about you and gordon about when you really met and how you met and what that meant to him and jemima ginas lips parted then pursed she said honestly youve been checking on me whats wrong with you meredith why are you so dont you dare turn this on me thats clever of you but im not about to be dragged in that direction oh dont be ridiculous no ones dragging you anywhere she pushed past meredith on the narrow path along the water if were going to walk lets bloody well walk gina stalked off after a moment she began to speak over her shoulder saying sharply just think if youre capable of it i told you i was establishing a programme i didnt tell you it existed and the first step in establishing a programme is assessing need for heavens sake thats what im doing thats what i was doing when i met gordon and yes all right i admit i havent been as diligent as i could have been about it i havent been asas dedicated as i was when i first came to the new forest and yes all right the reason for that is that i got involved with gordon and yes ive rather liked being gordons partner and having gordon provide for me but as far as i know none of that is a crime meredith so what i want to knowif you dont mindis why you dislike gordon so much why cant you stand the thought of meor anyone else i daresaybeing with him because this really isnt about me is it this is about gordon how did you meet him how did you really meet him i told you ive told you the absolute truth from the first i met him last month in boldre gardens i saw him later that day and we went for a drink he asked me for a drink and he looked harmless enough and it was a public place andoh why am i bothering with all this why dont you just come out with it why dont you tell me what you suspect me of murdering jemima encouraging the man i love to murder her or is it loving him at all that bothers you and why would that be this isnt about loving anyone oh isnt it then perhaps youre accusing me of sending gordon off to murder jemima for some reason perhaps you see me standing on the front step and waving a handkerchief as he drives off to do whatever he was supposed to do but why would i do that she was gone from his life perhaps she got in touch with him perhaps she wanted to come back perhaps they met somewhere and she said she wanted him and you couldnt have that because then youd have to so i killed her not gordon at all but me this time do you know how ridiculous you sound and do you want to be meeting out here in the wilds of hatchet pond with a killer she put her hands on her hips as if thinking about the answer to her question she smiled and said bitterly ah yes i see why you didnt want hinchelsea wood how foolish of me i might have killed you there ive no idea how i would have done it but thats what you think that im a killer or that gordon is or that we both are somehow in cahoots to eliminate jemima for reasons that are so bloody obscure she turned away there was a weatherbeaten bench nearby and she made for this and dropped upon it she whipped off her scarf and shook back her hair she removed her dark glasses folded them up and held them tightly in her hand meredith stood before her arms crossed against her chest she was suddenly and acutely aware of how different they were gina tanned and voluptuous and obviously appealing to any man and herself a miserable freckled beanpole of a thing alone and likely to stay that way only that wasnt the issue here yet as if gina had read her mind she said in a tone no longer bitter at all but instead resigned im wondering if this is just what you do to any woman who has a nice relationship with a man i know you didnt approve of gordon and jemima he said you didnt want him to be with her but i couldnt sort out why what it was to you if she and gordon were partners was it because you yourself have no one because perhaps you keep trying and failing while all round you women and men get attached with no trouble at all i mean i know what happened to you gordon told me jemima told him because of course he was trying to sort out why you disliked him so much and she said it had to do with london with when you lived there and got involved with the married man the one you didnt know was married and there you were pregnant meredith felt her throat close she wanted to stop the flow of words but she couldnt the catalogue of her personal failures she felt weak and dizzy as gina kept talkingabout betrayal and then desertion and then bloody little fool dont claim you didnt know i was married because you are simply not that stupid and i never lied i never once lied and why the hell werent you taking precautions unless it was that you wanted to trap me is that what it was did you want to trap me well i wont be trapped not by the likes of you or by anyone else if it comes down to it and yes yes you can damn well sort out exactly what that means my dear oh im sorry im sorry here please sit gina rose and urged meredith onto the bench next to her she said nothing more for several minutes as across the surface of the placid water dragonflies flitted their fragile wings flashing purple and green in the light listen gina said quietly can you and i possibly be friends or if not friends perhaps nodding acquaintances or maybe nodding acquaintances at first and then afterwards friends i dont know meredith said dully and she wondered how widely her shame was known she reckoned it was known everywhere it was she thought as much as she deserved for stupid is as stupid does and shed been unforgivably stupid by the time john dressers body was found two days after his disappearance he was national news what was known to the public at that point was what was seen in the cctv films from the barriers in which a toddler seems to walk off happily hand in hand with three little boys the still photos released by the police thus offered images that could be interpreted in one of two ways as children having found the toddler wandering and setting out to take him to an adult who ultimately did him harm or as children intent upon the abduction and possible terrorising of another child these images played across the front page of every national tabloid of every broadsheet of the local newspaper and on the television with michael spargo wearing that unmistakable overlarge mustard anorak his identity was quickly established by his own mother sue spargo took her son straight to the police station that hed been beaten beforehand was evident by the heavy bruising on his face although there is no record of anyones having questioned sue spargo about this beating following the rules of law michael spargo was interrogated in the presence of a social worker and his mother the detective in charge of this questioning was a twentynineyear veteran of the police force di ryan farrier a man with three children and two grandchildren of his own farrier had been working criminal investigations for nineteen years of his twentynineyear career but he had never come across a killing that affected him as did the murder of john dresser indeed so deeply was he harrowed by what he saw and heard during the investigation that he has since retired from the police and has remained under the care of a psychiatrist its worth noting as well that the police department made both psychological and psychiatric services available to all the individuals who worked upon the crime once john dressers body was found as might be expected michael spargo denied everything at first claiming that he was in school that day and maintaining that claim until presented not only with the cctv film but also with evidence from his teacher as to his truancy all right i was with reg and ian is all that he says on tape at this point when asked for their surnames he tells the police it was their idea wasnt it i didnt never want to nick that kid this enrages sue spargo whose eruption into verbal abuse and whose attempts at physical abuse are immediately halted by the other adults in the room her screams of you tell them the bloody truth or ill fucking kill you i will are the last words she will speak to michael during the course of the investigation and up until the moments she shares with him following his sentencing this abandonment of her son at a crucial moment in his life is characteristic of her parenting style and perhaps speaks more loudly than anything else as to the source of michaels psychological disturbance arrests of reggie arnold and ian barker quickly followed michael spargos mentioning of their names and what was known at the time of their arrests was only that john dresser had been seen with them and had disappeared when they were brought to the police station each boy was taken to a different station and they did not see each other until their trial began reggie was accompanied by his mother laura and later joined by his father rudy and ian was alone although his grandmother arrived prior to his being interviewed the whereabouts of ians mother tricia at the time of his arrest are never made clear in the documentation and she did not attend his trial at first no one suspected that john dresser was dead transcripts and tapes of early questioning by the police indicate that their initial belief was that the boys took john in an act of mischief grew tired of his company and left him somewhere to fend for himself although each of the boys was already known to the police they were none of them known for anything more than truancy acts of petty vandalism and minor thefts one does wonder how ian barker with a history of small animal torture managed to go unnoticed for so long however it was only when repeated witnesses began to step forward in the first thirtysix hours following johns disappearancecommunicating the level of the toddlers distressthat the police seem to have developed a sense that something more ominous than a prank had occurred a search for the little boy had already begun and as the area surrounding the barriers was picked through by police and by concerned citizens in an organised and everwidening circumference it was not overlong before the dawkins building site came under scrutiny constable martin neild twentyfour years old at the time and a brandnew father was the individual who found the body of john dresser alerted to the possibility of its proximity by the sight of johns blue snowsuit crumpled and bloodied on the ground near a disused portaloo inside this loo neild found the babys body stuffed callously into the chemical toilet nield reports that he wanted to think it was a doll or something but he knew otherwise chapter fifteen whats the decision about sunday lunch isabelle ive mentioned it to the boys by the way theyre quite keen isabelle ardery pressed her fingers to her forehead shed taken two paracetamol but theyd done nothing to ease her headache nor had they done much for her stomach she knew she should have eaten something before gulping them down but the thought of food on top of an already roiling gut was more than she could have managed she said let me speak to them bob are they there he said you dont sound quite yourself are you unwell isabelle which wasnt what he meant of course unwell was a euphemism and only barely unwell stood in place of everything else he didnt intend to ask but fully intended to communicate she said i was up late last night im on a case you might have read about it a womans been murdered in a north london cemetery he clearly wasnt interested in that part of her life only in the other he said hitting it rather hard then are you there are usually late nights when it comes to a murder investigation she replied deliberately choosing to misunderstand him you know that bob so may i speak to the boys where are they certainly theyre not out somewhere at this hour of the morning still asleep he said i dont like to wake them surely they can go back to sleep if i just say hello you know how they are and they need their rest they need their mother they have a mother as things stand sandras quite sandra has two children of her own you arent suggesting she treats them differently i hope because frankly im not listening to that because also frankly she treats them a damn sight better than their natural mother does since shes fully conscious and in possession of all her faculties when shes round them do you really want to have this kind of conversation isabelle now are you coming for lunch on sunday or are you not ill send the boys a note she said quietly beating down her incipient rage may i assume bob that you and sandra arent forbidding my sending a note to them were not forbidding anything he said oh please lets not pretend she rang off without a goodbye she knew shed pay for that laterdid you actually hang up on me isabelle surely we must have been disconnected somehow yesbut at the moment she could do nothing else to remain on the line with him meant being exposed to an extended display of his ostensible paternal concern and she wasnt up to it she wasnt in fact up to much that morning and she was going to have to do something to alter that before heading into work four cups of black coffeeall right it was irish coffee but she could be forgiven for that as shed used only a dash of spiritsone slice of toast and a shower later she was feeling fit she was actually in the middle of the morning briefing before she felt the urge once more but then it was easy to fight it off because she could hardly duck into the ladies and that was just how it was what she could do instead was keep her mind on her work and vow to have a different kind of evening and night at the end of this day which she decided she could easily manage sergeants havers and nkata had reported in first thing from the new forest they were staying in a hotel in swayforest heath hotel it was called havers saidand this bit of information was met with guffaws and remarks of the hope winnies managed to get his own room ilk which isabelle cut off with a sharp thatll do while they assessed the information the two sergeants had unearthed so far havers appeared to be building up a head of steam over the fact that gordon jossie was a master thatcher and that thatching tools were not only deadly but made by hand for his part nkata seemed to be more interested in the fact of another woman being present in gordon jossies life havers also mentioned gordon jossies letters of reference from a winchester college and then brought up a thatcher called ringo heath she concluded by listing the names of individuals still needing to be spoken to cn we get you lot on to background checks havers then asked hastings jossie heath dickens theyd spoken to the local rozzers by the way but there wasnt a lot of joy to be had from that quarter new scotland yard were welcome to nose round the locals patch according to the cs in lyndhurst but as the murder was in london it wasnt the locals problem ardery assured the sergeant that theyd get on things at this end since she herself wished to know everything there was to know about anyone even remotely concerned with jemima hastings i want to know every detail there is down to whether their bowels move regularly she told the team she instructed philip hale to carry on with the names from hampshire and she ticked off the additional london names in case hed forgotten them yolanda the psychic aka sharon price jayson druther abbott langer paolo di fazio frazer chaplin bella mchaggis alibis for everyone with confirmation and try for two sources john ill want you handling that part coordinate with so as well light a fire over there we need some good information stewart gave no indication that hed heard her so isabelle said did you get that john to which he smiled sardonically and pointed an index finger to his temple all in thereguv he noted and anything else as if he suspected that she was the one in need of a good prodding she narrowed her eyes she was about to respond when thomas lynley did so he was standing at the back of the room politely keeping himself out of the way although she couldnt decide if this was a benefit to her or merely a reminder to everyone else of what was likely the immense contrast between their styles he said perhaps matt jones sidney st jamess partner its likely nothing but if hed been to the cigar shop as barbara indicated matt jones as well isabelle said philip can someone on your team will do hale said she told them all to get on with it then and said thomas if youll come with me they would seek out paolo di fazios studio she told him between their interview with the sculptor and barbara havers report of her conversation with bella mchaggis about paolo and the pregnancy test there existed an ocean that wanted swimming lynley nodded amenable to anything it seemed she said she would meet him at her car five minutes for her to use the ladies she told him he said certainly in that wellbred fashion of his and she felt him watching her as she walked off she stopped in her office to grab her handbag and she took it with her to the toilet no one could possibly fault her for that she thought as before he was waiting patiently at her car but this time on the passengers side she raised an eyebrow to which he said i expect you need the practice guv london traffic and all that she tried to read him for underlying meanings but he was very good at a poker face very well she told him and its isabelle thomas due respect guv she sighed impatiently oh for gods sake thomas what did you call your last superintendent behind the scenes sir mostly other times it would have been guv fine wonderful well im ordering you to call me isabelle when were alone together have you an aversion to that he seemed to consider this the aversion bit he examined the door handle on which hed already placed his hand when he looked up his brown eyes were candidly on her face and the sudden openness of his expression was disconcerting i think guv gives a distance you might prefer he said all things considered what things she said all things the frank look they exchanged made her wonder about him she said you play your cards quite close dont you thomas he said i have no cards at all she snorted at this and got into the car paolo di fazios studio was near clapham junction this was south of the river he told her not terribly far from putney their best course was to drive along the embankment did she want him to give her directions i think i can just about manage the route to the river she told him paolo di fazio himself had indicated where to find him upon being contacted hed declared that he had given them all the information there was to give about himself and jemima hastings but if they wanted to spend their time going over old ground then so be it hed be where he was most mornings at the studio the studio turned out to be tucked into one of the many railway arches created by the viaducts leading out of clapham railway station most of these had long ago been put to use being converted from tunnels into wine cellars clothing outlets car repair shops andin one caseeven a delicatessen selling imported olives meats and cheeses paolo di fazios studio was between a picture framer and a bicycle shop and they arrived to find its front doors open and its overhead lights brightly illuminating the space this space was whitewashed and set up in two sections one section appeared to be given over to the early work that went on when an artist took a sculpture from clay on its way to bronze so there were masses of wax latex fibre glass and bags of plaster everywhere along with the grit and the grime one might associate with working with such substances the other section accommodated workstations for four artists whose pieces were currently shrouded in plastic and likely in varying stages of completion finished bronze sculptures had places in a row along the centre of the studio and they ranged in style from the realistic to the fantastical when they came upon it paolo di fazios style turned out to be figurative but of a nature that favoured bulbous elbows long limbs and disproportionately small heads lynley murmured shades of giacometti and he paused in front of it and isabelle glanced at him sharply to gauge his expression she had no idea what he was talking about and she absolutely hated a showoff but she saw he was taking out his spectacles to give the sculpture a closer look and he seemed unaware that hed even spoken she wondered what it meant that he moved round the sculpture slowly looking thoughtful she realised yet again that he was impossible to read and she additionally wondered if she could actually work with someone whod so mastered the art of keeping his thoughts to himself paolo di fazio wasnt in the studio nor was anyone else but he entered as they were having a look at his work area which was identifiable by more of the maskssimilar to those he made in jubilee market hallthat stood on dusty wooden pedestals upon shelves at the rear specifically they were having a look at his tools and at his tools potential to do harm di fazio said please touch nothing as he came in their direction he was carrying a takeaway coffee and a bag from which he brought out two bananas and an apple these he placed carefully on one of the shelves as if arranging them for a still life he was dressed as hed been dressed when theyd earlier seen him blue jeans a tshirt and dress shoes which as before seemed an odd getup for someone at work with clay particularly the dress shoes as he somehow managed to keep them perfectly clean they would have passed muster at a military inspection he said im at work here as you can see he gestured with his coffee in the direction of a shrouded piece isabelle said and may we look at your work he apparently needed to think about this for a moment before he shrugged and removed its swaddling of plastic and cloth it was another elongated knobbylimbed piece apparently male and apparently in agony if the expression was anything to go by a mouth gaped open limbs stretched out the neck curved back and the shoulders arched at its feet lay a grill of some sort and to isabelle it looked for all the world as if the figure were in anguish over a broken barbecue she reckoned it all meant something deep and she readied herself to hear lynley make an insufferably illuminating remark about it but he said nothing and di fazio himself didnt shed any light on matters for isabelle when he identified the figure only as st lawrence he went on to tell them that he was doing a series of christian martyrs for a sicilian monastery by which isabelle took it that st lawrences gruesome means of death had actually been by barbecue this made her wonder what belief if any shed be willing to die for and this in turn made her wonder how or if the deaths of martyrs tied in with jemima hastings own end ive done sebastian lucy and cecilia for them di fazio was saying this is the fourth of a series of ten theyll be placed in the niches in the monastery chapel youre well known in italy then lynley said no my uncle is well known in the monastery your uncles a monk di fazio gave a sardonic laugh my uncle is a criminal he thinks he can buy his way into heaven if he makes enough donations to them money food wine my art it is all the same to him and as he pays me for the work i dont question the he looked thoughtful as if seeking the proper word the effectiveness of his actions at the street end of the studio a figure appeared in the double doorway silhouetted by the light outside it was a woman who called out ciao baby and strode over to one of the other work areas she was short and rather plump with an enormous shelflike bosom and coils of espressocoloured hair she whipped the protective covering off her piece of sculpture and set to work without another look in their direction nonetheless her presence seemed to make di fazio uneasy for he suggested that they continue their conversation elsewhere dominique didnt know jemima he told them with a nod at the woman shed have nothing to add but she knew di fazio isabelle reckoned and she might come in useful down the line she said well keep our voices down if thats what worries you mr di fazio she will want to concentrate on her work i daresay we wont prevent her from doing so behind his goldframed spectacles the sculptors eyes narrowed it was just a fractional movement but isabelle did not miss it she said this actually wont take long its about your argument with jemima and about an athome pregnancy test di fazio gave no reaction to the remark he looked briefly from isabelle to lynley as if evaluating the nature of their relationship then he said i had no argument with jemima that i remember you were overheard it would have taken place in your lodgings in putney and chances are very good it might have had to do with that pregnancy test which was by the way found among your belongings you have no warrant as it happens we arent the ones who found it then its not evidence is it i know how these things work theres a procedure that must be followed and this was not followed so this pregnancy test or whatever it is cannot be evidence against me i applaud your knowledge of the law ive read enough of injustice in this country madam ive read how the british police work people who have been unjustly accused and unjustly convicted the birmingham gentlemen the guildford group you may have done lynley was the one to speak and isabelle noted that he didnt bother to lower his voice to prevent dominique from hearing so youll also know that in building a case against a suspect in a murder investigation some things go down as background information and some as evidence the fact that you had an argument with a woman who turned up dead may be neither here nor there but if it is neither here nor there it seems the wiser course to clear things up about it which is another way of saying isabelle noted that you have some explaining to do you indicated that you and jemima ultimately stopped having relations when she took up lodgings with mrs mchaggis that was the truth di fazio cast a look in dominiques direction isabelle wondered if the other artist had taken jemimas place had she become pregnant during the time when you and she were still lovers she had not another look in dominiques direction can we not have this conversation elsewhere he asked dominique and iwe hope to marry this winter she doesnt need to hear do you indeed and this would be your sixth engagement wouldnt it his face grew stormy but he mastered this he said dominique doesnt need to hear facts about jemima jemima was done with thats an interesting choice of words lynley noted i didnt hurt jemima i didnt touch jemima i wasnt there then you wont mind telling us everything youve so far failed to tell us about her isabelle said you also wont mind providing us with an alibi for the time of jemimas death not here please all right then at the local nick di fazios face went completely rigid unless you place me under arrest i do not have to take a step out of this studio in your company and this i know believe me i know ive read about my rights that being the case isabelle said youll also know that the sooner you clear up this matter of you jemima the pregnancy test the argument and your alibi the better off youll be di fazio cast another look in dominiques direction she seemed intent upon her work isabelle thought but who could really tell they appeared to be at the point of impasse when lynley made the move that resolved the situation he went to dominiques area to examine her work saying may i have a look ive always thought that the lostwax process and on he went till dominique was fully engaged so isabelle said to di fazio he turned his back on lynley and dominique the better to prevent his intended brides reading of his lips isabelle reckoned he said it was before dominique it was jemimas test in the rubbish in the toilet shed told me there was no one else in her life shed said she wanted a break from men altogether but when i saw the test i knew that shed lied there was someone new so i spoke with her and it was hot this conversation yes because she would not be with me but i knew that she would be with him who who else frazer she wouldnt risk it with me but with him if she lost her place in the lodging as a result of frazer it didnt matter she told you it was frazer chaplin he looked impatient she didnt need to tell me this is frazers way have you seen him have you spoken to him theres no woman that he wouldnt try to take because thats who he is who else would it be he wasnt the only man in her life she went to the ice rink for lessons she said but i knew better and sometimes she went to dukes hotel as well she wanted to see what frazer was up to and he was up to finding ladies isabelle said perhaps but there are other men whose lives touched hers at her own place of employment at the ice rink what you suppose she waswhat with abbott langer with jayson druther she went to work she went to the ice rink she went to dukes hotel she went home trust me she did nothing else if thats the case isabelle said you do see how this gives you a motive for murdering her dont you colour rushed into his face and he grabbed up one of his tools and used it to gesture with me its frazer who would want her dead frazer chaplin he would want to shake her away from him because she wouldnt give him the freedom he required to do what he does which is he fucks the ladies all the ladies and the ladies like it and he makes them want it and when they want it they seek him out so this is what she was doing you seem to know quite a lot about him ive seen him ive watched them frazer and women some might say hes merely had better luck with women mr di fazio what do you make of that i know what youre trying to say dont think im foolish im telling you how it is with him so i ask you this if frazer chaplin wasnt the man shed taken as her lover then who was it it was an interesting question isabelle thought but far more interesting at the moment was the fact that di fazio had seemed to know what jemima hastings every movement had been two of them hovered their form was different one rose from an ashtray on a table a cloud of grey that became a cloud of light from which he had to turn his head even as he heard the booming cry of the eighth choir stands before god he tried to block the words they are the messengers between man and mans deity the cries were loud louder than they had ever been and even as he filled his ears with music another cry came from another direction saying battlers of those who themselves were born of the bearer of light distort gods plan and be thrown into the jaws of damnation although he tried not to seek the source of this second shrieking he found it anyway because a chair swept into the air before him and it began to take shape and it began to approach him he shrank away what he knew was that they came in disguises they were travelers they were healers of the sick they were inhabitants of the pool of probatica at whose shores the infirm lay awaiting the movement of the water they were the builders the slave masters of demons he who healed was also present he spoke from within the cloud of grey and he became flame and the flame burned emerald he called not for righteous anger but for a flood of music to issue forth in praise but the other fought him he who was destruction itself known by sodom called hero of god but he was mercy as well and he claimed to sit at the left hand of god unlike the other incarnation conception birth dreams these were his offerings come with me but a price would be paid i am raphael and it is you who are called i am gabriel and it is you who are chosen then there was a chorus of them a veritable flood of voices and they were everywhere he worked against being taken by them he worked and he worked till the sweat poured from him and still they came on they descended till there was one mighty being above all and he approached he would not be denied he would overcome and to this there was no other answer that might be given so he had to escape he had to run he had to find a place of safety he himself gave the cry against the multitude that he now knew was indeed the eighth choir there was a stairway that emerged from the light and he made for this for wherever it headed to the light to god to some other deity it didnt matter he began to climb he began to run yukio came the cry from behind him so i have the impression the engagement is all in paolo di fazios head lynley said dominique did a bit of eye rolling when i offered her my congratulations now thats an interesting bit isabelle ardery said well i did think six times engaged was rather pushing the envelope in the human relationship area i mean ive heard of six times marriedwell perhaps only with american film stars in the days when they actually did get marriedbut its rather odd that with all the engagements hes never made it to the altar it does make one wonder about him how much is real and how much is imagined he may have done what ardery turned to him theyd stopped at the delicatessen which occupied one of the railway arches she was making a purchase of olives and meats shed already bought a bottle of wine at the wine cellar lynley reckoned these would likely stand in place of her dinner he knew the signs having worked for so many years with barbara havers and having thus become accustomed to the single policewomans eating habits he considered extending an invitation to the superintendent dinner at his home in eaton terrace he rejected the idea as he couldnt imagine as yet sharing his dining table with anyone he may have made it to the altar he said married philip hale will be able to tell us or perhaps john stewart were developing a rather long list for the background checks john can help out there if youve a mind to move him oh im sure hed adore that assignment the superintendent took her bag of goods said thanks to the shop girl and headed for her car the day was heating up surrounded by and composed of bricks concrete and macadam possessing all the possible charms that overfull wheelie bins and rubbish on the street could provide the area immediately round the railway arches was like a wrestlers armpit steaming and malodorous they got into the car before isabelle ardery said more she cranked down the window cursed that she did not have airconditioning pardoned herself for cursing and then said what dyou make of him then isnt there a song about it lynley said looking for love in all the wrong places he wound down his window as well they headed off his mobile rang he looked at the number and felt an unaccustomed moment of dread assistant commissioner hillier was phoning or at least his office was where was the inspector and could he come to the acs office hilliers secretary wanted to know and welcome back to new scotland yard detective inspector this is an unofficial meeting by the way no need to mention it to anyone code for dont mention this meeting to isabelle ardery and why accordingly didnt you let the assistant commissioner know you would be returning to work lynley didnt much like the inference that could be drawn from it all he said that he was out at the moment but he would come in to see the assistant commissioner as soon as he could he included the words assistant commissioner with a slow deliberation he felt ardery glance in his direction he said to her as he ended the call hillier wanting a word she drove on her gaze on the road she said thank you thomas are you always so decent virtually never she smiled i meant john stewart by the way pardon when i asked what you make of him ah right well he and barbara have nearly come to blows over the years if thats any help women in general then or women coppers thats something ive never been able to work out he was married once it ended badly ha i expect we know who wanted to end it isabelle said nothing more till theyd crossed over the river again and then im going to want a warrant thomas hmm yes i expect thats the only course and he knows his rights rather too well doesnt he hillier would call it an unfortunate sign of the times it came to lynley as he spoke that hed followed arderys line of thought with ease theyd gone smoothly from john stewart to paolo di fazio without the need for clarification and without the further need for ardery to explain why a search warrant was required they were going to want to gather up the artists sculpting tools indeed they were going to need the tools of every one of the artists with whom paolo di fazio shared space forensic examinations would have to be done on everything paolo lynley noted isnt going to be popular with his mates not to mention what this will do to his engagement to dominique did she alibi him by the way she didnt except to say she reckoned he was at covent garden if its afternoon youre talking about thats where he usually is she said and someone there will have seen him she also knew why i was asking and contrary to what di fazio said she did know jemima at least by sight she called her paolos ex no jealousy no concern not that i could see she seemed to knowor at least to believethat it was finished between them between jemima and paolo i mean they rode the rest of the way in silence and they were in the underground car park at new scotland yard when isabelle ardery spoke again gathering up her purchases from the railway arches she said what dyou make of paolos declaration that frazer chaplin was involved with jemima anythings possible at this point yes but it also supports what sergeant havers said about the bloke she slammed the door and locked it adding and that frankly comes as something of a relief i have my concerns about barbara havers and her reaction to men do you lynley walked at her side he was unused to a woman so tall barbara havers didnt reach to his collarbone and while helen had been of aboveaverage height she had not been nearly as tall as isabelle ardery he and the acting superintendent were shoulder to shoulder he said barbara has very good instincts about people you can generally rely on her input ah what about you then my input is i hope i meant your instincts thomas how are they she looked at him it was an even gaze he wasnt sure what to make of her question nor was he sure how he felt about it when the wind is southerly i generally know my hawks and handsaws he settled on saying back in the incident room bits of information were filtering in jayson druther had indeed been present in the cigar shop when jemima hastings was killed in stoke newington and hed provided the names of three customers to confirm this hed gone on to alibi his father if there was interest in that betting lounge john stewart reported in the edgware road abbott langer had finished up his afternoon lessons at the ice rink walked dogs in hyde park and then returned to the ice rink for his evening clients but the dogwalking bit gave him a goodsize window to get up to stoke newington because there was no dog owner to swear the family canine had been walked obviously a dog walker was employed when no one was at home as to background information progess had been made there as well although yolanda the psychic had been warned off stalking jemima hastings jemima hastings hadnt been the one to report her that reporting had been done by bella mchaggis mchaggiss husband died at home but theres nothing suspicious associated with it philip hale reported his heart gave out while he was on the toilet yolandas daughter is dead starved herself slimming same age as jemima interesting ardery said anything else frazer chaplin born in dublin one of seven children no record and no complaints shows up on time to the job he reported he has two jobs isabelle told him shows up on time to both of his jobs he seems a bit too interested in money but then who isnt theres something of a joke at dukes hotel him looking for a rich americanbraziliancanadianrussianjapanesechineseanything to support him male or female he doesnt care hes a bloke with plans according to the hotel manager but no one faults him and hes well liked one of those thats our lad frazer types hale said anything on paolo di fazio isabelle asked it turned out that paolo had an interesting background born in palermo from which his family fled the mafia his sister had been married to a minor mafioso there only to be beaten to death by him the husband himself had been found hanged in his cell while awaiting trial and no one thought it was a suicide as to the rest isabelle ardery asked there was very little jayson druther had an asbo apparently having to do with a relationship that went sour but this was with a man not a woman for whatever good that piece of news could do them abbott langer on the other hand was something of a puzzle it was true that he was an olympic ice skater turned coach and dog walker it was completely bogus that he had ever been married with children he was fairly close to yolanda the psychic apparently but this didnt seem to be a sinister connection as it was looking more and more as if yolanda the psychic did as much trolling for surrogate childrenadult or otherwiseas she did reading palms or getting in touch with the spirit world well want more on this marriage business ardery noted hes a real person of interest then lynley slipped out of the meeting as the superintendent was giving further instructions having to do with confirming alibis and with the time of death which was set between two oclock and five oclock this should make it easy she was saying most of these people have jobs someone saw something not quite right somewhere lets find out who and what it is lynley crossed over to tower block and he made his way to the assistant commissioners office hilliers secretaryin an uncharacteristic moverose from her chair and came to greet him her hand extended usually the soul of discretion when it came to things hillier judi macintosh murmured brilliant to see you inspector and added dont be fooled hes quite pleased about this this was apparently lynleys return and he naturally was sir david hillier the assistant commissioner however did not want to talk about lynleys return other than to say youre looking fit good when lynley entered his office then he got down to business the business was as lynley suspected it might be the permanent assignment of someone to the detective superintendents position which was nearly nine months vacant hillier broached the topic in his usual fashion at an oblique angle he said howre you finding the job which of course lynley might have taken any way he wished and which of course hillier would use to steer the conversation any way he desired different and the same at once lynley replied everythings a bit shaded with odd colours sir shes got a good mind i daresay she wouldnt have climbed as fast as shes climbed without that would she actually lynley had been talking about returning to work with the world as hed known it utterly transformed in an instant on the street at the hands of a child with a gun he thought about making this point but instead he said shes clever and quick which seemed to him a good response making a reply but saying little enough how are the team responding to her theyre professionals john stewart no matter who takes the job therell be a period of adjustment wont there john has his quirks but hes a good man im being pressed to name a permanent replacement for malcolm webberly hillier said i tend to think arderys a very good choice lynley nodded but that was the extent of his response he had an uneasy feeling where this was heading naming her will bring a lot of press not necessarily a bad thing lynley said id say the opposite in fact promoting a female officer indeed an officer from outside the meti cant see how that could be interpreted as anything other than a positive move fairly guaranteed to give the met good press which he didnt add they rather badly needed in recent years theyd faced charges of everything from institutionalised racism to gross incompetence and all points in between a story in which there were no skeletons lurking in anyones closet would be a welcome one no doubt about it if it is a positive move hillier noted which brings me to the point ah hillier shot him a look at that ah he apparently decided to let it go he said shes good on paper and shes good from every verbal report about her but you and i know theres more than verbiage involved in being able to do this job well yes but weaknesses always come out eventually lynley said sooner or later they do but the point is im being asked to make this sooner if you understand what i mean and if im going to make it sooner then im also going to make it right understandable lynley acknowledged it seems shes asked you to work with her lynley didnt inquire as to how hillier knew this hillier generally knew everything that was going on he hadnt got to his present position without developing an impressive system of snouts im not sure id call it working with her he said carefully shes asked me to come on board and show her the ropes to allow her to move more quickly into the job she has her work cut out not only new to london but new to the met and having a murder case landing in her lap if i can help her make a quick transition im happy to so youre getting to know her better than the rest i daresay that brings me to the point i cant put this delicately so im not going to try if you come across anything that gives you pause about her i want to know what it is and i do mean anything actually sir i dont think im the one to youre exactly the one youve been in the job you dont want the job youre working with her and youve a very good eye for people you and i have disagreed over the years which was putting it mildly lynley thought but id never deny that youve rarely been wrong about someone youve a vested interestwe all have a vested interestin this job going to someone good to the best person out there and youre going to know if shes that officer in very short order what im asking you to do is to tell me and frankly im going to need details because the last thing we need is a charge of sexism if she doesnt get the job what is it exactly that you want me to do sir if he was going to be asked to spy upon isabelle ardery then the assistant commissioner lynley decided was going to have to come out and say it written reports a regular briefing meetings like this i think you know as it happens i his mobile rang he looked at it let it go hillier said its ardery lynley replied still he waited for the assistant commissioners sharp nod telling him to take it weve got an id on the second efit ardery told him hes a violinist thomas his brother identified him chapter sixteen barbara havers did the telephone work and winston nkata did the route planning without much difficulty she was able to track down jonas bligh and keating crawford the two instructors at winchester technical college iino one was shedding any light on whether there was actually a winchester technical college iand both of these individuals agreed to speak to the scotland yard detectives both of them also asked what the coming visit from scotland yard was about when she said it was about a bloke called gordon jossie for whom a letter of reference had been written the response of who was identical barbara repeated jossies name this would have been eleven years ago she told them again they were virtual echoes in reply eleven years one could hardly be expected to remember a student from such a long time ago sergeant but each went on to assure her he would be waiting for the detectives to show up meanwhile nkata was studying the map to get them up to winchester into winchester and in the general environs of the college he was growing less and less happy about being in hampshire and barbara couldnt blame him he was the only black person she herself had seen since theyd entered the new forest and from the reaction of everyone theyd come into contact with at the hotel in sway he appeared to be the first black man theyd ever encountered other than on the telly shed said to him sotto voce at dinner on the previous evening first its that people think were a couple winnie to excuse the obvious curiosity of their server he said yeah and she could sense him bristling so wha if we are something wrong with mixed couples something wrong with that course not barbara said at once bloody hell winnie i should be so lucky and thats why theyre staring him and her theyre thinking howd she score that bloke definitely not on her looks by god have a look at the two of usyou and mehaving dinner in a hotel the candlelight the flowers on the table the music playing its a cd barb bear with me okay people jump to conclusions based on what they see you can believe me i get it all the time when im with di lynley he seemed to think about this the hotel dining room was moderately special even if the music did indeed come from a cd playing old neil diamond hits and the flowers on the table were plastic it remained the only establishment in sway where one could have anything remotely resembling a romantic evening still he said second to which she said huh you said first whats second she said oh second its just that youre tall and youve got that scar on your face makes you look a type and then theres the way you dress contrasted with the way i dress they also might be thinking youre someone and im your secretary or assistant or whatever probably a footballer that would be you not me or maybe a film star i reckon theyre trying to decide where they saw you last big brother some game show maybe on morse when you were still in nappies he gazed at her looking mildly amused he said you do this with inspector lynley barb do what worry so much bout him i mean like youre doing with me she could feel herself colouring was i i mean am i sorry just that nice of you he told her but i been stared at worsen here believe me oh she said well and he added you dont dress half bad barb to which she guffawed right and jesus didnt die on the cross but its no matter superintendent ardery is seeing about that soon believe me ill be the mets answer to she pulled at her lip see thats the problem i dont even know the latest fashion icon thats how far out of the loop i am well whatever it cant be helped but life was easier when emulating the dress sense of the queen was good enough let me tell you not that she herself had ever emulated the queens dress sense barbara thought although she did wonder if sensible shoes gloves and a handbag looped over her arm would satisfy superintendent ardery winchester being a city and not a village winston nkata was not marked for special observation there nor was he much noted on the campus of winchester technical college ii which they found easily as a result of his advanced planning jonas bligh and keating crawford proved to be more challenging however expecting to find them in a department somehow related to thatching barbara had neglected to ask their whereabouts it turned out that bligh was involved with computers in some arcane fashion while crawford dealt with telecommunications bligh was having his surgery hours they were told and they found his office tucked beneath a stairway up and down which during their initial conversation with him herds of students pounded incessantly barbara couldnt imagine anyone actually accomplishing anything in this environment but when they introduced themselves to bligh the wax earplugs he removed from his ears explained how he managed to cope with the place he suggested they get out of there go for a coffee have a walk whatever barbara countersuggested that they track down crawford a plan that she hoped would save them some time that was managed by way of mobile phone and they met the telecommunications instructor in the car park where a caravan selling ice cream and juice was attracting a crowd crawford was one of them heavy was a sympathetic way to describe him he certainly didnt need the cornetto he was attacking he finished it and immediately purchased another calling over his shoulder you lot want one to the detectives and to his colleague fully capable of seeing her future when her feet were held to the flames barbara demurred winston did likewise so did bligh who muttered dead before hes fifty just you wait although he said pleasantly dont blame you to crawford in reference to the second cornetto damned hot summer eh they went through the usual prefatory conversational motions that were peculiar to the english a brief discussion of the weather they strolled to a patch of browning lawn that was shaded by a sturdy sycamore there were no benches or chairs here but it was a relief to get out of the sun barbara handed each of the men the letter of reference hed written for gordon jossie bligh put on a pair of spectacles crawford dropped a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the sheet he wiped it off on his trouser leg said sorry occupational hazard and began to read in a moment he frowned and said what the hell and bligh simultaneously shook his head they spoke nearly in unison this is bogus bligh said as crawford declared i didnt write this barbara and winston exchanged a glance are you sure she asked the instructors could you have forgotten i mean you must be asked to write a lot of letters at the end of students course work right naturally bligh agreed his voice was dry but im generally asked to write letters in my own field sergeant this is college letterhead ill give you that but the letter itself deals with gordon jossies accomplishments in accounts and finance which i dont teach and thats not my signature you barbara said to crawford i take it he nodded large appliance repair he said indicating the contents of the letter by extending it to her not my bailiwick not even close what about the signature same thing im afraid someone likely nicked letterhead from an officeor even designed it on their computer i suppose if they had an example in front of themand then wrote their own recommendations it happens sometimes although youd think this bloke would have checked first to see who taught what looks to me like he gave a quick glance at a list of the staff and chose our names at random exactly bligh said barbara looked at winston it explains how someone who cant read or write managed to complete course work at the college eh winston nodded but not how someone who cant read or write wrote these letters cos he didnt that looks like the case which meant of course that someone else had written them for gordon jossie someone who knew him from years gone by someone they likely hadnt spoken to yet robbie hastings knew that if he was going to get to the bottom of what had happened to his sister and why and if he was going to be able to go on livingno matter how bleaklyhe had to begin looking squarely at a few basic truths meredith had been attempting to tell him at least one of those truths in the church in ringwood hed stopped her abruptly because he was quite simply a bloody coward but he knew he couldnt go on that way so he finally picked up the phone she said how are you when she heard his voice i mean how are you doing rob how are you coping i cant sleep or eat can you have you i just want to do merry he cleared his throat part of him was shouting better not to know better never to know and part of him was trying to ignore those cries what didin the church when you and i were talking about herwhat did you mean when you said whenever that was the word you used i did rob i dont know with a bloke you said whenever she was with a bloke god he thought dont make me say more oh merediths voice was small jemima and sex you mean he whispered it aye oh rob i spose i shouldnt actually have said that but you did didnt you so you need to tell me if you know something thats to do with her death its nothing she said quickly im sure of it its not that he said nothing more reckoning that if he was silent she would be forced to continue which she did she said she was younger then it was years ago anyway and she would have changed rob people do change he wanted so much to believe her such a simple matter to say oh right well thanks and ring off in the background he could hear murmurs of conversation hed phoned meredith at work and he could have used this alone as an excuse to end their conversation at that point so could have she for that matter but he didnt take that turn he couldnt do so now and live with the knowledge that hed run again just as hed turned a blind eye to what he knew at heart she was going to tell him if he insisted upon it seems its time for me to know it all merry its no betrayal on your part mind theres nothing you can say would make a difference now when she spoke at last it sounded to him as if she were talking inside a tube as the sound was hollow although it could well have been that his heart was hollow she said finally eleven then rob eleven what he asked lovers he wondered had jemima had so many already and by what age and had she actually kept count years meredith said thats how old and when he said nothing she rushed on with oh rob you dont want to know really and she wasnt bad she justsee she equated things course i didnt know that at the time why she did it i mean i just knew she might end up pregnant but she said no because she took precautions she even knew that word precautions i dont know what she used or where she got it because she wouldnt say just that it wasnt up to me to tell her right from wrong and if i was her friend i would know that wouldnt i and then it became a matter of me not having boyfriends see youre only jealous merry but that wasnt it rob she was my friend i only wanted to keep her safe and people talked about her so specially at school robbie wasnt sure he could speak he was standing in the kitchen and he felt blindly behind him for a chair onto which he could lower himself with infinite slowness boys at school he said boys at school were having jemima when she was eleven who how many because he would find them he thought he would find them and he would sort them even now so many years after the fact meredith said i dont know how many i mean she always had boyfriends but i dont expectsurely not all of them rob but he knew she was lying to protect his feelings or perhaps because she believed shed betrayed jemima enough even as he was the one whod betrayed her by not seeing what was in front of him all along tell me the rest he said theres more isnt there her voice altered as she replied and he could tell she was crying no no theres really no more god damn it merry really tell me rob please dont ask what else and then his own voice broke when he said please and perhaps that was what made her continue if there was a boy she was doing it with and another boy wanted hershe didnt understand she didnt know how to be faithful she didnt mean it as anything and she wasnt a tart she just didnt understand how it looked to other people i mean what they thought or might do or might ask of her i tried to tell her but there was this boy and that boy and this man and that man and she just couldnt see that it really had nothing to do with lovewhat they wantedand when i tried to tell her she reckoned i was being yes he said all right yes she was quiet again although he could hear the rustle of something against the phone tissue likely shed wept the entire time shed spoken she said we used to quarrel remember we used to talk for hours in her bedroom remember aye aye i remember that so you seei triedi should have told someone but i didnt know who you didnt think to tell me i did think yes but then sometimes i thoughtall the men and perhaps even you oh god merry im sorry so sorry why did you did she say never nothing not that but still you thought he felt a laugh bubbling in him one of simple despair at so outrageous an idea so far from the truth of who he was and how he lived his life at least he thought with gordon jossie had come an alteration in his sister somehow shed found what she was looking for because surely shed been faithful to him she had to have been he said she stuck with jossie though she was true to him i mean like i told you before he wanted to marry her and he wouldnt have done if he had the slightest suspicion or indication that did he something about the way she asked the question stopped him did he what want to marry her really course he did she left because she wanted time to think about it and i expect he worried it was over between them because he phoned her and phoned her and she got herself a new mobile so you see shed finally got to the pointi told you all this merry he was fairly babbling at this point and he knew it because he reckoned there was something more to come from his sisters friend there was meredith said but rob before ourwhat do i call it our breakup our row the end of our friendship before that she told me gordon didnt want to marry at all it wasnt her she said he didnt want to marry full stop he was afraid of marriage she said he was afraid of getting too close to anyone blokes always say that merry at the beginning no listen she told me it was all she could do to talk him into living together and before that it was all she could do to talk him into letting her spend the night with him and before that it was all she could do to coax him into having sex so to think he was mad to marry herwhat would have changed him living with her getting used to that seeing that there was no big fear to being with someone learning that what learning what truth is rob if there was something to learnsomething to discoverwouldnt it likely be that he discovered that jemima no he said it not because he believed it but because he wanted to believe it that his sister had been to gordon jossie what she hadnt been to her own brother an open book wasnt that what couples were meant to be to each other he asked himself but he had no answer how bloody could he since being one half of a couple was for him the stuff of fantasy meredith said i wish you hadnt asked i wish i hadnt said what does it matter really now i mean at the end of the day she only wanted someone to love her i think i didnt see that at the time when we were girls and when i finally did see it when we were older our paths were so different that when i tried to talk to her about it it seemed like i had a problem not jemima it got her killed he said thats what happened isnt it surely not because if shed changed as you said shed changed if she was faithful to gordonand shed been with him longer than anyone else hadnt she more than two years three she left in a rush he kept ringing her you see that means he wanted her back which he wouldnt have wanted if shed been unfaithful i think shed grown out of all that rob really i do but robbie could tell by the eagerness of merediths tone that whatever she said from this moment onwards would be said to assuage his feelings he felt turned every which way and he was dizzy among all the new information he had gathered there had to be an essential truth about his sister there had to be a way to explain both her life and her death and he had to find that truth for he knew that its discovery would be the only way he could forgive himself for failing jemima when she had needed him most barbara havers and winston nkata returned to the operational command unit where they handed over the forged letters from winchester technical college ii to the chief superintendent whiting read them he was the sort of reader who formed the words with his lips as he went along he took his time barbara said weve spoken to these two blokes sir they didnt write the letters they dont know gordon jossie he looked up that he said is problematical in a nutshell barbara thought although he didnt seem wildly interested in the matter she said last time we were here you said two women had phoned up about him did i whiting seemed to be musing on the matter there were two calls i believe two women suggesting that jossie needed looking into and barbara asked and whiting said barbara exchanged a glance with winston he did the honours we got these letters now see we got a dead girl up in london connected with this bloke he went up there on a search for her sometime back which he doesnt deny and he stuck up cards with her picture on them asking for phone calls should anyone see her and you got two phone calls yourself drawing your tention to him those calls didnt mention a card in london whiting said nor did they mention your dead girl point is the calls themselves and how thingsre stacking up gainst jossie yes whiting said that can make things look iffy i do see that barbara decided indirection was clearly not the path to take with the chief superintendent she said sir what do you know about gordon jossie that youre not telling us whiting handed the letters back to her not a bloody thing he said did you check him out based on those phone calls sergeantis it havers and nkata whiting waited for their nods although barbara could have sworn he knew their names very well despite the fact that he mispronounced both of them im not very likely to use manpower to investigate someone based on a phone call from a woman who might well be upset because a gentleman stood her up for a date you said two women nkata pointed out one woman two women the point is that they had no complaint only suspicions and their suspicions amounted to being suspicious if you understand meaning what barbara asked meaning that they had nothing to be suspicious about he wasnt peeping in windows he wasnt hanging about primary schools he wasnt snatching handbags from old ladies he wasnt moving questionable bits of this or that into his house or out of it he wasnt inviting women on the street to step into his vehicle for a bit of youknowwhat as far as they could tell usthese phone callers who by the way wouldnt leave their nameshe was just a suspicious type those letters of yourshe indicated the forgeries from the collegedont add anything to the mix seems to me the important bit is not that he forged them he didnt barbara said he cant read or write all right someone else forged them a mate of his a girlfriend who knows have you ever considered that he wouldnt have got himself hired as an apprentice at his age had he not had something to show he was a worthwhile risk i daresay thats all these letters show true enough barbara said but the fact remains the fact remains that the important bit is whether he did his job well once he got it and thats what he did yes he served a fine apprenticeship up in itchen abbas then he began his own business hes built that business up and as far as i know he has kept his nose clean sir i think thats the end of the story dont you as it happened she didnt but barbara said nothing nor did nkata and as she was careful not to look at winston so was he careful not to look at her for there was something that the chief superintendent wasnt dealing with theyd said nothing at all to him about gordon jossies serving an apprenticeship to ringo heath or to anyone else and the fact that whiting knew about one suggested once again that there was more to gordon jossie and his life in the new forest than met the eye to barbara there was no question about it chief superintendent zachary whiting was fully apprised as to what the more was meredith decided further action was called for after the phone call from rob hastings she could tell the poor man was equal parts crushed to the core and riddled by guilt and since part of this was due to her mouth running on about matters best left unsaid she took a step to rectify things she had seen just enough cop shows on the telly to know what to do when she made the decision to go to lyndhurst she was fairly confident that gina dickens wouldnt be in the lodgings that she claimed was hers above the mad hatter tea rooms since gina had seemed fairly intent upon establishing her life with gordon jossie meredith reckoned that in the pursuit of this end she likely hadnt darkened her own doorway in days should she actually be in meredith had her excuse ready came to say sorry for being such a pest im just upset that part was the truth at least although being upset was only the half of it shed begged the rest of the day off splitting headache the heat and that time of the month shed work at home if they didnt mind where she could put a cold compress on her head she nearly had most of the graphic done anyway an hour more was all it would take to get it finished that was fine with the boss and off she went and when she got to lyndhurst she parked by the new forest museum and walked the short distance up to the tea rooms on the high street midsummer and lyndhurst was thick with tourists the town sat squarely in the centre of the perambulation and was generally the first stop for visitors wishing to familiarise themselves with this part of hampshire ginas lodgings above the mad hatter tea rooms were accessed by a doorway that was separate from the tea rooms themselves from which at this time of day the scent of baked goods rolled out onto the street there were two lodging rooms only and since from one hiphop music was blasting meredith chose the other it was here she applied the knowledge shed gained from watching police programmes on the telly she used a credit card to ease the catch back it took five tries and she was drenched in sweatboth from nerves and from the ambient temperature in the buildingbefore she got inside but when she managed it she knew shed made the right decision for a mobile phone on the nightstand was ringing and as far as she was concerned the ringing was fairly screaming clue she made a dash for it she picked it up she said yes with as much authority as she could muster and as breathlessly as she could manage in order to disguise her voice as she did this she looked round the room it was furnished simply a bed a chest of drawers a bedside table a desk a wardrobe there was a basin with a mirror above it but no en suite bath as the window was closed it was deadly hot there was silence on the other end of the phone she thought shed missed the call and she cursed to herself then a mans voice said babe scotland yards been how the hell much longer and she went cold from head to toe as if a blast of refrigerated air had shot through the room she said who is this tell me who this is silence in reply then shit in a low mutter and then nothing she said hello hello who is this but she knew that whoever it was he had already disconnected himself from the call she punched the send button to return the call although she reckoned that the man on the other end would hardly answer but she didnt need him to do so she needed only to see the number from which the call had come what she got though was private number printed on the small screen damn she thought whoever he was he was calling from a withheld number when the call went through it rang and rang as shed expected no voice mail no message it had been a call from someone in cahoots with gina dickens meredith felt a surge of triumph at this knowledge it proved that shed been right from the first shed known that gina dickens was dirty all that remained was to find out the real purpose of her presence in the new forest because no matter what gina had declared about her programme to help girls at risk meredith didnt buy it as far as she was concerned the only girl at risk had been jemima through the walls of the room the hiphop music continued to thump from below the noise from the tea rooms rose from without the street noise reverberated through the windows lorries passing through lyndhurst high street and grinding through their gears when they hit the gentle slope cars heading for southampton or beaulieu tour coaches the size of small cottages ferrying their passengers south to brockenhurst or even as far as the port town of lymington and an excursion over to the isle of wight meredith remembered how gina had spoken of the cacophony in the street beneath her window in this at least she had not been lying but in other matterswell that was what meredith was here to discover she had to be quick she was going from cold to hot again and she knew she couldnt risk opening a window and drawing attention to the room in this way but the temperature made the air close and herself claustrophobic she attacked the bedside table first the clock radio upon it was tuned to radio five which didnt seem to indicate anything and within the single drawer of the table there was nothing but a box of tissues and an old opened package of blutac with a small chunk of it missing on the shelf of the table was a stack of magazines too ancient to have belonged to gina dickens meredith reckoned in the wardrobe there were clothes but not the quantity that one would associate with permanency they were of good quality though in keeping with what meredith had already seen gina wearing she had expensive taste nothing was trendy rubbish but the clothes gave no other clue about their owner they did make meredith wonder how gina expected to maintain her wardrobe on what gordon jossie made as a thatcher but that was it she had similar luck with the chest of drawers where the one piece of information she gleaned was that gina definitely did not buy her knickers at discount prices they seemed to be silk or satin at least six different colours and prints and each pair of knickers possessed a bra to match meredith allowed herself a moment of knicker envy before she looked through the rest of the drawers she saw neatly folded tshirts jerseys and a few scarves that was it the desk offered even less information it displayed some tourist brochures in a wooden holder atop it and some exceedingly cheap stationery in its centre drawer along with two postcards featuring the mad hatter tea rooms there was a single pen in a shallow depression within this drawer but that was all meredith pushed it shut sat on the desk chair and thought about what she had seen virtually nothing of use gina had nice clothes she liked nice knickers and she had a mobile phone why she didnt have that phone with her was an interesting point had she forgotten it did she not want gordon jossie to know that she had it was she worried that possession of it would indicate something she didnt wish him to know was she avoiding a caller to whom she didnt wish to speak was she therefore on the run the only way to get an answer to any of those questions was to ask her directly which meredith could hardly do without revealing shed broken into her room so she was out of luck she gazed round the place for want of anything else to do she looked under the bed but was not surprised when she found nothing but a suitcase which itself contained nothing she even examined it for a false bottomat this point feeling fairly ridiculousbut she came up emptyhanded at that she heaved herself to her feet once again noting the closeness of the room she thought about splashing some water on her face and she reckoned it wouldnt hurt to use the basin to revive herself but the water was tepid and would have needed running for several minutes to become cool enough to do any good she patted her face on the hand towel provided rehung it neatly on its rack and then gave a closer look to the sink it hung from the wall and was fairly modern in appearance it was feminine as well with flowers and vines painted onto the porcelain meredith ran her hand along it and then thinking that as shed noted it so also might have gina she ran her hand beneath it as well her fingers came to something that didnt feel right she squatted to have a better look there beneath the basin something had been lodged with blutac it appeared to be a small taped and folded package made of paper she eased it off the underside of the basin and carried it to the desk carefully she removed both the tape and the blutac for future use unfolded the paper turned out to be a piece of the rooms cheap stationery it had been fashioned into something akin to a pouch and what that pouch held appeared to be a small medallion meredith would have vastly preferred a message cryptic or otherwise she would have liked to see i asked gordon jossie to murder jemima hastings so that he would be free for me although she would not have said no to i believe gordon jossie is a killer although i myself had nothing to do with it instead what she had was a roundish object looking as if it had been made as part of a metallurgy class clearly it was supposed to be a perfect circle but it hadnt quite made it the metal in question looked like dirty gold but it could have been anything that headed remotely in the direction of gold as meredith reckoned there werent a lot of classes on offer that allowed students to experiment with something so expensive the thought of classes took her inexorably to winchester where gina dickens had come from there seemed to be possible fruit to be borne from a fuller exploration of this meredith didnt know whether this object actually belonged to ginanor had she the slightest idea why gina or anyone else would have placed it beneath the basinbut the opened packet of blutac in the bedside table suggested it was hers and as long as ginas ownership was a possibility meredith was not at a dead end in her investigation the question now was whether to take the little medallion with her or try to remember what it looked like so that she could describe it later she considered drawing it and she even went to the desk sat and brought out a sheet of the cheap stationery to try her hand at sketching the problem was that the workmanship wasnt particularly clear and while there seemed to be embossing on the thing she couldnt make any of it out very well so it seemed to her that there was nothing for it but to engage in one small act of burglary it was in a good cause after all when gordon jossie arrived back at his holding he found gina in the last place he would ever have expected to see her the west paddock she was at the far side of it and he might have missed her altogether had not one of the ponies whinnied which directed his attention over to them he saw the blond of ginas hair against the dark green backdrop of the wood in the distance at first he thought she was merely walking on the far side of the paddock and beyond the fence perhaps returning from a ramble in the trees but when he climbed out of the pickup with tess at his heels he ventured over to the fence and found that gina was actually within the paddock itself this sent his hackles soaring from the first gina had made a considerable topic out of her fear of the new forest ponies so to find her inside the paddock with them aroused the sleeping cobra of distrust within him she hadnt noticed his arrival she was pacing along the line of the barbedwire fencing and she seemed intent upon ignoring the ponies as well as watching for their droppings or taking care with her footwork since she had her eyes on the ground he called to her she started one hand clutching at the collar of her shirt in the other hand she appeared to be carrying a map she was wearing he saw her kneehigh wellingtons this told him that whatever else she was doing once again she was worried about adders briefly he thought about explaining to her that adders wouldnt likely be in the paddock that the paddock was not the heath but this wasnt a moment for explanations on his part there was a question to be answered about what she was doing in the paddock in the first place and about the map she was holding she smiled and waved and folded it she said with a laugh you gave me quite a fright whatre you doing he couldnt help it his voice was sharp he made a concerted effort to soften it but he didnt quite manage to make his tone normal i thought ponies scared you she cast a look at the animals they were meandering across the paddock in the direction of the water trough gordon gave it a look as he went over to the fence with tess on his heels the water was low and he went for the hosepipe and unspooled it to the paddock he entered telling the dog to stay where she waswhich she didnt much like pacing back and forth to show her displeasureand he began topping up the trough as he did this gina picked her way in his direction but she didnt do it by crossing directly over to him as another person might rather she went by way of the fence keeping within inches of it as she moved along she didnt answer him till shed reached the eastern part of the paddock in this diligent fashion youve found me out she said pooh i did so want to make it a surprise she cast a wary eye on the ponies as she got closer to him so also did she get closer to them what surprise he asked and is that a map whatre you doing with a map how cn a map be part of a surprise she laughed please one thing at a time whyre you inside the paddock gina she observed him for a moment before she answered then she said with care is something wrong should i not be in here you said the new forest poniesyou said that horses in general i know what i said about horses but that doesnt mean i wouldnt try to get over it what are you talking about gina reached his side before she replied again she ran her hand through her sparkly hair despite his agitation he liked to see her do this he liked the way it fell back into place so perfectly no matter how sheor hedisheveled it getting over an irrational fear she told him its called desensitisation havent you ever heard of people who get over their fears by being exposed to them bollocks people dont get over their fears shed been smiling but her smile faltered at his tone she said what nonsense gordon of course they do if they want to they expose themselves to their fear in increments till theyre no longer afraid like getting over a fear of heights by slowly exposing oneself to progressively higher and higher places or getting over a fear of flying by getting used to the aeroplane jetway first and then going to the doorway of the plane and then just inside with the doors open and then to the seats havent you heard of that whats that have to do with being in the paddock and carrying a map with you what the hell are you doing with a map she frowned outright then she shifted her weight in that womanly way one hip jutted out she said gordon are you accusing me of something answer the question she looked as startled as shed looked when he first called out her name only this time he knew it was because of how sharply he spoke to her she said quietly i just explained it to you im trying to get used to them by being in the paddock with them not close to them but not on the other side of the fence either i was going to stay there until they didnt make me so nervous then i was going to take a step or two closer to them thats all the map he said i want to know about the map good grief i took it from my car gordon its something to wave at them to frighten them off if they got too close he said nothing in reply to this she looked at him so closely that he turned his head to keep her from reading his expression he felt his blood pulsing in his temples and he knew his face must be red and revealing she said with what sounded like great care are you aware that youre acting like you suspect me of something again he made no reply he wanted out of the paddock he wanted her out of the paddock as well he went to the gate and she followed him saying whats wrong gordon has something happened something else what dyou mean he demanded swinging to her whats supposed to have happened well heavens i dont know but first that strange man came to speak with you then those detectives from scotland yard to tell you that jemima this isnt about jemima he cried she gaped at him then closed her mouth she said all right its not about jemima but youre clearly upset and i cant think its just that i went into the paddock to get used to the horses because that doesnt make sense he forced out the words because he had to say something theyve talked to ringo he phoned me about it ringo clearly she was nonplussed he gave them letters and the letters are false he didnt know that but theyll suss it out then theyll be back here at the double cliff lied like i asked him to but hell break if they press him theyll force the issue and he wont hold out does any of that matter of course it matters he jerked the gate open hed forgotten about the dog tess raced inside and greeted gina ecstatically seeing this gordon told himself that it had to mean something if tess liked gina tess read people well and if she read gina as decent and good what else mattered gina knelt to rub the dogs head tess wagged her tail and bumped closer to her for more gina looked up at him and said but you went to holland thats all it was if it comes to it you can tell the police you lied because you dont have the paperwork and what does it matter anyway if you dont have the itinerary or the ticket or whatever you went to holland and you can prove it some way hotel records internet searches the person you talked to about the reeds really how difficult can it actually be and when he didnt answer gordon wasnt that the case you were in holland werent you why dyou want to know he spoke explosively it was the very last thing he intended but he wouldnt be pressed shed risen from the dog as she spoke and she took a step away from him now her gaze drifted beyond him and he swung round to see who was there but it was only her car she was looking at and it came to him that she was thinking about leaving she seemed somehow to master this desire because once again she spoke calmly enough although he could see from the way her mouth formed the words that she was on the alert and prepared to run from him he wondered how theyd got to this point but he knew at heart that this would always be the end point he reached with a woman it might as well have been written in stone she said darling whats going on whos ringo what letters are you talking about have those police come to see you again today or at heart is this just about me because if it is i had no ideai didnt intend harm it only seemed to me that if were to be togetheri mean permanentlythen i need to get used to the new forest animals dont i the horses are part of your life theyre part of the holding i cant avoid them forever it was if not an olive branch then at least a fork in the road that he could take if he wanted to take it he thought about the choices that lay ahead before he finally said if you wanted to get used to them i would have helped you i know that but then it wouldnt have been a surprise and thats what i wanted it to be some small tension seemed to release within her before she went on im sorry if ive somehow overstepped the mark i didnt think it would actually hurt anything look will you watch she took the map and unfolded it she said will you let me show you gordon she waited for his nod when he gave it she turned from him she approached the trough slowly the map held at her side the ponies were drinking but they raised their heads warily they were wild after all and meant to remain so next to him tess whined for attention and he grasped her collar near the trough gina raised the map she waved it at the ponies and cried shoo horse tess gave a sharp bark as the ponies wheeled round and trotted to the far side of the paddock gina turned back to him she said nothing nor did he it was another point of choice for him but there were so many now so many choices and so many paths and every day there seemed to be more one wrong move was all it would take and he knew that better than anything she came back to him when she was outside the paddock once again he released his hold on the dog and tess bounded to gina a moment for another caress and the retriever was off in the direction of the barn loping for the shade and her water dish gina stood before him as was his habit he was wearing his dark glasses still and she reached up and removed them saying let me see your eyes the light he said although this wasnt quite the truth and i dont like to be without them which was she said gordon can you be easy will you let me help you let everything go he felt tight from head to foot held in a vice of his own creation i cant you can she said let me my darling and the miracle of gina was that how he had been with her moments before did not matter to her she was now incarnate the past was the past she slid one hand up his chest and her arm round his neck she drew him near her while her other hand slid down and down in order to make him hard let me help you let everything go she repeated this time close and against his mouth let me darling he groaned helplessly and then he chose he closed the remaining space between them chapter seventeen hes called yukio matsumoto isabelle ardery told lynley when he walked into her office his brother saw the efit and phoned in she fingered through some paperwork on her desk lynley said hiro matsumoto she looked up thats the brother dyou know him i know of him hes a cellist in a london orchestra no hes a soloist well known if you follow classical music which you do i take it she sounded marginally piqued as if hed been intent upon demonstrating knowledge that she considered both arcane and offensive she also seemed on edge lynley wondered if this had to do with whatever she might be thinking about his meeting with hillier he wanted to tell her to have no fear on that score while he and hillier had reached a point of personal rapprochement after helens death he had a feeling it wouldnt last and soon enough theyd be back on their previous footing which was at each others throats he said ive heard him play if indeed thats the hiro matsumoto who phoned you i cant think therere two blokes with that name and anyway he wouldnt come to the yard he said hed speak to us at his solicitors office some backing and forthing over that and we compromised with the bar at the milestone hotel not far from the albert hall do you know it it cant be difficult to find he said but why not at his solicitors office i dont like the image of cap in hand she looked at her watch ten minutes she said ill meet you at the car she tossed him her keys it was actually fifteen minutes later when she joined him in the closer confines of the car she smelled of mint right she said as they headed up the ramp tell me thomas he glanced at her what dont be coy did hillier order you to watch me and give him reports lynley smiled to himself not in so many words but it was about me wasnt it this meeting with sir david at the street he braked and looked in her direction you know in some situations that conclusion would smack of narcissism the appropriate response would be the world is not all about you guv isabelle she said guv he repeated oh bother thomas i dont intend to let that go the isabelle bit as to the other are you going to tell me or shall i just assume i want loyalists working for me by the way youll have to choose sides and if i dont wish to out on your handsome ear youll be back to traffic warden in the blink of an eye i was never a traffic warden in the first place guv isabelle and you damn well know what i mean behind those impeccable manners of yours he pulled out into broadway and considered his route he settled on making for birdcage walk and weaving over to kensington from there the milestone hotel was one of the many boutique establishments that had been springing up round town in the last few years fashioned from one of the distinguished redbrick mansions that faced kensington gardens and the palace it was oaken quiet and discreet an oasis from the bustle of high street kensington not far from the hotels front door it was also airconditioned a real blessing the hotels staff wore expensive uniforms and spoke in the hushed voices of people at a religious service the moment that lynley and isabelle ardery walked into the place they were approached by a pleasant concierge who asked if he could be of assistance to them they wanted the bar ardery told him she was brisk and official where is it she asked the mans moment of hesitation was something lynley recognised as an indication of a disapproval that he wouldnt voice for all he knew she was a hotel inspector or someone getting ready to write about the milestone in one of the myriad guides to london it would serve everyones interests if he cooperated as blandly as possible with only a minuscule display of his judgment of her manners he said of course madam and he took them personally to the bar which turned out to be an intimate setting for a colloquy before he left them isabelle asked him to fetch the bartender and when that individual arrived she ordered a vodka and tonic to lynleys carefully expressionless face she said are you going to tell me about sir david or not which surprised him as he thought shed likely remark about the drink theres little to report hes interested in filling the position soon its been too long without someone permanently in webberlys place youve a good shot at it as as long as i keep my nose clean wear tights to the office dont ruffle anyones feathers and walk the straight and narrow she said which i suppose includes not having a vodka and tonic during working hours whatever the temperature of the day i was going to say as far as i can tell he told her hed ordered a mineral water for himself she narrowed her eyes at him and frowned at the bottle of pellegrino when it arrived you disapprove of me dont you she said will you tell sir david that i disapprove i dont actually not even of the fact that i have the occasional drink on duty im not a lush thomas guv youve no need to explain yourself to me and as to the rest im not eager to become hilliers snout he knows that but your opinion counts with him i cant think why if it does now it never did before the sound of quiet conversation came in their direction and in a moment two people entered the room lynley recognised the cellist at once his companion was an attractive asian woman in a smartly tailored suit and stiletto heels that clicked like whip cracks against the floor she glanced at lynley but spoke to ardery superintendent she said at arderys nod she introduced herself as zaynab bourne and this is mr matsumoto she told them hiro matsumoto bent fractionally from the waist although he also extended his hand he gave a firm handshake and murmured a conventional greeting he had lynley thought a quite pleasant face behind his wirerimmed spectacles his eyes appeared kind for an international celebrity in the world of classical music he seemed inordinately humble as well asking politely for a cup of tea green tea if they had it he said if not black tea would do he spoke without an apparent accent lynley recalled that hed been born in kyoto but hed studied and played abroad for many years he was appearing now at the albert hall he said he was in london for only a fortnight also teaching a master class at the music college it was purest chance that hed seen the efitwhich he called the artists renditionof his brother in the newspaper and also on the television news please believe me hiro matsumoto said quietly when i assure you that yukio did not kill this woman the papers are speaking of he could not have done so why ardery said he was in the vicinityweve a witness to thatand he seems to have been running from the scene matsumoto looked pained there will be an explanation whatever else he might be whatever else he does my brother yukio is not a killer zaynab bourne said as if to explain mr matsumotos younger brother suffers from paranoid schizophrenia superintendent unfortunately he wont take medication but hes never been in trouble with the police since he first came to londonif you check your records youll find this is trueand he leads a quiet life in general my clientwith a brief proprietary touch on hiro matsumotos armis identifying him so that you can concentrate your efforts elsewhere where they belong that may be the casethe schizophrenia bit ardery said but as he was seen running from the area of a murder and as some of his clothing appeared to have been removed and was balled up its been hot weather the solicitor cut in hes going to have to be questioned so if you know where he is mr matsumoto you do need to tell us the cellist hesitated he removed a handkerchief from his pocket and used it on his glasses unshielded by them his face looked quite young he was in his late forties lynley knew but he could have passed for a man fifteen years younger he said first i must explain to you ardery looked as if the last thing she wanted was an explanation for anything but lynley himself was curious as secondary officer to ardery it wasnt his place but still he said yes his brother was a gifted musician hiro matsumoto said they were a musical family and the three of themthere was also a sister who was a flautist in philadelphiahad all been given instruments as children they were expected to learn to practise long and hard to play well and to excel towards this end they were educated in music at great cost to their parents and at personal sacrifice of them all obviously he said there is not a normal childhood when one has this sort offocus he chose the last word carefully in the end i went to juilliard miyoshi studied in paris and yukio came to london he was fine at first there was no indication that anything was wrong it was only later that the illness appeared and because of thisbecause it happened in the midst of his studiesour father believed he was malingering out of his depth perhaps and unable to admit it or to cope with it this was not the case of course he was seriously ill but in our culture and in our family matsumoto had continued polishing his glasses as he spoke but now he paused put them on and adjusted them carefully on his nose our father is not a bad man but his beliefs are firm and he could not be convinced that yukio needed more than merely a good talking to he came here from kyoto he made his wishes known to yukio he gave him instructions and he expected them to be followed since his instructions had always been obeyed he thought hed done enough and at first it seemed so yukio drove himself hard but the illnessthis is not something you can wish away or work away he had a collapse he left the college and he simply disappeared for ten years he was lost to us when we located him we wanted to help him but he would not be forced his fears are too great he distrusts the medicines he has a terror of hospitals he manages to survive on his music and my sister and i do what we can to watch over him when we come to london and do you now know where he is exactly where he is matsumoto looked to his solicitor zaynab bourne took up the thread of the conversation i hope mr matsumoto has made it clear that his brother is ill he wants an assurance that nothing will be done that might frighten him he understands that yukio will need to be questioned but he insists that your approach be cautious and that any interview be conducted in my presence and in the presence of a mental health professional he also insists upon your acknowledgement and assurance that as his brother is someone diagnosed with untreated paranoid schizophrenia his wordswhatever they might be once you speak to himcan hardly be used against him lynley glanced at ardery she had her hands clasped round her vodka and tonic and her fingers tapped against the cool sides of the glass shed drunk most of it during their conversation and now she drained the rest she said i acknowledge that well take care youll be there a specialist will be there the pope the home secretary and the prime minister will be there if you want it youll have as many witnesses as you like if thats your pleasure but if he admits to murder hes going to be charged hes seriously ill the solicitor said and we have a legal system that will make that determination there was a little silence as the cellist and his solicitor thought this over ardery leaned back in her chair lynley waited for her to remind them that they were at the moment sheltering someone who could be a material witness to a crime or worse the actual killer but she didnt play that card and she looked as if she knew she didnt need to instead she said theres a simple reality you must face mr matsumoto if you dont give your brother up to us someone else will eventually another silence before hiro matsumoto spoke he looked so pained that lynley felt a powerful surge of compassion for him a surge so strong that he wondered if he was actually meant to do police work at this juncture in his life the whole point was to manoeuvre people into a corner ardery was perfectly willing to do this he could see but he thought he himself might not have the stomach for it any longer matsumoto said quietly he is in covent garden he plays his violin there as a busker for money he dropped his head as if the admission were somehow a humiliation as perhaps it was ardery rose she said thank you i have no intention of frightening him and to his solicitor she went on with when we have him in custody ill ring you and tell you where he is we wont speak to him until youre there contact whatever mental health expert you need and bring her along i will want to see him hiro matsumoto said of course well arrange that as well she gave him a nod and indicated to lynley that they needed to be off lynley said to the cellist youve done the right thing mr matsumoto i know it wasnt easy he found he wanted to go on forging a fellowship with the man because his own brother had in the past been deeply troubled but peter lynleys difficulties with both alcohol and drugs were insignificant compared to this so he said nothing else isabelle made the phone call once they were on the pavement in front of the hotel heading back to her car they had their man she told di hale brusquely get over to covent garden at once and take a team with you five blokes should do it fan out when you get there look for a middleaged japanese man sawing away on a violin box him in do not approach him hes barking mad and just as dangerous phone me with his exact location im on my way she snapped her phone off and turned to lynley lets pick up the miserable shite he looked surprised or taken aback or something that she couldnt quite make out she said this bloke is very likely a killer thomas right guv he spoke politely she said what ill give them their bloody psychowhatevertheywantkindofexpert and ill not say a word to him till ms stiletto heels is sitting in his lap if necessary but im not about to risk his getting away from us when weve finally got him youll get no objection from me but she knew he objected to something and she pressed him i daresay you have a better approach not at all god damn it thomas if were to work together youre going to be frank with me even if i have to twist your arm they were at the car and he hesitated before unlocking his door at least she thought shed apparently cured him of opening her door for her he said youre certain about that well of course im certain why else would i say it i want to know what you think and i want to know it when you think it have you a drinking problem then he asked her it wasnt what shed been expecting but she knew she should have been prepared the fact that she hadnt been caused her to explode i had a bloody vodka and tonic do i look like im staggering drunk to you and before the vodka and tonic he asked guv im not a fool i expect youve got it in your bag likely its vodka because most people think that has no odour youve got breath mints as well or chewing gum or whatever else you use to hide the smell she said in automatic response gone icy to her fingertips youre out of order inspector lynley you are so bloody far out of order that i ought to send you packing to walk a patch in south london i can understand that she wanted to strike him it came to her that it didnt matter to him and that likely it had never mattered to him what threats were used against him to control him as a cop he was unlike the rest because he didnt need the job so if they took it from him or threatened to take it from him or acted in a way that met with his aristocratic displeasure he could walk away and do whatever it was that earls of the bloody realm did if they were not otherwise gainfully employed and this was more than maddening she realised it made him a loose cannon with loyalties to no one get in the car she told him were going to covent garden now they drove in absolute silence along the south side of kensington gardens and then hyde park and she wanted a drink the vodka and tonic had been a typical hotel bar vodka and tonic a meagre finger and a half of vodka in the glass with the tonic provided alongside in a bottle so she could make the drink as strong or as weak as she wished because of lynleys presence shed used the entire tonic and now she regretted it she bloody sodding regretted it she also went over her movements feverishly in her mind shed been perfectly careful he was making a guess and waiting to see what she would do about it she said to him im going to forget we had that exchange on the pavement thomas he said guv in a tone that telegraphed as you wish she wanted to go further she wanted to know what if anything he would say to hillier but to make any additional mention of the topic could give it a credence she couldnt afford they were attempting to negotiate piccadilly circus when her mobile rang she barked ardery into it and philip hale spoke theyd found the japanese bloke with the violin he told her down a set of stairs in a courtyard just beyond the cigar shop isabelle said for she recalled that she and lynley had seen the damn busker themselves hed been playing to the accompaniment of a boom box with long saltandpepper hair hed been wearing a tuxedo and standing in the lower courtyard in front of a wine bar why the hell hadnt she remembered the man that was the bloke philip hale said when shed described him have you uniforms with you no everyone was in plainclothes two blokes were sitting at tables in the courtyard and the rest were hale broke off then he said damn guv hes packing up hes shut off the boom box and hes putting the violinyou want us to nab him no no do not approach him follow him but keep everyone away and keep well back do not let him see hes being tailed all right right good man philip well be there presently she said to lynley hes on the move get us there for gods sake she could feel her nerves jangling to the tips of her toes he on the other hand was perfectly calm but once they made it through piccadilly circus a tailback of taxis seemed to stretch into infinity she cursed she said bloody hell thomas get us out of here he gave no reply but he made the virtue of being a longtime londoner apparent when he began to take side streets coolly as if in possession of the knowledge he finally parked as isabelles mobile rang again philip hales voice said theres a church at the southwest end of the square has he gone inside he hadnt hale said in front of the church was a garden and he had begun to play there in the middle of the central path there were benches lining this and people were listening and guv theres quite a crowd gathered isabelle said well be there and to lynley a church that would be st pauls covent garden as they came into the vicinity of the old flower market he took her arm briefly and pointed her towards it she saw the building over the heads of the crowd a classical structure of brick with quoins of pale stone she headed towards it but the route wasnt easy there were buskers everywhere and hundreds of people enjoying them magicians balloon sellers tap dancers even a group of greyhaired women playing marimbas isabelle was thinking it was the perfect spot for something dreadful to happenanything from a terrorist attack to a runaway vehiclewhen a sudden commotion to one side of the church caught her attention just as her mobile rang a shout went up and she snapped whats going on into the phone for it was clear to her that something was happening and it wasnt what she wanted to happen and even as she thought this she saw yukio matsumoto tearing through the crowd his violin in one hand and sheer unmitigated panic on his face on the mobile philip hale said he clocked us guv dont know how weve got i see him she said get in pursuit if we lose him here weve lost him for good and to lynley damn damn as the violinist broke into a crowd cries of protest were followed almost at once by shouts of police stop stop that man and afterwards a form of madness ensued for part of the dark history of the metropolitan police in pursuit of anyone was a history that included the shooting death of an unarmed and innocent civilian in an underground train and no one wanted to be in the line of fire no matter that these plainclothes cops were not armed the crowd wouldnt know that people began running in all directions as mothers grabbed children husbands grabbed wives and those individuals with a score to settle against the police did what they could to get in the way wheres he gone isabelle demanded of lynley he said there and indicated roughly the north she followed his gesture and saw the bobbing head of the man and then the black of his tuxedo coat and she set off after him shouting into her phone philip hes going north onwhat is it to lynley james street lynley said in the direction of long acre james street she repeated in the directionwhere to lynley and then bloody hell you talk to him she thrust her mobile at lynley and began to run forcing her way through the crowd with shouts of police police get out of the way matsumoto had made it to the top of the street charging down the middle of it with no regard for whom or what he ran into fallen children one upended kiosk and trampled shopping bags lay in his wake but to her cries of stop him no one did a thing in pursuit she and lynley had the advantage over philip hale and his men but matsumoto was fast he was driven by fear and by whatever demons were inside his head in front of her she saw him dash directly into long acre where the blast of a horn told her hed nearly missed being hit by a car she redoubled her speed in time to see him go roaring up another street he ran as if his life depended upon escape his violin clutched to his chest its bow long discarded isabelle cried where does that go to lynley wheres he heading shaftesbury avenue lynley told her and into the phone philip can you head him off by another route hes about to cross shelton street hes not attending to where hes running or whats around him if he makes it as far as shaftesburyyes yes right and to isabelle therell be uniforms somewhere nearby hes got the met on it christ we dont want uniforms thomas we dont have a choice they raced after him matsumoto knocked pedestrians right and left he stumbled against a placard for the evening standard she thought they had him because the vendor jumped forward and managed to grab his arm yelling just you bloody wait but he shoved the irate man into the window of a shop front with tremendous force the glass cracked then exploded and showered the pavement in shards he made it into shaftesbury avenue he veered to the right in vain isabelle hoped for a uniformed constable or anything else because as she and lynley rounded the corner she could see the danger and she understood in a flash what was likely to happen if they didnt stop him at once which they could not do they could not do what is this place she called to lynley hed gained upon her and was surging ahead but she was close after him high holborn endell new oxford his breathing was heavy we cant let him cross she saw that well enough cars taxis lorries and buses were all debouching into this one spot and from every direction but cross he intended and cross he attempted without a glance to the right or the left as if he were running in a park and not upon a congested street the taxi that hit him had no chance to stop it came from the northeast and like every other means of transport in the vast confluence of streets that hurled vehicles by the dozens and in every direction it came fast matsumoto flung himself off the pavement intent upon crossing and the taxi slammed into him sending his body in a horrifying arc of flight jesus god isabelle heard lynley cry and then he was shouting into her mobile philip philip hes been hit get an ambulance at once top of shaftesbury avenue near st giles high street as everywhere round them the screech of brakes and the blaring of horns filled the air as the taxi driver burst out of his vehicle andhands to his headran towards the crumpled body of yukio matsumoto as a bus driver joined him and then three others till the violinist was hidden from view as lynley shouted police keep back dont move him and as she herself realised shed made the wrong decisionthe very worst decisionto have a team go after the man when hed agreed to be part of isabelle arderys murder squad for this investigation the last spot lynley would have considered as one of the locations in which he might have to put in an appearance was st thomas hospital accident and emergency the very rooms and corridors in which hed had to make the decision to let go of helen and their child but that was where the ambulance took yukio matsumoto and when lynley walked through the doors into the hushed urgency of the casualty ward it was as if no time at all had passed between this moment and the aftermath of what had happened to his wife the smells were the same antiseptics and cleansers the sights were as they had been before the institutional blue chairs linked together and lining the walls the notice boards about aids other sexually transmitted diseases and the importance of frequent hand washing the sounds remained universal the arrival of ambulances the rush of feet exigent orders being barked as trolleys wheeled the injured into examining areas lynley saw and heard all of this and was swept back to the moment hed walked in and learned that his wife had been shot on the front steps of their house that help did not arrive for twenty minutes and that in that time helen had gone without oxygen as her heart pumped blood uselessly into the cavity of her chest it was all so real that he gasped stopped abruptly and did not come round till he heard isabelle ardery say his name her tone cleared his head she was saying to him uniforms down here round the clock wherever he is wherever they move him christ what a cockup i bloody well told him not to approach he noticed that she was wringing her hands and he thought inanely how hed never seen someone do that although hed read the expression often enough in books as an indication of someones anxiety doubtless shed be feeling anxiety in spades the metropolitan police in pursuit of someone who ends up in hospital no matter that they were identifying themselves as they pursued him it wouldnt play that way in the newspapers and shed know that she would also know that the ultimate head to rollif it came down to itwas going to be hers the doors opened philip hale came in his expression distraught sweat made rivulets from his temples and beaded on his forehead hed removed his jacket his shirt clung to his body ardery moved she had him by the arm and then against the wall and she was inches from his face before he had even noted her location in the room she hissed do you ever bloody listen i told you not to approach the man guv i didnt if we lose him philip youre taking the blame ill see to it personally but guv under review in the dock in the box whatever it takes to get your attention because when i say you are not to approach a suspect i do not sodding mean anything else so you tell meyou god damn bloody tell me philipwhich part of that you didnt understand because weve got a man whos been hit by a car and likely to die and if you think anyones about to let this go and pretend it didnt happen then youd better have another god damn think about the matter and youd better do it now the di glanced lynleys way there could not be lynley knew a better cop and more decent person than philip hale given an order hed follow it to the letter which was what hed done and all of them knew it hale said something spooked him guv one moment he was playing the violin and the next he was on the run i dont know why i swear to god you swear to god do you she shook his arm lynley could see the tension in her fingers and her grasp had to be a raw one because the tips of her fingers were red and the skin beneath her nails had gone crimson oh thats very pretty philip step onto the pitch take responsibility ive no time for men who snivel like guv lynley intervened quietly thatll do arderys eyes widened he saw that shed eaten the lipstick from her mouth and what replaced it for colour on her face were two circles of red fury high on her cheeks before she could reply he said to her urgently we need to get to his brother and let him know whats happened she began to speak and he added we dont want him to hear this from a news report we dont want anyone significant learning it that way by which he meant hillier and she had to know that even as she was driven by demons he well recognised but had never actually understood she released hales arm get back to the yard she said and then to lynley thats twice now youre warned understood he said and it makes no bloody difference does it then she swung on philip hale once again are you an idiot philip did you not hear me get back to the yard philip hale looked from ardery to lynley and back to ardery he said guv with a nod and he left them lynley saw him shake his head as he went ardery said to lynley get on to the brother then and she began to pace as lynley made the necessary calls he watched her and he wondered at what point shed make another trip to the ladies because there was little doubt in his mind that she desperately needed a drink however during the forty minutes they waited for hiro matsumotos solicitor to find the cellist and to bring him to st thomas hospital the acting superintendent remained in the waiting area and lynley developed a reluctant respect for the manner in which she mastered herself she made the appropriate phone calls to the yard putting the press office into the picture and passing along information to ac hilliers office as well hillier lynley reckoned would ultimately give isabelle ardery an earful there was nothing the assistant commissioner hated more than bad press half of london could shoot the other half in the street and hillier would not be as bothered as he would be by a tabloid screaming more brutality from the met when they finally arrived hiro matsumoto was far calmer than his solicitor who breathed fire and threatened lawsuits neither of which was unexpected she was interrupted only when they were joined by the physician whod initially seen to the violinists injuries he was a gnomelike man with overlarge and oddly translucent ears and a nametag reading hogg he spoke directly to hiro matsumoto obviously recognising him as the party probably most intimately connected to the injured man he ignored the others a broken shoulder and a broken hip constituted the initial information which sounded hopeful considering how bad things could have been but then mr hogg added fractured skull and acute subdural haematoma to the mix as well as the fact that the size of the injury was going to cause a dangerous increase in intracranial pressure which in turn would result in damage to delicate brain tissue if something was not done immediately that something was decompression effected only by surgery and yukio matsumoto was being prepared for the operating theatre as they spoke this is a murder suspect isabelle ardery informed the doctor were going to want to speak with him before anything is done to make him incommunicado hes not in any condition the doctor began to be interrupted by both the brother and the brothers solicitor one said my brother did not kill that woman as the other said youre not speaking to anyone but me madam and lets make certain thats very clear and if you so much as approach yukio matsumoto without my knowledge dont you threaten me isabelle ardery cut in what ill dowhat i intend to dois to find out exactly what led to this unbelievable development and when i find out youll be under a legal scrutiny the likes of which you have never seen i hope im being completely clear the doctor snapped my interest is in the injured and not on whatever quarrel you two are having hes going into surgery and theres an end to the matter please hiro matsumoto said quietly his eyes were liquid my brother hell live the doctors expression softened its a traumatic injury mr masumoto well do our very best when he departed isabelle ardery spoke saying to lynley we need to collect his clothing for forensics ill have something to say about that zaynab bourne snapped hes a principal suspect in a murder investigation ardery snapped back well have the appropriate paperwork and well take the clothing and if you have a problem with that you can take it up via the proper channels to lynley ill want someone posted here as well someone capable of staying on top of every development the moment hes able to speak we want an officer in the room with him she turned to hiro matsumoto and asked if he could tell them where his brother had his digs his solicitor was winding up to protest but matsumoto said no please mrs bourne i believe it is in yukios best interests to clear this matter up hiro you cant mrs bourne drew him away from lynley and ardery she spoke urgently into his ear and he listened gravely but the end result was no different he shook his head a few more words passed between them and zaynab bourne made for the outer doorway flipping open her mobile phone as she went lynley had little doubt the solicitor had resources upon whom she was calling to light a fire under the feet of the met hiro matsumoto returned to the police he said come ill take you there isabelle fielded a phone call from ac hillier as they crossed the river heading up victoria embankment to avoid parliament square previously shed spoken only to the acs secretary grateful for the opportunity to rehearse the passing along of information that was likely to send hillier into orbit he said tell me as a means of greeting isabelle cognizant of hiro matsumotos presence in the backseat of the car gave him as little information as possible she concluded her recitation with hes in the operating theatre and his brother is with us were heading to his digs have we got our man its very possible considering the situation i dont need possible i need probable i need yes we should know quite soon god knows we had better get to my office when youre done out there we need a meeting with deacon she didnt know who the hell deacon was but she wasnt about to ask hillier to identify him she said shed be there as soon as she could and when she ended the call she asked lynley the question he said head of the press bureau hilliers lining up the cavalry how do i prepare he shook his head ive never known philip cocked this up thomas do you think so the fact that he said those words as a statement was she decided a declaration of his own opinion not to mention of his judgement and perhaps a declaration of his loyalties as well they said nothing more merely riding in a tense silence to charing cross road where hiro matsumoto directed them to its intersection with denmark street there a redbrick structure of eight floors housed living accommodation that was called shaldon mansions which appeared to be flats that filled a building whose ground floor comprised a line of shops these carried on a theme of music that extended down denmark streetwhich itself appeared to comprise nothing but outlets for guitars drums and various types of hornsand combined this theme with news agents luggage shops cafés and bookstores the entrance to the flats consisted of an opening tucked between keira news and mucci bags and as they walked towards it isabelle sensed lynleys steps slowing so she turned to find he was gazing intently at the building she said what and he said paolo di fazio what about him this is where jemima hastings took him he gave a nod to the entrance to the flats that first night they met he said she took him to a flat above keira news isabelle smiled well done thomas so we know how yukio came to meet her hiro matsumoto said knowing they might have met does not mean of course it doesnt isabelle said grimly anything to keep him moving anything to get him to take them to the flat as there appeared to be no concierge to direct them unfortunately the cellist had no key but as things turned out a few bells rung followed by a few knocks upon doors and a few questions here and there led them into keira news there isabelles identification produced a master key to every flat in shaldon mansions held by the shops owner who did double duty as a recipient of packages and emergency contact should a crisis arise within the building they definitely had a crisis on their hands as isabelle explained to the man he handed over the key and they were about to set out when lynley paused to ask him about jemima hastings did he know her did he remember her unusual eyes one green and one brown the eyes did it she had indeed lived in shaldon mansions in a bedsit quite similar to the one into which they were seeking entrance this confirmed another connection between yukio matsumoto and jemima hastings and the fact gratified isabelle hugely it was one thing to connect them by means of covent garden it was quite another to connect them through their living accommodation things were looking up yukios bedsit was on the fifth floor of the building a point at which the spaciousness of the floors below gave way to crowstepped gables and a mansard roof as much accommodation as possible had been crammed into the space and these rooms opened off a narrow corridor where the air was so close it had probably gone unrefreshed since the first gulf war inside yukio matsumotos bedsit the atmosphere was oppressively hot and the place was quite disturbingly fitted out with floortoceiling figures that had been drawn on the walls with marker pens they loomed everywhere dozens of them a scrutiny indicated they depicted angels what in gods name isabelle murmured as next to her lynley fished out his reading glasses to give the scrawled figures closer scrutiny behind her she heard hiro matsumoto sigh tremulously she glanced his way he looked infinitely sad what is it she asked the cellists gaze went from one drawing to the next to the next he thinks they speak to him the celestial host the what all the different kinds of angels lynley put in theres more than one kind there are nine different kinds and he could no doubt list them isabelle thought grimly well she didnt want to knownor did she need to knowthe categories of celestial whatevertheywere what she needed to know was what if anything they had to do with jemima hastings death she reckoned nothing but hiro said they battle for him in his head of course but he hears them and he sometimes thinks he sees them what he sees are people but angels have come in human guise in the past and of course they are always depicted in a human form in art and in books and because of this he thinks hes one with them he believes theyre waiting for him to declare his intention its the very heart of his illness yet it proves doesnt it that he harmed no one isabelle took in the drawings as lynley moved along them slowly there were angels descending into pools of water where humans lay crumpled with arms extended in supplication there were angels driving demons before them to work on a temple in the distance there were angels with trumpets angels holding books angels with weapons and one enormous wingspread creature leading an army while nearby another cast destruction upon a biblicallooking town and one entire section appeared to be given to a struggle between two types of angels one armed with weapons and one with wings spread to cover cowering humans below he believes he must choose hiro matsumoto said choose what isabelle asked lynley she saw had moved to a narrow single bed where a bedside table held a lamp a book and a filmylooking glass of water the book he picked up and opened a card fell out and he bent to take it up from the floor as hiro matsumoto answered between guardian angel and warrior angel he said to protect or to he hesitated so isabelle finished the thought to punish she said well it seems he made his choice doesnt it please he did not guv lynley was looking at the card she crossed the room to him it was she saw yet another of the national portrait gallery postcards featuring the photograph of jemima hastings it also bore have you seen this woman upon it but over the image of the sleeping lion had been scrawled an angel like those in the room it had its wings spread out to create a shield but no weapons were in its hands it looks as if he was leaning towards guarding not punishing lynley said isabelle was about to tell him it didnt look like anything of the sort when yukios brother cried out she swung round she saw that hed approached the rooms basin and he was staring at something lying on its edge she said sharply keep away from it and she strode across the room to see what hed stumbled upon whatever it was it was crusted with blood indeed it was crusted with so much blood that other than its shape it was indefinable ah isabelle said yes indeed dont touch that thing mr matsumoto the time of day limited his options for parking in chelsea lynley had to make do with a hike over from carlyle square he crossed the kings road and walked towards the river via old church street as he did so he considered the various ways in which he might avoid ac hillier over the next few days and the other various ways in which he might colour what hed been experiencing at isabelle arderys side should he be forced into conversation with the assistant commissioner he wanted to give ardery leeway new to the job of superintendent she would be anxious to prove her worth but he also wanted the appropriate arrest made when the time came to make an arrest and he was unconvinced yukio matsumoto was guilty of the crime of murder guilty of something there could be little doubt but murderlynley couldnt see it thats because of the brother isabelle had told him brusquely upon their return to the yard you hold him in awe so you want to believe whatever he says i dont there was an unnatural hush in the incident room for their final meeting of the day the other officers knew what had earlier happened to yukio matsumoto in the street so this would have been one source of their reticence the other however would have been isabelle arderys confrontation with philip hale at st thomas hospital it was a clear case of telegraph telephone tellacop even if philip had said nothing to the others they would have known something was up simply by noting his demeanour by the end of the afternoon there had been no additional information from the hospital about yukio matsumotos condition so they were operating from a nonewsisgoodnews perspective soco had been dispatched to the violinists digs and the bloody object found on his washbasin had been sent to forensics for complete analysis everything was clicking along and checking out marlon kays woodcarving tools were clean all the sculpting tools from the studio near clapham junction were clean as well frazer chaplins whereabouts had been confirmed for the day of the murder by his colleagues at the ice rink by his colleagues at dukes hotel and by bella mchaggis her whereabouts had been confirmed by a yoga studio and her neighbours there was still some question about where and if abbott langer had actually done the dog walking hed claimed to be doing and paolo di fazios presence in jubilee market hall could have applied to any day or to no day because no one really paid that much attention but it was likely hed been there and likely was good enough for detective superintendent ardery she had high hopes that charges could be brought against yukio matsumoto as soon as the rest of the forensic reports were in lynley had his doubts about this but he said nothing when the meeting concluded he approached the china boards and spent a few minutes studying what was on them he examined one of the photographs in particular and when he left victoria street he took a copy of this with him it was at least in part his reason for coming to chelsea instead of heading directly home st james wasnt in as things turned out but deborah was and she ushered lynley into the dining room there shed laid out afternoon tea but not for consumption she was trying to decide whether she wanted to pursue food photography she told him first approached with the idea of doing so shed thought it was rather an insult to achieving the exceedingly high art of my dreams she said but as the exceedingly high art of my dreams isnt exactly bringing in vast sums of money and as i hate the thought of poor simon supporting his arty wife into her dotage i thought that photographing food might be the very thing until im discovered as the next annie leibovitz success in this arena she told him was all about lighting props colours and shapes additionally there were considerations having to do with overcrowding the pictures with suggesting that the viewer was actually part of the scene and with focusing on the food without overlooking the importance of mood im actually just thrashing about she admitted id say you and i can consume all this when im done but i wouldnt recommend it as i made the scones myself shed created quite a scene lynley saw something straight out of the ritz with everything from a silver tray of sandwiches to a bowl piled high with clotted cream there was even an ice bucket with a bottle of champagne tucked away in one corner and as deborah chatted about everything from the angle of the photograph to the manner in which one created what looked like beads of water on the strawberries lynley recognised in her conversation the effort to bring normality back into their relationship he said im quite all right deb its difficult as you might expect but im finding my way deborah averted her gaze a rose in a bud vase needed adjusting and she made this adjustment before she replied quietly we miss her terribly particularly simon he doesnt like to say i think he believes hell make it worse worse for me and for him he wont of course how could he possibly but its all mixed up lynley said weve always been something of a tangle the four of us havent we she looked up then although she didnt reply he said itll sort itself out he wanted to tell her that love was an odd thing that it bridged divides it faded and it rediscovered itself but he knew she understood this already because she was living it as was he so instead he said simons not here ive something i wanted to show him hes on his way home hes been in a meeting at grays inn whatve you got for him a picture he said and even as he said it he realised that there could exist additional pictures that might come to his aid he went on to ask deb have you any photos of your opening at the portrait gallery dyou mean my own photos i didnt take my camera no he told her he meant publicity photos had there been anyone at the national portrait gallery that night taking pictures of the opening of the cadbury show perhaps for use in a brochure perhaps for a magazine or a newspaper ah she said youre talking about pictures of celebrities and celebritiestobe the beautiful people holding champagne flutes and showing off their spray tans and dental work i cant say we had an enormous number of those turn up tommy but there were some photos being taken come with me she took him to simons study at the front of the house there from an old canterbury next to simons desk she unearthed a copy of hello she made a face and said it was a rather slow day for glamorous events in town hello he saw had done its usual business with those who might be considered the beautiful people these individuals had posed obligingly it was a gratifying twopage spread of pictures there had been quite a crowd at the photographic exhibit lynley recognised a few movers and shakers of london society in addition to those longing to become one of this ilk among the pictures there were candid shots as well and within these he found deborah and simon in conversation with jemima hastings and a saturnine man who looked like trouble he expected to learn that the bloke was one of the men connected in some way to the dead girl but he was surprised to learn he was looking upon matt jones the new partner of sidney st james simons younger sister sidneys quite mad about him deborah said simon on the other hand thinks shes merely mad hes rather a mysterythis is matt not simon of course he disappears for weeks at a time and says hes off working for the government sidney thinks hes a spy simon thinks hes a hit man what do you think i can never get ten words out of him tommy to be honest he makes me a bit nervous lynley found a picture of sidney then tall lithe striking a pose with champagne in hand and her head thrown back it was supposed to be candidindeed she was in conversation with a swarthy bloke tossing his drink down his throatbut it was not for nothing that sidney was a professional model despite the crowd round them she knew when a camera was on her there were other pictures posed and candid they needed a closer scrutiny indeed the magazine itself would likely have a score of photos on file that hadnt even been printed in these pages and lynley realised they might be valuable and that they might want tracking down he asked deborah if he could keep the magazine she said of course but did he think that jemimas killer had been there he said anything was possible so everything had to be explored st james arrived then the front door opened and they heard his uneven footsteps in the entry deborah went to the door of his study saying tommys here simon hes wanting you st james joined them there was an awkward moment in which lynleys old friend assessed his statewith lynley wondering when the time would arrive that awkward moments with friends would be a thing of the pastand then st james said tommy im in need of a whisky you lynley wasnt but he obliged with i wouldnt say no lagavulin then am i that special an occasion st james smiled he went to the drinks trolley beneath the window and poured two glasses as well as a sherry for deborah he handed them round and then said to lynley have you brought me something you know me too well lynley handed over the copy of the picture hed brought from the incident room as he did so he told st james something of what had happened that day yukio matsumoto the chase through the streets the accident in shaftesbury avenue then he told of the implement theyd found in the violinists room ending with arderys conclusion that they had their man hardly unreasonable all things considered st james said but youre reluctant to agree i find motive a difficulty obsessive love god knows that happens enough if obsessions involved it seems more likely hes obsessed with angels hes got them all over the walls in his room has he indeed thats curious st james gave his attention to the picture deborah joined him she said what is this tommy it was found in jemimas pocket sos saying its carnelian but thats as far as weve got i was hoping you might have some thoughts on it or failing that that i might know someone whod be able to suss it out let me have a closer look st james carried the picture to his desk where he used a magnifying glass on it he said its well worn isnt it the size suggests a stone from a mans ring or perhaps a womans pendant or a brooch i suppose jewellery in any case lynley agreed what dyou make of the carving st james bent over the photo he said after a moment well its pagan that much is obvious isnt it thats what i thought it doesnt appear celtic no no definitely not celtic how dyou know deborah asked st james handed over the magnifying glass to her cupid he said one of the carved figures hes kneeling in front of the other and shesminerva tommy or venus but the armour something belonging to mars deborah looked up that makes thishow old then simon a thousand years bit more i daresay third or fourth century likely but how did she get it deborah asked lynley thats the question isnt it could this be why she was killed deborah asked for a carved bit of stone it must be valuable it does have value lynley said but if her killer wanted it hed hardly have left it on her body unless he didnt know she was carrying it deborah said or was interrupted before he could make the search st james added as to that lynley told them more about the murder weapon or at least what they were assuming was the murder weapon it was he said saturated in blood what is it st james asked were not entirely sure lynley told him all we have to go on at the moment is the shape which is deadly sharp at one end perhaps nine inches long a curved handle very like an oddly shaped spike used for what ive no idea with the presence of police vehicles forensic vehicles an ambulance and dozens of officers of the law in the vicinity of the dawkins building site it was only a matter of minutes before the press arrived and the community as a whole became aware that a body had been found while local police efforts to control the flow of information were admirable the nature of the crime was difficult to conceal thus the superficial condition of john dressers body and exactly where the body had been found were details both widely reported and widely known within four hours also widely known and reported was the arrest of three boys their names withheld for obvious reasons who were helping the police with their enquiries which of course had long been a euphemism for suspects in the case michael spargos mustard anorak had made him identifiable not only to those individuals in the barriers who having seen him that day recognised both the anorak and him on the cctv film and not only to the witnesses who came forward with descriptions of him but also to his neighbourhood in short order community outrage led a threatening mob to the front door of the spargo home within thirtysix hours this resulted in the entire familys being removed from the gallows altogether and established in another part of town and after the trial to another part of the country under an assumed name when the police came for reggie arnold and ian barker it was with much the same consequences and their families were moved to other locations as well of them all only tricia barker has ever spoken to the press in the intervening years having resolutely refused to change her name there is some speculation that her cooperation has to do with garnering publicity for a hopedfor appearance on reality television it could well be said that the hours of interviews with the three boys in the subsequent days reveal much about their psychopathology and the dysfunction of their families of the three it would appear on the surface that reggie arnold came from the strongest home situation because in his every interview both rudy and laura arnold were present along with the interviewing detective and a social worker but of the three boys reggieit must be remembereddisplayed the most overt symptoms of inner turmoil according to his teachers and the tantrums hysteria and selfdestructive activities that characterised his classroom experience became more pronounced as the days of interviews wore on and as it became more evident to him that whatever manipulations hed used in the past to get himself out of trouble were not going to work in the situation in which he found himself on the tape his voice wheedles at first then it whines his father instructs him to sit up straight and be a man not a mouse and his mother weeps about what reggie is doing to us all their focus remains consistently upon themselves how the exigency of reggies situation is affecting them they seem oblivious not only to the nature of the crime about which hes being questioned and what the nature of this crime indicates about the state of his mind but also to the jeopardy he faces at one point laura tells him that she cant sit here all day while you whinge reg because she has reggies brother and sister to think of dont you understand that who dyou thinks taking care them while im here with you while your dads here with you even more troubling neither of the parents seems to notice when the questions directed at reggie begin to home in on the dawkins building site on the body of john dresser and on what the evidence found at the site suggests happened to john dresser there reggies behaviour escalateseven repeated breaks and interventions by the social worker do not settle himand although its clear that he was very likely involved in something horrendous his parents dont take note of that as they continue to attempt to mould his behaviour to something that they themselves will approve of in this we see the very essence of the narcissistic parent and in reggie we see the extreme to which a childs reaction to such parenting can take him ian barker faces a situation not unlike reggies although he remains stoic throughout it is only through his later drawings during sessions with a child psychiatrist that the extent of his participation in the crime will be revealed while interviewed he maintains his story that he knows nothing about no baby even when shown the cctv film and read the statements of the witnesses who saw him in the company of the other boys and john dresser during all of this his grandmother weeps one can hear her on the tape as her ululations rise periodically and the social workers murmurs of please mrs barker fail to calm her her only remarks are ive a duty here but there is no indication that she sees communication with her grandson as part of that duty while she understandably must have felt a tremendous sense of guilt for having abandoned ian to his mothers inadequate and often abusive care she does not appear to connect this abandonment and the emotional and psychological abuse that followed to what happened to john dresser for his part ian never asks for his mother its as if he knows in advance that he will stand alone throughout the investigation supported mainly by a social worker who was unknown to him before the crime as for michael spargo we have already seen that sue spargos abandonment of him occurred almost at once during his first encounter with the police this was also consistent with the rest of his life his fathers departure from the home would have had a profound effect on all of the spargo boys his mothers drinking and her other inadequacies would only have exacerbated michaels sense of desertion sue spargo had already been incapable of putting a stop to the handmedown abuse that was going on among her nine sons michael likely had no expectation that his mother would be able to stop anything else that was going to happen to him once they were arrested michael reggie and ian were interviewed repeatedly up to seven times in a single day as can be imagined considering the enormity and the horror of the crime committed each of them pointed a finger at the others there were certain events that none of the boys would discuss at allparticularly those having to do with the hairbrush they had stolen from itemsforapoundbut suffice it to say that both michael spargo and reggie arnold were aware of the iniquitous nature of what they had done their initial protestations of innocence notwithstanding the multitudinous references to stuff what was done to that baby along with their growing distress when certain topics were brought up and in the case of reggie arnold the repeated hysterical begging of his parents not to hate him tell us that they were fully cognizant of every line of propriety and humanity that was crossed during their time with john dresser to the end on the other hand ian barker remained unmoved stoic as if his life circumstances had bled from him not only conscience but also every feeling of empathy he might otherwise have had towards another human being do you understand what forensic evidence is lad were the words that cracked open the door to confession for a confession was what the police wanted from the boys just as a confession is what police want from all criminals upon their arrests the boys school uniforms their shoes and their outerwear had all been gathered for examination and the trace evidence from these articles would later not only place them at the dawkins building site but also put them in the company of john dresser in the final terrible moments of his life shoes belonging to all three boys were spattered with the toddlers blood fibres from their clothing were caught up not only in johns snowsuit but also in his hair and on his body their fingerprints were on the back of the hairbrush on copper tubing from the building site on the door of the portaloo on the seat of the commode inside and on john dressers little white trainers the case against them was open and shut but in the earliest interviews the police of course would not have known that as the evidence had not yet been analysed as the police ultimately saw it and as the social workers agreed a confession from the boys would serve a number of purposes it would trigger the recently passed contempt of court act putting an end not only to the growing hysterical press speculation about the case but also to any possibility of details prejudicial to the trial being leaked to the public it would allow the police to focus their attention on building whatever sort of case against the boys that they intended to present to the crown prosecutors it would give psychologists the necessary material for an evaluation of the boys the police did not as a whole consider the value of a confession as it pertained to the boys own healing that there was something deeply wrong in all of the families the words of detective superintendent mark bernstein in an interview two years after the trial was obvious to everyone but the police did not see it as their duty to mitigate the psychological and emotional damage done to michael spargo ian barker and reggie arnold within their own homes one can certainly not fault them for this despite the fact that the frenzied nature of the ultimate crime speaks of deep psychopathology in all of them for the brief of the police was to bring someone to justice for the murder of john dresser and to give through this some small measure of relief to his suffering parents as might be suspected the boys begin by accusing each other once they are informed that john dressers body has been located and that in the vicinity of the portaloo everything from footprints to faecal matter has been found and is going to be analysed by criminologists and doubtless connected to his abductors was ians idea to nick the kid comes from reggie arnold who addresses this cry not to the police interviewer but rather to his mother to whom he says mum i never i never took that kid michael spargo accuses reggie and ian barker says nothing until hes told of reggies accusation at which point he says i wanted that kitten is all all of them begin with protestations that they did not hurt no baby and michael is the first to admit that they mightve took him outside the barriers for a walk or something but that was cause we didnt know where he belonged all of the boys are urged throughout to tell the truth the truth is better than lying son michael spargo is told repeatedly by his interviewer youve got to say please luv youve got to say is what ian barker hears from the grandmother reggie is counseled by his parents to spit it out now like something bad from your tummy that youve got to get rid of but the full truth is clearly a form of abomination that the boys are afraid to touch upon and their reactions to the aforementioned injunctions illustrate the various degrees to which they raise their defences against having to speak it chapter eighteen he drove onto the property once again while gordon was watering the ponies ten minutes more and gordon would have been off for the day working on the roof of the royal oak pub as it was he was trapped he stood inside the paddock with a hosepipe in his hand and gina watching him from the fence shed not wanted to enter the paddock this time the ponies seemed skittish this morning shed said shed lost her nerve for the moment over the sound of the water burbling into the trough gordon didnt notice the cars engine as the vehicle rumbled onto the driveway gina however was near the edge of it and she tentatively called his name at the same moment as the car door slamming caught his attention he saw the sunglasses they caught the morning light like the wings of misplaced bats then he was coming towards the fence and the movement of his lips told gordon that whatever was to happen next the other man was determined to enjoy it the man said to gina in a tone perfectly gauged to convey an utter lack of fellow feeling gorgeous day my dear wouldnt you say bit hot again but whos about to complain we get little enough good weather in this country eh gina glanced at gordon a quick look shot through with questions that she wouldnt ask she said i could do with a few more cool breezes to be honest could you now cant get our gordon to wave the fan over you in the afters when youre both hot and sweaty he smiled a baring of teeth that was as disingenuous as everything else about him what dyou want gordon flung the hosepipe to one side the water continued to burble from it the ponies surprised by his sudden movement trotted away across the paddock gordon thought that gina might enter the enclosure at that pointwith the ponies safely awaybut she did not do so she remained by the fence her hands fixed atop one of the newer posts not for the first time he cursed that upright piece of wood and all of its brothers he should have let the whole damn thing rot to hell he thought thats not very friendly was the reply to his question what i want is a bit of conversation we can have it here or we can go for a drive ive work to do wont take long this he made a minute adjustment to his trousers a hitch a shift and the bollocks put into a more comfortable position it was the sort of movement that had a hundred different interpretations depending upon circumstances and the bloke making it gordon looked away the other said whats it to be my love ive a job to get to that i do know soa drive and to gina i wont take him far hell be back before you know how to miss him gina cast a look from gordon to the other man and back to gordon he could see she was frightened and he felt a surge of futile rage this was of course what the other man wanted him to feel he needed to get the bastard off the property he strode to the spigot and cranked the water off he said lets go and then quietly to gina as he passed her its all right ill be back but why must you ill be back he got into the car behind him he heard a chuckle and thats our lovely boy and in a moment they were reversing down the driveway and into the lane on the lane and heading in the direction of sway youre a sweet little piece of filth arent you she wouldnt be looking at you like youre gods gift to her wet hole would she if she knew the truth of the matter gordon said nothing although he felt a churning in his stomach at the end of the lane they jogged to the left and began to work their way over to sway at first he thought their destination was the village itself but they passed the hotel rumbled over the railway tracks and headed northwest past a line of suburban cottages they were coursing in the direction of the cemetery with its neat rows of graves sheltered on all four sides by stands of alders beeches and birch this gordon realised was likely where jemima would be buried the ancient churchyards nearby were full and he doubted there was a family plot somewhere for shed never mentioned one to him and he knew her parents had been cremated shed never spoken of death at all aside from telling him about her parents and hed been grateful for this although he had not considered that until this moment they went past the cemetery as well gordon was about to ask where the hell they were going when a left turn into a rutted track took them into a bumpy car park and then he knew this was set thorns inclosure an area of woodland like many others across the perambulation fenced off from the freeroaming new forest animals until the timber within it grew to a size that made it impossible for it to be harmed walking paths wound through this vast acreage of woods but only one other car stood nearby and no one was in it thus they had the woodland virtually to themselves just as the other man would want it come along darling gordon was told lets have a bit of a stroll eh gordon knew there was little point in playing for time things would be as they would be there were certain situations over which he had at least nominal control but this was not one of them he got out into the morning air the scent was fresh and pure there was a gate up ahead of the car and he went to this opened it went inside the inclosure where he waited for instruction it was soon in coming paths went in three directions from this point deep into the inclosure or following the woodlands boundaries it didnt matter to him which path was chosen as the outcome was going to be the same an examination of the ground was sufficient to indicate which way they should go paw prints and footprints looking rather fresh led into the heart of the trees so they would take an alternate route this one skirting southeast along the inclosures boundary before dipping downward into a swale and then rising again beneath chestnuts and through thick copses of holly in open spots the perambulations foresters had stacked wood cut from the trees or felled by storms here the bracken was thick and lush encouraged into growth by filtered sunlight but now beginning to brown at the edges by the end of the summer and into autumn it would form a covering of brown lace wherever the sun hit the floor of the wood most strongly they trudged along gordon waiting for whatever was to come they saw no one although they could hear a dog barking in the distance other than that the only sound came from the birds harsh corvine calls from avian predators and the occasional short burst of song from chaffinches hidden deep within the trees it was a place rich in wildlife where squirrels fed on the thick windfall from the chestnut trees and a flash of auburn in the undergrowth was a sure indication that foxes were here there were shadows everywhere as well and the air was fragrant walking and waiting he could almost forget gordon thought that he was being trailed by someone intent upon doing him harm this is far enough the other said he came up behind gordon and dropped a hand on his shoulder now let me tell you a tale my darling they were inches from each other gordon could feel the hot eager breath on the back of his neck theyd come to a widening of the path at this point more like a small clearing and up ahead there seemed to be an intersection of some sort with a gate beyond it in the distance the woodland ceased and he could see a lawn spreading out ponies grazed there placidly and safely at some great distance from any road now my sweet youll need to turn round and face me there just like that nicely done my love facetoface gordon could see much more than he wanted to seelarge pores blackheads a patch of whiskers missed in that mornings shaveand he could smell the sweat of anticipation he wondered what it felt like to have such supremacy over another but he knew not to ask that of the man things would go worse for him if he played this badly and the point that hed learned long ago was just to get through things so that he could go on so weve been found out what dyou mean oh i think you know youve had a visit from the coppers havent you theyre on your tail what dyou make of that the cops know nothing that you dont tell them gordon said think that do you hmmm yesssss but theyre on to winchester technical dear heart where dyou think theyll go now they know thats fiction someone somewhere should have sorted that one well no one did and i cant see that it matters i didnt need the bloody letters in the first place thats what you think he took a step closer they were chest to chest now and gordon wanted to step away so invaded did he feel but he knew how that step would be interpreted the other wanted fear to overwhelm him i learned the trade ive worked the trade ive got a business what more do you want me his voice was all innocence and surprise what do i want darling boy this isnt about me gordon made no reply he swallowed a sour flavour in his mouth he heard a dog yelp excitedly somewhere he heard its master call out in response the other man raised his hand then and gordon felt its heat cradling the back of his neck and then the fingers tightened just behind his ears thumb and forefinger slowly increasing their pressure until the grip was agony he refused to react to blink to groan he swallowed again he tasted bile but we both know who wants something dont we and we both know what that something is you know what i think should be done dont you gordon gave no answer the pressure increased dont you darling answer me now you know what i think should be done dont you i suspect it gordon said a few little words from me five or six words that cant be what you want eh he gave a little shake to gordons head a movement wearing the guise of fondness except for the pain of the pressure behind his ears gordons throat ached his head felt light youre bound he said for a moment nothing and then the other whispered i am what bound you know it this game of yours ill bloody well show you a game and the smile that baring of teeth like an animal except to think of the other man as an animal was to dishonour animals down he said and he spoke through his teeth down you go thats right on your knees he forced the issue with the pressure of his hand there was nothing for it but to obey he was only inches from the others groin and he saw the hairy fingers go deftly for the trousers zip they lowered it smoothly as if it had been oiled in anticipation of this moment and the purpose behind it the hand slid inside the dog ended things an irish setter bounded onto the path coming from the intersection of trails up ahead it trotted along and gave a bark someone called out jackson come boy come gordon found himself jerked to his feet the setter reached him and snuffled round him jackson jackson where are you come hes here gordon shouted hes over here the other smiled no teeth this time but an expression that said things had been merely postponed not canceled he whispered one word from me and you know who shows up one word from me and poofeverythings gone youll keep that in mind wont you you rot in hell gordon said ah but not without you my dear thats the real beauty of your position meredith powell found the office she was looking for without much trouble it was in christchurch road near the fire station and she walked there from gerber hudson graphic design on her morning break she didnt know what to expect from a private investigator shed seen depictions of private eyes on the telly and the emphasis always seemed to be on their quirkiness she didnt want quirky however she wanted efficient she had little enough money to spend on this venture although she knew it had to be spent that phone call to ginas mobile had convinced her as had the fact that the mobile wasnt in ginas possession in the first place while meredith knew that gina could merely have forgotten to take it with her prior to setting off on that particular day it looked as if she was more or less a permanent fixture on gordons holding and that being the case why would she not have returned for her mobile phone once she realised it was missing from her belongings it seemed to meredith that there was only one possible answer to that question she hadnt returned for it because she hadnt wanted it with her ringing vibrating messaging texting or anything elseing while gordon jossie was about all of this made gina a suspicious character once again all of this made meredith turn to daugherty enquiries inc the daugherty in question turned out to be an elderly woman much to merediths surprise no rumpled trench coat was involved in her attire and no dusty office plant or pockmarked steel desk sat in her office rather she wore a green summer suit and sensible shoes and her office furniture was polished to a glow there was no plant at all dusty or otherwise just prints on the walls these of the new forest wildlife she had pictures on her desk comforting shots of children and grandchildren she had a laptop computer opened on her desk as well and a neat stack of papers next to it but she closed the lid of the laptop and gave her full attention to meredith in the few minutes that they spoke meredith called her mrs daugherty she said it was ms but that michele would do she pronounced it meshell with the accent on me she said unusual name for someone my age but my parents were forward thinkers meredith was unsure what this meant she stumbled once with the placement of emphasis on the womans name but she got the hang of it after a single correction which seemed to please michele daugherty because she beamed and winked meredith wasted no time in telling the investigator what she wanted any information to be uncovered about one gina dickens anything at all she said she didnt know what the investigator would be able to find but she was looking for as much as possible the competition the investigators tone suggested this wasnt the first time a woman had come seeking information about another woman you might say that meredith said but this is for a friend it always is they spent a few moments on the fee and meredith brought out her chequebook because on the telly there was always a retainer given but michele daugherty waved this away meredith would pay once services were rendered that was that it hadnt taken long meredith walked back to gerber hudson feeling as if shed taken an appropriate step she began to doubt this almost at once however gina dickens was waiting for her she was perched on a chair in the square of space that went for reception feet flat on the floor and shoulder bag in her lap when meredith entered she rose and approached i didnt know where else to turn she spoke in an anxious whisper youre the only person i actually know in the new forest they said you were gone for a bit but that i could wait meredith wondered if somehow gina had made a few unwelcome discoveries that shed been in her digs above the mad hatter tea rooms that shed answered the ringing of the mobile phone there that shed removed what had been hidden beneath the basin that shed only just now hired a private eye to look into the whats and wherefores of ginas entire existence she felt an immediate surge of guilt but then she quelled it despite the look on ginas face which seemed to blend importuning and fear this was not the moment to let ones conscience get the better of one besides what was done was done jemima was dead and there were too many questions that needed to be answered meredith looked across the room to the little alcove in which she did her work this was meant to convey that she did not have a moment to spare but gina apparently wasnt going to read anything into merediths actions that she didnt want to read just now she said i foundmeredith what i foundi dont know what to make of it but i think i know and i dont want to know and i need to talk to someone and the mention of finding something hooked meredith at once what is it gina winced as if meredith had spoken too loudly she glanced round the office and said cn we talk outside im just off my break ive got to please five minutes less even ii phoned robbie hastings to find out where you were he didnt want to tell me i dont know what he thought but i told him you and i had spoken and that i needed another woman and as ive no friends yetoh its stupid ever to tie oneself to a man i knew it and i did it anyway with gordon because he seemed so different from other men ive known her eyes filled but no tears spilled over instead the moisture made them luminous meredith wondered ridiculously how she managed that how did any woman manage to look attractive so close to tears she herself got all red in the face meredith gestured towards the doorway they stepped into the corridor it seemed that gina meant to go down the stairs and out into ringwood high street but meredith said to her itll have to be here she added sorry when gina turned back and looked a little taken aback by the abruptness of merediths declaration yes of course gina smiled tremulously thank you im grateful you see i just didnt she began to fumble with the straw bag she was carrying she brought out a simple envelope she lowered her voice the police from london have been to see us from scotland yard they came about jemima and they asked gordonthey asked us bothwhere we were the day she was killed meredith felt a piercing of pleasure scotland yard a triumphant yes shot through her brain and she asked gina looked round as if to see who might be listening gordon had been there she said meredith grabbed her arm what in london the day she was murdered the police came because there was a postcard they found it had her picture on it meredith hed put them up all round london at least round the area where he thought she was he admitted this when the police showed it to him a postcard with her picture what in gods name gina stumbled through an explanation that meredith scarcely followed the national portrait gallery a photograph a competition of some sort an advertisement whatever gordon had seen it had gone to london months earlier had bought god only knew how many postcards and had put them up like wanted posters he put his mobile number on the back gina said meredith felt ice run down her arms someone phoned him because of the postcard she whispered he found her didnt he i dont know gina said he said he didnt he told me he was in holland when the day that day you know what day when jemimayou know but thats not what he said to the police meredith instead he told them he was working i asked him why did he tell them that and he said cliff would give him an alibi why didnt he just tell them that he was in holland thats what i asked him he said he couldnt prove it he said hed thrown everything away i said they could phone the hotel he stayed in and they could phone the farmer hed talked to butmeredith that wasnt the point really what do you mean why wasnt it the point because her tongue came out and licked her lips pink with a lipstick that matched one of the colours in the sundress she was wearing i already knew you see what meredith felt her head was spinning had he been to london on the day she died then why didnt you tell because he didnt knowhe doesnt knowthat id found him out hes been avoiding certain topics for ages and whenever ive got close to whatever he doesnt want to talk about he just avoids twice even hes gone a bit wild and last time he did that hehe frightened me and now im thinking what if hes the one what if he i cant stand to think he might be butim afraid and i dont know what to do she shoved the envelope into merediths hands she said look meredith slid her finger beneath the flap which didnt seal the envelope but merely folded inward to contain the contents there were just three items two rail tickets to and from london and a hotel receipt for one nights stay the hotel bill had been paid by credit card and meredith reckoned the date of stay was the same as jemimas death gina said id found these already i was taking out the rubbishthis was the day after his returnand they were tucked into the bottom i wouldnt have seen them at all had i not dropped an earring into the wastepaper basket i reached in to find it and i saw the colour of the ticket and i knew what it was of course and when i saw it i reckoned hed gone up there because of jemima i thought at first that it wasnt over between them like hed told me or if it was they had unfinished business of some sort and i wanted to talk to him about it at once but i didnt i wasyou know how it is when youre afraid to hear the truth what truth god did you know hed done something to her no no i didnt know she was dead i mean i thought it wasnt over between them i thought he still loved her and if i confronted him thats what hed have to say then it would be over between us and shed return and i hated the thought of her returning meredith narrowed her eyes she could see the trick if trick it was for perhaps jemima and gordon had mended their fences perhaps jemima had intended to return and if that was the case what was to prevent gina herself from making the trip to london doing away with jemima and keeping the ticket and the hotel receipt to pin the crime on gordon what a nice bit of vengeance from a woman scorned yet something wasnt right in all this but the various possibilities made merediths head pound gina said ive been afraid somethings very wrong meredith meredith handed the envelope back to her well youve got to turn this over to the police but then theyll come to see him again hell know i was the one to turn him in and if he did hurt jemima jemimas dead shes not hurt shes murdered and whoever killed her needs to be found yes of course but if its gordonit cant be gordon i refuse to thinkthere has to be an explanation somewhere well youll have to ask him wont you no im not safe if hemeredith dont you see please if you dont help mei cant do it on my own you must wont you no youve got the story you know the lies thered be only one outcome if i went to the police gina was silent her lips quivered when her shoulders dropped meredith saw that gina had worked things out for herself should meredith take the rail tickets and the hotel receipt to the local police or to the scotland yard cops she would only be repeating what someone else had told her that someone else was exactly the person the police would seek next and gordon jossie would likely be right there when the detectives arrived to put questions to gina ginas tears fell then but she brushed them away she said will you come with me ill go to the police but i cant face it alone its such a betrayal and it might mean nothing and if it means nothing dont you see what im doing it doesnt mean nothing meredith said we both know that gina dropped her gaze yes all right but what if i get to the station and lose my courage when it comes to going inside and talking andwhat will i do when they come for gordon because they will come wont they theyll see he lied and theyll come and hell know oh god oh god how did i do this to myself the door to gerber hudson opened and out popped randall hudsons head he didnt look pleased and he made the reason clear when he said are you coming back to work today meredith meredith felt heat in her cheeks shed never been scolded at her work before she said in a low voice to gina dickens all right ill go with you be here at half past five and then to hudson sorry sorry mr hudson just a small emergency its taken care of now not quite true the taken care of part but that would be settled in a very few hours barbara havers had made the phone call to lynley earlier out of winston nkatas presence it wasnt so much because she hadnt wanted winston to know she was phoning her erstwhile partner it was more a matter of timing shed wanted to get in touch with the inspector prior to his arrival at the yard that day this had necessitated an early morning call which shed made from her room in the sway hotel shed reached lynley at the breakfast table hed brought her up to speed on the goingson in london and hed sounded guarded on the topic of isabelle arderys performance as superintendent which made barbara wonder what it was that he wasnt telling her she recognised in his reticence that peculiar form of lynley loyalty that she herself had long been the recipient of and she felt a pang that she didnt want to name to her question of if she thinks shes got her man why dyou think she hasnt recalled us to london he said things have moved quickly i expect youll hear from her today what do you reckon about whats going on in the background she heard the clink of cutlery against china she could picture lynley in the dining room of his town house the times and the guardian nearby on the table and a silver pot of coffee within reach he was the sort of bloke whod pour that coffee without spilling a drop and when he stirred it within his cup hed manage to do so without making a sound how did people do that she wondered shes not jumping to a wild conclusion he settled on saying matsumoto had what looked like the weapon in his room its gone to forensics he also had one of the postcards tucked into a book his brother doesnt believe he harmed her but i dont think anyone else will go along with him on that barbara noted that hed avoided her question and you sir she persisted she heard him sigh barbara i just dont know simon has the photo of that stone from her pocket by the way its curious i want to know what it means someone killing her to get it again i dont know but there are more questions than answers just now that makes me uneasy barbara waited for more finally he said i can understand the desire to sew the case up quickly but if its mismanaged or botched altogether because of someone rushing to judgement thats not going to look good for her you mean for ardery and then she had to add because of what it meant to her and to her own future with the yard you care about that sir she seems a decent sort barbara wondered what that meant but she didnt ask it wasnt her business she told herself even as it felt like her business in every way she brought up the reason for her call chief superintendent zachary whiting the forged letters from winchester technical college ii and whitings knowledge of gordon jossies apprenticeship in itchen abbas with ringo heath she said we didnt mention any apprenticeship let alone where it was so why would he know about it does he keep his fingers on the pulse of every individual in the whole bloody new forest seems to me theres something going on with whiting and this jossie bloke sir because whiting definitely knows more than hes willing to tell us what are you considering something illegal whiting taking payoffs for whatever jossies doing when hes not off thatching old buildings hes working on peoples houses jossie is he sees whats inside them and some of them will have valuables this isnt exactly a povertystricken part of the country sir burglaries orchestrated by jossie and discovered by whiting pocketing illgotten gains instead of making an arrest or could be theyre into something together something that jemima hastings discovered thats definitely a possibility so im wonderingcould you do some checking on him bit of snooping background and such who is this bloke zachary whiting whered he do his police training whered he come from before he ended up here ill see what i can sort out lynley said while all roads werent exactly leading to gordon jossie barbara thought they were certainly circling the bloke it was time to see what the rest of the team in london had come up with when checking on himnot to mention when checking on every other name shed handed overso after breakfast when she and winston were making their preparations for the day she took out her mobile to make the call it rang before she had a chance the caller was isabelle ardery her remarks were brief of the packupandcomehome variety they had a solid suspect they had what was undoubtedly the murder weapon they had his shoes and his clothing which were going to test positive for jemimas blood they had an established connection between them and hes a nutter ardery concluded schizophrenic who wont take meds he cant be tried then barbara said trying hims hardly the point sergeant ardery told her getting him permanently off the street is understood but theres more than one curious person down this way guv barbara told her i mean just considering jossie fr instance you might want us to stay and nose round till we what i want is your return to london cn i ask where we are with the background checks so far theres nothing questionable on anyone ardery told her especially not down there your holidays over get back to london today right barbara ended the call and made a face at the phone she knew an order when she heard an order she wasnt convinced however that the order made sense so winston said to her thats definitely the question of the hour chapter nineteen although bella mchaggis liked to think that her lodgers would scrupulously do their own recycling shed learned over time that they were far more likely to toss items into the rubbish so weekly she made rounds inside her house she found broadsheets and tabloids piled here and there old magazines under beds coke cans crushed inside wastepaper baskets and all sorts of otherwise valuable articles in nearly every location it was for this reason that she emerged from her house with a laundry basket whose contents she intended to deposit among the many receptacles she had long ago placed in her front garden for this purpose on the step however basket in arms bella halted abruptly for after their previous encounter the last person she expected to see just inside her front gate was yolanda the pyschic she was in the midst of waving in the air what looked like a large green cigar a plume of smoke rose from it and as she waved it yolanda chanted sonorously in her husky masculine tone this was the bloody limit bella thought she dropped her basket and yelped you what the bloody hell will it take get off my property this instant yolandas eyes had been shut but they flew open she appeared to shake off some trance she was in that was likely another one of her completely spurious performances bella thought the woman was an utter charlatan bella kicked the laundry basket to one side and strode over to the psychic who was holding her ground did you hear me she demanded leave the property this instant or ill have you arrested and stop waving thatthat thing in my face closer to it now bella saw that that thing was a collection of pale leaves rolled tightly and bound up with thin twine its smoke was frankly not bad smelling more like incense than tobacco but that was hardly the point black as the night was yolandas reply her eyes looked odd and bella wondered if the woman was high on drugs black as the night and the sun the sun yolanda waved her stick of smoking whateveritwas directly in bellas face ooze from the windows ooze from the doors purity is needed or the evil within oh for gods sake bella snapped dont pretend youre here for anything other than causing trouble yolanda continued to wave the smoking object like a priestess in the performance of an arcane rite bella grabbed her arm and attempted to hold it in place she was surprised to find the psychic was quite strong and for a moment they stood there like two ageing female wrestlers each trying to throw the other to the mat bella finally won for which she was thankful as it did her good to see that her hours of yoga and athletic training were doing something besides lengthening her life on this miserable planet she mastered yolandas arm lowered it and knocked the green cigar from her hand she stamped upon it till it was extinguished while yolanda moaned mumbled and murmured about god purity evil black the night and the sun oh stop your nonsense yolandas arm still in her grasp bella began to march her towards the gate yolanda however had other things on her mind she put on the metaphorical brakes legs as stiff as a twoyearolds in the midst of a tantrum she planted herself firmly and would not be budged this is a place of evil she hissed to bella the womans expression looked wild if you wont purify then you must leave what happened to her will happen again all of you are in danger bella rolled her eyes listen to me yolanda cried he died within and when that happens in a place of abode oh rubbish stop pretending youre here to do anything other than spy and cause trouble which youve done from the first and dont deny it what do you want now who do you want now looking to talk someone else out of living here well theres no one else yet are you satisfied now get the hellbe gone before i phone the police it seemed that the idea of police finally got through yolanda immediately stopped resisting and allowed herself to be propelled towards the gate but still she nattered on about death and the need for a ritual of purification bella was able to determine from yolandas rambling that all of this was due to the untimely passing of mr mchaggis and truth to tell the fact that yolanda seemed to know about mchaggiss death inside the house did give bella pause but she shook off the pausebecause obviously jemima could have told her about mchaggiss death since bella herself had mentioned it more than onceand with no further conversation between them she directed yolanda from the property to the pavement there yolanda said heed my warning to which bella said you bloody heed mine next time you show your face round here youll be explaining your presence to the coppers understand now scarper yolanda started to speak bella made a threatening movement towards her that apparently did it because she hustled down the pavement in the direction of the river bella waited till she disappeared round the corner into putney bridge road then she went back to what shed intended to do she grabbed the laundry basket and approached the serried rank of rubbish bins with their neat labels upon them it was in the oxfam bin that she found it later she would think what a miracle it was that shed opened that particular bin at all for she emptied the oxfam bin least often as items for oxfam were tossed away infrequently by herself by residents of her house and by people who lived nearby as it was she had nothing to deposit in the oxfam bin on this day she merely removed its lid to take note of when it was likely to need emptying the newspaper bin was itself nearly full and the plastics bin was likewise the glass bins were fineseparating green from brown from clear kept them from filling too quicklyand since she was looking at the bins in general shed gone on to the oxfam bin as a matter of course the handbag was buried beneath a jumble of clothing bella had removed this with a curse about peoples enduring laziness as evidenced by the fact that they couldnt be bothered to fold what they wished to have carted off to the charity and she was about to fold it all herself item by item when she saw the handbag and recognised it it was jemimas there was no doubt about it and even if there had been doubt bella scooped it up and opened it and there inside were jemimas purse her driving licence her address book and her mobile phone there were other bits and bobs as well but these didnt matter as much as the fact that jemima had died in stoke newington where shed no doubt had her handbag with her and here it was now in putney as large as the life she no longer possessed there was no question in bellas mind what she had to do about this sudden discovery she was headed for the front door with the handbag in her grasp when the front gate opened behind her and she turned expecting to see yolandas stubborn return but it was paolo di fazio coming through and when his eyes lit on the handbag that bella was carrying she saw from his expression that like her he knew exactly what it was by returning to st thomas hospital and remaining there for most of the previous night to await word on yukio matsumotos condition isabelle had managed to put off the meeting with ac hillier since hed instructed her to deliver herself to his office upon her return to the yard shed decided merely not to return to the yard until long after the assistant commissioner had vacated tower block for the night this would give her time to sort through what had happened in order to be able to speak clearly about it that plan had worked it had also allowed her to be first in line to know what was going on with the violinists condition this was simple enough he remained in a coma throughout the night he was not out of danger but the coma was artificial induced to allow the brain time to recover had she been given suzerainty in this situation yukio matsumoto would have been brought round and then thoroughly questioned once hed emerged from the operating theatre as it was the most she was able to manage was a police guard in the vicinity of intensive care to make certain the man didnt suddenly regain consciousness on his own realise the depth of the trouble he was in and do a runner it was she knew a laughable possibility he was in no condition to go anywhere but appropriate procedure had to be followed and she was going to follow appropriate procedure she believed she had done so from the first yukio matsumoto was a suspect his own brother had identified him from an efit in the newspaper it was not down to her that the man had panicked and had tried to outrun the police besides that as things turned out he was in possession of what had to be the murder weapon and when his clothing and his shoes had undergone analysis along with the weapon there were going to be blood splatters somewhere upon themno matter how minute and no matter how hed tried to clean themand those blood spatters would belong to jemima hastings the only problem was that this information could not be passed on to the press it could not come out until a trial and that was a problem indeed because the moment the word got out that a member of londons foreign citizenry had been hit by a vehicle while running from the copperswhich hadnt taken longthe press had gathered like the wolf pack they were on the scent of a story that smacked of police incompetence they were baying to bring down the responsible party and the job of the met was to position itself to handle things when the wolves closed in for the kill which naturally was one of two reasons that hillier had wanted to see her to determine what the mets position was going to be the other reason she knew was to assess if or how badly shed cocked things up should he decide blame lay with her she was finished the opportunity for promotion gone the broadsheets that morning had taken a waitandsee attitude reporting the bare facts the tabloids on the other hand were doing their usual isabelle had watched bbc as shed made her preparations for the day and the morning talking heads did their typical bit with both the broadsheets and the tabloids holding them up for the delectation of their viewers and commenting upon the stories featured thus in advance of heading to the yard she knew that gallons of newsprint were being devoted to the copper chase disaster this gave her time to prepare whatever she reported to hillier had to be good and she damn well knew it for once the papers connected the victim with his famous brother which would hardly take long considering zaynab bournes threats of the previous day the story would have even stronger legs undoubtedly then it would run for days things could have been worse but isabelle couldnt quite see how she had an irish coffee prior to leaving for work she told herself that the caffeine would counteract the effects of the whisky and besides after being up for most of the night she had earned it she drank it down quickly she also tucked four airline bottles of vodka into her bag she assured herself that she likely wouldnt need them and anyway they were not enough to do anything but help her think clearly if she felt muddled during the day she stopped in at the incident room at work she told philip hale to relieve the officer at st thomas hospital and to remain there his startled expression replied that as a di he should not be asked to do something that a uniformed constable could easily do as it was a waste of manpower she waited for him actually to make a comment but he sucked in a breath and said nothing but guv in polite response no matter because john stewart talked for him saying laconically due respect guv which isabelle knew he felt nothing of anyway she snapped what is it and he pointed out that using a detective inspector as some sort of singleheaded cerberus at the hospital when he could otherwise be handling what hed earlier been told to handleall of the background checks which were by the way mounting upwas hardly a wise use of philips expertise she told him she didnt need his advice get on to forensics and stay glued to them whys the analysis of those hairs found on the body taking so long and where the hell is di lynley hed been called up to hilliers office she was informed stewart did the informing and he looked as if nothing could have pleased him more than to be the person sharing that bit of news with her she might otherwise have avoided her meeting with hillier but because lynley had been theredoubtless making his own report on the goingson of the previous dayshe had no choice but to take herself to the assistant commissioners office she refused to fortify herself before heading there lynleys impertinent question about her drinking still plagued her she met him in the corridor near hilliers office he said you look like youve had no sleep she told him shed returned to the hospital and remained there long into the night how are things she asked in conclusion with a nod towards the acs office as expected it could have gone better with matsumoto yesterday he wants to know why it didnt does he see that as your position thomas what making those sorts of determinations making reports to him about my performance official snout whatever lynley gazed at her in a fashion she found disconcerting it wasnt sexual she could have dealt with that it was instead rather more than intolerably kind he said quietly im on your side isabelle are you i am hes thrown you headfirst into the investigation because hes being pressured from above to fill malcolm webberlys position and he wants to know how you do the job but whats going on with him is only partially about you the rest is politics politics involve the commissioner the home office and the press as youre feeling the heat so is he i wasnt wrong the situation yesterday wasnt mismanaged i didnt tell him it was the man panicked no one knows why thats what you told him thats what i told him if philip hale hadnt dont throw philip into the midst of feeding sharks that sort of thing will return to haunt you the best position to take is no ones to blame thats the position that will serve you in the long run she thought about this she said is he alone when i went in he was but hes phoned for stephenson deacon to come to his office theres got to be a briefing and the directorate of public affairs wants it as soon as possible that will mean today isabelle acknowledged a fleeting wish that shed tossed back at least one of the bottles of vodka there was no telling how long the coming meeting would take but then she assured herself that she was up to the challenge this wasnt about her as lynley had said she was merely present to answer questions she said to lynley thank you thomas and it was only when she was approaching the desk of hilliers secretary that she realised lynley had earlier used her christian name she turned back to say something to him but he was already gone judi macintosh made a brief call into the sanctum sanctorum of the assistant commissioner she said superintendent ardery but got no further she listened for a moment and said indeed sir she told isabelle that she was to wait it would be a few minutes did the superintendent want a cup of coffee isabelle declined she knew she was supposed to sit so that was what she did but she didnt find it easy as she was waiting her mobile rang her exhusband she saw she wouldnt talk to him now a middleaged man came into the area a litre bottle of soda water tucked into his arm judi macintosh said to him do go in mr deacon so isabelle knew she was looking at the head of the press bureau sent by the directorate of public affairs to get to grips with the situation oddly stephenson deacon had a football stomach although the rest of him was thin as a towel in a thirdrate hotel this inadvertently gave the impression of a pregnant woman blindly determined to watch her weight deacon disappeared into hilliers office and isabelle spent an agonising quarter of an hour waiting to see what would happen next what happened was judi macintoshs being asked to send isabelle within although how judi macintosh received this information was a mystery to isabelle as nothing had seemed to intrude upon what the woman was doingwhich was beavering away at some typing on her computerwhen she looked up and announced do go inside superintendent ardery isabelle did so she was introduced to stephenson deacon and she was asked to join him and hillier at the conference table to one side of the acs office there she was subjected to a thorough grilling by both men on the topic of what had happened when where why who did what to whom what sort of chase how many witnesses what had been the alternatives to giving chase did the suspect speak english did the police show their identification was anyone in uniform etc etc isabelle explained to them that the suspect in question had bolted out of the absolute blue theyd been watching him when something apparently spooked him any idea what hillier wanted to know any idea how none at all shed sent men there with strict instructions not to approach not to have uniforms with them not to cause a scene fat lot of good that did stephenson deacon put in but somehow he was frightened anyway it seems that he might have taken the police for invading angels angels what the hes a bit of an odd egg sir as things turned out had we known about that had we known he was likely to misinterpret anyones approaching him had we even thought he would take the sight of someone coming near to mean he was in danger invading angels invading angels what the bloody hell do angels have to do with what happened isabelle explained the condition of yukio matsumotos digs she described the drawings on the walls she gave them hiro matsumotos interpretation of the depiction of the angels his brother had drawn and she concluded with the connection that existed between the violinist and jemima hastings as well as what theyd found in the room itself at the end there was silence for which isabelle was grateful she had her hands clasped tightly in her lap because shed realised theyd begun shaking when her hands trembled it was always a signal that thinking was going to become difficult for her in very short order it was a result of not eating breakfast she decided a simple matter of blood sugar finally stephenson deacon spoke the solicitor for hiro matsumoto he informed her with a glance at what appeared to be a phone message would be holding a press conference in just three hours the cellist would be with her but he wouldnt speak zaynab bourne was going to lay blame for what had occurred in shaftesbury avenue directly at the feet of the met isabelle started to speak but deacon held up a hand to stop her they themselves would prepare for a counter press conferencehe referred to it as a preemptive strikeand they would hold it in exactly ninety minutes at this isabelle felt a sudden dryness develop in her throat she said i expect you want me there deacon said they did not we want no such thing was how he put it he would give out the relevant information that hed just gathered from the superintendent if she was wanted further he said he would let her know she was thus dismissed as she left the room she saw the two men lean towards each other in the sort of huddle that indicated an evaluation being made it was an unnerving sight what are you doing here bella mchaggis demanded she didnt like surprises in general and this one in particular disturbed her paolo di fazio was supposed to be at work he was not supposed to be coming through her garden gate at this time of day the juxtaposition of paolos being there in putney with her having just discovered jemimas handbag caused a frisson of warning to run through bellas body paolo didnt answer her question his eyes were fixedthey were absolutely paralysed bella thoughtupon the handbag he said thats jemimas interesting that you know was her reply i myself had to look inside and then she repeated her question what are you doing here his reply of i live here did not amuse he then said as if she hadnt already told him have you looked inside i just told you i looked inside and and what is therewas there anything what sort of question is that she asked him and why arent you at work where youre supposed to be where did you find it what are you going to do with it this was the limit she began to say i have no intention when he cut in with who else knows about it have you phoned the police why are you holding it that way what way how am i supposed to be holding it he fished in his pocket and brought forth a handkerchief here you must give it to me that sent the alarm bells absolutely clanging all at once bellas mind was filled with details and rising to the top of them was that pregnancy test that fact floated there with others equally damning all of paolo di fazios engagements to be married that argument bella had heard between him and jemima paolos being the one to bring jemima to her house in the first placeand there were probably more if she could gather her wits and not be put off her mental stride by the expression on his face shed never seen paolo look so intense she said you put it there didnt you with everything for oxfam you play the innocent now with all these questions but you cant fool me paolo i he said you must be mad why would i put jemimas bag in the oxfam bin we both know the answer to that its the perfect place to stow the handbag right here on the property she could indeed see how the plan would have worked no one would look for the bag so far from the place where jemima had been killed and if someone found it by chanceas she herself had donethen it could easily be explained away jemima herself had discarded it never bloody mind the fact that it held her essential belongings but if no one found it prior to its being carted off to oxfam all the better when the bin was emptied it would doubtless be months after her death the contents would be taken away and perhaps the bag would be opened wherever things were gone through for distribution to the shops by that time no one would know where it had come from or perhaps even remember the death in stoke newington no one would think the bag had anything to do with murder oh it was all so clever of him wasnt it you think i hurt jemima paolo asked you think i killed her he ran his hand over his head in a movement she knew she was meant to take for agitation pazza donna why would i hurt jemima she narrowed her eyes he sounded so convincing didnt he and wouldnt he just him with his five or fifteen or fifty engagements to women who always threw him over and why why why just what was wrong with mr di fazio what did he do to them what did he want from them or better yet what did they come to know about him he took a step closer saying mrs mchaggis at least lets dont she backed away you stay right there dont come an inch closer or ill scream my head off i know your sort my sort what sort is that dont you play the innocent with me he sighed then we have a problem how why oh dont you try to be clever i need to get into the house he said this i cannot do if you wont let me approach you and pass you he returned his handkerchief to his pocket hed been holding it all alongand she knew hed meant to use it to wipe fingerprints from the bag because one thing he wasnt was a bloody fool and neither was shebut obviously he could see that she knew what he intended and hed given it up i have left in my room a postal order that i wish to send to sicily i must fetch this mrs mchaggis i dont believe you you could have sent it straightaway directly you bought it yes i could have but i wished to write a card as well would you like to see it mrs mchaggis youre being silly dont use that ruse on me young man please think things through because what youve concluded makes no sense if jemimas killer lives in this house as you seem to think there are far far better places to have put her bag than in the front garden dont you agree bella said nothing he was trying to confuse her that was what killers always did when they were backed into a corner he said to be honest id thought frazer was probably responsible for whats happened but this bag tells me dont you dare blame frazer because that was what they did as well they tried to blame others they tried to divert suspicion oh he was bloody clever indeed that it makes no sense to think hes guilty either for why would frazer kill her bring her bag here and put it in the rubbish in front of the house where he lives its not rubbish she said inanely its for recycling i wont have you call the recycling rubbish its because people think that that they wont recycle goods in the first place and if people would simply begin recycling we might save the planet dont you understand he raised his eyes skyward it came to bella that he looked for a moment exactly like one of those pictures of martyred saints this was due to the fact that he was darkish skinned because he was italian and most of the martyred saints were italian werent they if it came to it was he really italian perhaps he was merely pretending to be lord what was happening to her brain was this what abject terror did to people except she realised perhaps she wasnt as terrified as shed earlier been or as she was supposed to be mrs mchaggis paolo said quietly please consider that someone else might have put jemimas bag in that bin ridiculous why would anyone else and if someone else put the bag there who might that person be is there someone who might want to make one of us look guilty theres only one person looking guilty my lad and that person is you it isnt dont you see that bags presence makes you look bad as well doesnt it just as it makes me look badat least in your eyesand it makes frazer look bad youre shifting blame i told you not to i told you and suddenly the penny dropped the vague mutterings about black night sun and ooze the prayers and the smoking green cigar oh dear lord bella murmured she turned from paolo and fumbled for the door to get into the house if he followed her inside at this point she knew it did not matter chapter twenty i think your best course is going to be to get someone from christies to look at it st james said or failing that someone at the bm you can check it out from the evidence officer cant you im not exactly in a position to take that decision lynley said ah the new superintendent how does it go a bit unevenly im afraid lynley glanced around he and st james were speaking via phone references to isabelle ardery had to be circumspect of necessity besides he felt for the acting superintendents position he didnt envy her having to cope with stephenson deacon and the directorate of public affairs so soon into her employment at the yard once the press came howling into the picture in an investigation the pressure for a result mounted with someone now in hospital ardery was going to feel that pressure from every quarter i see st james said well if not the stone itself what about the photo you showed me its quite clear and you can see the scale that might be all thats necessary for the british museum possibly but certainly not for christies st james was silent for a moment before he said i wish i could be more help tommy but im loath to send you in the wrong direction nothing to apologise for lynley told his friend it might mean nothing anyway but you dont think so i dont on the other hand i may be merely clutching at a straw so it definitely seemed because right left and centre everything was either utterly confusing matters or checking out as inconsequential there was no middle ground between the extremes the background checks completed so far served as evidence of this of the principals in london involved in the case tangentially or otherwise everyone was turning out to be exactly who he seemed to be and nobodys copy book was blotted there was still the matter of abbott langers supposed marriages to be sorted and matt jonesparamour of st jamess sistercontinued to be a question mark as there were more than four hundred matthew joneses spread out in the uk so tracking each down and sorting them all out was proving a problem other than that no one had so much as a parking ticket this made things look grim as far as yukio matsumoto was concerned despite his brothers protestations of the violinists harmless nature for with everyone else turning up clean and no one else in london apparently having a motive to murder jemima hastings the killing either had to have been committed in the sort of act of madness one could easily associate with yukio matsumoto and his angels or it had to have arisen from something and someone connected to hampshire of the hampshire principals there were two curious points that had been uncovered and only one of them seemed likely to lead anywhere the first point was that gina dickens had so far been untraceable in hampshire although various forms of her name were still being tried regina jean virginia etc the secondand more interesting piece of informationwas about robert hastings who as things turned out had trained to be a blacksmith prior to taking over his fathers position as agister and this might have merely been shoved aside as another useless bit of data had forensics not given a preliminary assessment about the murder weapon according to microscopic examination the thing was hand forged and the blood upon it had come from jemima hastings as well when this information was added to yukio matsumotos possession of the spike to the eyewitness report of an oriental man stumbling from abney park cemetery to the efit generated by that report and to what was likely to be blood residue on the violinists clothing and his shoes it was difficult to disagree with isabelle arderys conclusion that they had their man but lynley liked to have everything accounted for thus he returned to the stone that jemima hastings had carried in her pocket it wasnt that he assumed it was valuable and possibly the reason for her death it was just that the stone remained a detail that he wanted to understand he was once again studying the photo of the stone when he received a phone call from barbara havers shed had the word to return to london she told him but before she did so she wanted to know if hed unearthed anything about chief superintendent zachary whiting or for that matter about ringo heath because it could be that there was a connection between those two that wanted exploring what hed discovered was little enough lynley told her all of whitings training as a police officer had followed the usual legitimate pattern hed done his required training weeks at a centrex centre hed taken additional instruction at several area training units and hed attended an admirable number of courses in bramshill he had twentythree years of service under his belt all of them spent in hampshire if he was involved in anything untoward lynley hadnt sorted what it was he can be a bit of a bully on occasion had been the nastiest comment anyone cared to make about the bloke although hes been sometimes too enthusiastic about the job in hand could lynley knew have several interpretations as for ringo heath there was nothing especially there was no connection of record between heath and chief superintendent whiting as to a connection between whiting and gordon jossie whatever it was it was going to have to come out of jossies background because it certainly wasnt coming out of whitings so its sod bloody all on a biscuit eh was how havers received the information i spose her order to come home makes sense youre on your way arent you lynley asked her with winston at the wheel what dyou think which meant that nkata who unlike havers had a history of taking orders seriously was returning them to london had she been given her way in matters barbara would have probably dallied until she was satisfied by what she was able to gather about everyone in hampshire even remotely connected to jemima hastings death he concluded his call as isabelle ardery returned from her meeting with hillier and stephenson deacon she looked no more harried than usual so he concluded the meeting had gone marginally well then john stewart fielded a phone call from so that put a full stop to the case as far as ardery was concerned they had the analysis of the two hairs found on the body of jemima hastings he told them well thank god for that ardery declared whatve we got oriental he told her hallelujah it would have been a moment for packing everything in then and lynley could see that ardery was inclined to do so but dorothea harriman came into the room in the very next moment and with her words burst everything wide open one bella mchaggis was downstairs in reception harriman told them and she wanted to speak to barbara havers she was told the detective sergeant is in hampshire so shes asked to see whoevers in charge of the case harriman said shes got evidence she says and she doesnt mean to hand it over to just anyone bella was no longer suspicious of paolo di fazio that was finished the moment shed seen the error in her thinking she didnt regret setting the coppers after him since she watched enough police dramas on the telly to know that everyone had to be eliminated as suspects in order to find the guilty party and like it or not he was a suspect so was she she supposed anyway she reckoned hed get over whatever offence he might be feeling because of her suspicions and if he didnt hed find other lodgings but in any case she couldnt be bothered because jemimas handbag had to be turned over to the officers investigating the case as she didnt intend waiting at home for them finally to show their faces this time round she didnt bother with the phone instead shed dropped jemimas handbag into the canvas carryall that she used for her grocery shopping and shed carted it off to new scotland yard because that was where that sergeant havers person had come from when she learned that sergeant havers wasnt in shed demanded someone else the head the chief the whoeversincharge she said to the uniform in reception and she wasnt leaving till she talked to that person in person by the way not on the phone she parked herself near the eternal flame and there she determined to remain and damn if she didnt have to wait exactly fortythree minutes for a responsible party finally to appear even when this happened she didnt think she was looking at the responsible party at all a tall nicelooking man approached her and when he spoke from beneath his head of beautifully groomed blond hair he didnt sound like anyone shed ever heard yapping away on the bill he was inspector lynley he said in the plummy tone that had always proclaimed public school in ones past did she have something related to the investigation are you in charge she demanded and when he admitted that he was not she told him to fetch whoever was and that she said was how it was going to be she was in need of police protection from the killer of jemima hastings she said and she had a feeling he wasnt going to be able to provide that on his own i know who did it she told him and she lifted the carryall to her chest and what ive got in here proves it ah he said politely and what have you got in there im not a nutter she told him sharply because she could tell what he was thinking about her you fetch who needs to be fetched my good man he went to make a phone call he regarded her from across the lobby as he spoke to whoever was at the other end of the line whatever he said proved fruitful though in another three minutes a woman came out of the elevator and through the turnstile that kept the general public away from the mysterious workings of new scotland yard this individual strode over to join them she was inspector lynley told bella detective superintendent ardery and are you the person in charge bella said i am the superintendent replied her facial expression added the comment and this better be worth my time madam right bella thought it bloody well will be the handbag was so hopelessly compromised for purposes of evidence that isabelle wanted to shake the woman silly the fact that she did not was she decided a testimony to her selfcontrol its jemimas bella mchaggis announced as she produced it with a flourish this flourish included adding fingerprints to what were doubtless dozens more of her own in the process smearing everyone elses and in particular smearing the killers i found it with the oxfam goods a discarded bag or one that she carried daily lynley asked not unreasonably its her regular bag and it wasnt discarded because its got all her clobber in it you went through it isabelle gritted her teeth in preparation for the inevitable answer which was naturally that the woman had pawed through everything depositing more fingerprints creating more compromised evidence well of course i went through it bella asserted how else was i to know its jemimas how else indeed isabelle said bella mchaggis gave her a narroweyed look that told isabelle she was being evaluated the woman seemed to reach a conclusion that no offence was intended by isabelles tone and before she could be stopped from doing so she opened the handbag said see here then and dumped its contents onto the seat where shed been awaiting them please dont isabelle began as lynley said this all must go to and bella picked up a mobile phone and waved it at them declaring this is hers and this is her purse and her wallet and on and on as she pawed through everything there was nothing for it but to grab her hands in the unlikely hope that something had gone untouched on bellas first time through the handbag and that it could remain so yes yes thank you isabelle said she nodded at lynley to replace the handbags contents and to put the bag itself into the carryall when hed accomplished this isabelle asked the woman to take her through everything that had led to her finding the handbag this bella mchaggis was pleased to do she gave them chapter and verse on recycling and saving the planet and from this isabelle concluded that the handbag had come from a bin that was not only situated in front of bella mchag giss house but was also accessible to anyone who happened to pass by and see it this apparently was a point that bella herself wished to make because the conclusion of her recitation contained a fact she declared the most important bit of all and that is isabelle enquired yolanda it seemed that the psychic had been lurking round bellas front garden again and shed been there this time moments before bella had made the discovery of jemimas handbag shed been ostensibly having some sort of bloody psychic experience bella scoffed which had been characterised by muttering moaning praying and waving round a stick of burning whatever that was supposed to do something magical or rubbish like that bella had given her a few choice words and the psychic had scurried off moments later checking the oxfam bin bella had uncovered the handbag why were you checking the bin lynley asked to see how soon it would need emptying obviously was her withering reply it seemed not unreasonably that the other bins collected recycling matter far more quickly than did the oxfam bin while they were emptied twice each month the oxfam bin was not shed have no way of knowing that bella said well want to go through this bin isabelle said youve not done anything with its contents have you she hadnt done for which isabelle praised god she told the woman that someone would fetch the bin from her and in the meantime she wasnt to open it again or even touch it its important isnt it bella looked quite pleased with herself i knew it was important didnt i there was no doubt of that although how to interpret the handbags importance was something over which isabelle found herself at odds with lynley as they rode the lift on their return to the incident room she said to him he had to have known where she lived thomas lynley said who and the way he said it told her he was thinking in another direction entirely matsumoto it would have been a simple matter for him to put the handbag in that bin and keep the murder weapon lynley asked how dyou reckon his thinking went on that one hes mad as a hatter he isnt thinking he wasnt thinking or if he was thinking he was thinking about doing what the angels told him to do get rid of this hold on to that run hide follow her whatever she glanced at him sharply he was gazing at the floor of the lift his brow furrowed and the knuckle of his index finger to his lips in a posture that suggested consideration of her words and of everything else she said well he said weve paolo di fazio inside that house weve frazer chaplin inside it as well and then theres the matter of yolanda you cant mean to suggest another woman killed jemima hastings by driving a spike into her carotid artery heavens thomas the entire means of murder isnt the least bit feminine and i daresay you know it i agree its unlikely lynley said but i dont want to discount the fact that yolanda might be protecting someone who handed the bag over to her and asked her to be rid of it she wants talking to oh for gods bloody sake and then she saw his expression she knew from it that he was assessing her and she also knew what he was assessing she felt a bubble of anger that any man should stand in judgement of her in a situation in which he would not stand in judgement of another male she said i want to have a close look at the contents of that bag before we hand it over to forensics and dont bloody tell me thats irregular thomas we dont have time to wait round for those blokes to tell us every fingerprint is useless we need a result youre well wear gloves all right and the bag wont leave my sight or yours does that please or do you want more guarantees i was going to say youre in charge you give the orders he replied i was going to say its your case she doubted that he was as smooth as icing on a cake he was she said it is mind you remember that as they left the lift together the most important belonging of jemima hastings inside the bag was the mobile phone and this isabelle handed over to john stewart with orders to deal with it to listen to voice messages to trace calls to read and make note of any and all texts and to get his hands on the mobiles records well want to use the mobile phone towers as well she added the pinging or whatever the hell they call it the rest of the contents she and lynley went through together most of it seeming to be perfectly straightforward a small folding map of london a paperback novel showing a predilection for historical mysteries a wallet holding thirtyfive pounds along with two credit cards three biros a broken pencil a pair of sunglasses in a case a hairbrush a comb four lipsticks and a mirror there was also a list of products from the cigar shop along with an advertisement for queens ice and bowlgreat food birthday parties corporate eventsan offer for membership to a putney gym and spa and business cards from yolanda the psychic london skate centre abbott langer professional ice instructor and sheldon pockworth numismatics this last gave isabelle pause as she tried to recall what numismatics referred to she came up with stamps lynley said coins she told him to check it out he said along with yolanda because i still think all right along with yolanda but i swear she has nothing to do with this thomas a woman did not commit this crime lynley found yolanda the psychics place of business in queensway with little trouble although he had to wait outside the faux mews building where she plied her trade because a sign on the door declared in session no entry and from this he assumed that yolanda was in the process of doing whatever it was that psychics did for their clients tea leaves tarot cards palms or the like he fetched himself a takeaway coffee from a russian café tucked in the junction of two of the indoor markets corridors and he returned to psychic mews with cup in hand by that time the sign had been removed from the door so he finished the coffee quickly and let himself in that you dearest yolanda called from an inner room shielded from the reception area by a beaded curtain bit early arent you no lynley replied to her first question di lynley new scotland yard she came through the curtain he took in her startling orange hair and her tailored suit that he recognisedwith thanks to his wifeas either vintage coco chanel or a coco chanel knockoff she wasnt what he had expected she stopped when she saw him it throbs she said he blinked pardon your aura its taken a terrible blow it wants to regain its strength but somethings got in the way she held her hand up before he could reply she cocked her head as if listening to something hmm yes she said its not for nothing you know she intends to return in the meantime your part is to become ready for her thats a dual message from the great beyond he asked the question lightly but of course he thought at once of helen no matter the irrationality of applying the idea of return to someone so completely gone yolanda said youd be wise not to make light of these matters those who make light generally regret it whatd you say your name was di lynley is that what happened to jemima hastings did she make light yolanda ducked behind a screen for a moment lynley heard the scratch of a match he thought she was lighting incense or a candleeither seemed likely and there was already a cone of incense burning at the crossed legs of a seated buddhabut she emerged with a cigarette she said to him its good that you gave it up i dont see you dying because of your lungs he absolutely refused to be seduced he said as to jemima she didnt smoke that didnt much help her in the end did it yolanda took a heavy hit from the tobacco i already talked to the cops she said that black man strongest aura ive seen in years prhaps ever to tell you the truth but that woman with him the one with the teeth id say she has issues impeding her growth and they arent exactly dental what would you say may i call you mrs price lynley asked i understand thats your real name you may not not on these premises here im yolanda very well yolanda you were in oxford road earlier today we must talk about that about jemima hastings as well shall we do it here or elsewhere elsewhere being theyll have an interview room at the ladbroke grove station we can use that if you prefer she chuckled cops you best be careful how you act else itll disappear altogether theres such a thing as karma mr lynley thats what you said your name is didnt you thats what i said she examined him you dont look like a cop you dont talk like a cop you dont belong how true he thought but this was hardly a startling deduction for her to have made he said where would you like to talk yolanda she went through the beaded curtain he followed her there was a table in the centre of the inner room but she didnt sit there instead she went to an overstuffed armchair that faced a victorian fainting sofa she lay upon this latter and closed her eyes although she still managed to smoke her cigarette unimpeded he took the chair and said to her tell me about oxford road first well get to jemima in a moment there was little enough to tell according to yolanda the psychic shed been in oxford road because of its inherent evil she declared shed failed to save jemima from it despite her warnings to move house and with jemima having fallen victim to its depravity she was duty bound to try to save the rest of them clearly they werent about to leave the place so she was trying to purify it from without she was burning sage not that that bloody woman will listen to anything i try to tell her she declared not that she would even begin to appreciate my efforts on her behalf what sort of evil lynley asked yolanda opened her eyes there arent different sorts of evil she replied theres just it it evil so far its taken two people from that house and its after more her husband died there you know mrs mchaggiss husband so youd think shed purify the place but will she no shes too much the dim bulb to see the importance now jemimas gone as well and therell be another just you wait and you were there solely to perform alynley sought the term that best fit burning sage in someones front garden and settled ona rite of some kind not of some kind oh i know what your sort think about my sort youve no belief till life brings you to your knees and then you come running dont you is that what happened to jemima why did she come to see you initially i mean i dont speak about my clients i know thats what you told the other officers but weve a problem you see as youre not a psychiatrist a psychologist a solicitor theres no privilege to invoke as far as i can tell which means exactly what which means your failure to disclose information can be seen as impeding a police investigation she was silent digesting this she drew in on her cigarette and blew the smoke heavenward thoughtfully lynley went on so my suggestion is that you tell me whatever seems relevant why did she come to see you yolanda continued silent for a moment she seemed to be tossing round the ramifications of speaking or not speaking she finally said i told the others already love its why they usually come love for whom again a hesitation before she said the irishman the one who works at the ice rink frazer chaplin she wanted to know what they always want to know yolanda moved restlessly on the sofa she reached for an ashtray beneath it and stubbed out her cigarette she said i told the others that more or less the black man and the woman with the teeth i dont see how going over it all again with you is going to make a difference lynley gave passing wry thought to how barbara havers would react to being called the woman with the teeth he let the thought go he said call it a new perspective mine what exactly did you tell her she sighed loves risky isnt it just lynley thought i mean as a topic she went on one cant make predictions about it therere too many variables always the unexpected bits especially if one doesnt have the other person there towell to scrutinise you see so one keeps things vague in a manner of speaking thats what i did to keep the client coming back i should guess she glanced his way as if to evaluate his tone he kept his face impassive she said this is a business i dont deny it but its also a service that i provide and believe me people need it sides all sorts of things come up when im engaged with a client they come to see me for one reason but they find others s not me keeping them coming back i can tell you that its what i know its what i tell them that i know and jemima what about her she had other reasons beyond her questions about love she had and what were those yolanda sat up she swung her legs round they were chunky without ankles a single plane from her knees to her feet she plopped her hands down on either side of her thighs as if for balance and while she held herself straight her head was lowered she shook this lynley thought she meant to refuse no more information sir but instead she said somethings standing between me and the others everythings gone quiet but i intended no harm i didnt know lynley felt strongly disinclined to play along he said mrs price if you know something i must insist yolanda she said her head rising with a jerk its yolanda in here im having enough trouble with the spirit world as it is and i dont need someone in this room reminding them ive another life out there dyou understand that ever since she diedever since i was told that she diedits gone quiet and dark im going through the motions ive been doing that for days and i dont know what im failing to see then she rose the room was dim and gloomy likely in keeping with her line of work and she went to the curtained entry where she switched on an overhead light the illumination brought the dismal little space into unforgiving relief dust on the furniture sluts wool in the corners secondhand belongings that were chipped and cracked yolanda paced the small area lynley waited although his patience was wearing thin she finally said they come for advice i try not to give it directly thats not how it works but in her case i could feel something more and i needed to know what it was in order to work with her she had information that would have helped me but she didnt want to part with it information about whom about what whos to tell she wouldnt say but she asked where she should meet someone if hard truths had to be spoken between them and if she feared to speak them a man she wouldnt tell me that i said the obvious what anyone would say she must choose a public place for her meeting did you mention i did not tell her that cemetery she stopped her pacing she was on the other side of the table and she faced him across it as if she needed the safety of this distance she said why would i tell her that cemetery i take it you didnt recommend her local starbucks either lynley pointed out i said choose a place where peace predominates and where she could feel it i dont know why she chose that cemetery i dont know how she even knew about it she resumed her pacing round the table once twice before she said i should have told her something else i should have seen or felt but i didnt tell her to stay away from that place because i didnt see danger she swung round on him do you know what it means that i didnt see danger mr lynley do you understand the position that puts me in ive never doubted the gift for a moment but now i do i dont know truth from lies i cant see them and if i couldnt protect her from danger i cant protect anyone she sounded so wretched that lynley felt a surprising twinge of compassion although he did not for a moment believe in psychic phenomena the thought of protecting someone however made him think of the stone jemima was carrying a talisman a good luck charm he said did you try to protect her of course i did did you give her anything to keep her safe prior to this meeting she intended to have but she hadnt she had sought to protect jemima hastings only with words of advicevague mutterings and imaginings lynley thoughtand theyd been useless at least however they now knew what jemima had been doing in abney park cemetery on the other hand they had only yolandas word for what she herself had been doing in oxford road that day he asked her about this he also asked her what shed been doing at the time of jemimas death to the latter she said shed been doing what she was always doing meeting with clients she had the appointment book to prove it and if he wanted to phone them he was welcome to do so as to the former shed already said she was attempting to purify the bloody house before someone else met death unexpectedly mchaggis frazer the italian she said did yolanda know them all lynley asked her by sight if not by acquaintance mchaggis and frazer shed spoken to the italian not and did she have occasion to open any of the recycling bins in the garden he enquired she looked at him as if he were mad why the bloody hell would she open the bins she asked the bins dont need purifying but that house does he didnt want to go down that road again he reckoned hed got all there was to be had from yolanda the psychic until the spirit world revealed more to her she seemed like a closed book to him chapter twentyone when robbie hastings pulled onto gordon jossies holding he wasnt sure what he intended to do for jossie had lied to him not only about wanting to remain with jemima but alsoas things turned outabout when hed last seen her rob had had this latter piece of information from meredith powell and it was a phone call from her that had sent him to jossies property shed been to see the police in lyndhurst shed given them proof positive that gordon had traveled into london on the morning of jemimas death hed even stayed the night in a hotel she told rob and shed given the police that information as well but rob she had said and through his mobile he could hear anxiety in her voice i think weve made a mistake we half of we turned out to be gina dickens in whose company meredith had been ushered into the presence of chief superintendent whitingbecause we said rob that we wouldnt talk to anyone but the man at the topand there theyd demanded to know the whereabouts of the two detectives whod come to the new forest from new scotland yard they had something of grave importance to hand over to those detectives they told him and of course he asked what it was once he knew what it was he asked to see it once he saw it he put it into a filing folder and asked where it had come from gina didnt want to tell him rob she seemed afraid of him afterwards she told me hes been on the property to talk to gordon and when he came to talk to gordon she didnt know he was police he didnt say and gordon didnt either she said she went all cold when we walked into his office and she saw him cos she reckons gordon mustve known who he was all along so now shes nearly out of her mind with fear because if this bloke shows up on the property and if he takes that evidence with him then gordonll know how he got it because how else could he have got it except from gina as the information continued to pile up robbie had difficulty taking it all in train tickets a hotel receipt gina dickens in possession of both gordon jossie chief superintendent whiting new scotland yardand then there was the not small matter of gordons complete lie about jemimas departure that she had someone in london or elsewhere that he himself had wanted to remain with her and she had left him rather than what the truth probably was that he had driven her off meredith had gone on to say that chief superintendent whiting had kept the rail tickets and the hotel receipt in his possession but once she and gina had left him and once gina had revealed the mans connectionwhatever it is robto gordon jossie meredith herself had known absolutely that he was not going to give the information to new scotland yard although she couldnt say why and we didnt know where to find them meredith wailed those detectives rob ive not even talked to them yet anyway so i dont know who they are so i wouldnt recognise them if i saw them on the street why havent they come to talk to me i was her friend her best friend rob to rob only one detail actually mattered it wasnt that chief superintendent whiting had potential evidence in his hands and it wasnt the whereabouts of the scotland yard detectives or why they hadnt spoken yet to meredith powell what mattered was that gordon jossie had been to london rob had taken the call from meredith just at the end of a meeting of the new forests verderers which theyd held as usual in the queens house and although this location was not far from the police station where the chief superintendent operated rob didnt even think about going there to question chief superintendent whiting about what he intended to do with the information from meredith and gina dickens he had only one destination in mind and he set off for it with a grinding of the land rovers gears and frank lurching on the seat next to him when he saw from the absence of vehicles that no one was at home on jossies holding rob paced intently round the cottage as if hed be able to find evidence of the mans guilt leaping out of the flower beds he looked into windows and tested doors and the fact that they were locked in a place where virtually no one locked their doors seemed to declare the worst he went from the cottage to the barn and swung open the doors he strode inside to his sisters car saw that the key was in the old figaros ignition and tried to make something of this but the only thing he could make of it didnt amount to sense anyway that jemima had never gone to london but had been murdered here and buried on the property which of course hadnt happened at all then he saw that the ring attached to the ignition key held another and assuming this was the key to the cottage robbie took it and hurried back to the door what he intended to look for he didnt know he only understood that he had to do something so he opened drawers in the kitchen he opened the fridge he looked in the oven he went from there to the sitting room and took the cushions off the sofa and the chairs finding nothing he dashed up the stairs clothes cupboards were neat pockets were empty nothing languished under the beds towels in the bathroom were damp a ring in the toilet bowl spoke of cleaning needing to be done and although he wanted something to be hidden inside the cistern there was nothing then frank started barking outside then another dog began barking as well this took robbie to one of the windows where he saw two things simultaneously one was that gordon jossie had come home in the company of his golden retriever the other was that the ponies in the paddock were just that still in the damn paddock when rob would have sworn to god that they belonged out on the forest so why the hell were they still here the barking increased in frenzy and rob dashed down the stairs never mind that he was the one trespassing there were questions to be asked frank sounded insane as did the other dog rob saw as he burst out of the cottage that for some reason jossie had stupidly opened the door of the land rover and had let frank jump out and he himself was now bent into the vehicle and searching through it as if he didnt bloody well already know who owned it the weimaraner was actually howling it came to rob that the animal was howling not at the other dog but at jossie himself this fueled robs rage because if frank howled it was because hed been harmed and no one was meant to lay a hand on his dog and certainly not jossie whod laid hands elsewhere and death was the result the retriever was yelping now because frank was howling two dogs from the property across the lane joined in and the resulting cacophony set the ponies in motion inside the paddock they began to trot back and forth along the line of the fence tossing their heads neighing what the hellre you doing robbie demanded jossie swung round from the land rover and asked a variation of the same question and with far more reason as the door to the cottage stood wide open and it was only too clear what rob had been up to rob shouted at frank to be quiet which only set the dog into a complete paroxysm of barking he ordered the weimaraner back into the vehicle but instead frank approached jossie as if he intended to go for the thatchers throat jossie said tess thatll do and his own animal ceased barking at once and this made rob think of power and control and how a need for power and control could be at the heart of what had happened to jemima and then he thought of the railway tickets of the hotel receipt of jossies trip to london of his lies and he strode over to the thatcher and heaved him against the side of the land rover he said through his teeth london you bastard what the hell gordon jossie cried she didnt leave you because she had someone else robbie said she wanted to marry you although god knows why he pressed jossie back had his arm across the thatchers throat before jossie could defend himself with his other hand he knocked the mans sunglasses to the ground because he damn well intended to see his eyes for once jossies hat went with them a baseball cap that left a line across his forehead like the mark put on cain but you didnt want that did you rob demanded you didnt want her first you used her then you drove her away and then you went after her jossie pushed rob away he was breathing hard and he was rob found far stronger than he looked he said whatre you talking about used her for what for the love of god i can even see how it worked you bastard it seemed so obvious now that rob wondered he hadnt seen it before you wanted this placethis holding didnt youand you reckoned i could help you get it because its part of my area and land with common rights isnt easy to come by and id want to help because of jemima eh its all fitting now youre round the bend jossie said get the hell out of here rob didnt move jossie said if you dont get off this property ill what call the cops i dont think so you were in london jossie and they know it now that stopped him cold he was dead in whatever tracks he thought he was about to make he said nothing but robbie could tell he was thinking like mad the upper hand his rob decided to play it you were in london the very day she was murdered theyve got your rail tickets how dyou like that theyve got the receipt from the hotel and i expect your names on it large as life eh so how long dyou expect itll be before they come after you for a little chat an hour more an afternoon a day if jossie had been considering lying at this point his face betrayed him as did his body which went limp all fight gone because he knew he was done for he bent picked up his sunglasses rubbed them against the front of his tshirt which was marked by sweat and stained from work he returned the glasses to his face seeming to hide his wary eyes but it didnt matter now because rob had seen in them everything he wanted to see yes robbie said endgame gordon and dont think you can run because ill follow you to hell if i have to and ill bring you back jossie reached for his cap next and he slapped it against his jeans although he didnt put it back on hed removed his windcheater and left it in a lump on the land rovers seat he grabbed it up in the same lump and said all right rob his voice was quiet and rob saw that his lips had gone the colour of putty all right he said again meaning what exactly you know you were there if i was whatever i say wont make a difference youve lied about jemima from the first ive not she wasnt running to someone in london she didnt leave you for that she had no one else in london or anywhere there was only you and you were who she wanted but you didnt want her commitment marriage whatever so you drove her away jossie looked towards the ponies in the paddock he said thats not how it was are you denying you were there man cops check the cctv films from the railway stationin sway in londonand youll not be on them the day she died they take your photo to that hotel and no onell remember you were there for a night i had no reason to kill jemima gordon licked his lips he glanced over his shoulder back towards the lane as if seeking someone coming to rescue him from this confrontation why the hell would i want her dead shed met someone new once she got to london she told me as much and then it was dog in the manger for you wasnt it you didnt want her but by god no one else was going to have her id no idea she had anyone else i still dont know that how was i to know because you tracked her you found her and you talked to her she would have told you and if thats what happened why would i care i had someone else as well i have someone else i didnt kill her i swear to god you dont deny being there there in london i wanted to talk to her rob id been trying to find her for months then i got a phone callsome bloke had seen the cards id put up he left a message saying where jemima was just where she worked in covent garden i phoned therea cigar shopbut she wouldnt talk to me then she rang me a few days later and said yes all right she was willing to meet me not where she worked she said but at that place at the cemetery rob thought but what jossie was saying didnt make sense jemima had someone new jossie had someone new what had they to talk about rob walked to the paddock where the ponies had gone back to grazing he stood at the fence and looked at them they were too sleek too well fed gordon was doing them no service by keeping them here they were meant to forage all year long they were part of a herd rob opened the gate and went into the paddock what are you doing jossie demanded my job behind him rob heard the thatcher follow him into the paddock whyre they here he asked him theyre meant to be on the forest with the others they were lame rob went closer to the ponies he shushed them gently as behind him jossie closed the paddock gate it didnt take any longer than a moment for rob to see that the ponies were perfectly fine and he could feel their restless need to be out of there and with the others in the herd he said theyre not lame now so whyve you not and then he saw something far more curious than the oddity of healthy ponies locked up in a paddock in july he saw the way their tails were clipped despite the growth of hair since the last autumn drift when the ponies had been marked the pattern of the clipping on these ponies tails was still quite readable and what that pattern said was that neither one of the animals belonged in this particular area of the new forest at all indeed the ponies were branded as well and the brand identified them as coming from the north part of the perambulation near minstead from a holding located next to boldre gardens he said unnecessarily these ponies arent yours what the hell are you up to jossie said nothing robbie waited they had a moment of stalemate it came to rob that further conversation or argument with the thatcher was going to be pointless it also came to him that it didnt matter the cops were on to him now he said right then whatever you want ill come tomorrow with a trailer to fetch them they need to go back where they belong and you need to keep your hands off other peoples livestock at first gordon tried to believe robbie hastings had been bluffing because to believe anything else would mean one of two things either he himself had blindly misplaced trust yet another mad time in his life or someone had broken into his house found damning evidence that he had not even known would be damning and taken it away to bide his time or her time and to present it to the cops when it could do the most damage to him of the two possibilities he preferred the second one because although it would mean the end was near at least it would not mean hed been betrayed by someone he trusted if on the other hand it was the first one he believed he might not recover from the blow yet he knew it was far more likely that gina had found the railway tickets and the hotel receipt than it was that meredith powell or someone with equal antipathy for him had entered his house gone through the rubbish and pocketed those materials without his knowledge so when gina returned home he was waiting for her he heard her car first it was odd because she cut the engine as she came into the driveway and she coasted to a stop behind his pickup when she got out she closed the door so quietly that he couldnt even hear the click of it nor could he hear her footsteps on the gravel or the sound of the back door opening she didnt call his name as she usually did instead she came up the stairs and into the bedroom and she gave a start when she saw him by the window the sun behind him and the rest of him he knew just a silhouette to her but she made a quick recovery she said here you are and she smiled as if nothing was wrong and for that single moment how he wanted to believe that she had not given him up to the police he said nothing as he tried to gather his wits together she brushed an errant lock of hair from her cheek she said his name and when he didnt reply she took a step towards him and said is something wrong gordon something everything had there been a moment when hed thought that things could ever be right and why had he thought that a womans smile perhaps the touch of a hand that was soft and smooth against his skin his hands on the fullness of hips or buttocks his mouth on the sweetness of breastshad he been so much of a fool that the mere act of having a woman somehow could obliterate all that had gone before he wondered what gina knew at this point the fact that she was here suggested it was little enough but the fact that she had possiblyprobablyfound the rail tickets found the hotels receipt keeping them close to her until she could use them to harm himand why had he not thrown them away on the platform in sway upon his return that was the real question had he only thought to do so he and this woman would not be standing here in this bedroom in the insufferable summer heat facing each other with the sin of betrayal in both of their hearts not only in hers because he could not claim she was the only sinner he hadnt thrown the tickets away on the station platform and he hadnt rid himself of the receipt because he hadnt considered that something might happen to jemima that his possession of those bits of paper might damn him that gina might find them and keep them and say nothing about his lie to her of having gone to holland allowing him to dig himself in deeper and deeper and still not saying a word about what she knew about where he had really been which was not in holland not on a farm talking to someone about reeds not out of the country at all but rather in the heart of a london cemetery trying to wrest from jemimas possession those things she could use to destroy him if she chose gina said gordon whyre you not answering me whyre you looking at me like that like what like youre she brushed at her hair again although this time none of it was out of place her lips curved but her smile faltered why wont you answer whyre you staring is something wrong i went to talk to her gina he said thats all i did she furrowed her brow who i needed to talk to her she agreed to meet me i didnt tell you only because there was no reason to tell you it was over between us but she had something of mine that i wanted back she said the realisation apparently coming to her you saw jemima when he said dont pretend you havent sussed that rob hastings was here she said gordon i dont see howrob hastings she gave a small laugh but it held no humour you know youre actually frightening me you soundi dont knowfierce did rob hastings say something to you about me did he do something did you argue with him he told me about the rail tickets and the hotel receipt what rail tickets what hotel receipt the ones you found the ones you handed over her hand rose she placed the tips of her fingers between her breasts she said gordon honestly yourewhat are you talking about did rob hastings claim that i gave him something something of yours the cops he said what about them you gave the rail tickets and that hotel receipt to the cops but if youd asked me about them instead i would have told you the truth i didnt before this because i didnt want you to worry i didnt want you to think there might still be something between us because there wasnt ginas eyeswide blue more beautiful than the northern skyobserved him as her head slowly tilted to one side she said what on earth are you talking about what tickets what receipts what did rob hastings claim i did hed claimed nothing of course gordon had merely concluded and hed done that because it seemed to him that unless someone had surreptitiously gone through his rubbish no one else could have come across those items save gina he said rob told me the cops in lyndhurst have what proves i was in london that day the day she died but you werent ginas voice sounded perfectly reasonable you were in holland you went about the reeds because those from turkey are becoming rubbish you didnt keep the tickets to holland so you had to say you were working that day and cliff told the policethat man and woman from scotland yardthat you were working because you knew theyd think you were lying if you didnt produce those tickets and thats what happened no what happened is i went to london what happened is that i met jemima in the place she died on the day she died dont say that its the truth but when i left her she was alive she was sitting on a stone bench at the edge of a clearing where theres an old chapel and she was alive id not got from her what i wanted to get but i didnt hurt her i came home the next day so youd think id gone to holland and i threw those tickets in the rubbish bin thats where you found them no she said absolutely not and if i had found them and been confused by them i wouldve talked to you i wouldve asked you why you lied to me you know that gordon so how do the cops rob hastings told you they have the tickets she didnt wait for an answer then rob hastings is lying he wants you to be blamed he wants you toi dont knowto do something crazy so the police will thinkgood heavens gordon he couldve gone through the rubbish himself found those tickets and handed them over to the police or he could be holding on to them just waiting for the moment to use them against you or if not him then someone else with equal dislike for you but why would i do anything with any tickets other than simply talk to you about them have i the slightest reason to do something that might cause you trouble look at me have i if you thought that id hurt jemima why on earth would i think that you were through with each other you and jemima you told me that and i believed you it was true then he said nothing she approached him he could tell she was hesitant as if he were an anxious animal in need of calming and she was just as anxious he could tell what he couldnt sense was the source of her anxiety his paranoia his accusations her guilt the desperation each of them felt to be believed by the other and why was there desperation at all he knew for a certainty what he had to lose but what had she she seemed to hear the question and she said so few people have anything good between them dont you see that he didnt reply but he felt compelled to look at her right into her eyes and the fact of this compulsion made him tear his gaze from her and look anywhere else which was out of the window he turned to it he could see the paddock and the ponies within it he said slowly you said you were afraid of them but you went inside you were in there with them so you werent afraid were you because if you were you wouldnt have gone inside for any reason the horses gordon i tried to explain you would have just waited for me to release them onto the forest again you knew id do that eventually id have to do it then it would have been perfectly safe to go in but then you wouldnt have had a reason would you gordon gordon she was near him now listen to yourself that doesnt make sense like an animal he could smell her so close was she the odour was faint but it combined the scent she wore a light sheen of perspiration and something else he thought it might be fear equally he thought it might be discovery his discovery or hers he didnt know but it was there and it was real feral the hair on his arms stirred as if he were in the presence of danger which he was he always had been and this fact was so odd to him that he wanted to laugh like a wild man as he realised the simple truth that everything was completely backwards in his life he could hide but he could not run she said what are you accusing me of why are you accusing me of anything youre acting like she hesitated not as if she was searching for a word but rather as if she knew quite well what he was acting like and the last thing she wanted was to say it you want me to be arrested dont you still it was the ponies he looked at they seemed to him to hold the answers you want me to be in trouble why would i want that look at me please turn around look at me gordon he felt her hand on his shoulder he flinched she withdrew it she said his name he said she was alive when i left her she was sitting on that stone bench in the cemetery and she was alive i swear it of course she was alive gina murmured you had no reason to harm jemima the ponies outside trotted along the fence as if knowing it was time to be released no one will believe that though he said more to himself than to her heabove allwont believe it now he has those tickets and that receipt so he would return gordon thought bleakly again and again over and over and directly into the end of time then you must just tell the truth she touched him again the back of his head this time her fingers light on his hair why on earth didnt you simply tell the truth in the first place that was the question wasnt it he thought bitterly tell the truth and to hell with the consequences even when the consequences were going to be death or worse than death because at least death would put an end to how he had to live she said so near to him now why didnt you tell me you can always talk to me gordon nothing you tell me could ever change how i feel about you and then he felt her cheek pressing against his back and her hands upon him her knowing hands they were first at his waist then her arms went round him and her soft hands were on his chest she said gordon gordon and then the hands descended first to his stomach and then caressing between his thighs reaching for him reaching i would never she murmured i would never ever ever darling he felt the heat the pressure and the surge of blood it was such a good place to go so good that whenever he was there nothing else intruded upon his thoughts so happen happen let it happen he thought for didnt he deserve he jerked away from her with a cry and swung round to face her she blinked at him gordon no why gordon so few people get away from me i can see it now its down to you that gordon gordon i dont want you here i want you gone go bloody god damn you to hell away meredith was heading for her car when her mobile rang it was gina she was sobbing unable to catch her breath long enough to make herself clear all meredith could tell was that something had happened between gina and gordon jossie in the aftermath of the visit she and gina had made to the lyndhurst police station for a moment meredith thought that chief superintendent whiting had shown up on gordons property with the evidence theyd given him but that didnt seem to be the case or if it was gina didnt say so what she did say was that gordon had somehow discovered that his railway tickets and his hotel receipt were in the hands of the cops and he was in a terrifying rage about it gina had fled the property and was now holed up in her bedsit above the mad hatter tea rooms im that scared she cried he knows im the one i dont know what hell do i tried to pretendhe accused mewhat could i say i didnt know how to make him believeim so afraid i cant stay here if i do hell come he knows where she sobbed anew i should never havehe wouldnt have hurt her but i thought he should explain to the policebecause if they found it meredith said ill come over straightaway if he bangs on the door you ring triple nine where are you ringwood but thatll takehell come after me meredith he was so angry sit in one of the tea rooms then he wont go after you there not in public scream your head off if you have to i shouldnt have what you shouldnt have gone to the cops what else were you supposed to do but how did he know they have those tickets how could he know did you tell someone meredith hesitated she didnt want to admit shed told robbie hastings she picked up her pace to get to her car and she said that bloke whiting hedve gone out there with questions straightaway when we gave him that stuff but this is good gina its what we wanted to happen dont you see that i knew hed know thats why i wanted you to be the one to its going to be all right meredith ended the call she was at this point some distance from lyndhurst but the dual carriageway out of ringwood was going to help her her nerves begged for the affirmation tape to be played so as she drove she listened to it repeating the phrases feverishly i love you i want you you are special to me i see you and i hear you its not what you do but who you are that i love i love you i want you you are special to me i see you and i hear you its not what you do but who you are that i love and then i am enough i am enough i am enough i am enough and when that didnt seem to be the ticket i am a child of god beloved to him i am a child of god beloved to him she steamed into lyndhurst some twenty minutes later she felt marginally calmed she left her car by the new forest museum and hurried back along the car parks narrow entry towards the high street where a tailback from the traffic lights for the romsey road made crossing between the vehicles easy gina wasnt in the tea rooms these were closed for the day anyway but the proprietress was still there doing her evening cleanup so meredith knew that had gina wanted to sit and wait and be perfectly safe she could have done so which meant she concluded that gina had calmed down she climbed the stairs it was silent above with just the noises from the high street drifting in from the open doorway as before it was hotter than hades in the building and meredith felt the sweat trickle down her back although she knew it was only partly due to the heat the other part was fear what if he was here already in the room with gina having followed her back to lyndhurst and ready to do his worst meredith had barely knocked on the door when it was flung open gina presented an unexpected sight her face was puffy and red she was holding a flannel to the upper part of her arm and a seam had given way on the sleeve of the shirt she was wearing meredith cried out oh my god he was upset he didnt mean to what did he do gina crossed to the basin where meredith saw shed put a few pathetic cubes of ice these she wrapped into the washing flannel and when she did so meredith saw the ugly red mark on her arm it looked the size of a fist she said were phoning the police thats assault the police have to know i should never have gone to them he wouldnt have hurt her thats not who he is i should have known that are you mad look at what he just did to you we must weve done enough hes frightened he admits he was there then she died he admitted it you must tell the police those detectives from scotland yard oh where the hell are they not that he killed her never that he admitted he saw her they had arranged to meet he said he had to know for sure it was finished between them before he and i could she began to cry she held the flannel back to her arm and she gave a wince when it touched her we must get you to casualty that could be a serious injury its nothing a bruise thats all she looked down at her arm her lips moved convulsively i deserved it thats mad thats what abused women always say i didnt believe in him and not to believe in him and then to betray him when i could have just asked him and when all he did was go to talk to her to make sure they were done with each other so that he and i he hates me now i betrayed him dont talk like that if anyone did any betraying we both know who it was why would you believe him anyway he says he went there to make sure it was finished between them but what else would he say what else could he say now he knows the cops have the evidence they need hes in trouble and hes running scared hes going to cut down anyone in his way i cant believe it of him its that policeman meredith the chief superintendent we saw you think he killed jemima i told you earlier hes been to see gordon theres something between them something not right you think its jemima meredith asked jemimas between them they killed her together no no oh i dont know i wouldnt have thought a thing about him about him coming out to see gordon at home those times but then when we walked into his office today and i saw who he really isi mean that hes a cop that hes someone importantwhen he came to the cottage he never said he was a cop and gordon never said either but he must know mustnt he meredith finally saw how all of it fitted more she saw how theyd put themselves into real danger she and gina for if gordon jossie and the chief superintendent were engaged in something together she and gina had handed over a piece of evidence that whiting would need to destroy at once but he wouldnt need to destroy only the tickets and the hotel receipt would he he would also need to destroy those people who knew about them he would have recognised gina obviously but he didnt know who meredith herself was and she didnt think shed given him her name so she was safe for the moment she and gina couldor had she she wondered had she said her name had she introducedshown identificationsomething isnt that what one always did no no she hadnt done so theyd merely gone to his office theyd handed over the evidence theyd spoken to him andgod god she couldnt remember why on earth couldnt she remember because she was in a muddle she thought there was too much going on she was getting confused there was gina there was ginas panic there was evidence there was gordons rage and there was probably something else as well but she couldnt remember she said to gina weve got to get out of here im taking you home but come on you cant stay here and neither can i she helped gina gather her belongings which were few enough they threw them into a carrier bag and got under way gina would follow meredith in her own car and they would go to cadnam it seemed the safest possible place they would have to share not only a room but also a bed and they would have to cook up some story for merediths parents but meredith had time to work on that on the drive home and when she pulled into the driveway at her parents house she told gina that a gas leak at the mad hatter tea rooms had made her lodging unfit for habitation at such short notice it was the best she could do she said youve just come to work at gerber and hudson as the receptionist all right gina nodded but she looked fearful as if merediths parents might phone up gordon jossie and announce her whereabouts should she get part of the story wrong she relaxed a bit as cammie came charging out of the house shouting mummy mummy the little girl flung herself at meredith wrapping her arms tightly round merediths legs gran wants to know where you been mummy and to gina my names cammie whats yours gina smiled and meredith could see her shoulders change as if tension was draining out of them she said im gina im five years old cammie told her demonstrating her age with her fingers as meredith lifted her to her hip ill be six years old next but not for a long time cos i jus turned five in may we had a party dyou have parties on your birthday i havent in a long time thats too bad birthday parties are lovely especially if you have cake and then typically she was off in another conversational direction mummy grans cross cos you didnt ring her and say youd be late youre meant to ring her ill apologise meredith kissed her daughter with the loudest smack of her lips that she could manage the way cammie liked she set her on the ground could you run inside and tell her we have company cam whatever pique janet powell might have been feeling thus was dissipated when meredith ushered gina into the house her parents were nothing if not hospitable and once meredith told them the spurious tale of the gas leak at the mad hatter tea rooms nothing more needed to be said janet murmured terrible terrible pet and patted gina on the back well we cant have you stopping there can we you sit right here and let me fix you a nice plate of ham salad cammie you take ginas bag to your mums room and put out fresh towels in the bathroom and ask your granddad will he scrub the tub cammie scampered off to do all this announcing that shed even let gina use her own personal bunny towels and calling out granddad were to clean the bath you an me as gina sat at the table meredith helped her mother put together the ham salad neither she nor gina was actually hungryhow could they have been considering the circumstancesbut they both made an effort as if with the mutually unspoken knowledge that failure to do so would arouse suspicion where further suspicion was unwanted gina went along with the idea of the gas leak with an ease that meredith found herself admiring greatly putting aside her worries about gordon jossie in a way that meredith herself could never have managed in the same situation indeed she soon had engaged janet powell in a conversation on the topic of janet herself her long marriage to merediths father motherhood and grandmotherhood meredith could tell her mother was charmed nothing disturbed the evening and by the time darkness fell merediths guard had melted away they were safe for now tomorrow would be time enough to consider what to do next she began to see that she had been wrong about gina dickens gina was just as much a victim in this as jemima had been each of them had made the same mistake for some reason that meredith herself would never be able to understand each of the women had fallen for gordon jossie and gordon jossie had deceived them both she couldnt comprehend how two intelligent women had failed to see gordon for what he so obviously was but then she had to admit that her distrust of men wasnt something that other women would naturally share besides people generally learned from their own encounters with the opposite sex people didnt usually learn from hearing tales about others relationships gone sour this had been the case for jemima and it was undoubtedly the case for gina she was learning now that was true although it still seemed that she didnt want to believe i still cant think he hurt her gina said in a low voice when they were alone in merediths bedroom and then she added before meredith could make an acidulous comment about gordon jossie anyway thank you youre a real friend meredith and your mums lovely so is cammie and your dad youre very lucky meredith considered this she said for a long time it didnt feel that way she told gina then about cammies father she recited the whole wretched tale she finished by saying when i wouldnt have an abortion that was that he said id have to prove in court that he was the dad but at that point i actually didnt care to he doesnt help you at all he doesnt support her if he sent me a cheque id set fire to it way i see it hes the one losing out i have cammie and hell never know her what does she think about her dad she knows that some kids have dads and others dont we reckonedmum and dad and meif we didnt make it a tragedy she wouldnt see it that way but she must ask sometimes but at the end of the day shes more interested in seeing the otters at the wildlife park so we dont have to have much of a conversation about it in time ill tell her some version of the story but shell be older then meredith shrugged and gina squeezed her hand they were sitting on the edge of the bed in the dim light of a single bedside lamp the house was silent aside from their whispers gina said i expect you know you did the right thing but its not been easy for you has it meredith shook her head she found herself grateful for the understanding for she knew that it looked to others as if it had been easy and she never spoke about it in any other way she lived with her parents after all and they loved cammie merediths mum looked after the little girl while meredith went off to work what could be simpler many things of course as it turned out and topping the list was being single being free and being in pursuit of the career shed set off to london to have in the first place that was gone now but not forgotten meredith blinked quickly as she realised how long it had been since shed had a close friend of her own age she said ta to gina and then she considered what real friendship actually meant confidences shared no secrets kept yet she had one that she needed to part with she said gina and she took a deep breath ive got something of yours gina looked puzzled mine what meredith fetched her bag from the top of the chest of drawers she dumped its contents next to gina and she pawed through them till she had what she was looking for the tiny packet shed found beneath the basin in ginas lodging she held it in the palm of her hand and she extended it to gina i broke into your bedsit she could feel her face flush to pure red i was looking for something that would tell me meredith thought about it what had she been looking for she hadnt known then and she didnt know now she said i dont know what i was looking for but this is what i found and i took it im sorry it was a terrible thing to do gina looked at the little packet of folded paper but she didnt take it her shapely eyebrows drew together what is it meredith hadnt for a moment considered that what shed found might not actually belong to gina shed discovered it in ginas room ergo it was hers she withdrew her hand and removed the wrapping from round the roughly shaped circle of gold again she extended her hand to gina and this time gina picked the small piece of gold from merediths palm and held it in her own she said dyou think its real meredith real what real gold gina peered at it closely she said its quite old isnt it look how its worn down i cn make out a head and therere some letters as well she looked up i think its a coin or prhaps a medal an award of some kind have you a magnifying glass meredith thought about this her mother used a small one to thread the needle of her sewing machine she went to fetch it and handed it over gina used it to try to make out what was depicted on the object she held she said some blokes head all right hes wearing one of those circlet crowns like a king would wear into battle over his armour gina nodded therere words as well but i cant make them out only they dont look like english meredith thought a coin or medal possibly fashioned from gold a king words in a foreign language she thought also of where they lived in the new forest itself a place long ago established as the hunting grounds for william the conqueror he didnt speak english none of the court spoke english then french was their language is it french she asked gina said cant tell have a look yourself its not easy to read it wasnt the letters were blurred likely with time and usage which suggested the way any coin would become less easy to read having been carried round handled and passed from one person to another i expect its valuable gina said if only because its gold course im only assuming its gold i spose it could be something else what else meredith said i dont know brass bronze why hide a brass coin or a bronze one i expect its gold all right she raised her head only question is if its not yours honestly ive never seen it in my life then how did it get into your room gina said sounding delicate about it truth to tell meredith if you broke into the room so easily meredith finished the thought someone else could have done the same and left the coin beneath the basin as well is that where you found it gina was quiet mulling this over well either whoever had the room before me hid the coin left in a hurry and forgot about it she finally said or someone put it there while ive had the room we need to know who that person was meredith said yes i think we do chapter twentytwo lynley took a call from isabelle ardery as he emerged from psychic mews luckily hed set his phone on vibrate or he wouldnt have heard it as the noise from a shop playing turkish music made hearing anything else impossible he said hang on ive got to get out of here and he went outside has to be the quickest work hes managed to do isabelle ardery was saying as he brought the mobile to his ear once he reached the pavement at lynleys question she repeated what shed been telling him that di john stewart in an admirable display of what he was actually capable of when he wasnt being deliberately difficult had tracked down all of the phone calls made to and from jemima hastings mobile in the days leading up to her death on the day of her death and in the days after her death as well weve one call from the cigar shop on the day she died ardery said jayson druther and he confirms he says it was about an order for cuban cigars he couldnt find them her brother phoned her as well as did frazer chaplin andi admit ive saved whats most intriguing for last there was a call from gordon jossie was there indeed there was his number large as life same one as on the postcards he put up round the portrait gallery and covent garden interesting isnt it whatve we got on the mobile phone towers lynley asked anything yet theyd want to track the location of the callers when the calls to jemimas mobile had been made and checking the pinging off the mobile phone towers was the way to do this it couldnt pinpoint exactly where a caller had been but it would get them close to the spot johns checking into that its going to take time calls following her death there were messages from yolanda from rob hastings from jayson druther from paolo di fazio nothing from abbott langer then or frazer chaplin nothing from jossie nothing at all not afterwards suggests to me that one of those blokes knew there was no point in phoning doesnt it what about calls she made on the day she died three to frazer chaplinthis is in advance of the one she received from himand one to abbott langer they need talking to again those two lynley told her he would get on to that he was yards away from the ice rink he added what yolanda had said about her last meeting with jemima if jemima had sought advice from the psychic about hard truths needing to be spoken to someone it seemed to lynley that those hard truths were meant to be heard by a man since if the psychic was to be believed jemima had apparently been in love with the irishman one of the possibilities was that he was the recipient of those hard truths that she needed to tell of course lynley told the superintendent he was not blind to the fact that there were other equally strong potential recipients of jemima hastings message abbott langer would be one of them as would paolo di fazio jayson druther yukio matsumoto and any other man whose life touched upon hers such as gordon jossie as well as her own brother rob go with chaplin and langer first ardery said when hed finished well keep digging at this end she was silent for a moment before adding hard truths thats what she told you dyou reckon yolandas telling her own truths thomas lynley considered what yolanda had said about him about his aura about the return of a womangone but not and never forgotteninto his life he had to admit that he didnt know how much of what yolanda said was based on intuition how much on watching for subtle reactions in her listener as she spoke and how much on what she really knew from the other side he reckoned they could discount just about everything she proclaimed that had no basis in cold facts and he said but when it comes to jemima the psychic wasnt making predictions guv she was reporting on what jemima actually told her isabelle she said not guv wed got to isabelle thomas he was quiet for a moment considering this he finally said isabelle then yolanda was reporting on what jemima told her but she also has a vested interest in leading us astray if she herself put that handbag in the bin true but someone else could have put it there and she could be protecting that person let me talk to abbott langer the mobile phone records were simultaneously good news and bad news for isabelle anything that led them in the direction of the killer had to be a plus at the same time however anything that led them away from yukio matsumoto as that killer made her own position perilous it was one thing if a killer attempting to run from the police was hit by a taxi and severely injured this was bad for her situation but it wasnt fatal it was quite another thing if an innocent psychiatric patient off his meds was hit while in the act of fleeing godonlyknewwhat cooked up by his feverish brain that didnt look good in the present climate of people being mistaken for terrorists and taken out by gunfire in hideous error the long and short of it was that mobile phone calls or not they needed something definitivesomething absolutely ironcladto be the nail in matsumotos coffin she had watched the mets preemptive press conference which stephenson deacon and the directorate of public affairs had put together she had to admit that the press office was as smooth and cool as sculpted marble but they would be having had years of practice in the subtle art of imparting information meant to be explicative when the very last thing they wanted was to give out incriminating details about any officer from or any action taken by the met deacon and hillier himself had appeared before the cameras hillier had made the prepared statement the accident in shaftesbury avenue was deemed unfortunate undesirable unavoidable and every other un that could be excavated from someones thesaurus but the officers were not armed he intoned they had clearly and repeatedly identified themselves as officers and if a suspect runs from the police when the police want to question him those police are going to give chase for obvious reasons in a murder investigation the safety of the public at large trumps other considerations especially when someone is making an attempt to evade an interaction with the police who those police were by name hillier didnt divulge that would come later isabelle knew in the unfortunate event of someone needing to be thrown to the wolves isabelle had a good idea of who that person would be there were followup questions from journalists at the press conference but she didnt listen to them she got back to work and she was still at work when a phone call came in from sandra ardery the call didnt come through her mobile which was clever of sandra isabelle thought since she would have recognised the number and refused to answer rather the call came through channels ending up on dorothea harrimans line harriman came personally to share the blessed news sandra ardery would be that grateful for just a word with you guv she says its about the boys that inflection on the noun indicated harrimans unfounded assurance that surely isabelle would jump to talk to anyone who had something to say about the boys isabelle restrained herself from snatching up the phone and barking what at sandra she had nothing against bobs wife who at the very least always made an heroic attempt to remain a neutral party in isabelles disputes with her former husband she nodded at harriman and took the call sandras voice was breathy as always for some reason she spoke like someone either doing a bad impersonation of marilyn monroe or exhaling clouds of cigarette smoke although she didnt indulge in the latter as far as isabelle knew bob said he tried to reach you earlier sandra told her he left a message on your mobile i did tell him to try your office butyou know bob ah yes isabelle thought she said ive been caught up in things here sandra weve had an incident with a bloke in the street are you somehow involved in that how dreadful i saw the news conference it interrupted my programme her programme was medical isabelle knew not a daily hospital drama this but rather an intense scientific exploration of debilitating conditions and numerous afflictionsfatal and otherwise sandra watched it religiously and took copious notes as a means of monitoring her childrens health as a result she regularly ferried them to their paediatrician in a state of panic most recently because of a rash on the younger girls arm which sandra had firmly believed was an outbreak of something called morgellons disease sandras obsession with this programme was the single subject that isabelle and bob ardery could actually share a chuckle over yes im involved in an investigation related to that incident isabelle told her which is why i wasnt able to shouldnt you have been at the press conference isnt that how its done its not done any particular way why is bob monitoring me oh no oh no which meant that he was which meant that he had probably phoned his wife and told her to switch on the telly posthaste because his exhad blotted her copybook properly this time and the proof was at that very moment being offered up for public consumption on the airwaves anyway thats not why im phoning why are you phoning are the boys all right oh yes oh yes not to worry about that theyre right as rain a bit noisy of course and a bit rambunctious theyre eightyearolds of course of course i dont mean to implyisabelle not to worry i love those boys you know i do theyre just wildly different to the girls they dont like dolls and tea parties if thats what you mean but you didnt expect them to did you not at all not at all theyre lovely we had an outing yesterday by the way the girls and the boys and i i thought they might enjoy the cathedral in canterbury did you a cathedral isabelle thought weakly for eightyearolds i wouldnt think well of course of course youre right it didnt go quite as well as id hoped id thought the thomas becket part would appeal you know what i mean murder on the high altar this renegade priest and it did rather at first but holding their attention was a bit of a problem i think they would have preferred a trip to the seaside but i do so worry about sun exposure what with the ozone layer and global warming and the alarming increase in basal cell carcinoma and they dont like sunblock isabelle which i cant understand the girls slather it right on but one would think im trying to torture the boys the way they react to it did you never use it isabelle drew in a steadying breath she said perhaps not as regularly as i might have done now but its crucial to use it you must have known sandra is there something particular youve phoned about im quite tied up in things here you see so if this is just to chat youre busy youre busy of course youre busy its only this do come to lunch the boys want to see you i dont think please i do plan to take the girls to my mums so it will be just you and the boys and bob and bob naturally she was silent for a moment and then she said impulsively i did try to get him to see isabelle i told him it was only fair i said you need time with them i told him i would cook the lunch and have it ready for you and then we could all be off to my mums wed leave you with them and it would be just like a restaurant or a hotel only it would be in our house butim afraid he wouldnt consider that he just wouldnt im so sorry isabelle he means well you know he means nothing of the kind isabelle thought please come wont you the boysi do think theyre caught in the middle dont you they dont understand well how could they doubtless bob has explained it all isabelle didnt bother to try to keep bitterness at bay he hasnt he hasnt not word not a word just that mummys in london settling into a new job just as you agreed i didnt agree where the hell did you get the idea that i agreed its only that he said would you have agreed to hand over your children would you is that the sort of mother you think i am i know youve tried to be a very good mother i know youve tried the boys dote on you tried tried isabelle suddenly heard herself and wanted to pound her fist against her skull as she realised shed begun to sound exactly like sandra with her infuriating habit of doubling words and phrases a nervous tic that always sounded as if she believed the world was partially deaf and in need of her constant reiteration oh im not saying this right im not saying i must get back to work but will you come will you consider coming this isnt about you and its not about bob its about the boys its about the boys dont you bloody dare tell me what this is about isabelle slammed the phone down she cursed and dropped her head into her hands i will not i will not she told herself and then she laughed although even to her own ears she sounded hysterical it was that bloody doubling of words she thought she might go mad uhguv she looked up although she knew before she did so that the marginal deference in the tone marked the interruption as coming from di john stewart he stood there with an expression on his face that told her hed overheard at least part of her conversation with sandra she snapped what is it the oxfam bin it took her a moment before she got her brain round that one bella mchaggis and her recycling front garden she said to stewart what about it john weve got more than a handbag inside it weve something youre going to want to see the continued heat wave was lynley found making it a big day at the queens ice and bowl particularly on the ice itself this was likely the coolest spot in london and everyone from toddlers to pensioners appeared to be taking advantage of it some of them simply clung to the railing at the rinks edge and pulled themselves along haphazardly others more adventurous wobbled round the rink without assistance the more expert skaters trying to avoid them in the very middle of the rink future olympians practised jumps and spins with varied degrees of success while negotiating the crowd for space wherever possible icedancing instructors plied their trade with inept partners making brave attempts to mirror torvill and dean lynley had to wait to speak to abbott langer who was giving a lesson in the middle of the ice hed been pointed out to lynley by the skatehire bloke who referred to langer as the git with the hair lynley hadnt been certain what was meant by that until he caught a glimpse of the instructor then he saw there was no other description needed hed not seen such a hirsute swiss roll outside of a photograph ever no matter the case langer could certainly skate he launched himself off the ice in an effortless jump as lynley watched demonstrating its ease for a young male pupil who looked round ten years old the child tried it and landed on his bum langer glided over and lifted him to his feet he bent his head to the childs they spoke for a moment and langer demonstrated a second time he was very good he was smooth he was strong lynley wondered if he was also a killer when the lesson finished lynley intercepted the skating instructor as he said goodbye to his pupil and put guards on the blades of his skates could he have a word lynley enquired politely he showed his identification langer said ive spoken to the other two black bloke and some dumpy woman i dont see how i could have anything else to say loose ends lynley told him this shouldnt take long he indicated the café that formed a division between the ice rink and the bowling alley he said lets have a coffee mr langer and he waited till langer resigned himself to a conversation lynley bought two coffees and took them to the table where langer dropped his bulky body he was turning a salt cellar in his fingers these were thick and strong looking and his hands were large like the rest of him why did you lie to the other officers mr langer lynley asked him without preamble you must have known everything you said would be checked langer made no reply to this wise man lynley thought he was waiting for more there are no exwives nor are there children lynley said why lie about something so easy to disprove langer took a moment to tear open two packets of sugar which he dumped into his coffee he did not stir it its nothing to do with what happened to jemima ive nothing to do with that yes but youd say that wouldnt you lynley pointed out anyone would its a matter of consistency thats all explain i tell everyone the same three exwives children it keeps things simple thats important to you langer looked away from where they sat the ice rink was visible all the lovely young things flying aboutor otherwisein their colourful tights and skimpy skirts i like to remain uninvolved he said exwives and children help i find uninvolved with whom im an instructor thats all i do with them whatever their ages sometimes a young one or a middleaged one or any of them develop an interest because were close on the ice its stupid it doesnt mean anything and i dont take advantage exwives make that possible with jemima hastings as well jemima took lessons from me langer told him thats the extent of it she used me rather for what i told the others this already i wasnt lying about that she wanted to keep her eye on frazer she phoned you on the day she died along with the truth about exwives and children you didnt mention that to the other detectives langer took up his coffee i hadnt remembered the call and do you now he looked reflective yes actually she was looking for frazer was she supposed to be meeting him at the cemetery i rather think she was checking up on him she did that often anyone frazer was involved with ended up doing that jemima wasnt the first and she wouldnt have been the last long as he worked here that went on a woman checking up on him a woman who didnt quite trust him making sure he was walking the straight and narrow he rarely did and for jemima it was likely business as usual for frazer but i dont know do i anyway i couldnt help her that day which she ought to have realised before she rang me why because of the time he isnt here at that hour had she thought about it she would have known he wouldnt be here but he wasnt answering his mobile she said shed rung him a few times and he wasnt answering and she wanted to know was he still here where perhaps he wouldnt be able to hear it with all the noise he indicated the clamour round them but really she had to have known hed already left for home anyway thats what i told her for home lynley thought he didnt go from here directly to dukes hotel he always goes home first he says he doesnt like to keep his dukes kit here where it could get dirty but knowing frazer theres another reason he made a crude gesture with his hands an indication of sexual intercourse likely hes been doing the job on someone en route between here and dukes or there at home even it wouldnt surprise me that would be his style anyway jemima said shed been leaving him messages and she was feeling panicky she used that term panicky no but i could hear it in her voice was it fear perhaps not panic but fear she was phoning from a cemetery after all people are sometimes frightened in cemeteries langer shrugged off this idea he said i dont think thats what it was f you ask me i think it was dread of having to look squarely at something shes been denying interesting point lynley thought he said carry on frazer he said i expect she wanted very much to think frazer chaplin was the one if you know what i mean the one in inverted commas but i expect in her heart she knew he wasnt what makes you draw the latter conclusion langer smiled thinly because its the conclusion they always reached inspector every last woman who hooked up with the bloke thus lynley greatly anticipated meeting the male paragon hed been hearing about he made his way to st jamess place a nearly hidden culdesac where dukes hotel formed a stately l of redbrick decorative ironwork oriel window and sumptuous swaths of ivy tumbling from firstfloor balconies he left the healey elliott under the watchful eye of a uniformed doorman and entered into the reserved hush one usually encounters in places of worship could he be helped he was asked by a passing bellboy the bar he replied an immediate smile of recognition lynleys possession and use of the voice would make him eternally welcome in any establishment where people spoke in murmurs called employees the staff and had the good sense to drink sherry before and port after if the gentleman would come this way the bar ran heavily to naval portraits and prints of ruined castles with a painting of admiral nelson in his postarm days taking a predominant position as one would expect of a seaoriented décor the bar comprised three roomstwo of which were separated by a fireplace in which mercifully no fire was burningand it was furnished with upholstered armchairs and round glasstopped tables at which were gathered mostly business people at this time of day they appeared to be tossing back gin and tonics with a few hardier souls getting glassyeyed over martinis this was apparently the signature drink of one of the bartenders an italian man with a marked accent who asked lynley if he wanted the speciality whichhe was toldwas neither shaken nor stirred but rather bruised along into some sort of miraculous nectar lynley demurred he said he wouldnt mind a pellegrino if they had it lime and no ice and was frazer chaplin available for a chat he produced his identification the bartenderwho bore the unlikely nonitalian name of heinrichgave no reaction at all to the presence of a policeman in possession of a cultured accent or not indifferently he said frazer chaplin had not yet arrived he was expectedwith a glance at an impressive watchin the next quarter hour did frazer work regular hours lynley enquired of the bartender or did he perhaps just fill in when things were busy in the hotel regular hours he was told wouldnt have taken the job otherwise heinrich said why not evening shift is busiest the tips are better so are the customers lynley raised an eyebrow seeking elucidation which heinrich was happy to give him it seemed frazer enjoyed the attention of various ladies of varying ages who frequented the bar at dukes hotel most evenings these were international businesswomen generally in town for one reason or another and frazer was apparently willing to give them additional reasons to hang about has an eye out for a lady wholl keep him how he wants to be kept was how heinrich put it he shook his head but his expression was unmistakably fond fancies himself a gigolo is that working for him heinrich chuckled not yet but thats not kept the lad from trying he wants to own a boutique hotel just like this place but he wants someone else to buy it for him hes looking for a great deal of money then thats frazer lynley thought about this and how it related to the truths jemima had wished to speak to a man hoping for money from a woman the message that she wouldnt be handing it over to him would indeed be a very hard truth as would be the possible truth that she wanted nothing more to do with him because shed discovered he was after her moneyif she had money in the first place but again and maddeningly there were other truths when it came to jemima to paolo di fazio there was a hard truth that might have been told that she was going to take up life with frazer chaplin despite paolos feelings for her as to everyone from abbott langer to yukio matsumoto doubtless a little delving was going to reveal truths everywhere needing to be spoken lynley did the maths on the time of frazer chaplins daily arrival in the bar of dukes hotel the irishman had ninety minutes between the hour he left the ice rink and when he began work at this location was it time enough to race up to stoke newington murder jemima hastings and get to his second job lynley didnt see how not only had abbott langer suggested that the man went to putney before heading to dukes but even had that not been the case the london traffic would have made it next to impossible and lynley couldnt see the killer getting to that cemetery on public transport when frazer chaplin arrived at dukes lynley had the uneasy feeling hed seen the man before exactly where hed seen him hovered on the edge of his consciousness but for the moment he couldnt insert the face into a location he thought about where hed been in recent days but nothing clicked he let it go for the moment he was no judge of male looks but he could see chaplins appeal to women who liked their men dark and edgy possessing an air of danger a cross between a modernday heathcliff and sweeney todd he wore a cream jacket and white shirt with a red bow tie over his dark trousers an outfit giving reasonable testimony to why he would want to change his clothes at home and not carry them round with him or leave them at the ice rink like abbott langer his hair verged on black but unlike langers it was styled more in keeping with the times it looked newly washed and he appeared to be freshly shaven his hands looked manicured as well and he wore an opal ring on his left ring finger he joined lynley at once having been given the word by the bartender lynley had taken a table quite near to the gleaming mahogany bar and frazer dropped into one of the chairs extended his hand and said heinrich tells me youd like a word have you something new to ask me ive spoken to some other coppers already lynley introduced himself and said you appear to be the last person to speak to jemima hastings mr chaplin chaplin replied in his lilting accent which lynley noted would likely have appealed to the ladies as much as frazers tough masculinity do i now but he made it a statement and not a question and how would you reckon that inspector from her mobile phone records lynley told him ah he said well i expect the very last person to speak to jemima would be the bloke who killed her unless she was jumped on without preliminaries she seems to have phoned you a number of times in the hours leading up to her death she phoned abbott langer as well looking for you according to him abbott seems to feel she was romantically involved with you and he isnt the only person to make that observation would i be wrong to expect the other person is one paolo di fazio chaplin asked where theres smoke theres generally something in flames in my experience lynley said what was your phone call to jemima hastings about mr chaplin frazer tapped his fingers on the glasstopped table a silver bowl of mixed nuts sat upon it and he reached for a few and held them in the palm of his hand he said she was a lovely girl ill give you that ill give everyone that if anyone wants it but while i might have seen her on the outside now and again on the outside away from mrs mchaggiss lodgings while i might have seen her now and againthe pub the high street having a meal somewhere at a film eventhat would be the extent of it now ill also give you the fact that it could have appeared to others we were involved truth to tell it could have appeared that way to jemima as well her coming to the ice rink like she did her talking to that gypsy woman who does the fortunes that sort of thing makes it look like the two of us had it going but more than being friendly to her more than being friendly like i would be to anyone i shared lodgings with more than merely having or trying to have a friendship thats the stuff of fantasy inspector whose what whose fantasy he popped the nuts into his mouth he sighed inspector jemima drew conclusions have you never known a woman to do that one moment youre buying a lager for a girl and the next shes got you married with kids and living in a rosecovered cottage in the countryside thats not happened to you not in my memory lucky you are then for its happened to me tell me about your phone call to her on the day of her death i swear to the holy ghost man i dont even remember making it but if i did and if as you say shed been phoning me as well then likely as not i was merely returning her call fending her off in one way or another or at least attempting to she had it for me i wont deny that but theres no way i was encouraging the lass and the day of her death what about it tell me where you were what you did who saw you ive been over all this with the other two but not with me and sometimes there are details that one officer misses or fails to put in a report please humour me theres nothing to humour you with i worked at the ice rink i went home to shower and change i came here its what i do every day for jesus sake theres someone at every point to confirm this so you cant be thinking that i somehow scarpered up to stoke newington to kill jemima hastings especially as i had no bloody reason to do it how do you get from the ice rink to this job mr chaplin ive a scooter he said have you indeed i do and if youre thinking that idve had the time to weave through traffic and make it up to stoke newington and then back herewell you best come with me frazer rose picking up a few more nuts and tossing them into his mouth he had a brief word with heinrich and then led the way out of the bar and out of the hotel as well at the far end of the culdesac that was st jamess place frazer chaplins motor scooter stood it was a vespa the sort of vehicle that zips up and down the streets of every major town in italy but unlike those scooters this one was not only painted a violent and completely unforgettable lime green it was also covered with bright red advertising transfers for a product called dragonfly tonics in effect becoming a mobile billboard not unlike those seen occasionally on black cabs round town chaplin said would i be mad enough to take myself up to stoke newington on that to leave it parked anywhere and then do a dash to kill jemima what dyou take me for man a fool would you be likely to forget youd seen that thing parked hither or thither i wouldnt and i doubt anyone else would either take a bloody photo of it if you want show it round up there go to every house and shop in every street there is and youll see the truth of it which is what that i bloody well didnt kill jemima when the police ask ian barker on tape why did you make the baby naked he does not reply at first his grandmother keens in the background a chair scrapes the floor and someone taps on the tabletop you know that baby was naked dont you when we found him he was naked you know that dont you ian are the next questions and they are followed by you yourself made him naked before you used the hairbrush on him we know that because your fingerprints are on that hairbrush were you angry ian had johnny done something to make you angry did you want to sort him out with the hairbrush ian finally says i didnt do nothing to that kid you ask reggie you ask mikey mikey was the one changed his nappy anyways he knew how he got brothers i dont and reg was the one nicked the bananas eh michael says in response to the first mention of the hairbrush i never i never ian told me he poohed ian said i was meant to change him but i never and when asked about the bananas he begins to cry ultimately he says it got poo on it didnt it that baby was in the muck there on the groundhe was just laying there whereupon his weeping turns to wailing reggie arnold addresses his mother as before saying mum mum there wasnt no hairbrush i never made that baby naked i never touched him mum i never touched that baby mikey kicked him mum see he was on the ground and he was on his face causemum he mustve fell and mikey kicked him when told of reggies claim following on the heels of ians claims michael spargo finally begins to tell the rest of the story in what is an attempt to defend himself against what he obviously sees as an effort on the part of the other two boys to shift blame upon him he admits to using his foot on john dresser but he claims it was only to turn the baby over in order to help him breathe right from this point forward the excruciating details slowly come out the blows to little john dresser from the boys feet the use of copper tubing upon him like swords or whips and ultimately the discarded concrete blocks parts of the story howeverthe exact details of what happened with the banana and the hairbrush for examplemichael refuses to speak about altogether and this silence about those two pieces of evidence remains when the other two boys are questioned as well but the postmortem examination of john dressers body in addition to the level of the boys continued distress when the subject of the hairbrush comes up indicates the sexual component of the crime just as its terrible ferocity substantiates the deep well of anger each boy called upon in the final moments of the toddlers life once a confession was obtained from the boys the crown prosecutors took the highly unusual and equally controversial decision not to present the full details of john dressers antemortem injuries to the court during the subsequent trial their reasoning was twofold first they had not only the confessions but also the cctv films the eyewitness testimonies and copious forensic evidence all of which they believed established without doubt the guilt of ian barker michael spargo and reggie arnold second they knew that donna and alan dresser were going to be present for the trial as was their right and the cps did not wish to exacerbate the parents agony by revealing to them the extent of the brutality that had been inflicted upon their child prior to and after his death wasnt it enough they reasoned to learn ones childso recently out of infanthoodhad been abducted dragged across town stripped naked whipped with copper tubing stoned with broken concrete and dumped into an abandoned portaloo additionally they had complete confessions from at least two of the boys ian barker only going so far as admitting finally that he was in the barriers that day and he saw john dresser before holding firm to maybe i did something and maybe i didnt for the rest of his interviews and more than that seemed completely unnecessary for a conviction it must be argued however that a third reason could well exist for the cpss silence on the matter of john dressers internal injuries had these injuries become known questions regarding the psychological state of his killers would have arisen and these questions might have led the jury ineluctably towards manslaughter instead of murder because they would necessarily have been instructed to consider the act of parliament which declares that a person shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mindas substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts at the time of the crime abnormality of mind are the key words here and johns further injuries do much to suggest deep abnormality on the part of all three of his killers but a verdict of manslaughter would have been unthinkable considering the climate in which the boys were tried while the venue for the trial had been changed the crime had gone from being a national story to an international story shakespeare declares that blood will have blood and this situation was an example of that some have argued that when the boys stole the hairbrush from the itemsforapound shop in the barriers they knew full well what they were going to do with it but to me this suggests both reasoning and planning far beyond that of which they were capable i dont deny that perhaps my reluctance to believe in such a degree of premeditation is attached to a personal disinclination for considering the potential for pure iniquity to exist in the minds and hearts of tenand elevenyearold boys nor will i deny my preference for believing that the use of that hairbrush was the work of impulse what i certainly will agree with is what the fact of that hairbrush illustrates about the boys those who abuse and violate have been abused and violated themselves not once but repeatedly when the hairbrush was brought up in interviews it was a subject that not one of the boys was willing to talk about on tape their reactions vary from ians assertion that wasnt no hairbrush that i ever saw to reggies attempt at innocence with mikey mightve nicked one from that shop but i dont know that do i and i never took no hairbrush mum you got to believe i never wouldve took no hairbrush to michaels we didnt have no hairbrush we didnt have no hairbrush we didnt we didnt which rises in what sounds like panic with every denial when michael is gently told you know one of you boys took that hairbrush son he agrees that reggie mightve then but i didnt see and i dont know what happened to it do i it is only when the presence of the hairbrush at the dawkins building site is brought up along with the fingerprints upon it in conjunction with the blood and the faecal matter on its handle that the reactions of the boys escalate to their most emotive michaels begins with i neveri told you and told you i didnti didnt take no hairbrushthere werent no hairbrush at all and segues to it were reggie done it to that babyreggie wanted toian took it from himi said to stop and reggie did it reggie on the other hand addresses all his remarks to his mother saying mum i neveri wouldnt hurt no babymaybe i hit him once but i neveri took his snowsuit off him but it was all mucked up thats whyhe were crying mum i knew not to hurt him if he were crying during this rudy arnold is silent but laura can be heard throughout moaning reggie reggie whatve you done to us as the social worker quietly asks her to drink some water perhaps in an attempt to silence her as for ian he finally begins to cry when the extent of john dressers injuries are read to him his grandmother can be heard weeping along with him and her words sweet jesus save him save him lord suggest shes accepted the boys culpability it is at the point of the hairbrushs introduction into the interviewsthree days after the toddlers body was foundthat the boys confess fully to the crime it is perhaps one of the additional horrors of the murder of john dresser that when the perpetrators of this ghastly crime confessed only one of them had a parent present rudy arnold sat by his son throughout ian barker had only his grandmother and michael spargo was accompanied only by social workers chapter twentythree whoever had killed jemima hastings as things turned out was someone whod worn a yellow shirt to do it lynley learned the details of this article of clothing upon his return to new scotland yard where the team was meeting in the incident room and a photo of the shirtnow in the possession of forensicswas newly up on one of the china boards barbara havers and winston nkata had arrived from the new forest lynley saw and he also saw from barbaras expression that she wasnt happy about being recalled to london bloodstained yellow shirt or not she was fighting back a need to speak which in her case meant fighting back a need to argue with the acting superintendent nkata on the other hand seemed acquiescent enough displaying the easiness of disposition that had long been an integral part of his character he lounged at the back of the room sipping from a plastic cup he nodded at lynley and tilted his head towards havers he too knew she was itching to walk on the wrong side of whatever line isabelle ardery had drawn for her still unconscious ardery was saying but the surgeon indicates hell be brought round tomorrow when that happens hes ours and to lynley bringing him fully into the picture the shirt was among the clobber in the oxfam bin its got a significant bloodstain on the front of it right side and on the right sleeve and cuff its with forensics but for the moment were assuming the blood is our victims agreed she didnt wait for lynleys reply right then lets put a few things together weve two oriental hairs in the victims hand no defensive wounds on her a pierced carotid artery and a japanese man in possession of the murder weapon and with her blood on his clothing whatve you got to add from today thomas for the team lynley recapped what hed learned from yolanda he added for them and for isabelle as well the details hed had off abbott langer the bartender heinrich and frazer chaplin he knew he was about to devastate isabelles position but there was no way round it he concluded by saying with a nod at the large photo of the shirt i think we have two individuals interacting with jemima in abney park cemetery guv there was nothing in matsumotos wardrobe even vaguely resembling that shirt he wears black and whitenot bright coloursand even if that werent the case the clothing he had on that day a tuxedo was itself stained with her blood as youve just said he cant have been wearing both the tuxedo and the yellow shirt so with yet another article of clothing bloodstained and with jemima going to the cemetery to speak with a man weve got two blokes there instead of one thats how ive got it figured barbara havers put in quickly so guv it seems to me that recalling winnie and me to london one bloke to kill her and the other towhat john stewart asked to watch over her i suspect lynley said something at which matsumoto seeing himself as her guardian angel failed miserably hang on thomas ardery said hear me out lynley replied he saw her eyes widen slightly and he knew she wasnt pleased he was going in a completely different direction and god knew she had very good reason for the investigations maintaining its progress towards matsumoto as the killer a bloke met her there to hear her hard truths lynley said weve got this from the psychic and her profession aside i think shes to be believed if we ignore all yolandas additional maundering about jemima and the house in oxford road shes merely relating to us her own encounters with the woman so from her we know that a man in jemimas life needed to hear something and yolanda suggested a place of peace for their meeting jemima knew about the cemetery as shed been photographed there that was the spot she chose with matsumoto just happening to be there ardery demanded he likely followed her all right but lets assume this wasnt the only time he followed her why would it have been why only on this particular day that makes no sense so if he was stalking her he likely was the man who needed to hear the hard truths those being leave me alone or ill have you for stalking but he anticipates this is the way the conversation will go and like all mad stalkers hes come with a weapon yellow shirt or not bloodstained tuxedo or not how do you explain that weapon in his possession thomas how do you explain the blood on two kinds of clothing john stewart put in glances were exchanged among the others present it was his tone he was taking sides lynley didnt want this it was not his intention to turn the investigation into a political intrigue he said he sees her meet someone in the cemetery they decamp to the chapel annex for a more private word why isabelle asked theyre already in a private spot why does it need to be more private because whoever shes there to meet is there to kill her havers put in so he makes the request lets go over there lets go in that building guv we need to lynley held up a hand perhaps theyre arguing one of them gets up begins to pace the other follows they go inside but only the killer emerges matsumoto sees this he waits for jemima to come out as well when she doesnt he goes to investigate for gods sake wouldnt he notice the other bloke had blood on his shirt he may have done perhaps thats why he went to investigate but i think its more likely that the other bloke would have taken that shirt off and stowed it hed have to have done so he cant leave the cemetery with blood all over him matsumoto did which is what suggests to me that he didnt kill her not that he did this is bollocks ardery said guv it isnt havers broke in and her tone declared she was serious this time she would be heard and damn the consequences theres something not right in hampshire we need to get back there winnie and i oh you two lovebirds john stewart put in lynley said automatically thatll do john forgetting his return from acting superintendent to inspector sod off havers told stewart undeterred guv theres more to be looked into in the new forest this bloke whiting somethings not right about him therere contradictions all over the place such as isabelle asked havers began leafing through her disaster of a notebook she shot a look at winston saying get involved here mate winston stirred and came to her aid jossies not what he seems guv he said he and whiting are connected somehow weve not got to the root of things but the fact that whiting knew bout jossies apprenticeship suggests to usto barb an methat he was behind jossie getting it in the first place an that suggests he forged those letters from the technical college we cant see who else mightve done it for gods sake why would he do that could be jossies got something on him nkata said we dont know what yet havers said but we could find out if youd let us youll stay here in london as youve been ordered but guv no and to lynley its just as easy to work this the other way round thomas she meets matsumoto in the cemetery she goes with matsumoto into the chapel annex they have their words he uses the weapon on her and he flees the other wearing a yellow shirt sees this he goes into the annex he comes to her aid but she has a wound thats beyond aid he gets her blood on him he panics he knows how this is going to look once his history with jemima comes to light he knows the cops look hard at whoever first comes upon the victim and reports it and he cant afford that so he runs and then what john stewart asked he puts that shirt in mchaggiss oxfam bin along with the handbag and what about the handbag why take it could be matsumoto took the handbag could be he put it in the bin hed want to cast blame to muddy the waters so stewart said acerbically let me get this straight this matsumoto and the other blokedamn well unbeknownst to each otherboth put a piece of incriminating evidence in the very same bin in an entirely different area of london from where the crime was committed bloody hell woman jesus god what exactly dyou think are the odds of that he blew out a derisive breath and looked at the others idiot cow his expression said isabelles face was perfect stone she said to stewart in my office now stewart hesitated just long enough to signal his scorn he and isabelle engaged in a moment of locked gazes before the acting superintendent strode out of the room stewart rose in a lazy movement and followed her a tight silence ensued someone whistled low lynley approached the china board for a closer look at the photo of the yellow shirt there was a movement next to him and he saw that havers had come to join him she said to him in a low voice you know shes making the wrong decisions barbara you know no one wants to kick his arse into the next time zone as much as i do but hes right this time she meant john stewart lynley couldnt disagree isabelles desperation to bend the facts to fit what she needed to believe about matsumoto was truncating the investigation she was in the worst position possible her temporary status at the met her first investigation and its deterioration into a welter of inconceivable circumstances with a suspect in hospital because hed done a runner that suspect the brother of a famed cellist with access to a fiery solicitor the press taking up the story hillier involved and the abominable stephenson deacon on board to attempt to manipulate the media and evidence pointing in every possible direction lynley wasnt sure how things could get worse for isabelle hers was turning out to be a baptism not by fire but rather by conflagration he said barbara im not sure what youd have me do talk to her shell listen to you webberly wouldve and youdve talked to webberly if hed been going at things like this you know you would and if you were in the same position as she is just now youd listen to us were a team for a reason she drove her hands into her illcut hair in typical fashion pulling on it roughly why did she call us back from hampshire she has limited resources every investigation has oh bloody hell havers stalked off lynley called after her but she was gone he was left facing the china board staring at the yellow shirt he saw at once what it was telling him and what it should have told isabelle he realised he too was in an unenviable position he considered how best to use the information before him barbara couldnt understand why lynley wouldnt take a stand she could understand why he might not want to do that in front of the rest of the team since john bloody stewart hardly needed encouragement to pull a mr christian on the acting superintendents captain bligh but why not have a word with her in private that was the part that didnt make sense lynley wasnt a man intimidated by anyonehis thousand and one runins with ac hillier surely gave testimony to thatso she knew he wasnt unnerved by the prospect of going eyeballtoeyeball with isabelle ardery that being the case what was stopping him she didnt know what she did know was that for some reason he wasnt being himself when she needed him to be just that person the one hed always been to her and to everyone else that he wasnt being the thomas lynley she recognised and had worked with for years troubled her more than she wanted to admit it seemed to mark the degree to which hed changed and the degree to which things that had once mattered to him no longer did it was as if he was floating out there in some sort of unnameable void lost to them in ways that were crucial but undefined barbara didnt want to define them now she just wanted to get home because winston had driven them up from the new forest she was forced into a journey on the blasted northern line at the worst time of day in the worst possible weather and she was additionally forced to make this journey crammed into the area in front of the carriage doors wondering why the hell people would not move down the aisle into the bloody carriage itself as she was jostled into the broad backside of a woman shrieking into her mobile phone about fooking get home an i mean it this time clive or i swear im taking the knife and cutting them off when she wasnt being pushed into the odoriferous armpit of a tshirted adolescent listening to something loud and obnoxious through his earphones to make matters worse she had her holdall with her and when she finally reached the chalk farm station she had to jerk it out of the carriage and in the process broke one of its straps she swore she kicked it she scraped her ankle against one of its buckles she swore again she trudged home from the station wondering when the weather would break bringing a storm that would wash the dust from the tree leaves and scour the smogladen air her mood grew even fouler as she lugged the holdall behind her and everything that was infuriating her seemed to have as its source isabelle ardery but considering isabelle ardery led her back to considering thomas lynley and barbara had had enough of that for one day i need a shower barbara decided i need a fag i need a drink hell on wheels i need a life by the time she arrived home she was dripping perspiration and her shoulders ached she tried to tell herself it was the weight of the holdall but she knew it was tension plain and simple she reached the front door of her bungalow with more relief than shed felt in ages at being home she didnt even care that inside the place it was suitable for baking bread she opened windows and dug her small fan from a cupboard she lit a cigarette inhaled deeply blessed the mere existence of nicotine fell into one of the plain kitchen chairs and looked round her extremely humble little abode shed dropped her holdall by the door so she hadnt seen what was on the daybed at first but now sitting at the kitchen table she saw that her aline skirtthat article best suited to a woman with a figure like hers according to hadiyyahhad been tailored the hem had been taken up the skirt had been ironed and a complete outfit had been assembled upon the bed the skirt a crisp businesslike new blouse sheer tights a scarf even a chunky bracelet and her shoes had been polished as well they fairly gleamed the good fairy had been here barbara rose and approached the bed she had to admit it all looked good together especially the bracelet which she never would have considered purchasing let alone wearing she picked it up for a closer inspection a gift tag was tied to it with a purple ribbon surprise had been printed on the card along with welcome home and the gift givers name as if she had not known who had arranged these items for her hadiyyah khalidah barbaras mood altered at once amazing she thought how such a little thing a mere act of thoughtfulnessshe stubbed out her cigarette and ducked into the tiny bathroom a quarter of an hour saw her showered refreshed and dressed she brushed some blusher on her face in a bow to hadiyyahs makeover efforts and she left her bungalow she went to the lower groundfloor flat of the big house which faced on to the summerdry lawn the french windows were open and cooking sounds along with conversation came from within hadiyyah was chatting to her father and barbara could hear from her voice that she was excited she knocked and called out anyone home to which hadiyyah cried barbara youre back brilliant when hadiyyah came to the door she looked altered to barbara taller somehow although that didnt make sense as barbara had hardly been gone long enough for the little girl to have grown oh this is so lovely hadiyyah cried dad barbaras here cn she stay for dinner no no barbara stammered please dont kiddo i only came to say thank you ive just got back i found the skirt and the rest and what a bloody nice surprise it was i hemmed it myself hadiyyah informed her proudly well maybe mrs silver helped a bit cause sometimes i make my stitches crooked but were you surprised i ironed it as well did you find the bracelet she bounced from foot to foot did you like it when i saw it i asked dad could we buy it cause you know how you got to accessorise barbara from your lips to my memory barbara told her reverently but i couldntve found anything as perfect as that its the colour isnt it hadiyyah said and part of what makes it so wonderful is the size see what i learned is that the size of the accessory depends upon the size of the person wearing it but that has to do with ones features and bones and body type not with ones weight and height if you know what i mean so if you look at your wristslike if you compare them to minewhat you cn see khushi azhar came to the door of the kitchen wiping his hands on a tea towel hadiyyah turned to him barbara found the surprise she announced she likes it dad and what about the blouse barbara did you like the new blouse i wished i picked it out but i didnt dad picked it out didnt you dad i wanted a different one dont tell me you wanted one with a pussy bow well she shifted on her feet doing a little tap dancing in the doorway not exactly but it did have ruffles not a lot you see but there was a sweet little ruffle down the front hiding the buttons and i liked it awfully i thought it was brilliant but dad said you wouldnt ever wear ruffles i said fashion is all about expanding ones horizons barbara but he said horizons can be expanded only so far and he said the tailored blouse was better i said the neckline of a blouse is meant to copy the shape your jawline makes and your face is rounded isnt it not angular like the tailored blouse is and he said lets try it and you cn always take it back if you dont like it and dyou know where we got it khushi khushi azhar said warmly why do you not invite barbara inside hadiyyah laughed hands to her mouth i got so excited she stepped back from the door we have fizzy lemonade to drink dyou want some were having a celebration arent we dad khushi azhar said to her meaningfully some sort of message passed between them and barbara realised that azhar and his daughter had been in the midst of a private conversation her presence was clearly an interruption she said hastily anyway im off you two i wanted to say thanks straightaway it was awfully kind cn i pay you for the blouse you may not azhar told her it was a present hadiyyah declared we even bought it in camden high street barbara not in the stables or anything god no barbara said uneasy personal experience had taught her how azhar felt about hadiyyah wandering round the warren comprising the stables and camden lock market but we did go into inverness street market and it was just lovely ive never been there before azhar smiled he cupped the back of his daughters head and jiggled it lightly in a fond gesture he said how you chatter tonight and to barbara will you stay for dinner barbara oh do stay barbara hadiyyah said dads making chicken saag masala and theres dal and chapatis and mushroom dopiaza i genrally dont like mushrooms you know but i love them how dad cooks oh an hes making rice pilau with spinach and carrots that sounds like quite a feast barbara said it is it is cause she clapped her hands to her mouth her eyes fairly danced above them she said against her palms oh i wish and wish i could say more only i cant you see i promised then you mustnt barbara said but youre such a friend isnt she dad cn i you may not azhar shot barbara a smile now we have stood here chatting long enough barbara we insist that you join us for dinner theres lots of food hadiyyah announced put that way barbara told her i can hardly do anything but fall straight into it she followed them inside and she felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the days temperature which had hardly been lessened by the cooking that had gone on within the flat indeed the beastly heat of the waning day was something she hardly noticed at all instead she noticed the manner in which her mood lifted she no longer was caught up in considering what was happening to thomas lynley and the concerns of the murder enquiry melted away the confrontation with john stewart left isabelle rattled a reaction she hadnt expected she was long used to dealing with men on the force but theirs was generally a covert sexism displayed by the sly innuendo whose interpretation could conveniently be attributed to everything from thin skin to complete misinterpretation on the part of the listener matters were different with john stewart sly innuendo was not his style at least isabelle found that this was the case behind closed doors when stewart knew very well that any move she made against him would be an instance of herwordagainsthis with the higherups and this in a situation in which the last thing she wanted to do was to go to her superior officers with a complaint about sexual harassment or anything else john stewart she realised was clever as the devil he knew the ice she was skating on was thin he was happy to shove her directly into the middle of the pond she wondered briefly how a man could be so shortsighted as to set himself in warfare with someone who might be selected as his superior officer but she gave that consideration only a moment before she saw their standoff from stewarts point of view clearly he didnt expect her to be selected and at the end of the day she couldnt blame him for believing shed soon be shown the door what a cockup she thought how could things possibly get any worse god how she wanted a drink but she steeled herself not to have one not even to look inside her handbag where her airline bottles nestled like sleeping infants she didnt need the stuff she merely wanted it want was not need a knock on her office door and she swung round from the window where shed been standing to gaze at a view she did not even see she called entrance and lynley stood there he held a manila envelope in his hand he said i was out of order earlier im terribly sorry she laughed shortly you and everyone else still and all its no matter thomas he said nothing for a moment observing her he tapped the envelope against his palm as if he was thinking how to go on at last he said john is but still he hesitated perhaps looking for the proper word she said yes its hard to pin down isnt it just the right term to capture the essence of john stewart i suppose but i shouldnt have reprimanded him isabelle it was rather a kneejerk reaction im afraid she waved him off as i said it doesnt matter its not you lynley said youre meant to know that he and barbara have been at it for years he has difficulty with women his divorceim afraid it rather turned him hes not come back from it and hes not been able to see any fault on his part for what went on what did go on lynley entered shutting the door behind him his wife had an affair ask me if im surprised about that she had an affair with another woman i can hardly blame her that bloke would make eve choose the snake over adam theyre a couple now and they have custody of johns two girls he observed her steadily as he said this she shifted her gaze away i cant feel sorry for him who could blame you but sometimes these things are good to know and i doubt his file said it youre right it didnt are you thinking we have something in common john stewart and i people at odds often do and then in a shift will you come with me isabelle youll need to bring your car as i wont be coming back this way theres someone i want you to meet she frowned whats this about not much actually but as its the end of the daywe can have a meal afterwards if youd like sometimes talking over a case brings out something not considered before arguing about it does the same is that what you want to do argue we do have areas of disagreement dont we will you come with me isabelle looked round the office she thought whyever not and she nodded curtly give me a moment to collect my things ill meet you below when hed left her she used the time to make a quick trip into the ladies where she observed herself in the mirror and saw the day playing out on her face especially between her eyes where a deep line was making the sort of vertical incision that became permanent she decided to repair her makeup which gave her a reason to open her handbag there she caught sight of those nestling infants she knew it would take only a moment to toss one of them back or all of them but she firmly closed the bag and went to join her colleague lynley didnt tell her where they were going he merely nodded when she joined him and said hed keep her within sight that was the limit of their exchange before he set off in his healey elliott and gunned its engine as he headed upward out of the underground car park and into the street he manoeuvred over to the river he was as good as his promise he kept her within view she was oddly comforted by this she couldnt have said why unfamiliar with london as she was she hadnt a clue where they were going as they headed southwest along the river it was only when she saw the golden orb atop a distant obelisk to her right that she realised theyd come to the royal hospital which meant theyd reached chelsea the broad lawns of ranelagh gardens were desiccated from the weather she saw although a few brave souls gathered there anyway a lateafternoon game of football was in progress just beyond the gardens lynley turned right he coursed along oakley street and then went left and left again they were in an established chelsea neighbourhood now and it was characterised by quite tall redbrick homes wroughtiron railings and leafy trees he pointed out a parking space to her and he pulled ahead to wait for her to fit her car into it when she joined him in his own car he drove a bit farther she saw the river up ahead of them again along with a pub which was where he parked he said hed be a moment and he went inside he had an arrangement with the publican he told her when he returned when there was no parking available in cheyne row which appeared to be the streets usual condition he left his car alongside the pub and his keys with the barman as security he said its just this way and he directed her to one of the houses this one at the junction of cheyne row and lordship place she expected this building like the others to be a conversion as she couldnt imagine someone actually owning an entire piece of this pricey london real estate but then she saw from the doorbell that she was wrong and when lynley rang it a dog began barking almost at once quieting only when a mans rough voice said enough ell youd think we as gettin invaded as he swung the door open he saw lynley even as the dog rushed out a longhaired dachshund who did not attack but rather leapt round their legs as if wanting to be noticed watch out for peach the man said to isabelle shes wanting food fact shes always and only wanting food and with a nod to lynley lord ashrton in something of a mumble as if he knew lynley preferred another way of being addressed but was reluctant to be less formal with him then he said with a smile i was doing a tray of g and t you as well as he held open the door planning to get addled are they lynley enquired as he gestured for isabelle to precede him inside the man chuckled spose miracles can happen he replied and he said that pleased superintendent when lynley introduced isabelle he was called joseph cotter she discovered and while he didnt appear to be a servantdespite his making drinks for someonehe also didnt appear to be the primary resident of the house that was someone they would apparently find above as joseph cotter said he himself went into a room just to the left at the front of the house g and t then mlord he called over his shoulder superintendent lynley said he would gladly have one isabelle demurred a glass of water would be lovely though she replied will do he said the dachshund had been sniffing around their feet as if in the hope theyd brought something edible in on their shoes finding nothing shed scarpered up the stairs and isabelle could hear her paws clicking against the wooden risers as she ascended higher and higher in the house they did likewise she wondered where on earth they were going and what the man joseph cotter had meant by above they passed floor after floor of dark wainscoting below pale cream walls on which hung dozens of blackandwhite photos mostly portraits although some interesting landscapes were also scattered among them on the final level of the houseisabelle had lost count of the number of flights of stairs theyd climbedthere were two rooms only and no corridor although even more of the photos hung here and in this spot they hung straight to the ceiling the effect was like being in a photographic museum lynley called out deborah simon to which a womans voice replied with tommy hullo and a mans voice said in here tommy mind the puddle there my love and her reply let me see to it simon youll only make a bigger mess isabelle preceded lynley into the room which took most of its illumination from an enormous skylight that comprised the greater part of the ceiling beneath this a redheaded woman knelt on the floor sopping up liquid her gauntfaced companion stood nearby a few towels in his hands these he passed to her as she said two more and i think weve got it lord what a mess she could have been referring to the room itself which looked like the den of a mad scientist with worktables cluttered with files and documents being blown about by fans that stood in the rooms two windows in a futile attempt to mitigate the heat there were bookshelves crammed with journals and volumes racks of tubes and beakers and pipettes three computers china boards video machines television monitors isabelle couldnt imagine how anyone was able to function in the place neither apparently could lynley for he looked round said ah and exchanged a look with the man whom he introduced as simon st james the woman was st jamess wife deborah and isabelle recognised the name as that of the photographer whod taken the portrait of jemima hastings she recognised st jamess name as well he was a longtime expert witness an evaluator of forensic data who worked equally for the defence or for the prosecution when a case of homicide came to trial she could tell from their interaction that lynley knew simon and deborah st james rather well and she wondered why he had wanted her to meet them st james said to lynley yes as you see in answer to his ah he employed an even tone in which something about the state of the room was communicated between them beyond this workplace a second door opened into what was apparently a darkroom and it was from this space that liquid pooled out fixer deborah st james explained as she finished mopping it up shed spilled an entire gallon of the stuff one never spills when a container is nearly empty have you noticed she asked job done she stood and shook back her hair she reached in the pocket of the bib overalls she was wearingthese were olive linen wrinkled and they suited her in ways that would have seemed ridiculous on another womanand she brought out an enormous hair slide she was the kind of woman who could gather up her hair in a single deft movement and make it look fashionably disheveled she wasnt at all beautiful isabelle thought but she was natural and that was her appeal that she appealed to lynley was something he didnt hide he said deb and hugged her kissing her on the cheek briefly deborahs fingers touched the back of his neck tommy she said in reply st james watched this his face perfectly unreadable then he removed his gaze from his wife and lynley to isabelle and said lightly howre you getting on with the met then youve been thrown in feetfirst i dare say i suppose thats better than headfirst isabelle replied deborah said dads doing us drinks did he offer you well of course he did lets not have them up here theres got to be air in the garden unless she looked from lynley to isabelle is this business tommy it can be done in the garden as easily as here with me with simon simon this time and to st james if youve a moment it shouldnt take long i was finished here anyway st james looked round the room and added she had the maddest system of organising things tommy i swear to you i still cant work it out she meant to be indispensable to you well she was that isabelle looked between them once again some sort of code she reckoned deborah said itll come right eventually dont you think but it seemed that she wasnt speaking of the files then she smiled at isabelle and said lets get out of here the little dog had settled on a tattered blanket in one corner of the room but she heroically scuttled back down the stairs shed just come up when she realised their intentions at the ground floor deborah called dad were going to the garden and joseph cotter replied be there in a tic then from the study where the sound of glass clinking against metal suggested that drinks were being placed on a tray the garden comprised lawn brick patio herbaceous borders and an ornamental cherry tree deborah st james led isabelle to a table and chairs beneath this chatting about the weather when theyd sat she changed gears directing a long look at isabelle hows he getting on she asked frankly we worry about him isabelle said im not the best judge as ive not worked with him before he seems to be doing perfectly well as far as i can tell hes very kind isnt he deborah didnt reply at first she gazed at the house as if seeing the men within it after a moment she said helen worked with simon tommys wife did she id no idea she was a forensic specialist no no she waswell she was rather uniquely helen she helped him when he needed her which usually worked out to be three or four times each week he misses her terribly but he wont talk about it she removed her gaze from the house back to isabelle years ago they intended to marrysimon and helenbut they never did well obviously they didnt she added with a smile and helen eventually married tommy bit of a difficult situation isnt it making the change from lovers to friends isabelle didnt ask why lynleys wife and deborahs husband had not married she wanted to do so but the arrival of the two men supervened and on their heels came joseph cotter with the tray of drinks and the household dog who bounded across the lawn with a yellow ball in her mouth that she proceeded to chew on plopping herself at deborahs feet more conversation about the weather followed but soon enough lynley brought up the ostensible reason for this visit to chelsea he handed to simon the manila envelope hed been carrying in isabelles office simon opened it and drew out its contents isabelle saw it was the photograph of the yellow shirt from the oxfam bin what dyou make of it lynley asked his friend st james studied it for a minute in silence before he said i should think its arterial blood the pattern on the front of the shirt its a spray suggesting suggesting this was worn by the killer and he stood quite close to the victim when he struck the fatal blow look at the spray on the collar of the shirt what dyou reckon that means st james thought about this his expression distant he responded with oddly enough id say in the midst of an embrace anything else and the heaviest spray would surely be on the sleeve not on the collar and the front of the shirt let me show you deborah he rose from his chair no easy business for him because he was disabled isabelle hadnt noticed this earlier he wore a leg brace which made his movements awkward his wife rose as well and stood as directed by her husband he put his left arm round her waist and drew her to him he bent as if to kiss her and as he did so he lifted his right hand and brought it down on her neck the demonstration completed he touched his wife lightly on the hair and said to lynley with an indication of the photo you can see the heaviest part of the spray is high on the right breast of the shirt hes taller than she was but not by much not a defensive wound on her simon suggesting she knew him well she was there with him willingly i dare say isabelle said nothing she saw the purpose of this call upon the st jameses and she didnt know whether to be grateful that lynley hadnt made these pointswhich she reckoned hed already deduced from the photoduring the teams meeting at the met or angry that he had decided to do it this way in the presence of his friends she was hardly likely to argue with him here and he must have known that it was yet another nail in the coffin of matsumoto as killer she had to regroup and she had to do it in haste she stirred in her seat she nodded sagely and made noises about being grateful for their time and unfortunately having to be on her way there were various things to see to an early morning the expectation of a witness to be interviewed undoubtedly a meeting with hillier they would understand of course deborah was the one to see her to the door isabelle thought to ask her if on the day of the photo she remembered anything anyone any circumstance remotely unusual deborah said the expected it had been more than six months ago she could remember virtually nothing about it other than sidneysimons sisterst james being present oh and there would be matt as well deborah added he was there matt matt jones sidneys partner he brought her to the cemetery and watched for a few minutes but he didnt stay sorry i should have mentioned it earlier i hadnt really considered him till now isabelle was thinking about this as she began to trace the route back to her car but she hadnt got far in her speculation when she heard her name called she turned to see lynley coming towards her down the pavement she said when he reached her matt jones he said who he had the manila envelope in his possession again she gestured for it he handed it over sidney st jamess boyfriend her partner whatever he was there that day in the cemetery according to deborah shed forgotten till now when and then he put it together the day she took the photo right what do we know about him so far we know that therere hundreds of matthew joneses philip was on it but all right all right i take your meaning thomas she sighed shed pulled hale off and forced him to stand watch at st thomas hospital if there was critical information out there about matt jones it was still out there waiting to be uncovered lynley looked towards the river he said are you interested in dinner isabelle i mean are you hungry we could have something in the pub or if you prefer i dont live far from here but you know that dont you as youve been to the house he sounded rather awkward with the invitation which isabelledespite her growing concerns about the investigationfound a bit charming she recognised the immediate dangers of getting to know thomas lynley better however she didnt particularly want to expose herself to any of them he said id like to talk to you about the case she said thats all and she was very surprised to see him flush he didnt strike her as a flushing kind of man he said of course what else then he added well i suppose theres hillier as well the press john stewart the situation and then theres hampshire what about hampshire she asked the question sharply he indicated the pub come to the kings head he said we need to take a break they stayed three hours lynley told himself it was all in the service of the case in hand still there was more to their elongated sojourn at the kings head and eight bells than sorting out the various aspects of the investigation there was the matter of getting to know the acting superintendent and seeing her somewhat differently she was careful with what she revealed about herself like most people and what she did reveal was painted in positives an older brother sheep farming in new zealand two parents alive and well near dover where dad was a ticket agent for a ferry line and mum was a housewife who sang in the church choir education in rc schools although she was not now a member of any religion former husband a childhood sweetheart whom she married too young unfortunately before either of them was really prepared for what it takes to make a marriage work i hate to compromise she admitted i want what i want and there you have it he said and what do you want isabelle she looked at him frankly before she answered it was a long look that could have communicated any one of a number of things he supposed she said at last with a shrug i expect i want what most women want he waited for more nothing more was offered round them in the pub the noise of the nighttime drinkers seemed suddenly muted until he realised what muted them was his heartbeat which was unaccountably loud in his ears whats that he asked her she fingered the stem of her glass theyd had wine two bottles of it and hed pay the price the following morning but theyd stretched the drinking over the hours and he didnt feel in the least drunk he told himself he said her name to prompt her to reply and he repeated his question she said youre an experienced man so i think you know very well his heartbeat again and this time it occluded his throat which didnt make sense but it did prevent him from giving a reply she said thank you for dinner for the st jameses as well theres no need she rose from the table then adjusted her bag over her shoulder and laid her hand on his as she made ready to depart she said oh but there is you could have presented what youd already concluded about that shirt during our meeting im not blind to that thomas you could have made a perfect fool of me and forced my hand with regard to matsumoto but you chose not to youre a very kind and decent man chapter twentyfour an establishment called sheldon pockworth numismatics had sounded to lynley like a place tucked away in an alley in whitechapel a shop whose proprietor was a mr venus type articulating bones instead of dealing in medals and coins the reality he found was far different the shop itself was clean sleek and brightly lit its location was not far from chelseas old town hall in a spotless brick building on the corner of the kings road and sydney street where it shared what was doubtless expensive space with a number of dealers in antique porcelain silver jewellery paintings and fine china there was no sheldon pockworth nor had there ever been there was instead one james dugué who looked more like a technocrat than a purveyor of coins and military medals from the napoleonic wars when lynley entered that morning he found dugué leafing through a heavy volume set upon a spotless glass counter beneath this gleamed gold and silver coins on a rotating rack when dugué looked up his chic steelrimmed spectacles caught the light he wore a crisp pink shirt and a navy tie striped diagonally in green his trousers were navy as well and when he moved from beyond the counter to a second display case lynley saw that he had on blindingly white trainers and no socks brisk was a very good word to describe him so as things turned out was certain lynley had come to the shop directly from his home rather than going into the yard he lived so close that it made more sense and hed phoned isabelle on her mobile to tell her this as a courtesy theyd spoken briefly haltingly and politely the ground had slightly shifted beneath them at the end of their dinner on the previous night hed walked with her to her car although shed told him such a show of good breeding was hardly necessary as she was perfectly adept at defending herself in the unlikely event that she should be accosted in the fashionble chelsea neighbourhood then she seemed to realise exactly what shed said because shed stopped completely on the pavement turned to him impulsively put her hand on his arm and murmured oh my god i am so sorry thomas which told him shed connected her remarks to what had happened to helen murdered in a neighbourhood not so different from this one and less than a mile away hed said thank you but youve no need really and he hesitated about saying more stumbling rather with its only that before he stopped again in a search for words they stood in the deep shadows of a leafy beech the pavement beneath it already beginning to collect its leaves fallen in the hot dry summer once again he was aware of being nearly eye to eye with isabelle ardery a tall woman slender without being thin cheekbones prominenta fact he hadnt noticed beforeand eyes large which he also hadnt noticed her lips parted as if to say something he held her gaze a moment passed a car door slammed nearby he looked away he said i do want people to have less care with me she made no reply he said theyre afraid theyll say something and ill be reminded i understand that id probably feel the same but what i dont understand is how anyone might think i actually need reminding or am afraid of being reminded still she said nothing what i mean is that shes always there anyway shes a constant presence how could she not be she was doing such a simple thing bringing in her shopping and there they were two of them he was twelve years old the one who shot her he did it for no reason really just because she was there theyve caught him but not the other and hethe boywont name him he wont say a word about what happened he hasnt done since they found him but the truth is all i want to know was what she might have said to them before theybecause somehow i think i might feelif i knew he suddenly found his throat was so tight that he knew he would to his horror weep if he did not stop speaking he shook his head and cleared his throat he kept his gaze on the street her hand was extraordinarily soft when she touched his she said thomas youve no need really walk along with me as if she thought he might not do so she put her hand at his elbow and with her other hand she held on to his arm she brought him close to her side and it was oddly comforting he realised that other than his immediate family and deborah st james no one had touched him for months aside from shaking his hand it was as if people had become frightened of him as if by touching him they believed the tragedy that had visited his life would somehow visit theirs he found he felt such relief at her touch that he walked with her and their steps fell into a natural rhythm there she said when they reached her car she faced him ive had a pleasant evening youre very good company thomas ive my doubts about that he said quietly do you yes and its tommy actually thats what most people call me tommy yes ive noticed she smiled and said im going to hug you now and youre meant to know that this is in friendship she did so she held him close to herbut only for a momentand she also brushed her lips against his cheek i think i shall call you thomas for now if thats all right she said before she left him now in the coin shop lynley waited while the proprietor put his heavy volume away lynley handed him the card theyd found in jemima hastings bag and he showed dugué the portrait gallery photo of jemima he also showed his police identification surprisingly after dugué examined the warrant card he said to lynley youre the policeman who lost his wife last february arent you i am i remember these things dugué told him terrible business that how can i help you and when lynley nodded at the portrait gallery picture of jemima he said yes i remember her shes been into the shop when dugué considered the question he looked out of the shop which was mostly windows and studied the corridor beyond it he said round christmas i cant be more exact than that but i do remember the decorations seeing her backlit by the fairy lights we put up in the corridor so it would have been round christmas give or take two weeks in either direction unlike some establishments we dont keep our decorations up all that long we all of us loathe them to be honest along with the carols bing crosby may dream of snow i for one dream of strangling bing crosby at the end of one week having to listen to him did she make a purchase as i recall she wanted me to look at a coin it was an aureus and she thought it might be worth something aureus lynley considered his schoolboy latin gold then was it worth a great deal not as much as one would think despite its being gold it seemed to lynley that the price of gold alone would make it valuable did she want to sell it she just wanted to know what it was worth and what it was actually because shed no idea she reckoned it was old and she was right about that it was old round onefifty ad roman then did she say how she came to have it dugué asked to look at the picture of jemima again as if this would stimulate his memory after studying it for a moment he said slowly i believe she said it was among her fathers things she didnt tell me exactly but i reckoned hed died recently and shed been going through his belongings the way one does trying to sort out what to do with this and that did you offer to buy it as i said aside from the gold itself it wasnt worth enough on the open market i wouldnt have been able to get a lot for it you seehere let me show you he went to a desk behind the counter where he opened a drawer that had been fashioned to hold books he ran his fingers along them and brought out one saying what she had was an aureus minted during the reign of antoninus pius the bloke who came to be emperor directly after hadrian know about him one of the five good emperors lynley said dugué looked impressed not the sort of knowledge id think a copper would have i read history lynley admitted in another life then you know his was an unusual reign only that it was peaceful right as one of the good guys he wasntwell lets say he wasnt sexy or at least hes not sexy now not to collectors he was intelligent well educated experienced protective of christians clement towards conspirators and happy to stay in rome and delegate responsibility to his provincial leaders loved his wife loved his family assisted the poor practised economy in a word boring certainly compared to caligula or nero eh dugué smiled theres not been a lot written about him so i think collectors tend to dismiss him which makes his coins of less value on the market that and the fact that there were two thousand different coins minted during his reign dugué found what he was looking for in the volume and he swung it to face lynley the page lynley saw displayed both the obverse and the reverse of the aureus in question the former depicted the emperor in profile draped in the fashion of a bust with caes and antoninvs in relief parenthesising the emperors head the latter showed a woman enthroned this was concordia dugué explained a patera in her right hand and cornucopiae beneath her these images were fairly standard stuff the coin dealer went on which was what hed also told jemima hed explained to her that although the coin itself was rare enoughone generally comes across coins of baser metals because they were minted more regularly than the aureusits true value would come from the marketplace that was defined by the demand for the coin among collectors so what are we talking about exactly lynley asked the value dugué considered this tapping his fingers against the top of the display case id say between five hundred and a thousand quid if someone wanted it and if that person were bidding against someone else who wanted it what you must remember dugué concluded is that a coin needs to be sexy lynley said i understand the bad boys are the sexy ones arent they sad dugué confimed but true could he then assume lynley asked that sheldon pockworth numismatics did not have an aureus from the period of antoninus pius among its stock he could dugué said if the inspector wanted to look at an actual aureus from that time he would likely find one in the british museum barbara havers had been forced to begin her day by shaving her legs which hadnt done much to elevate her mood she was fast discovering that there was a domino effect to altering her physical appearance for example the wearing of a skirtaline or otherwisedictated either the wearing of tights or going bare legged and either choice demanded that something be done about the condition of her legs this required the application of razor to skin that required shaving cream or some other kind of lather which she did not possess so she used a dollop of fairy liquid instead to develop some suds activity but the entire operation led to the excavation of a plaster from her medicine cabinet when she sliced into her ankle and blood gushed forth she shrieked then cursed what the flaming hell she wondered did how she dressed have to do with what she was able to accomplish as a cop anyway there was no question however that she would wear the skirt that had been dictated not only by the acting superintendents pointed suggestion but more by the fact that hadiyyah had gone to such an extreme to make it ready for her indeed what was also demanded of the morning was that barbara stop at the big house upon leaving her bungalow her purpose to show hadiyyah how she looked she had on the new bracelet and the blouse as well but shed eschewed the scarf too hot she reasoned shed save it for autumn azhar came to the door hadiyyah appeared behind him at once when she heard barbaras voice they both exclaimed over the dubious alteration in barbaras appearance you look lovely hadiyyah cried hands clasped beneath her chin as if to keep herself from bursting into applause dad doesnt barbara look lovely barbara said not exactly the word kiddo but thanks all the same hadiyyah is right azhar said all of it suits you barbara and shes got on makeup hadiyyah said see how shes got on makeup dad mummy always says makeups just to enhance what you got and barbaras used it just like mummy dont you think so dad indeed azhar put his arm round hadiyyahs shoulders youve both done very well khushi he told her barbara felt the pleasure of their compliments she knew they were due to kindness and friendship and nothing moreshe was not nor would she ever be a remotely attractive womanbut still she fancied that their gazes remained fixed on her as she went to the garden gate for the walk to her car once at work she put up with the hoots and goodnatured teasing of her colleagues she suffered their remarks in silence as she looked round for lynley and found him missing as was the acting superintendent she learned first thing that had happened that day hillier had demanded isabelle arderys presence in his office had lynley gone with her she asked the question of winston nkata she tried to make it casual but he wasnt deceived got to wait and see barb was how he put it anyting else you make yourself crazy she scowled she hated the fact that winston nkata knew her so well and she couldnt reckon how hed managed the accomplishment was she that bloody obvious about everything what else had nkata worked out she asked abruptly if anyone had gathered any useful information about zachary whiting was there anything besides the fact that he was once or twice too enthusiastic about being a cop whatever that meant when it was home for supper but there was nothing everyone was working on something else barbara sighed it seemed that if anything was to be dug out about anyone in hampshire she was going to have to do the digging this was down to what so had reported about the hairs found clasped in jemima hastings hand with oriental hairs on the body stacked alongside a murder weapon in the possession of a japanese violinist and the victims blood on his clothing and witnesses seeing him in the vicinity wearing that clothing on the day of her death it wasnt going to appear to be a matter of urgency to go digging deeper into the background of one marginally suspicious cop and this despite the discovery of a yellow bloodstained shirt in a recycling bin across the river in putney that had to mean something as did the presence of the victims handbag in that same bin barbara went for whiting first since someone had reported him being rather too enthusiastic with his work surely there were going to be records somewhere that further defined exactly what his enthusiasm had been about one merely had to follow the trail of whitings career to find someone willing to talk frankly about the bloke where for example had he been before lyndhurst he could hardly have spent his entire career climbing the ranks in a single station that just didnt happen the home office was going to be the likeliest source of information but excavating for it was not going to be quick or easy the hierarchy of the place constituted a labyrinth and it was peopled by the undersecretary the deputy undersecretaries the assistant undersecretaries and the assistant secretaries most of these individuals commanded their own staffs and these staffs manned all of the different departments that were responsible for policing in the country of all the departments the section that dealt with powers and procedure seemed the best option to barbara the question was whom did she ring pay a call upon invite out for a coffee armtwist bribe or beg that was a real problem because unlike other cops who cultivated connections the way farmers grow their crops barbara had never possessed the social skills to rub elbows with people who might later be useful to her but there had to be someone who did have those skills whod used them who could come up with a name she considered her colleagues lynley was the best possibility but he wasnt there philip hale was also likely but he remained at st thomas hospital under arderys orders ill conceived though they were john stewart was out of the question as he was the last person on the planet from whom barbara would ask a favour winston nkatas connections were street oriented as a result of the time hed spent as chief battle counsel for the brixton warriors this left the constables and the civilian staff which in turn left the most obvious person of all barbara wondered that she hadnt reckoned from the first that dorothea harriman could be of assistance in this matter she located the departmental secretary in the copy room where in lieu of copying she appeared to be applying nail enamel to her tights for some reason she was wearing one of her stylish pencil skirtsbarbara felt she was becoming something of an expert in the matter of skirtswhich was appropriate to her lanky figure and she had this hiked to the middle of her thighs as she used the nail polish against her tights dee barbara said harriman started oh my goodness she said what a fright detective sergeant havers for a moment barbara thought she was referring to her own appearance then she realised what harriman actually meant and she said sorry didnt mean to surprise you whatre you doing with that this harriman held up the bottle of nail enamel ladder she said and when barbara looked at her blankly on my tights it stops ladders from going further didnt you know barbara said hastily oh yeah ladders sorry dont know what i was thinking have a moment then well of course cn we since she was going her own way in matters barbara knew the wisdom of keeping this situation strictly entre nous she tilted her head towards the corridor and harriman followed her they went along it and into the stairwell barbara explained what she wanted a snout at the home office someone willing to do a little snoopandtalk about one chief superintendent zachary whiting of the hampshire constabulary she reckoned this potential snout had to be employed within the powers and procedures section of the home office because that was where information about criminal records regional crime squads detective work and complaints was housed she had a feeling that within one of those areas there was going to be some tiny detailpossibly something that might seem otherwise insignificant to a person not actually looking for itthat would put her on to what whiting was up to out in hampshire surely she said dorothea harriman knew someone who might be able to direct them to another someone who in turn could find a third someone harriman pursed her welldefined lips she fingered her scrupulously highlighted and fashionably cut hair she tapped her blusherenhanced cheek had they been in other circumstances barbara acknowledged that she might have asked the young woman for lessons in applying her makeup as she was definitely a practitioner of hadiyyahs mums philosophy of enhancement only as it was barbara could only note and admire as harriman considered the question she gazed at the soft drinks machine on the landing two floors below a door opened a voice spoke loudly about being served a plate of mash tasting like gravel in drying cement and footsteps came clomping up the stairs barbara grabbed harriman by the arm and pulled her back into the corridor and from there into the copying room again this evidently gave harriman time to consider all the various possibilities she no doubt had either in her rolodex or in her personal directory because when theyd sequestered themselves on the far side of the copier she said in a stage whisper there was a bloke whose sisters flatmate yeah barbara said i dated him briefly we met at a drinks party you know how it is barbara hadnt a clue how it was but she nodded helpfully cn you ring him see him whatever harriman tapped a fingernail against her teeth its a bit tricky he was rather keen and i wasnt if you know what i mean but she brightened let me see what i can do detective sergeant havers cn you do it now this is important isnt it dee barbara said fervently i cant even stress how important it is there had been no further avoiding a meeting with the assistant commissioner judi macintosh had phoned isabelle early enough in the morningand on her mobile at thatto make sir david hilliers wishes perfectly clear the acting detective superintendent was meant to come to sir davids office the moment she got to victoria street to make certain that isabelle understood the request was repeated when she reached her office it came this time in the person of dorothea harriman teetering into isabelles domain in what had to be fiveinchhigh heels bound to condemn her feet to podiatric surgery in later years he does say youre meant to go now dorothea explained apologetically would you like me to fetch you a coffee to take with acting detective superintendent ardery i dont ordinarily she added as if to clarify her duties but as its early and as you might want to fortify yourself since the assistant commissioner can be a bit overwhelming what she wanted to fortify herself with wasnt coffee but isabelle didnt intend to go that route instead she declined the offer stowed her belongings in her desk and made her way to hilliers office in tower block where judi macintosh greeted her sent her directly in to the assistant commissioner and told her that the head of the press office would be joining them this wasnt good news it meant further machinations were in the works further machinations meant isabelles position was even more tenuous than it had been on the previous day hillier was just finishing a phone call this consisted of im asking you to hold back on it for a few hours more till i get things sorted outthis isnt deal makingthere are points to clarify and im about to do soof course youll be the first to knowif you think this is the sort of call i actually like to makeyes yes all right with that he rang off he gestured to one of the two chairs in front of his desk isabelle sat and he did likewise which went a small distance towards reassuring her he said its time for you to tell me precisely what you knew in advance and i suggest you take care with your answer isabelle drew her eyebrows together she saw that on the assistant commissioners desk a tabloid and a broadsheet lay facedown and she determined the press had picked up on something that she hadnt revealed to hillier and deacon or something that she had not previously known and did not know now she realised she should have had a look at the morning papers prior to coming in to work if for no other reason than to prepare herself but shed not done so nor had she turned on the morning television news for the presenters usual report on the front pages of the papers she said im not sure what you mean sir even though she recognised that this was what he wanted her to say because it put him in a more powerful position where he liked to be she waited for what would come next she was fairly sure it would be the dramatic moment in which he flipped the papers right side up and so it was thus she saw in short order that zaynab bournes afternoon news conference the legs of which had been intended to be summarily amputated by the mets preemptive meeting with the media had instead attained such prominence in the news cycle that the mets conference might never have occurred zaynab bourne had managed this by releasing a piece of information that isabelle herself had not mentioned to either hillier or deacon during their meeting that yukio matsumoto was a longdiagnosed paranoid schizophrenic the mets withholding of this information constitutedin the words of the solicitoran obvious and disgraceful attempt at subreption for which they cannot and will not be held blameless isabelle didnt need to read the rest of the story to know that mrs bourne had asserted the investigating officers prior knowledge of yukio matsumotos condition revealed to them in a meeting theyd had with the violinists own brother in advance of setting off after him so now the police were in the position of not only chasing a man into the afternoon traffic of shaftesbury avenue which certainly could have been forgiven as an unfortunate but unavoidable circumstance brought about by an individuals attempting to evade a reasonable conversation with unarmed policemen but now of chasing a terrified psychiatric patient into said traffic a man who doubtless was in the midst of a psychotic episode that the police had already been told to anticipate by the mans own brother it did not help matters that the mans own brother was international virtuoso cellist hiro matsumoto isabelle considered her approach her palms were damp but the last thing she intended to do was to wipe them casually along her skirt should she do so she knew that hillier would see that her hands were shaking as well she schooled herself to relax what was called for here was a show of strength through a clear indication that she would not be cowed by tabloids broadsheets solicitors news conferences or hillier himself she looked at the assistant commissioner squarely and said the fact that yukio matsumoto is mental hardly matters as i see it sir hilliers skin went rosy isabelle continued confidently before he could speak his mental state didnt matter when he avoided our questions and it matters even less just now hilliers skin went rosier still isabelle plunged on she made her voice certain and she kept it cool cool would mean that she had no fear of the assistant commissioners disagreeing with her assessment of matters it would mean she believed that her assessment had been and was rock solid she said the moment matsumotos ready for an identity parade we have a witness wholl place him in the vicinity of the crime this is the very same witness who created the efit recognised by the mans own brother matsumoto was as you know in possession of the murder weapon and wearing bloodied clothes but what you might not yet know is that two hairs found in the hand of the victim have been identified as oriental in origin when dna tests are completed on them those hairs are going to belong to him he was acquainted with the victim shed lived in the same building as he and hes known to have followed her so frankly sir whether hes a mental case or not is incidental i didnt consider mentioning it when i met with you and mr deacon because in light of everything else we knew about the man the fact that he has a mental conditionwhich hasnt been attested to by anyone save his own brother and his brothers solicitor by the wayis a minor point if anything at all its yet another detail that weighs against him he wouldnt be the first untreated mental patient to murder someone in the midst of an episode of some sort and sad to say he wont be the last she stirred in her seat leaning forward and placing her arms along hilliers desk in a gesture to show that her assumption was that she was his equal and the two of themand by extension the metwere in this together now she said this is what i recommend incredulity hillier didnt reply at once isabelle could feel her heart beatingit was slamming reallyagainst her rib cage she reckoned it could have been seen in the pulse on her temples had she worn her hair differently and she knew it probably was evident on her neck but that too was somewhat out of hilliers view and as long as she said nothing more merely waiting for his reply obviously communicating to him nothing but confidence in the decisions shed madeshe merely needed to keep her eyes on his which were icy and rather soulless werent they and she hadnt actually noticed that before this moment incredulity hillier finally repeated his telephone rang he snatched it up listened for a moment and said tell him to hang on im nearly finished here then to isabelle go on with she made it sound as if she assumed hed followed her logic all surprise that he needed her to clarify his nostrils moved not a flare so much as a testing of the air for prey no doubt she held her ground he said with your point superintendent ardery just how do you see this playing out with our astonishment that someones mental conditionunfortunate though it may bewould ever trump the safety of the general public our officers went to the site unarmed the man in question panicked for reasons we havent yet ascertained in our possession is hard evidence most of which was gathered after the fact of his accident hillier noted which is beside the point of course the point being that we have our hands on a person of serious interest who can as the phrase goes help us with our inquiries in a fashion that no one else can what were looking for good people of the press ismight i remind youwhoever is responsible for the brutal murder of an innocent woman in a public park and if this gentleman can lead us to that party then thats what were going to demand he do the press will fill in the blanks the last thing theyll ask is the order in which events occurred evidence is evidence theyll want to know what it is not when we found it and even if they unearth the fact that we found it after the accident on shaftesbury avenue the point is the murder the park and our belief that the public might prefer we protect them from madmen wielding weapons rather than tiptoe round someone who might or might not be hearing beelzebub muttering in his ear hillier considered this isabelle considered hillier she wondered idly what hed received his knighthood for because it was odd that someone in his position would be given an honour that generally went to the higherups that hed been knighted spoke not so much of a service to the public heroically rendered but rather to hilliers knowing of people in high places and more important knowing how to use those people in high places he was thus not a man to cross but that was fine she didnt intend to cross him he said to her youre a wily one arent you isabelle ive not missed the fact that youve managed to swing this meeting your way i wouldnt in the least expect you to miss that fact isabelle said a man like you doesnt rise to the position you have because things get by him i quite understand that i quite admire it youre a political animal sir but so am i are you oh yes a moment passed between them during which they were locked in an assessing look it had about it the air of the distinctly sexual and isabelle allowed herself to imagine going at it with david hillier the two of them locked in an entirely different kind of combat on her bed she reckoned he imagined much the same when she was as certain of that as she could be she dropped her gaze she said i assume mr deacons waiting outside sir would you like me to stay for that meeting hillier didnt reply until she raised her eyes then he said slowly that wont be necessary she rose then ill get back to work if you want meher choice of verb was deliberatems macintosh has my mobile number as perhaps do you i do he said well speak again chapter twentyfive she went directly to the ladies the only problem was that she hadnt thought to bring her bag with her to hilliers office so at the moment she was without resources and she was left relying on what was available which was water from the tap this was hardly an efficacious substance for what ailed her but she used it for want of anything else on her face her hands her wrists thus she felt little improved when she left tower block and made her way back to her office she heard her name called by dorothea harrimanwho for some reason seemed incapable of referring to her in any terms briefer than acting detective superintendent arderybut this she ignored she closed her office door and went directly to her desk where shed left her bag upon opening it she discovered in short order that she had three messages on her mobile phone she ignored them as well she thought yes yes yes as she brought forth one of her airline bottles of vodka in her rush to have it she dropped the bottle onto the lino floor she scrambled on her knees beneath her desk to fetch it and she downed it as she rose to her feet it wasnt enough of course she emptied her bag on the floor to find the other she downed this and went for the third one she deserved it shed survived an encounter that by all rights she shouldnt have survived at all shed avoided the participation of stephenson deacon and the directorate of public affairs in that encounter shed argued her case and shed won if only for the moment and because it was only for the moment she bloody well needed a drink she bloody well deserved one and if there was anyone between here and hell who didnt understand that acting detective superintendent ardery isabelle spun towards the door she knew of course whod be standing there what she didnt know was how long shed been there or what shed seen she snapped dont you ever come into this office without knocking dorothea harriman looked startled i did knock twice and did you hear me reply no but i then do not enter do you understand that if you ever do that again isabelle heard her own voice to her horror she sounded like a termagant she realised she still had the third airline bottle in her hand and she closed her fingers round it in a concealing fist she drew a breath harriman said detective inspector hales rung from st thomas hospital maam her tone was formal and polite she was as ever the consummate professional and her being so at such a moment as this reduced isabelle to feeling like a scrofulous cow im sorry to disturb harriman said but hes phoned twice i did tell him you were with the assistant commissioner but he said it was urgent and youd want to know and to tell you the moment you returned to your office he said hed rung your mobile but couldnt reach you id left it here in my bag whats happened isabelle said yukio matsumotos conscious the detective inspector said you were meant to know the moment you returned when isabelle arrived the first person she saw was di philip hale who she mistakenly presumed was pacing down the pavement to meet her as things turned out however he was instead on his way back to the yard having reached the infuriating conclusion that hed followed her orders sufficiently by remaining at the hospital until their principal suspect had regained consciousness whereupon hed made the call to inform her he had gone on he told her to bring in two uniformed constables to stand guard at matsumotos doorway now he was heading to the incident room to get back to the checks he and his constables had been making on inspector hale isabelle interrupted him i tell you what youll be doing you do not tell me are we clear on that hale frowned what what do you mean by what youre not a stupid man are you you certainly dont look stupid are you stupid look guv i was you were at this hospital and here at this hospital you shall remain until ordered otherwise youll be at the doorway to matsumotos roomseated or standing and i dont care which youll be holding the patients hand if necessary but what you wont be doing is going off on your own and ringing up constables to take your place until youre directed otherwise youre here is that clear due respect guv this isnt the best use of my time let me point something out to you philip were where we are at this precise moment because of your earlier decision to confront matsumoto when you were told to keep your distance from the man thats not what happened and now she went on despite being told to remain here at the hospital youve taken it upon yourself to arrange for your own replacement is this not true philip he shifted his weight it is in part and which part isnt i didnt confront him at covent garden guv i didnt say a word to the bloke i may have got too close to him i may havewhatever but i didnt were you told to approach him to get close to the man to breathe the same air in his vicinity i think not you were told to find him report back and keep him in sight in other words you were told to keep your distance which you did not do and now here we are where we are because you took a decision you werent meant to take just as youre doing now so get back into that hospital get back to matsumotos doorway and until you hear otherwise from me remain there am i being clear as shed been speaking shed watched the muscle in hales jaw jumping he didnt reply and she barked inspector im asking you a question to which he finally said as you wish guv at that she went towards the hospital entrance and he followed as she preferred him to follow several paces behind her she wondered at the fact of these detectives under her command all wanting to go their own way in the investigation and what this said about the leadership provided first by the former superintendent malcolm webberly and by everyone subsequent to him including thomas lynley discipline was called for but having to administer that in the midst of everything else going on was particularly maddening changes were going to have to be made with this lot there was no question about that as she reached the door with hale as her shadow a taxi arrived hiro matsumoto stepped out a woman in his company this was thank god not his solicitor but a japanese woman close to his own age the third matsumoto sibling isabelle concluded miyoshi matsumoto the philadelphia flautist she was correct she paused jerking her thumb at the door for hale to go ahead into the hospital she waited till matsumoto had paid for the taxi whereupon he introduced her to his sister she had arrived from america on the previous evening he said she had not yet seen yukio but theyd had word this morning from yukios doctors yes isabelle said hes conscious and i must speak with him mr matsumoto not without his attorney it was miyoshi matsumoto who replied and her tone was nothing like her brothers obviously shed been in big city america long enough to know that lawyerup was rule number one when dealing with the police force hiro call mrs bourne right now and to isabelle keep away i dont want you near yukio isabelle wasnt unaware of the irony of being told exactly what she herself had told philip hale in the moments leading up to yukio matsumotos flight she said ms matsumoto i know youre upset youve got that much right and i dont disagree that this is a mess thats what you call it but what i ask you to see get away from me miyoshi matsumoto pushed past isabelle and stalked towards the hospital doors hiro call that lawyer call someone keep her out of here she went within leaving isabelle outside with hiro matsumoto he looked at the ground his arms crossed on his chest she said to him please intercede he seemed to consider her request and isabelle felt momentarily hopeful until he said this is something i cant do miyoshi feels much as i do which is he looked up behind his gleaming spectacles his eyes looked bleak responsible he said you didnt do this not for what happened he said but for what didnt happen he nodded at isabelle and moved towards the hospital doors she followed him at first then walked at his side they entered the hospital and began to make their way to yukio matsumotos room isabelle said no one could have anticipated this ive been reassured by my officer on the scene that he didnt approach your brother that instead yukio saw something or heard something or perhaps felt somethingwe cant even work out which it wasand he simply bolted as youve said yourself superintendent thats not what i mean matsumoto paused round them people went on their way visitors bearing flowers and balloons to loved ones members of the hospitals staff striding purposefully from one corridor to another above their heads the public address system asked dr marie lincoln to report to the operating theatre and next to them pardon was requested by two orderlies whisking a patient somewhere on a trolley matsumoto seemed to take all of this in before he went on we did what we could for yukio for many years miyoshi and i but it was not enough we had our own careers and it was easier to let him drift so that we could pursue our music with yukio to concern ourselves with to weigh us down he shook his head how could we have climbed so far miyoshi and i and now this how could we have sunk so low i am most deeply shamed youve no need to be isabelle told him if hes sick as you say and without medication if hes got a mental condition that caused him to do something you bear absolutely no responsibility hed walked on as she was speaking and hed rung for the lift and then faced her when the doors opened in near silence he turned and she followed him inside he said to her quietly again you misunderstand me superintendent my brother did not kill that poor woman there is an explanation for everything for the blood on him for thatthat thing you found in his lodgings then for gods sake let him give me the explanation isabelle said let him tell me what he did do what he knows what actually happened you can be present right at his bedside your sister can be present im not in uniform he wont know who i am and you dont need to tell him if you think hell panic you can speak to him in japanese if that would make it easier for him yukio speaks perfect english superintendent then speak to him in english or japanese or both i dont care if as you say hes guilty of nothing but being in the cemetery then he may have seen something that can help us find jemima hastings killer they reached the floor hed rung for and the doors slid open in the corridor isabelle stopped him a final time she said his name in such a way that even she could hear the desperation in her voice and when he looked at her gravely she went on to say were in a time crunch here we cant wait for zaynab bourne to show up if we do wait you and i both know shes not going to let me speak to yukio which means if as you say hes guilty of nothing more than being in abney park cemetery when jemima hastings was attacked and murdered he himself could well be in danger because the killer will know from every newspaper in town that yukio is a person of interest because he was there and if he was there he likely saw something and hes likely to tell us which he wont be able to do if your solicitor shows up she was more than desperate at this point she realised she was verging on babbling and it made no difference to her what she said or whether she believed what she saidwhich she didnt actuallybecause the only thing that mattered just then was bending the cellists will to hers she waited she prayed her mobile phone rang and she ignored it finally hiro matsumoto said let me speak to miyoshi and he went to do so barbara discovered that dorothea harriman had hidden talents from harrimans appearance and demeanor shed always reckoned that the departmental secretary had no real trouble pulling men and this was of course true what she hadnt known was the length of time harriman evidently managed to linger in the memories of her victims and to produce within them a willingness to cooperate with anything she desired within ninety minutes of barbaras making the request dorothea was back with a slip of paper fluttering from her fingers this was their in at the home office the flatmate of the sister of the bloke who was apparently still lost within dorotheas thrall the flatmate was a minor cog in the welloiled machine that was the home office her name was stephanie thompsonsmythe andthis is whats truly excellent dorothea breathedshe was dating a bloke who apparently had access to whatever codes keys or magical words were necessary to create an open sesame situation with an individual policemans employment records i had to tell her about the case dorothea confessed she was barbara found rather full of her success and desirous of waxing eloquent on the topic which barbara reckoned she owed her so she listened cooperatively and waited for the slip of paper to be handed over well of course she knew about it she reads the papers so i told herwell i had to bend the truth just a bit naturallythat a trail seems to be leading to the home office which of course made her think that perhaps the guilty party is there somewhere and being protected by one of the higherups rather like jack the ripper or something anyway i told her that anything she could help us out with would be brilliant and i swore her name wouldnt come up at all anywhere but i told her she would be doing an heroic service to help us out even in the smallest way she seemed to like that wicked barbara indicated the slip of paper dorothea still held and she said shed phone her boyfriend and she did and youre to meet them both at the suffragette scroll indorothea glanced at her wristwatch which like the rest of her was slender and goldtwenty minutes she sounded quite triumphant her first venture into the underworld of snouts and blackguards a rousing success she handed over the slip of paper at last which turned out to be the mobile phone number of the boyfriend of the flatmate this was dorothea told her just in case something happened and they failed to show in her words you barbara told her are a marvel dorothea blushed i do think i carried things off rather well better than that barbara told her ill head over there now if anyone asks im on a mission of grave importance for the superintendent what if the superintendent asks dorothea said shes only gone over to st thomas hospital shell be back eventually youll think of something barbara told her as she grabbed her disreputable shoulder bag she headed off to meet her potential home office snout the suffragette scroll was no great distance either from the home office or from new scotland yard a monument to that eponymous movement of the early twentieth century it stood at the northwest corner of the green that comprised the intersection of broadway and victoria street the journey was a fiveminute walk for barbaraincluding her wait for the lift inside victoria blockso she had adequate time to fortify herself with nicotine and to lay her plans before two individuals came strolling hand in hand towards her doing their best to look like lovers having a bit of a walk on the green in their break from the daily grind one was stephanie thompsonsmythesteph ts as she introduced herselfand the other was norman wright the thinness of whose bridge of nose spoke of serious inbreeding among his forebears he could have sliced bread with the top of his proboscis norman and stephanie ts looked round like agents from mi stephanie said to her man you talk ill watch and retreated to a bench some distance away barbara thought this was a good idea the fewer people involved the better it was norman said to her what dyou think of the scroll he gazed upon it intently and spoke from the side of his mouth from this barbara took it that they were to play at being admirers of mrs pankhurst and her fellows which was fine by her she walked round the scroll gazing up at it and murmuring to norman about what she needed and hoped to attain from their acquaintance brief though it might likely be whitings his name she concluded zachary whiting chapter and verse is what i need theres got to be something somewhere in his records that looks ordinary but isnt norman nodded he pulled at his nose which gave barbara a chill as to the damage this might do to the delicate thing and he considered her words he said so youll want the lot eh that could be difficult i send it online and i leave a trail were going to have to be antique in our methods barbara told him careful and antique he looked at her blankly clearly a child of the electronic age his eyes narrowed as he thought about this antique he asked a photocopier ah he said and if theres nothing to copy most of this is stored on computer a printer then someone elses printer someone elses computer there are ways norman and youve got to find one were talking life and death a female corpse up in stoke newington and something rotten in denmark norman said yes i see barbara wondered what the hell he was talking about but she twigged it before she made a fool of herself and asked what denmark had to do with the price of salami she said ah very good too bloody right thing to remember is that what looks ordinary might not be ordinary this blokes managed to get as far as chief superintendent in the hampshire constabulary so were not likely to stumble on smoking guns something subtle yes of course so barbara asked him he would see what he could do norman told her meantime did they need a code word perhaps a signal some way for him to tell her that he had the goods for her without phoning new scotland yard and if he was to make copies of anything where would the drop be located obviously barbara thought hed been reading far too much early john le carré she decided she would have to play along the drop barbara told him sotto voce would be at the cashpoint machine in front of barclays in victoria street he would ring her personal mobile phone and say drinks tonight luv and she would know to meet him in that spot she would stand behind him in line he would leave the goods at the cashpoint machine when he withdrew money or at least pretended to withdraw money she would then pick it up with her own cash when she used the machine not the most sophisticated system she knew considering all the cctv cameras that would be documenting every movement in the vicinity but it couldnt be helped norman said right then and waited for her to hand over her mobile number they parted barbara said to his retreating back soon norman life and death was his reply god she thought the lengths she went to in the cause of finding a killer she returned to victoria block back in the incident room there was some serious milling about going on she learned this had to do with a report from so that had just come in the blood sprayed on the yellow shirt from the oxfam bin did indeed belong to jemima hastings well barbara thought they had reckoned as much she approached the china board with its array of photos its scrawled information its names listed and its timelines drawn she hadnt had a good look at it since being recalled from hampshire and among other things up there was a decent photo of the yellow shirt it might tell her something she thought she wondered how whiting looked in yellow but it was not the shirt that caught her attention as things turned out it was another photograph altogether she looked upon the picture of the murder weapon of the ruler placed next to it to indicate its size when she saw it she spun round from the photo to seek out nkata from across the room he glanced up at that moment a phone pressed to his ear and he obviously clocked her expression because he said a few more words to whoever was on the other end of the line before ringing off and coming to join her she said winnie and pointed to the picture she didnt need to say more she heard him breathe out in a whistle so she knew he was thinking what she was thinking the only question was whether his conclusion was the same she said weve got to get back to hampshire he said barb dont argue barb we been ordered back we cant head off like were in charge here phone her then shes got her mobile we cn ring down there we cn tell th cops to ring where hampshire with whiting in charge winnie good god dyou think that makes sense he looked at the photo of the weapon then at the photo of the yellow shirt barbara knew he was thinking of the politics behind what she was proposing and in his hesitation she had her answer to the question concerning on what side of the line winnie would always walk she couldnt blame him her own career was so chequered that a few more black marks hardly mattered his career was not she said all right ill phone the guv but then im going its the only way to her relief isabelle ardery discovered that hiro matsumoto did have some influence over his sister after some conversation in their brothers hospital room miyoshi matsumoto emerged and told isabelle she could speak to yukio but if her younger brother became upset either by isabelles questions or her presence the interview would end at once and shenot isabellewould be the one to determine how upset might manifest itself isabelle had no choice but to agree to miyoshis rules she fished her mobile out of her bag and switched it off she wanted to take no chances that anything external to her own questions might disturb the violinist yukios head was bandaged and he was hooked up to various machines and iv drips but he was conscious and he seemed to be taking some comfort from the presence of his two siblings hiro had positioned himself near his brothers shoulder where hed laid his hand miyoshi took a place on the other side of the bed she fussed maternally with the neck of his hospital gown as well as with the thin blanket that covered him she eyed isabelle suspiciously she said youve the time it will take mrs bourne to arrive that isabelle saw had been the compromise the siblings had reached hiro had phoned the solicitor in exchange for his sisters agreeing to allow isabelle a few minutes access to their brother she said very well and she studied the violinist he was smaller than hed seemed in flight he looked far more vulnerable than she would have expected she said to him mr matsumotoyukio im detective superintendent ardery i need to speak with you but youre not to worry what were saying herein this roomis not being recorded or documented your brother and sister are here to make sure i dont upset you and you can be assured that upsetting you is the least of my intentions do you understand me yukio nodded although his gaze fluttered over to his brother first there was isabelle saw only a faint resemblance although hiro matsumoto was the elder he looked years younger when i went to your lodgings in charing cross road isabelle told yukio i found a piece of iron pointed like a spike on the edge of the basin it had blood on it and that blood turned out to belong to a woman called jemima hastings do you know how that spike got there yukio yukio didnt respond at first isabelle wondered if he would at all shed never before confronted a paranoid schizophrenic so she had no idea what to expect when he finally spoke he indicated his neck in the approximate location of the wound to jemima hastings i pulled it out he said the spike isabelle clarified you pulled the spike from jemimas neck he said tore the spike tore her skin made the wound worse is that what youre saying it certainly matched the condition of her body isabelle thought dont direct him to say what you want him to say miyoshi matsumoto said sharply if youre going to ask my brother questions hes going to answer them in his own way yukio said lifes fountain came forth like god telling moses to tap upon stone from the stone comes water to soothe their thirst the water is a river and the river turns to blood jemimas blood isabelle asked you got it on your clothing when you removed the spike it was everywhere he closed his eyes his sister said thats enough to isabelle are you mad was what isabelle wanted to reply hardly the question to ask the sister of a paranoid schizophrenic shed heard virtually nothing from the man and certainly not a single word that could be used in court or used even to press charges against him or against anyone shed be laughed off the force if she even tried she said why were you there in the cemetery on that day still with his eyes closedand god only knew what he was seeing behind his lidsyukio said it was the choice they gave me to guard or to fight i chose to guard but they wanted something else so you fought did you have a fight with jemima thats not what hes saying miyoshi said he didnt fight with that woman he tried to save her hiro shes trying to bend his words im trying to learn what happened that day isabelle told her if you cant see that then try bending the conversation in another direction miyoshi snapped and then to her brother with her hand stroking his forehead yukio were you there to protect that woman in the cemetery is that why you were there when she was attacked did you try to save her is that what youre saying yukio opened his eyes he looked at his sister but didnt seem to see her he said and for the first time his voice was quite clear i watched her can you tell me what you saw miyoshi asked him it came out haltingly and half of it was obscured by what isabelle assumed were either biblical references or products of his fevered mind he spoke of jemima in the clearing where the cemeterys chapel stood she sat on a bench read a book used her mobile phone ultimately she was joined by a man sunglasses and a baseball cap constituted the limit of the description that yukio matsumoto provided which could have applied to one quarter of the male population of the country if not the world it telegraphed disguise so loudly and clearly that isabelle thought yukio matsumoto was either manufacturing it on the spot or they had an imagecompletely uselessof their killer at last she wasnt sure which but then things got dicey this man had a conversation with jemima upon the stone bench where jemima sat yukio had no idea how long the conversation lasted but when it ended the man left and when he left jemima hastings was decidedly still alive she used her mobile again once twice three times five hundred times yukio didnt know but then she took a call after that she walked to the side of the chapel and out of his range of vision and then isabelle asked nothing at least not at first not for some minutes then a man appeared from that same side of the ruined chapel a man in black god why were they always in black isabelle wondered who carried a rucksack and who made for the trees away from the chapel out of sight altogether yukio waited then but jemima hastings did not return to the chapel clearing so he went to look for her and that was how he discovered what he had not seen before that there was a tiny building abutting the chapel in this building jemima lay wounded her hands scrabbling round her throat which was how he saw the spike he thought she was trying to pull it out and so he helped her and thus isabelle thought the river of blood from her artery which had already spurted out upon the yellow shirt worn by her killer began to pulse out with every beat of her heart nothing yukio could have done would have saved her not with a wound like that exacerbated when hed removed the spike if she thought he was to be believed and she had a terrible feeling that he was indeed one man in sunglasses and a baseball cap the other in black they would need to try to get efits of both of them and isabelle prayed only that this could be managed before zaynab bourne got there and threw a spanner in everything chapter twentysix robbie hastings had encountered no difficulty when he went to the lyndhurst police station his thought had been to insist on quick action but that wasnt necessary as it turned out upon identifying himself hed been escorted into the chief superintendents office where zachary whiting had offered him midmorning coffee and heard him out with not a single interruption as rob spoke whiting frowned in concern but the frown turned out to be about robs upset rather than about the questions he was asking or the demands for action he was making at the conclusion of robs recitation of concerns whiting had said good god its all in hand mr hastings you should have been informed of this and i cant think why you werent rob wondered what was in hand and this he asked adding that there were train tickets there was a hotel receipt he knew that these had been given to whiting and what had whiting done about them what had he done about jossie as a matter of fact again whiting reassured him what he meant when he said that things were in hand was that everything hewhitingknew everything he had been told and everything that had been handed to him was now in the possession of the scotland yard detectives whod come down to hampshire in connection with the london murder enquiry that meant the tickets and the hotel receipt as well whiting told him they were likely in london at this point as hed sent them up by special messenger mr hastings wasnt to worry about that if gordon jossie had perpetrated this crime against mr hastingss sister if rob had said then mr hastings could expect scotland yard to come calling again in very short order i dont understand why the london police and not you lot here whiting held up his hand he said it was a complicated matter because more than one police jurisdiction was involved as to why it was scotland yard looking into matters and not the locals from where mr hastings sister had been killed he couldnt say that was likely due to some political situation up in london but what whiting could say was that the reason the hampshire constabulary was not handling the case had to do with this being a killing that had not occurred in hampshire in the first place the hampshire police would cooperate and were cooperating fully with london naturally that meant handing over whatever they had or were given or what they learned and once again he wanted to assure mr hastings that this had been done and was continuing to be done jossie admits to being in london rob told whiting again i spoke to him myself the bastard admits it and that too would be transmitted to the london police there would be someone brought to justice mr hastings that was likely to happen in very short order whiting personally ushered rob to the reception area at the end of their meeting he introduced him along the way to the duty press officer to the sergeant in charge of the custody suite and to two special constables who liaised with the community in reception whiting informed the special on duty that until an arrest had been made in the london murder of jemima hastings whenever her brother needed to see the chief superintendent he was to be given access rob appreciated all of this it went a great way towards soothing his mind he returned to his home and hooked up the horse trailer with frank as his companionhead hanging out of the window tongue and ears flappinghe trundled from burley along the lanes to sway and from there to gordon jossies holding the narrowness of the roads and the fact of the horse trailer made the going slow but it was of no account he didnt expect gordon jossie to be on the property at this time of day that turned out to be the case when rob reversed up the cottage drive and positioned the horse trailer near the paddock that contained the two ponies from the minstead area no one came out of the cottage to stop him the absence of jossies golden retriever told him as well that no one was home he let frank out of the land rover to have a run but told the weimaraner to keep his distance when he brought the ponies from the paddock as if he understood this perfectly frank headed in the direction of the barn snuffling along the ground as he went the ponies werent as skittish as some within the perambulation so it wasnt difficult to get them into the horse trailer this went some way towards explaining how jossie had managed them when he brought them here as unlike rob he wasnt an experienced horseman it did not however explain what jossie was doing with the two ponies in the first place so far from where they normally grazed and belonging to someone else he would have seen how their tails were clipped so even had he mistaken them for his own ponies upon a glance a closer look would have told him they were from another area keeping them on his holding when they werent his responsibility and longer than they clearly needed to be there was an expense any other commoner would have avoided rob couldnt reckon why gordon jossie had taken it on when he had them ready for transport rob returned to the paddock to close its gate there he noticed what he might have noticed on earlier visits to the holding had he not been first consumed with concerns about his sister and then later taken up by considerations ranging from gina dickens presence to that of the ponies jossie he saw had been putting some work into the paddock the gate was relatively new a number of the fence posts were new and the barbed wire strung between them was new as well the freshness of all this however comprised only one part of the paddock the rest had yet to be seen to indeed the rest was something of a ruin with posts atilt and areas overgrown with weeds this gave him pause it wasnt he knew unusual for a commoner to make improvements upon his holding this was generally necessary it was however odd that someone like jossiecharacterised by the nearly compulsive care with which he did everything elsewould have left a job such as this one unfinished he went back inside the inclosure for a closer look rob recalled gina dickens desire for a garden and for a moment he wondered if she and jossie had taken the unlikely decision to have that garden here if gordon intended to build another paddock somewhere else for ponies it would explain why the thatcher had gone no further with his scheme to improve this one as a holding pen for stock on the other hand discontinuing this paddocks use as a holding pen would mean moving the heavy granite trough to another location a task requiring the sort of equipment gordon didnt possess rob frowned at this the trough suddenly seemed to him very much like the presence of the ponies unnecessary for hadnt there been a trough here already within the paddock surely there had he looked for it it didnt take long he found the old trough in the unrestored section of the paddock heavily overgrown with brambles vines and weeds it stood some distance from the water source which made the new trough not altogether unreasonable as it could be more easily reached by hosepipe still it was strange that gordon would go to the expense of a new trough without having uncovered the old one he had to have suspected it was there it was a curiosity rob intended to have a word with gordon jossie about it he returned to his vehicle and murmured to the ponies moving restlessly within the trailer he called to frank the dog came running and they set off to the northernmost part of the perambulation it took nearly an hour to get there even keeping to the main roads rob was stymied in his progress by a train stopped on the railway tracks in brockenhurst blocking the crossing and then again by a tour coach with a flat tyre that caused a tailback on the south side of lyndhurst when he finally got beyond it and into lyndhurst itself the restiveness of the animals in the trailer told him that taking them up to minstead was a bad idea as a result he veered onto the bournemouth road and made for bank beyond it and along a sheltered lane stood the tiny enclave of gritnam a circle of backtoback gardenless cottages facing outward onto the lawns the trees and the streams that comprised the expanse of gritnam wood the lane itself went no farther than gritnam so there was likely no safer place in the new forest to release ponies that had too long been kept in gordon jossies paddock rob parked in the middle of the lane that encircled the cottages as the place was so tiny there was no other spot to leave a vehicle there amid a silence broken only by the call of chaffinches and the trill of wrens he eased the ponies out into freedom once more two children emerged from one of the cottages to watch him at work but long schooled in the ways of the new forest they did not approach only when the ponies were making their way towards a stream that gleamed some distance into the trees did either child speak and then it was to say we got kittens here if you want to see em we got six mum says were meant to give em way rob went over to where the two children stood barefoot and freckled in the summer heat a boy and girl each of them held a kitten in arms whyve you got the ponies the boy asked he seemed to be the elder of the two by several years his sister watched him adoringly she put rob in mind of the way jemima had once watched him she put rob in mind of how hed failed her he was about to explain what he was doing with the ponies when his mobile rang it was on the seat of his land rover but he could hear it clearly he set off to take the call heard the news all of the agisters dreaded hearing and swore when he was given it for the second time in a week a new forest pony had been hit by a motorist robs services were wanted in the manner in which he least wished to give them the animal was going to have to be killed the worry meredith powell felt had grown to fullblown anxiety by the morning all of it had to do with gina theyd shared the double bed in merediths bedroom and gina had asked in the darkness if meredith didnt mind holding her hand till she went to sleep shed said i know its ridiculous to ask but i think it might soothe me a bit and meredith had told her yes of course she didnt even need to explain and shed covered ginas hand with her own and ginas hand had turned and clasped hers and there their hands had lain for hours upon hours on the mattress between them gina had fallen asleep quicklywhich of course made perfect sense as the poor girl was exhausted by what shed gone through at gordon jossies cottagebut her sleep was light and fitful and every time meredith had tried to ease her hand away from ginas ginas fingers tightened she gave a small whimper and merediths heart had gone out to her again so in the darkness shed thought about what to do about ginas situation for gina had to be protected from gordon and meredith knew that she herself might be the only person willing to protect her asking for police participation in the matter was out of the question chief superintendent whiting and his relationship with gordonwhatever it wasput paid to that and even if that were not the situation the police werent about to deploy their resources upon the protection of a single individual based on the strength of her bruises truth was that cops wanted a lot more than a few bruises before they did anything they generally wanted a court order an injunction filed charges made and the like and meredith had a very good feeling that gina dickens was too frightened to apply herself to any of this anyway she could be urged to remain at merediths house but that could hardly go on indefinitely while it was true that no one was more accommodating than merediths own parents it was also true that they were already sheltering meredith and her daughter and anyway since meredith had impulsively come up with the gas leak tale to explain ginas presence her mum and dad would assume the gas leak would be fixed within twentyfour hours that being the case gina would be expected to return to her bedsit above the mad hatter tea rooms this of course was the worst place for her because gordon jossie knew where to find her so an alternative needed to be developed and by morning meredith had an idea what that alternative might be rob hastings will protect you she told gina over breakfast once we tell him what gordon did to you hell certainly help robs never liked him hes got rooms in his house that no ones using and hell offer one without our even asking gina hadnt eaten much merely picking at a bowl of grapefruit segments and taking one bite of a piece of dry toast she was silent for a moment before she said you must have been a very good friend to jemima meredith that was hardly the case since she hadnt been able to talk jemima out of taking up with gordon and look what had happened meredith was about to say this but gina went on she said i need to go back to your bedsit bad idea you cant put yourself where he knows where to find you hell never think you might be at robs its the safest place but surprisingly gina had said not the bedsit i must go back to gordons ive had the night to sleep on it and ive thought about what happened i can see how i was the one to provoke no no no meredith cried for this was how abused women always acted given time to think what they generally ended up thinking was that they were at fault somehow provoking their men to do what theyd done to hurt them they ended up telling themselves that if theyd only kept their mouths shut or acted compliant or said something different fists would never have been swung in their direction meredith had tried her best to explain this to gina but gina had been obdurate shed said to meredith in reply i know all that meredith ive got my degree in sociology but this is different thats also what they always say meredith had cut in i know trust me i do know but you cant think id let him hurt me again and the truth is she looked away from meredith as if gathering the courage to admit the worst i do honestly love him meredith was aghast her face must have shown it because gina went on to say i just cant think at the end of the day that he hurt jemima hes not that kind of man he went to london he lied about going he lied to you to scotland yard as well why would he lie if he didnt have a reason to be lying and he lied to you from the very first about going there he said it was holland he said it was to buy reeds you told me that and you must see what it means gina let meredith have her entire say in the matter before she herself drew the conversation to its conclusion she said he knew id be upset if he told me hed gone to see jemima he knew id be a bit unreasonable which is what ive been which is certainly what i was last night look youve been good to me youve been the best friend i have in the new forest but i love him and i must see if theres a chance he and i can make things work hes under terrible stress right now because of jemima hes reacted badly but ive not reacted well either i cant throw it all away because he did something that hurt me a bit he may have hurt you meredith cried but he killed jemima gina said firmly i dont believe that there was no more talking to her about the matter meredith discovered there was only her intention to return to gordon jossie to give things another try in the fashion of abused women everywhere this was bad but what was worse was that meredith had no choice she had to let her go still worry over gina dickens dominated most of her morning she had no creative energy to apply to her work for gerber hudson and when a phone call came into the office for her she was happy enough to have to use her elevenses in a dash over to the office of michele daugherty whod made that call and said to her got something for you have you time to meet meredith purchased a takeaway orange juice and drank it on her route to the private investigators office shed nearly forgotten that shed hired michele daugherty so much having happened since shed asked her to look into gina dickens the investigator was on the phone when she arrived at long last michele daugherty called her into her office where a reassuring stack of papers seemed to indicate shed been hard at work on the brief that meredith had given her the investigator wasted no time with social preliminaries there is no gina dickens she said are you sure youve got the right name the right spelling at first meredith didnt understand what the investigator meant so she said this is someone i know ms daugherty shes not just a name i heard mentioned in a pub or something shes actuallyratherwell shes rather a friend michele daugherty didnt question why meredith was having a friend investigated she merely said be that as it may theres no gina dickens that i can find therere dickenses aplenty but no one called gina in her age range or in any other age range if it comes down to it she went on to explain that shed tried every possible spelling and variation of the given name considering that gina was likely a nickname or an abbreviated form of a longer name shed gone into her databases with gina jean janine regina virginia georgina marjorina angelina jacquelina gianna eugenia and evangelina she said i could go on like this indefinitely but i expect youd rather not pay for that at the end of the day when things go in this direction i tell my clients its safe to say that there is no person by that name less shes managed to slip through the system without having left a mark on it anywhere which isnt possible she is a brit isnt she no doubt of that chance she might be a foreigner aussie new zealander canadian of course shes british i spent last night with her for heavens sake as if that meant anything meredith thought as soon as she said it shes been living with a man called gordon jossie but she has a bedsit in lyndhurst above the mad hatter tea rooms tell me how you searched tell me where you looked where i always look where any investigator including the police would look my dear people leave records they leave trails without knowing birth education health credit history financial dealings throughout their lives parking tickets the ownership of anything that might have required financing or provided a guarantee or warranty and thus needed to be registered magazine subscriptions newspaper subscriptions phone bills water bills electricity bills one searches through all this what exactly are you saying then meredith was feeling quite numb im saying that there is no gina dickens full stop its impossible not to leave a trail no matter who you are or where you live so if a person doesnt leave a trail its fairly safe to conclude she isnt who she says she is and there you have it so who is she meredith considered the possibilities what is she ive no idea but the facts suggest shes someone very different from whoever it is shes pretending to be meredith stared at the investigator she didnt want to understand but the fact was that she was understanding all of it too terribly well she said numbly gordon jossie then jossie what about gordon jossie start on him gordon had to return to his holding for a load of turkish reeds these had been held for inspection at the port for a maddening length of time a circumstance that had considerably slowed his progress on the roof of the royal oak pub it seemed to gordon that the terrorist attacks of recent years had resulted in all port authorities believing there were muslim extremists hidden within every crate on every ship that docked in england they were especially suspicious of items having their provenance in countries with which they were not personally familiar that reeds actually grew in turkey was a piece of information most port officials did not possess so those reeds had to be examined at excruciating length and if such examination ate up a week or two there was not much he could do about it it was yet another reason to try to get the reeds from the netherlands gordon thought at least holland was a familiar place in the eyes of the hopeless blokes who were assigned the duty of inspecting that which was shipped into the country when he and cliff coward returned to his holding for the delivery of the reeds he saw at once that rob hastings had made good on his word the two ponies were gone from the paddock he wasnt sure what he was going to do about this but then perhaps he thought wearily there was nothing to be done things being the way they were at the moment this was something that cliff had wanted to discuss seeing ginas car gone from the vicinity of gordons house cliff asked about her not where she was but how she was the same hows our gina then that he asked nearly every day cliff had been quite taken with gina from the first gordon had told him the truth gone was how he put it cliff repeated the word dumbly as if the term were slow to sink into his head when it got to his brain he said what shes left you to which gordon replied thats how it works cliff this prompted a lengthy discourse from cliff on the subject of what kind of shelf lifeas he put itgirls like gina generally had you got six days or less to get her back man cliff informed him you think blokesre going to let a girl like gina walk round the streets without trying it on ring her up say sorry get her back say sorry even if you didnt do nothing to make her leave say anything just do something nothing to be done gordon told him youre off your nut cliff decided so when gina actually showed up while they were loading reeds into the back of gordons pickup cliff made himself scarce from the elevated bed of the truck he saw her red mini cooper coming along the lane said give you twenty minutes to sort this one gordon and then he was gone heading in the direction of the barn gordon walked towards the end of the driveway so when gina drove in he was in the vicinity of the front garden at heart he knew that cliff was right she was the kind of woman blokes lined up to have the slightest chance of winning over and he was a fool if he didnt try to get her back she braked when she saw him the car roof was down and her hair was windblown from the drive he wanted to touch it because he knew how it would feel so soft against his hands he approached the car can we talk she was wearing her sunglasses against the brightness of another fine summer day but she shoved them to the top of her head her eyes he saw were red rimmed he was the one whod brought this on her crying it was another burden yet another failure to be the man he wanted to be please can we talk he repeated she looked at him warily she pressed her lips together and he could see her bite down on them not as if she wanted to keep herself from speaking but as if she feared what might happen if she did speak he reached for the handle of the door and she flinched slightly he said oh gina he took a step back in order to allow her to decide when she opened the door he felt he could breathe again he said cn we lets sit over here over here was the garden shed made so lovely for them with the table and chairs the torches and the candles over here was where theyd had their suppers in the fine weather of the summer amid the flowers shed planted and painstakingly watered he walked to the table and waited for her he watched her but said nothing she had to make the decision on her own he prayed shed make the one that would give them a future she got out of the car she glanced at his pickup at the reeds he was loading into it at the paddock beyond it he saw her draw her eyebrows together she said whats happened to the horses he said theyre gone when she looked at him her expression told him she thought hed done this for her because she was afraid of the animals part of him wanted to tell her the truth that rob hastings had taken them because gordon hadnt the needlet alone the rightto hang on to them but the other part of him saw how he could use the moment to win her and he wanted to win her so he let her believe whatever she wanted to believe about the ponies removal she came to join him in the garden they were separated from the lane by the hedge they were also sequestered from cliff cowards curious eyes by the cottage that stood between the front garden and the barn they could speak here and not be heard or seen this went some distance towards making gordon easier although it seemed to have the opposite effect on gina who looked round shivered as if with cold and clasped her arms to her body whatve you done to yourself he asked her for he saw deep bruises upon her arms ugly marks that made him move towards her gina whats happened she looked down at her arms as if shed forgotten she said dully i hit myself what did you say she said have you never wanted to hurt yourself because nothing you do ever seems to come out right what how did you i pounded she said when it wasnt enough i used shed not been looking at him but now she did and he saw her eyes were full you used something to hurt yourself with gina he took a step towards her she backed away he felt struck he said why did you do this a tear spilled over she wiped it away with the back of her hand im so ashamed she said i did it for a horrible moment he thought she meant that shed killed jemima but she clarified with i took those tickets that hotel receipt i found them and i took them and i was the one who gave them toim so sorry she began to weep in earnest then and he went to her he drew her into his arms and she allowed this and because she allowed it he felt his heart open to her as it had not ever opened to anyone even to jemima he said i shouldnt have lied to you i shouldnt have said i was going to holland i should have told you from the first that i was seeing jemima but i thought i couldnt why she clenched her fist against his chest what did you think why dont you trust me everything i told you about seeing jemima was true i swear to god i saw her but she was alive when i left her we didnt part well but we didnt part in anger then what gina waited for his answer and he struggled to give it with his body his soul and his very life hanging in the balance of whatever words he chose he swallowed and she said what on earth are you so afraid of gordon he put his hands on either side of her lovely face he said youre only my second he bent to kiss her and she allowed this her mouth opened to him and she accepted his tongue and her hands went to the back of his neck and held him to her so the kiss went on and on and on he felt enflamed and henot shewas the one to break off he was breathing so hard that he might have been running only jemima and you no one else he said oh gordon she said come back to me what you saw in methat angerthe fear shh she murmured she touched his face with those fingers of hers and where she touched he felt his skin take fire you make it all disappear he said come back gina i swear i will chapter twentyseven lynley took the first of the phone calls on his mobile as he left sheldon pockworth numismatics heading for his car on his way to the british museum it was from philip hale initially his message was positive yukio matsumoto he reported was conscious and isabelle ardery was interviewing him in the presence of his brother and sister however there was something more and as hale was the last of the detectives ever to raise a protest in the midst of an investigation when he did so lynley knew the situation was serious ardery was ordering him to stay at the hospital when he could better be used elsewhere he told lynley hed tried to explain to her that guarding the suspect was something better left to constables so that he could return to more useful occupation but she wouldnt hear of it he said he was a team player as much as anyone tommy but there came a time when someone had to protest obviously ardery was a micromanager and she was never going to trust her murder squad to take any initiative she was philip lynley cut in hang on i cant do anything about this its just not on you can talk to her hale replied if youre showing her the ropes like she claimed you are then show her that one can you see webberlyor yourselfor even john stewart and god knows johns obsessive enough come on tommy shes got a lot on her plate you cant tell me she wont listen to you ive seen how sheoh hell seen how she what she got you to come back to work we all know that theres a reason for it and likely its personal so use the reason theres no personal tommy for gods sake dont play at being blind when no one else is lynley didnt reply for a moment he considered what had passed between himself and ardery how things looked and what they were he finally said hed see what he could do although he reckoned it would be little enough he phoned the acting superintendent but arderys mobile went immediately to her voice message he asked her to ring him and he kept onward to his car she wasnt his responsibility he thought if she asked his advice he could certainly give it but the point was to let her sink or swim without his interference no matter what anyone else wanted from him in what other way could she show that she was up to the job he made his way over to bloomsbury the second call on his mobile came while he was stuck in traffic in the vicinity of green park station this time it was winston nkata ringing him barb havers he said in best barb fashion was on her way to defying the superintendents instructions that she remain in london she was he went on driving down to hampshire he had not been able to talk her out of it you know barb was how winston put it shell listen to you man nkata said cos she bloody well int listening to me christ lynley muttered shes a maddening woman whats she up to then the weapon nkata said she recognised it what dyou mean she knows who it belongs to she knows what it is so do i we dint see the picture of it till today dint have a look at the china board before this morning and what it is narrows the field to hampshire its not like you to keep me in suspense winston called a crook nkata told him we saw em by the crate in hampshire when we talked to that bloke ringo heath the master thatcher thas the bloke crookss whats used to hold reeds in place when youre putting them on a roof not exactly something wed be used to seeing in london eh but in hampshire any place they got thatched roofs and thatchers youre goin to see crooks jossie lynley said or hastings cos thesere made by hand crooks that is hastings why then lynley remembered he trained as a blacksmith and blacksmithsre the ones who make the crooks each one makes em different see they end up like fingerprints lynley concluded thas about it whichs why barbs heading down there she said shed ring ardery first but you know barb so i thought you mightyou know barbll listen to you like i said she wasnt having anything off me lynley cursed beneath his breath he rang off traffic began moving so he continued on his way determined to track down havers via mobile as soon as he could he hadnt managed this when his mobile rang again this time it was ardery whereve you got with the coin dealer she asked he briefed her telling her he was on his way to the british museum she said excellent its a motive isnt it and weve found no coin among her things so someone took it off her at some point were getting somewhere at last good she went on to tell him what yukio matsumoto had informed her there had been two men in the vicinity of the chapel in abney park cemetery not just one indeed there had been three if they wanted to include matsumoto himself were working with him on an efit his solicitor showed up while i was talking to him and we had something of a settogod that womans like a pit bullbut shes on board for the next two hours as long as the met admits culpability in yukios accident lynley drew in a sharp breath isabelle hilliers never going to go for that this isabelle said is more important than hillier it would lynley thought be a very snowy day in hell before david hillier saw things that way before he could tell the acting superintendent as much however she had rung off he sighed hale havers nkata and ardery where to begin he chose the british museum there at last he tracked down a woman called honor robayo who had the powerful build of an olympic swimmer and the handshake of a successful politician she said frankly and with an appealing grin never thought id be talking to a cop read masses of mysteries and detective novels i do who dyou reckon youre more like then rebus or morse i have a fatal proclivity for vintage vehicles lynley admitted morse it is robayo crossed her arms on her chest high up as if her biceps wouldnt allow her arms to get closer to her body so what cn i do for you then inspector lynley he told her why hed come to talk to the curator about a coin from the time of antoninus pius this coin would be an aureus he said got one you want to show me she asked i was hoping for the opposite he replied and could ms robayo tell him what such a coin might be worth id heard between five hundred and a thousand pounds lynley said would you agree lets just have a quick look she took him to her office where amid books magazines and documents on her desk she also kept her computer it was a small matter to access a site on which coins were sold and a smaller matter to find on this site an aureus from the time of antoninus pius offered for bidding on the open market the amount being asked was given in dollars three thousand six hundred more than dugué had thought likely not a huge sum but a sum to kill for possibly do coins like these need a provenance lynley asked well theyre not like art are they no ones going to care whos owned it in the past unless i suppose it was some nazi who took it off a jewish family the real questions about it will circle round its authenticity and its material meaning she indicated the computer screen on which the aureus for sale was pictured its either an aureus or its not an aureus its pure gold or not and thats not something thatd be tough to sort out as to its ageis it really from the period of antoninus piusi suppose someone could fake one but any coin expert would be able to spot that besides theres the question of why one would go to all the trouble of faking a coin like this i mean were not talking about faking a newly discovered painting by rembrandt or van gogh you cn imagine what something like that would be worth if someone could pull the wool successfully tens of millions eh but a coin one would have to ask if thirtysix hundred dollars makes it worth the effort over time however you mean if someone had faked a lorry load of coins to sell in dribs and drabs possibly i spose may i have a look at one lynley asked aside from on the computer screen i mean dyou have any here in the museum they did indeed honor robayo told him if hed follow her theyd have to toddle over to the collection itself but it wasnt far and she expected lynley would find it interesting she led him back through time and place in the museumancient iran turkey mesopotamiauntil they got to the roman collection lynley had been here but not in years hed forgotten the extent of the treasure mildenhall hoxne thetford they were called the hoards because that was how they had each been found as a hoard hidden through burial during the time of the romans occupation of britain things hadnt always gone swimmingly for the romans as they attempted to subdue the people whom theyd come to rule since those people hadnt generally taken well to being vanquished rebellions occurred during these intermittent periods of revolt roman riches were concealed to keep them safe sometimes the owners of these riches were unable to return for them so they remained buried for centuries in sealed jars in wooden cases lined with straw in whatever was available at the time this had been the case for the mildenhall hoxne and thetford hoards which comprised the main treasures that had been found buried for more than one thousand years each had been unearthed during the twentieth century and they included everything from coins to vessels from body ornaments to religious plaques there were minor treasure hoards in the collection as well each representing a different area of britain where the romans had settled the most recently discovered was the hoxne hoard lynley saw which had been uncovered in suffolk on county council land in the discoverera bloke called eric laweshad miraculously left the treasure exactly where and as it lay and had phoned the authorities at once out they came to scoop up more than fifteen thousand gold and silver coins silver tableware and gold jewellery in the form of necklaces bracelets and rings it was a sensational find its value lynley reckoned was incalculable much to his credit lynley murmured hmm honor robayo said the fact that mr lawes turned it in the treasure and this gentleman who found it well of course she said but really less to his credit than you might think she and lynley were standing in front of one of the cases that contained the hoxne hoard where a reconstruction of the chest in which the hoard had been buried was rendered in acrylic she moved from this across the room to the immense silver platters and trays from the mildenhall hoard she leaned against the case and said remember this bloke eric lawes was out there looking for metal objects anyway and as thats what he was doing in the first place he likely wouldve known the law course the laws been changed round a bit since this hoard was found but at the time a hoard like hoxne wouldve become the property of the crown doesnt that indicate hed have had a motive to hang on to it lynley asked she shrugged whats he supposed to do with it especially when the law said a museum could purchase it from the crownat fair market value mind youand whoever found it would get that money as a reward thats some considerable dosh ah lynley said so someone would be motivated to hand it over not to hang on to it right and now he smiled feeling rather foolish for the last question he said forgive me i probably ought to know the law about this as a policeman bah was her reply i doubt you come across many cases of people unearthing treasures in your particular line of work anyway the laws not much changed finder has fourteen days to report the treasureif he knows its a treasureto the local coroner he actually could be prosecuted if he doesnt ring up the coroner as a matter of fact local coroner hang on lynley said what dyou mean if he knows its a treasure well thats the thing about the law you see it defines what a treasure is one coin fr instance does not a treasure make if you know what i mean two coins however and youre on shaky ground if you dont get on the phone and let the proper authorities know so that they can do what lynley asked on the off chance that all youve found is two coins and not twenty thousand so that they can bring out an archaeological team and dig the hell out of your property i expect honor robayo said which to be frank most people dont mind because they end up with fair market value for the treasure if a museum wants to buy it right and if no one does if the crown claims it thats another interesting bit about the change in law the crown can only put its mitts on treasures from the duchy of cornwall and the duchy of lancaster as to the rest of the country while its not exactly a case of finders keeperslosers weepers the finder will end up with a reward when the treasure is finally sold and if the treasure is anything like thesewith a nod at the cases of silver and gold and jewellery in room you can lay good odds on the reward being hefty so what youre saying lynley said is that the finder of something like this has absolutely no motivation for keeping the news to himself or to herself none at all of course i spose he could hide it under his bed and bring it out at night and run his hands through it gleefully for all thats going to get him sort of a silas marner kind of thing if you know what i mean but at the end of the day most peopled prefer the cash i expect and if all thats been found is a single coin oh he can keep that which bring us toover here weve got the aureus you were looking for it was inside one of the smaller cases one in which various coins were displayed and identified the aureus in question looked no different from the one hed seen on the screen of james dugués computer at sheldon pockworth numismatics a short time earlier lynley gazed at it willing the coin to tell him something about jemima hastings whod supposedly had it in her possession at some point if as honor robayo had so colourfully indicated one coin did not a treasure make then there was every chance that jemima had possessed it merely as a memento or a good luck charm that she was considering selling perhaps to help her with her finances in london once she came to live in town she would have needed to know what it was worth first there was nothing unreasonable about that but part of what shed told the coin dealer had been a lie her father hadnt died recently from havers report on the matter as he recalled jemimas father had been dead for years did that lie matter lynley didnt know but he did need to talk to havers he moved away from the case containing the aureus thanking honor robayo for her time she seemed to think shed disappointed him in some way because she apologised and said well anyway i do wish there was somethinghave i helped at all again he didnt really know it was certain that he had more information than hed had earlier in the day but as to how it reflected a motive for killing jemima hastings he frowned the thetford treasure caught his attention theyd not looked so closely at that one because it comprised not coins but rather tableware and jewellery the former was mostly done in silver the latter was gold he went for a look it was the jewellery that interested him rings buckles pendants bracelets and necklaces the romans had known how to adorn themselves theyd done so with precious and semiprecious stones for the larger pieces along with some of the rings contained garnets amethysts and emeralds among these nestled one stone in particular reddish in colour it was he could see at once a carnelian but what caught his eye was not so much the stones presence among the others but what had been done with it venus cupid and the armour of mars were engraved upon it according to the description given and it was in short nearly identical to the stone that had been found on jemimas body lynley swung round to look at honor robayo she raised an eyebrow as if to say what is it he said not two coins but a coin and a gemstone together do we have a treasure something that has to be reported to that local coroner you were mentioning a moment ago something governed by the law she considered this scratching her head i spose that could be argued but you could equally argue that someone who happens to find two superficially unrelated objects might merely clean them up set them aside and not think about them in relation to the law i mean how many people out there actually know this law find a treasure like the hoxne hoard and youre highly likely to make a few enquiries as to what youre supposed to do next right find a single coin and a stoneboth of which probably needed massive cleaning mind youand why would you jump to the phone over that i mean its not like newsreaders are announcing on the telly once a week that their viewers must ring up the coroner on the off chance that theyve unearthed a treasure chest while theyre planting their tulips besides people think of coroners and death dont they not coroners and treasure hoards yet according to law two items constitute treasure dont they wellright they do yes it was little enough lynley thought and honor robayo could certainly have sounded more robust in her agreement but at least it was something if not a torch then at least a match and as he knew a match was better than nothing when one was wandering in the dark barbara havers had stopped for both petrol and sustenance when her mobile rang otherwise she would have religiously ignored it as it was shed just pulled into the vast car park of a services area and she was striding towards the little cheffirst things first shed told herself and first things meant a decent fryup to see her through the rest of the daywhen she heard peggy sue emanating from her shoulder bag she rooted out the mobile to see that di lynley was ringing her she took the call as she marched towards the promise of food and airconditioning where are you sergeant lynley asked without preamble his tone told her that someone had sneaked on her and it could only have been winston nkata since no one else knew what she was up to and winnie was nothing if not scrupulous about obeying orders no matter how maddening they were winnie in fact even obeyed nonorders he anticipated orders damn the man she said about to sink my teeth into a major food group thats been dipped into batter and thoroughly fried and let me tell you i dont much care which food group it is at this point peckish doesnt begin to describe if you know what i mean where are you havers lynley said you didnt answer my question please do so she sighed im at a little chef sir ah centre for all thats nutritious and where might this particular branch of that fine eating establishment be well let me see she considered how to dress up the information but she knew it was useless to make it sound like anything other than what it was so she finally said along the m where along the m sergeant reluctantly she gave him the nearest exit number and does superintendent ardery know where you happen to be going she didnt reply this was she knew a rhetorical question she waited for what was coming next barbara is professional suicide really your intention lynley enquired politely i rang her sir did you it went to her voice mail i told her i was on to something what else was i supposed to do perhaps what you were meant to be doing in london thats hardly the point look sir did winnie tell you about the crook its a thatching tool and he did indeed tell me and your intention in heading off to hampshire is what exactly well its obvious isnt it jossies got thatching tools ringo heaths got thatching tools rob hastings likely once made thatching tools whichre probably lying round his barn then theres the bloke that works with jossiecliff cowardwho could put his mitts on a thatching tool and theres that cop whiting as well because somethings not right with him in case youre about to tell me i shouldve rung up the lyndhurst station and given him the news about the crook ive got a snout at the home office by the way looking into whiting which is more than you were able to do she wanted to say but did not if she thought lynley would be impressed with the leaps and bounds she was making while hed been swanning round london doing whatever isabelle ardery had asked him to do she was proven wrong almost at once he said barbara i want you to stay where you are she said what sir listen to me you cant take matters into my own hands thats what youre going to say isnt it well i wouldnt have to if the superintendentthe acting superintendent mind youhad something other than tunnel vision shes dead wrong about that japanese bloke and you know it and she knows it now as well he told her what ardery had managed to get from her interview with yukio matsumoto barbara said two men in the cemetery with her aside from matsumoto bloody hell sir dont you see that one of themand possibly both of themcame up from hampshire i dont disagree in the least lynley told her but youve only got one part of this puzzle under your pillow and you know as well as i that if you play that part too soon youve lost the game barbara smiled then in spite of herself are you aware of how many metaphors you just mixed she could hear the smile in his own voice when he said call it the passion of the moment it prevents me from thinking cleverly why whats going on she listened then to what he had to say about roman treasure hoards about the british museum about the law about finders of treasures and what they were owed when he was finished she whistled and said brilliant whiting must know this he has to whiting lynley sounded incredulous barbara no listen someone unearths a treasure jossie lets say in fact its got to be jossie he doesnt know what to do so he rings the coppers who else to ring if you dont know the law eh word gets up the food chain at the lyndhurst station to whiting and bobs your uncle out he trots he lays eyes on the booty he sees what the future could hold for him if he manages to claim it as his owncops pensions being what they areand then what lynley demanded he scarpers up to london and kills jemima hastings might i ask why cause hes got to kill anyone who knows about the treasure and if she went to see this sheldon mockworth bloke pockworth lynley said sheldon pockworth and he doesnt exist thats just the name of the shop whatever she goes to see him she verifies what the coin is she knows theres morelots more piles of moreand now she knows its the real thing vast amounts of lolly all waiting to be scooped up and whiting bloody knows it as well barbara was building a real head of steam on the topic they were so close to cracking what was going on she could feel her entire body tingling with the knowledge lynley said patiently barbara are you at all aware of how much youre actually ignoring with all this like what just to begin why did jemima hastings abruptly leave hampshire in the first place if there was a vast treasure of roman coins sitting there waiting for her to share in it why after she identified the coinmonths and months ago by the waydid she apparently do nothing more about it why if the man she lived with in hampshire had dug up an entire roman treasure did she never mention the slightest thing about this to anyone including mind you a psychic whom she apparently visited numerous times to ask about her love life instead theres an explanation for gods bloody sake all right do you have it i damn well would if you what if you would work with me that was the answer but barbara couldnt bring herself to say it because of what the declaration implied he knew her well though far too well he said in that most reasonable tone of his listen barbara will you wait for me will you stay where you are i can be there in less than an hour you were about to have a meal have it then wait will you do that much she thought about this even though she knew what her answer would be he was after all still her longtime partner he was after all still and always lynley she sighed all right ill wait she told him have you had lunch shll i order you a fryup good god no he replied lynley knew that the last thing barbara havers was was a woman given to cooling her heels merely because shed agreed to hold off momentarily on a course of action she was determined to take so he was unsurprised when he walked into the little chef some ninety minutes laterfrustratingly delayed by a burst water main in south londonto discover that she was burning up minutes on her mobile phone the remains of her meal lay before her in typical havers fashion it was a veritable monument to arterial blockage to her credit at least a few of the chips remained uneaten but the presence of a bottle of malt vinegar told him that the rest of the meal had likely consistedas shed promisedof cod deep fried and sealed in copious amounts of batter shed followed this up with sticky toffee pudding it seemed he looked at all this and then at her she was incorrigible she nodded a hello as he examined the plastic chair opposite her for the remains of a previous diners meal finding it free of grease and food scraps he sat she said now thats interesting to whoever was the recipient of her phone call and when she had at last ended the conversation she jotted a few lines in her tattered spiral notebook she said to lynley something to eat im thinking of giving it up entirely she grinned my dining habits inspire you that much do they sir havers he replied solemnly believe me words fail she chuckled and rooted out her cigarettes from her shoulder bag she would know of course that smoking was forbidden inside the eatery he waited to see if she would light up anyway and wait to be thrown out of the place she did not instead she set the players to one side and did some further excavation which produced a roll of polos she dislodged one for herself and offered him another he demurred bit more on whiting she told him with a nod at her mobile on the table between them and oh i definitely think were heading where we need to be heading when it comes to that bloke just you wait heard from ardery yet dwe have an efit from matsumoto on either of the blokes he saw in the cemetery i think thats in hand but i havent heard well i cn tell you if one of thems a ringer for jossie then the other will be whitings identical twin if its not whiting himself and what are you basing this inference upon that was ringo heath i was talking to you know the bloke under whom gordon jossie learned his trade yes i know who he is right well seems our ringos had more than one visit from chief superintendent whiting over the years and the first of them came before gordon jossie ever signed on as ringos apprentice lynley considered what havers was saying to him she was sounding rather more triumphant than the information seemed to call for he replied with and this is important because because of what he wanted to know when he first came to see him did ringo heath take on apprentices and by the way what was mr heaths familial situation meaning did he have a wife kids dogs cats mynah birds the whole cricket match two weeks laterprhaps three or four but who knows as it was a long time ago he saysalong comes this bloke gordon jossie with it turns out and we bloody well know this phony letters from winchester technical college two in hand so ringowhos already told whiting he takes on apprentices rememberhires our gordon and that shouldve been that i take it that that wasnt that too bloody right on the odd occasion whiting shows up sometimes he runs into ringo at his local even which you can bet isnt whitings local he makes enquiries casual ones theyre in the nature of howstheworkcomingalongmyfriend but ringo isnt exactly dead between the ears is he so he reckons this has to do with more than just a friendly enquiry from one of the local rozzers as he hoists a pint sides who likes to have the local rozzers being friendly thatd make me dead nervous and im one of them she drew in a breath it seemed to lynley the first time shed done so clearly she was heading for the peroration of her remarks because she said now like i told you ive got a snout in place at the home office looking into our zachary whiting meantime theres the thatching crook to be dealt with none of the principles in londonre going to have got their mitts on a thatching tool hang on lynley said why not that stopped her in her tracks she said what dyou mean why not you cant expect these things to be growing in flower beds havers this particular tool was old and rusty lynley said what does that suggest to you that it was old and rusty left lying about taken from an old roof discarded in a barn what else is it supposed to mean sold in a london market by a dealer in tools no bloody way why not you know as well as i do that there are antique markets in every part of town from formal markets to casual affairs set up on sunday afternoons if we come down to it theres a market right inside covent garden where one of the suspectsyou do remember paolo di fazio dont youactually has a stall the crime was committed in london not hampshire and it stands to reason no bloody way havers voice was loud several diners in the little chef glanced in their direction she saw them do so and said sorry to lynley adding in a hiss sir sir you cant be telling me that the use of a thatching tool to kill jemima hastings was an absolute and completely incredible coincidence you cant you just cant be saying that our killer conveniently picked out something to do away with her and that something just happened to be one of the very same somethings that gordon jossie uses in his work that horse wont run once round the track and you bloody well know it im not saying that then what what he considered this perhaps it was used to frame gordon jossie can we believe that jemima never told a soul in london about the man she left behind in hampshire about the fact that her former lover was a master thatcher once jossie came looking for her once he began putting up those cards with his phone number on them round the streets doesnt it stand to reason that she would have told someonepaolo di fazio jayson druthers frazer chaplin abbott langer yolanda bella mchaggissomeonewho this person was what would she have told them havers said okay my exboyfriend prhaps ill give you that but my exboyfriend the thatcher why would she tell someone he was a thatcher why wouldnt she havers threw herself back in her seat shed been leaning forward intent upon making her every point but now she observed him round them the noise of the little chef rose and fell when havers finally spoke again lynley was unprepared for the direction she took she said its ardery isnt it sir whats ardery what are you talking about you know bloody well youre talking like this because of her because she thinks thiss a london situation it is a london situation havers i hardly need remind you that the crime was committed in london right excellent bloody brilliant of you you dont need to remind me and i dont think i need to remind you that we arent living in the age of transportation by horseback you seem to think that no one from hampshireand for that you cn read jossie or whiting or hastings or father bleeding christmascouldve got up to london in any number of ways done the deed and then gone home father christmas hardly comes from hampshire lynley said dryly you know damn well what im talking about havers listen dont be what absurd thats the word youd use isnt it but at the end of the day the real issue here is youre protecting her and we both know it although only one of us knows why youre doing it thats outrageous and untrue lynley replied and might i add although its never stopped you before now youre out of order dont you bloody pull rank on me barbara told him from the first shes wanted to think this is a london case she had it that way when she decided matsumoto did it and shell have it that way once she gets an efit off him just you wait for that meantime hampshires crawling with nasties that no ones beginning to want to look at for the love of god barbara she sent you to hampshire and she ordered me back before i was finished webberly wouldve never done that you wouldnt have done it even that wanker stewart wouldnt ever have done it shes wrong wrong wrong and havers stopped abruptly she seemed to have run out of steam she said i need a fag and she grabbed up her belongings she strode towards the doors of the place he followed her weaving between the tables of onlookers whod become understandably curious about what was going on between them lynley thought he knew it was a logical leap that havers was making it was just the wrong one outside she was striding towards her car on the far side of the car park in the direction of the petrol pumps he was parked nearer the little chef than she so he got into the healey elliott and drove after her he came up alongside her she was smoking furiously muttering to herself she tossed a glance his way and increased her speed he said havers get in id rather walk dont be stupid get in thats an order i dont obey orders you will now sergeant and then seeing her face and reading the pain that he knew was at the heart of why she was acting as she was he said barbara please get into the car she stared at him he stared at her finally she tossed away her cigarette and climbed into the car he said nothing until hed driven across the car park to the only spot of shade available provided by an enormous lorry the driver of which was likely inside the little chef as they themselves had just been havers groused this car mustve cost you a mint whys it not got airconditioning for gods bloody sake it was built in barbara stupid excuse she didnt look at him nor did she look straight ahead of them into the shrubbery beyond which the m offered a broken view of traffic whizzing towards the south instead she looked out of her side window offering him the sight of the back of her head youve got to stop cutting your own hair he told her shut up she said quietly you sound like her a moment passed he raised his head and looked at the pristine ceiling of the car he thought about praying for guidance but he didnt really need it he knew what had to be said between them yet it constituted the great unmentionable that had been governing his life for months he didnt want to mention it he just wanted to get on he said quietly she was the light barbara that was the most extraordinary thing about her she had thisthis ability that was simply at the core of who she was it wasnt that she made light of thingssituations people you know what i meanbut that she was able to bring light with her to uplift merely by virtue of who she was i saw her do this time and again with simon with her sisters with her parents and then of course with me havers cleared her throat still she did not look at him he said barbara do you believedo you honestly believethat i could walk away from that so easily that so desperate to get out of the wilderness because i admit i am desperate to get out of it i would take any route that appeared before me do you believe that she didnt reply but her head lowered he heard a small sound emanate from her and he knew what it meant god how he knew he said let it go barbara stop worrying so learn to trust me because if you dont how will i learn to trust myself she began to weep in earnest then and lynley knew what her show of emotion was costing her he said nothing else for there was indeed nothing more to say moments passed before she turned to him and then it was to say i dont have a damn tissue she began to scramble round her seat as if looking for something he fished out his handkerchief and handed it over she used it saying ta trust you to have the linen ready the curse of my upbringing he told her its even ironed i noticed she said i expect you didnt iron it though god no figures you dont even know how well i admit that ironing isnt among my talents but i expect if i knew where the iron was kept in my housewhich thank god i donti could put it to use on something simple like a handkerchief mind you anything more complicated would completely defeat me she chuckled wearily she leaned back in the seat and shook her head then she seemed to examine the car itself the healey elliott was a saloon with room for four and she squirmed round for a look in the back she noted thiss the first time ive been in your new motor the first of many i hope as long as you dont smoke wouldnt dare but i cant promise i wont eat nice bit of fish and chips to make the insides smell sweet you know what i mean whats this then up for some light reading she fished something from the backseat and brought it to the front it was he saw the copy of hello hed had from deborah st james havers looked from it to him and cocked her head checking up on the social scene are you not what id expect you to do less you take this with you when you go for your manicures you know something to read while the nails are being buffed its deborahs he said i wanted to have a look at the photos from the portrait gallery opening and lots of people holding champagne glasses and looking well turned out thats about it ah not my crowd then havers opened the magazine and began flipping through it she found the appropriate set of pages where the photos of the portrait competitions opening show were spread out right she said not a hoisted pint anywhere mores the pity cause a decent ales better than some thimbleful of champagne any day of the her hand tightened on the magazine she said holy hell and she turned to him what is it lynley asked frazer chaplin was there havers said and in the picture was he then lynley remembered how in person frazer had seemed so familiar to him that was it then hed obviously seen the irishman in one of the pictures of the gallery opening forgetting about it later lynley glanced at the magazine and saw that havers was indeed indicating a photo of frazer hed been the swarthy man in the picture of sidney st james more evidence he was involved with jemima lynley said no matter that hes posing with sidney no no havers said frazers not the point its her her sidney not sidney her havers pointed to the rest of the crowd and specifically to another woman this one young blond and very attractive some socialite he reckoned the wife or daughter of a gallery sponsor likely but havers disabused him of that notion when next she spoke its gina dickens inspector she said and she added unnecessarily because at that point he knew quite well who gina dickens was she lives in hampshire with gordon jossie much has been made not only of the british criminal justice system but also of the trial that followed the boys confessions words such as barbaric byzantine archaic and inhuman have been used and commentators around the globe have taken strong positions on both sides of the matter some of them passionately arguing that inhumanity no matter its source should be met with like inhumanity invoking hammurabi and others of them just as passionately contending that nothing is served by the public pillorying of children and indeed further damage is done to them what remains is this singular fact governed by a law that makes children responsible for their behaviour at the age of ten in the case of capital crimes michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker had to be tried as adults thus they faced trial by judge and jury what is also worthy of note is that when a serious crime has been committed by children they are forbidden by law to have any therapeutic access to psychiatrists or psychologists prior to trial while such professionals are tangentially involved in the developing proceedings against children their examination of the accused is strictly limited to determining two things whether the child in question wasat the time of the crimecapable of distinguishing between right and wrong and whether such child was responsible for his acts six child psychiatrists and three psychologists examined the boys interestingly they reached identical conclusions michael spargo ian barker and reggie arnold were of average to aboveaverage intelligence they were fully cognizant of the difference between right and wrong they were well aware of the notion of personal responsibility despite or perhaps because of their attempts to blame each other for john dressers torture and death in the climate that surrounded the investigation into john dressers abduction and murder what other conclusions could have been drawn as has already been noted blood will have blood yet the sheer enormity of what was done to john dresser begged for a disinterested approach from all parties involved in the investigation the arrest and the trial without that kind of approach in these matters we are doomed to cling to our ignorance believing that the torture and murder of children by children is somehow normal when no rational mind would accept this as the case we do not need to forgive the crime nor do we need to excuse it but we do need to see the reason for it so as to prevent its ever occurring again yet whatever the true cause was that lay at the root of the three boys heinous behaviour that day it was not presented at their trial because it did not need to be presented the polices function was not to delve into the psychological makeup of the boys once they were arrested rather their function was to make that arrest and to organise the evidence the witnesses statements and the boys confessions for the prosecution for their part the prosecutions function was to obtain a conviction and because any therapeutic psychological or psychiatric attention to the boys prior to their trial was forbidden by law whatever defence could be mounted on their behalf had to rely upon their counsels attempts to shift blame from one boy on to another or to chip away at what testimony and evidence the cps presented to the jury in the end of course none of this mattered the preponderance of evidence against the three boys made the outcome of their trial ineluctable abused children carry abuse forward through time this is the unthinkable gift that keeps on giving study after study underscores this conclusion yet that salient piece of information was not part of the trial of reggie arnold michael spargo and ian barker it could not have been based not only on criminal law but also on the thirst we might call it blood thirst for some form of justice to be handed down someone had to pay for what had happened to little john dresser the trial established guilt beyond any doubt it was up to the judge to determine punishment unlike many more socially advanced countries in which children accused of crimes are remanded into the custody of their parents foster parents or some sort of care pending what is usually a hearing held in camera child criminals in the uk are placed in secure units designed to house them prior to facing a court of law during their trial the three boys daily came and went from three separate secure unitsin three armed vans that had to be protected from surging crowds waiting for them at the royal court of justiceand while court was in session they sat in the company of their individual social workers inside a dock designed especially for them and built so that they could see over the side in order to watch the proceedings they were well behaved throughout although occasionally restless reggie arnold had been given a colouring book with which to entertain himself during tedious moments the other boys had pads of paper and pencils ian barker was stoic throughout the first week but by the end of the second week he continually looked around the courtroom as if seeking his mother or grandmother michael spargo spoke frequently to his social worker who often had her arm around him and who allowed him to rest his head on her shoulder reggie arnold cried frequently as testimony was given members of the jury observed the accused sworn to do their duty they could not have helped wondering what exactly their duty was in the situation they faced the verdict of guilty took only four hours the decision on punishment would take two weeks chapter twentyeight the pony lay thrashing on the ground on mill lane which was just outside burley it writhed on the ground with both of its back legs broken desperately attempting to rise and run from the group of people who gathered at the rear end of the car that had hit it every few moments it shrieked horribly as it arched its back and flailed its legs robbie hastings pulled over to the narrow bit of verge he told frank to stay and he got out of the vehicle and into the noise pony conversation cries as he approached the scene one of the group broke away and strode to meet him a man in jeans wellingtons and tshirt the jeans were worn and stained brown at the knees rob recognised him from his occasional nights at the queens head billy rodin he was called and he worked as a fulltime gardener at one of the large homes along the road rob didnt know which one american billy winced at the noise from the stallion and jerked his thumb at the rest of the group there were four of them two middleaged couples one of the women was crying and the other had turned her back on the scene and was biting her hand got confused is what happened wrong side of the road bout it yeah car coming towardsm too fast round that curve billy gestured the way rob himself had come startled them they veered right instead of left and then tried to correct and the stallion was there wanted to give em a piece of my mind but lookit em eh wheres the other vehicle just kept going number plates didnt get em i was over there billy pointed towards one of the many brick walls on the lane this one some fifty yards away rob nodded and went to look at the stallion the pony screamed one of the two american men came towards him he wore dark glasses and a golf shirt with a logo bermuda shorts and sandals he said god damn im sorry cn i help you get him into the trailer or something rob said eh the trailer maybe if we support his rump rob realised that the man actually thought hed brought the horse trailer for this poor creature on the ground in front of them perhaps to drive him to some veterinary surgery he shook his head got to destroy him we cant theres no vet around oh shit oh damn did that guy tell you what happened there was this other car and i totally blew it because he told me rob squatted to take a closer look at the pony whose eyes were rolling and from whose mouth a froth was issuing he hated the fact that it was one of the stallions he recognised this one since he and three others had only been moved into robs area to service the mares this past year a strong young bay with a blaze on his forehead he should have lived more than twenty years listen do we have to stay while you the man asked i only want to know because cath is upset enough and if she has to watch you kill that horseshes a real animal person this pretty much ruins our vacation anywaynot to mention the front end of the carand we only got to england three days ago go into the village rob told the man how to get there wait for me at the queens head youll see it on the right i expect therere phone calls you need to make anyway about the car look how bad a troublere we in cn i make this right somehow youre not in trouble there are just formalities the pony neighed wildly it sounded like a scream do something do something one of the women cried the american nodded and said queens head okay and then to the others come on lets go they made short work of vacating the scene leaving rob the stallion and billy rodin on the side of the lane worst part of the job eh billy said poor dumb brute rob wasnt sure which of them the phrase suited best the american the stallion or himself he said happens too often especially in summer need my help rob told him he didnt he would dispatch the poor animal and ring new forest hounds to pick up the body you neednt stay he told him right then billy rodin said and he headed back to the gardening from which hed come on the run this left rob to deal with the stallion and he went to his land rover to fetch the pistol two ponies in less than a week he thought things were getting worse and worse his charge was to protect the animals on the forestespecially the poniesbut he didnt see how he could do it if people didnt learn to value them he didnt blame the poor foolish americans likely they hadnt been driving fast anyway here to see the countryside and to gawk at its beauties they might have been momentarily distracted by one vista or another but he suspected that had it not been for the surprise of the other vehicle coming at them none of this would have happened he told frank once more to stay as he jerked open the land rovers door and reached in the back the pistol was gone he saw this at once and for an unnerving moment he thought ridiculously that somehow one of the americans had got it since theyd driven right by the land rover on their way towards burley then he thought of the children at gritnam while he was unloading the two ponies into the woodland just a short time ago that consideration made his stomach churn and drove him to thrust himself into the land rover and begin a frantic search he always kept the pistol secured behind the drivers seat in a disguised holster fashioned for just this purpose but it wasnt there it hadnt fallen to the floor it wasnt under the seat nor was it under the passengers seat he thought about the last time hed used itthe day the two scotland yard detectives had found him on the side of the road with another injured ponyand he considered briefly that one of themperhaps the black man because he was blackand then he realised how horrible a thought it was and what it said about him that he even considered itand behind him the stallion continued to thrash and shriek he grabbed up the shotgun god he didnt want to have to do it this way but he had no choice he loaded the thing and approached the poor pony but all the time his mind was feverishly casting up images of the past few days of all the people whod been near enough to the land rover he should have been removing the pistol and the shotgun from the vehicle every evening hed been too distracted meredith the scotland yard detectives his own visit to the local police gordon jossie gina dickenswhen had he last removed the pistol and the shotgun as he was meant to do anyway he couldnt say but there was a single certainty and he damn well knew it he had to find that gun meredith powell faced her boss but she couldnt look at him he was in the right and she was in the wrong and there were no two ways about it she had been off her stride she had been enormously distracted she had been ducking out of the office on the least pretext she certainly couldnt deny any of this so what she did was nod she felt as humiliated as shed ever felt even in the worst moments all those years ago in london when shed had to face the fact that the man to whom shed given her love had been merely a worthless object of a feminine fantasy long fed by the cinema by certain novels and by advertising agencies so i want to see a change mr hudson was saying as a conclusion to his remarks can you guarantee a change meredith well of course she could that was what he expected her to say so she said it she added that her dearest and oldest friend had been murdered in london recently and that was causing her to be preoccupied but she would pull herself together yes yes im sorry about that mr hudson said abruptly as if he was already in possession of the facts surrounding jemimas death as indeed he likely was tragedy it is but life continues for the rest of us and its not going to continue if we let the walls collapse round our ears is it no no of course he was right she was sorry shed not been pulling her weight round gerber hudson but she would resume doing so the very next day that is unless mr hudson wanted her to remain into the evening to make up for lost time which she would do except that she had a fiveyearold at home and that wont be necessary mr hudson used a letter opener to clean beneath his fingernails digging round industriously in a way that made meredith feel rather faint as long as i see the old meredith back here at her desk tomorrow he would oh he would meredith vowed thank you mr hudson i appreciate your confidence in me when he dismissed her she returned to her cubicle end of the day so she could go home but to leave so soon on the heels of mr hudsons reprimand would not look good no matter how hed concluded their interview she knew that she ought to spend at least one hour longer than usual with her nose to the grindstone of whatever it was that she was supposed to be doing which of course she could not remember which of course had been randall hudsons point she had a pile of telephone messages on her desk so she fingered through these in the hope of finding a clue there were certainly names and there were pointed questions and ultimately she reckoned she could start looking a few things up since most everyone seemed to be concerned about how the designs for this and for that were coming along according to the messages but her heart wasnt in it and her mind would not cooperate at all she had she concluded far more important subjects with which to be concerned than the colour scheme she would recommend for the advertisement of a local bookshops new reading group she put the messages to one side she used the time to straighten her desk she made an effort to look industrious as her colleagues called out goodbyes and faded into the late afternoon but all the time her thoughts were like a flock of birds circling a food source lighting upon it briefly and taking flight again instead of a food source though the flock of birds circled gina dickens only to find out that there were far too many places for them to land without a single one offering either a decent foothold or safety from predation but how could it actually be otherwise meredith asked herself for in every matter that touched upon gina meredith had been outmanoeuvred from the first she forced herself to consider each of her interactions with the other young woman and she felt every which way the fool the truth of the matter was that gina had read her as easily as she herself read cammie she had no more sense and even less art than a fiveyearold and it had likely taken fewer than ten minutes for gina dickens to work that out shed done so on the very first day when meredith had taken that stupid melting birthday cake to jemimas cottage gina had claimed knowledge of nothing relating to jemima and meredith had believed her just like that and hearing a claim that the programme for young girls at risk was merely in its embryonic stage shed believed that as well as she had also believed that gordon jossieand not gina herself which lets face it was far more likelyhad gone into london on the very day that jemima died as she had also believed that gordon jossieand not gina herselfhad caused the bruising on ginas body as to everything gina had claimed about a relationship of some sort between chief superintendent whiting and gordongina could have announced theyd both landed as conjoined twins from mars and meredith probably would have believed her it seemed that there was only one alternative now so meredith rang her mother and told her shed be just a bit late coming home because she had a stop to make fortunately that stop was on the way so she neednt worry and give cammie a kiss and a cuddle please then she went for her car and headed for lyndhurst she put on an affirmation tape to accompany her on the a she repeated the sonorous declarations of her ability her value as a human being and the possibility of her becoming an agent of change the usual rush hour tailback slowed her progress on the bourne mouth road as she approached lyndhurst the traffic lights in the high street didnt help matters either but meredith found that the repetition of her affirmations kept her centred so that when she finally reached the police station her nerves were steady and she was ready to make certain that her demands for action were well understood she expected to be thwarted she reckoned that the special constable in reception would recognise her and with much eye rolling would tell her she could not see the chief superintendent on the spur of the moment this wasnt after all a dropin centre zachary whiting had more important concerns than to meet with every hysterical woman who happened to call in but that didnt occur the special constable asked her to be seated disappeared into the station for less than three minutes and returned with the request that she follow him because although chief superintendent whiting had intended to leave for the day once he heard merediths name he remembered it from her earlier visitso she had given her name she thoughtand asked that she be ushered to his office she told him everything she gave him a to z and then some on the topic of gina dickens she saved the very best for the end her own hiring of a private investigator in ringwood and what that private investigator had turned up about gina whiting jotted notes throughout at the end he clarified that this gina dickens was the same woman who had accompanied meredith to the police station here in lyndhurst with evidence suggesting that one gordon jossie had been in london during the time his former lover had been murdered this was that woman was it not it was meredith said and she realised chief superintendent whiting how that looked that she herself was a nutter of the first water but shed had her reasons for delving into ginas background because everything gina told her had been suspect from the first and wasnt the important bit the fact that now they knew every word the woman spoke was a lie shed even lied about himself and gordon jossie meredith told him shed said hewhiting himselfhad paid more than one mysterious call upon gordon had she indeed whiting frowned this would be looked into he assured her he said he would handle the matter personally he said that there was obviously more here than could be understood by merely skimming the surface and since he had access to a far better set of investigatory tools than were had by any private investigator meredith should let the matter rest with him but will you do something about her meredith asked and she even wrung her hands he would indeed whiting told her there was nothing she needed to worry about from this moment forward he recognised the urgency of the situation especially as it had to do with a murder so she left she felt if not lighthearted then at least moderately relieved shed taken a step towards dealing with the problem of gina dickens and that made her feel somewhat less foolish about being seducedthere was no other word for itby ginas lies there was a car in the drive of her parents home in cadnam when meredith arrived she didnt recognise it and the sight of it gave her pause she briefly considered the possibility that she always considered and hated herself for considering when something unexpected happened that might concern cammie her daughters father had decided to visit this was never the case but meredith had not yet managed to school her mind not to go there at the least provocation inside the house she was startled to see the private investigator from ringwood sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea and a plate of fig newtons before her on her lap was cammie and michele daugherty was reading to her not a childrens book for cammie was not remotely interested in stories about elephants boys and girls puppies or bunnies rather the investigator was reading to merediths daughter from an unauthorised biography of placido domingo a book whose purchase cammie had insisted upon when shed seen it in a shop in ringwood and recognised one of her favourite tenors on the cover merediths mother stood at the cooker doing fish fingers and chips for cammies tea she said unnecessarily weve a visitor luv and to cammie thats enough for now put placido back on the shelf theres a good girl well have more of him after your bath but gran camille meredith used her mother tone cammie made a face but slid off michele daughertys lap and trudged dramatically in the direction of the sitting room michele daugherty gave a glance in the direction of the cooker meredith decided pleasantries were in order until her mum was supervising cammies meal indeed since she didnt know whether her mother had been told exactly what michele daugherty did for a living she decided to wait and see what this unexpected visit was all about rather than to question it janet powell unfortunately was taking her time probably in order to hear why this stranger had come calling upon her daughter theyd run out of chat and still she cooked there was nothing for it but to offer michele daugherty a look at the back garden which meredith did michele accepted with alacrity janet powell shot meredith a look ill have it out of you anyway was the message there was thank god at least a back garden to see merediths parents were both avid about roses and they were in full bloom and since the powells insisted upon planting roses with fragrance and not just with colour the scent was heady impossible not to notice and to comment upon michele daugherty did both but then took meredith by the arm and led her as far from the house as possible i couldnt ring you she said how did you know where to find me i didnt tell you where my dear you did hire me because im a pi didnt you how difficult do you suppose it is to find someone who isnt worried about being found there was that of course meredith realised she wasnt exactly in hiding which brought her immediately to the person who was in hiding or in something else she said youve found out and waited for her thought to be completed by the other woman its not safe she said nothing appears to be thats why i couldnt phone you i dont trust the phone in my office and when it comes to mobiles theyre just about as risky listen my dear i went on with my research once you left me i started in on the other name gordon jossie meredith felt a shiver crawl up her arms like fingertips tapping from the other world youve found out something she murmured i knew it its not that michele glanced round as if expecting someone to leap over the brick wall and come charging across the roses to accost her its not that at all more on gina dickens then not that either i had a visit from the cops my dear a gentleman called whiting showed up he let me know in very clear terms having a great deal to do with my license to do business that a bloke called gordon jossie was off limits to me and to my endeavours its all in hand is how he put it thank god meredith breathed michele daugherty frowned whats that you say i stopped to see him on my way home this afternoon chief superintendent whiting i told him what youd discovered about gina dickens and id already told him about gordon id been to talk to him about gordon earlier before i came to you in fact id tried to interest him in what was going on but youre not understanding me my dear michele daugherty said chief superintendent whiting came to see me this morning not an hour after you left me id begun my search but id not got far id not even rung the local police or any police for that matter did you ring him and tell him i was investigating before you saw him this afternoon meredith shook her head she began to feel ill michele lowered her voice do you see what this means meredith had an idea but she didnt particularly want to give it voice she said youd only begun the process when he showed up what does that mean exactly it means i went into the national data banks it means that somehow entering gordon jossies name into those national data banks set off bells and whistles somewhere and brought chief superintendent whiting on the run to my doorstep it means theres far more here than meets the eye it means i cant help you further barbara havers drove directly to gordon jossies holding arriving there in late afternoon and without being intercepted by a phone call from isabelle ardery for which she thanked her lucky stars she only hoped that di lynley would run interference for her with the acting superintendent when it came to light that barbara had taken herself to hampshire if he did not her goose was in the oven no cars were in the drive that ran alongside the cottage barbara parked and knocked on the cottages back door for good measure although she reckoned no one was at home which turned out to be the case no matter she thought time to have a look round she took herself over to the barn and tried its vast sliding door it was conveniently unlocked she left it ajar to give herself some light it was cool within and musty smelling a combination of stone dust and cob the first thing she saw was an ancient car two tones of colour on it in the fashion of the s it was in pristine condition and looked as if someone came out to the barn to dust it every day barbara went to have a closer look a figaro she saw italian inspector lynley would know car buff that he was she herself had never seen a vehicle like it it wasnt locked so she checked it over stem to stern beneath the seats and in the glove box as well there was nothing of interest the figaro was parked towards the back of the building to give clear access to the rest of the barn this space contained any number of unsealed crates which barbara reckoned had to do with gordon jossies employment she went to them next there were crooks galore she found this was unsurprising since they were a principal element of thatching it wasnt rocket science to work out how they were used either the hooked end did just that it hooked over one end of a bunched collection of reeds and held them in place the pointed end got pounded into the rafters beneath when it came to murder the use of the crook was equally simple to sort out the hooked end was the handle and the pointed end did the business on the victim what was interesting about the crooks that jossie had was that they were not all the same among the wooden boxes three contained crooks but in each of the boxes the crooks were slightly different this difference had to do with the business end of the tool each pointed tip had been created differently in one box the points had been fashioned as a diagonal cut in another the points had been created by turning and pounding the iron four times upon taking the crook from the blacksmiths fire in the third a smoother point had been achieved by rolling the iron when it was molten the end was the same in each case but the means of getting there apparently formed the blacksmiths signature for a city denizen like barbara the fact that these implements were made by hand in this day and age was nothing short of remarkable seeing them was like stepping back in time but then she reckoned so was seeing thatched roofs she needed to ring winston he was likely in the incident room at this time of day and he could have a close look at the photo of the murder weapon and tell her how the point was shaped that wouldnt sign seal and deliver anyones guilt in the matter of jemimas death but at least it would let them know whether jossies crooks here in his barn bore any resemblance to the one that was used on his former lover she headed towards the barn door to fetch her mobile from her car outside she heard the sound of a vehicle in the drive the quick slam of a door and the barking of a dog it seemed that gordon jossie had just arrived home from his workday he wouldnt be happy to find her prowling round his barn she was right in that jossie came striding towards her and despite the baseball cap that shaded part of his face barbara could see from the ruddiness of the rest of his complexion that he was not pleased what the hell are you doing nice supply of crooks youve got in there she replied where dyou get them what difference does that make amazing that theyre still made by hand cos they are arent they id reckon at this point someone would be manufacturing them what with the industrial revolution having come along cant you get them from china or somewhere india maybe someones got to be turning them out in masses the golden retrieverabsolutely worthless as a guard doghad apparently recognised her from her earlier visit to the holding the dog leapt up and licked her cheek barbara patted her on the head tess jossie said down get away sokay barbara said i generally prefer men but in a pinch a female dog will do you didnt answer me jossie said makes us even you didnt answer me either whyre the crooks made by hand because the others are crap and i dont work with crap i take pride in my work we have that in common he wasnt amused what do you want who dyou get them off someone local ones local the others are from cornwall and norfolk you need more than one supplier why the obvious you need masses of them to do a roof and you cant get caught short in the middle of a job are you going to tell me why were talking about crooks im thinking of a career change barbara went to the mini and fetched her bag she dug out her players and said mind to jossie she offered him one but he refused she lit her own and observed him all of this gave her time to consider what it actually meant that when long came to short he was asking her as much about the crooks as she was asking him he was either very clever or he was very something else innocent of the crime came to mind but shed seen enough of the criminal element to know that the criminal element was the criminal element because it had been quite successful at being the criminal element talking to one of their sort was like dancing in one of those regency costume dramas on the telly one had to know the proper steps and in which order one was supposed to make them wheres your lady friend barbara asked him ive no idea moved out has she i didnt say that you cn see for yourself that her cars not here so jemimas is though thats hers in the barn isnt it she left it here why havent a clue i assume she meant to come back for it when she had a use for it or a place to keep it she didnt tell me and i didnt ask why not what the hell does it matter what do you want why are you here he looked round as if he could sort out what shed been up to by glancing from the barn to the west paddock and from there to the east paddock and from there to the cottage the dog picked up on his agitation and began to pace looking from her master to barbara after a few moments she yelped once and headed for the back door to the cottage barbara said to jossie i think your dog wants feeding he said i know how to care for a dog he went to the cottage and disappeared inside barbara took the opportunity to fetch the magazine shed had from lynley when shed met him earlier on the motorway she rolled it up and went to the cottage where she let herself in jossie was in the kitchen where the dog was gulping down a bowl of dry food jossie stood at the sink looking out of the window it gave a view of his pickup barbaras car and the paddock beyond earlier she remembered thered been animals in it whered the horses go she asked him ponies he said theres a difference they went back on the forest i presume i wasnt here when he fetched them who rob hastings he said hed come for them now theyre gone i reckon its safe to assume he returned them to the forest as they werent likely to let themselves out of the paddock were they why were they here he turned to her prime ministers question time he said is over for the first time he sounded menacing and barbara saw a glimpse of the real man beneath the exterior that he kept so controlled she drew in on her cigarette and wondered about her personal safety she concluded he was unlikely to dispatch her right there in his kitchen so she approached him flicked cigarette ash into the sink and said sit down mr jossie i have something to show you his face hardened he looked as if hed refuse at first but then he went to the table and dropped into a chair hed not removed his cap or his sunglasses but he did so now what he said not even a question he sounded tired to the bone barbara unrolled the magazine she found the pages of social photos she sat down opposite him and turned the magazine so that he could see it she said nothing he glanced at the pictures and then at her what he said again posh folk drinking champagne am i supposed to care about this have a closer look mr jossie this is the opening of the photo show at the portrait gallery i think you know which show im talking about he looked again she saw that he was giving his attention to the picture of jemima posing with deborah st james but that was not the picture of interest she indicated the one in which gina dickens appeared we both know who this is dont we mr jossie barbara said to him he said nothing she saw him swallow but that was his only reaction he didnt look up and he didnt move she looked at his temple but saw no wild pulsing there was nothing at all not what shed expected she thought time for a bit of a push she said personally i believe in coincidence or synchronicity or whatever these things happen and theres no doubt about that eh but lets just say that it wasnt coincidence that gina dickens was at the portrait gallery for the opening of this show that would mean she had a reason to be there what dyou expect that reason was he didnt reply but barbara knew his mind must be racing prhaps shes wild for photography barbara said i spose thats possible i rather like it myself prhaps she happened to be wandering by and thought she could score a glass of the bubbly and a cheese stick or something i could see that as well but theres another prhaps and i reckon you and i know what it is mr jossie no he sounded a little hoarse this was good barbara thought yes she said prhaps she had a reason for being there prhaps she knew jemima hastings no she didnt or you cant believe she did he said nothing barbara took out her card wrote her mobile number on the back and slid it across the table towards him i want to talk to gina she said i want you to ring me when she gets home chapter twentynine isabelle had remained at st thomas hospital for most of the afternoon excavating for information in the twisted passageways that comprised the mind of yukio matsumoto when she wasnt sparring with his solicitor and making promises that she was not remotely authorised to make the result was that by the end of the day she had a disjointed scenario of what had happened in abney park cemetery along with two efits she also had twelve voice messages on her mobile hilliers office had rung three times which wasnt good stephenson deacons office had rung twice which was just as bad she skipped those five messages plus two from dorothea harriman and one from her exhusband that left her with messages from john stewart thomas lynley and barbara havers she listened to lynleys hed phoned twice once about the british museum once about barbara havers although she took note of the fact that the sound of the inspectors wellbred baritone was vaguely comforting isabelle paid scant attention to the messages for unrelated to the fact of his messages was the additional fact that her insides felt as if they wanted to become her outsides and while she knew very well that there was one quick way to settle both her stomach and her nerves she did not intend to employ it she drove back to victoria street on the way she phoned dorothea harriman and told her to have the team in the incident room for her return harriman tried to bring up the subject of ac hillieras isabelle reckoned she mightbut isabelle cut her off with yes yes i know ive heard from him as well but first things first she rang off before harriman told her the obvious that in hilliers head first things first meant attending to sir davids desires well that couldnt matter at the moment she had to meet with her team and that took priority they were assembled when she arrived she said right as she walked into the room weve got efits on two individuals who were in the cemetery and seen by yukio matsumoto dorotheas running them through the copier so youll each have one shortly she went over what matsumoto had told her about that day in abney park cemetery jemimas actions the two men hed seen and where he had seen them and yukios attempt to help jemima upon finding her wounded in the chapel annex obviously he made the wound worse when he removed the weapon she said she would have died anyway but removing the weapon hastened things it also got him drenched in her blood what about his hair in her hand it was philip hale who asked the question he doesnt remember her reaching up to him but she may have done and he may be lying john stewart noted having talked to him sod talking to him stewart threw a balledup piece of paper onto his desk why didnt he phone the police go for help hes a paranoid schizophrenic john isabelle said i dont think we can expect rational behaviour from him but we can expect usable efits isabelle clocked the restless movement among those gathered in the room stewarts tone was as usual bordering on snide he was going to have to be sorted out eventually harriman entered the room the stack of duplicated efits in hand she murmured to isabelle that ac hilliers office had phoned again apparently with the knowledge that acting superintendent ardery was now in the building should she she was in a meeting isabelle told her tell the assistant commissioner she would get to him in good time dorothea looked as if that way lies madness was the response on the tip of her tongue but she scurried off as well as she could scurry on her ridiculous high heels isabelle handed out the efits shed already anticipated the reactions she was going to get once the officers looked at what yukio matsumoto had come up with so she began talking to head them off she said weve got two men one of them our victim met in the vicinity of the chapel in the clearing on a stone bench where she apparently had been waiting for him they spoke at some length he then left her and when he left her she was alive and unharmed matsumoto says that jemima took a phone call from someone at the conclusion of her conversation with this bloke shortly after that she disappeared round the side of the chapel out of yukios view it was only when man number two appeared coming from the same direction that jemima had herself taken that yukio went to see where she was that was when he saw the annex to the chapel and discovered her body within it where are we with the mobile phone towers john if we can triangulate where that phone call came from just before she was attacked jesus these efits hang on isabelle cut in john stewart was the one who had spokenno surprise there that he went his own way rather than answer her questionbut she could tell from the expression on winston nkatas face that he wished to speak as well philip hale moved restlessly and lynley had gone to stand by the china boards for a look at something or perhaps to hide his own expression which she had no doubt was deeply concerned as well he might be she was concerned herself the efits were nearly useless but that was not a subject she intended to countenance she said this second man is dark dark is consistent with three of our suspects frazer chaplin abbott langer and paolo di fazio all with alibis stewart managed to put in he counted them off with his fingers chaplin at home confirmed by mchaggis di fazio inside jubilee market at his regular stall confirmed by four other stall holders and no doubt seen by three hundred people langer walking dogs in the park confirmed by his customers none of whom saw him john isabelle snapped so well break the goddamn alibis one of these blokes put a spike through a young womans neck and were going to get him is that clear bout that spike winston nkata said hang on winston isabelle continued her previous line of thought lets not forget what we already know about the victims mobile phone calls either shes rung chaplin three times and langer once on the day of her death shes taken one call from gordon jossie another from chaplin and another from jayson drutherour cigar shop blokeon the same day and within our window of time when she was killed after her death her mobile took messages from her brother jayson druther again paolo di fazio and yolanda our psychic but not abbott langer and not frazer chaplin both of whom fit the description of the man seen leaving the area of the murder now i want the neighbourhoods canvassed again i want those efits shown at every house meantime i want the cctv films weve got from the area looked over once again for a vespa motorbike lime green with transfers advertising dragonfly tonics on it and i want that to be part of the house to house as well philip coordinate the house to house with the stoke newington station winston i want you on the cctv films john youll bloody hell this is stupid john stewart said the sodding efits are worthless just look at them are you trying to pretend theres a single defining characteristic the dark bloke looks like a villain in a television drama and the one in the cap and glasses could be a bloody woman for all we know dyou actually believe this slanteyes tale that thatll do inspector no it wont wed have an arrest if you hadnt run this bugger into traffic and then hung about waiting to find out he wasnt the killer in the first place youve bloody well mishandled this case from the first youve give it a rest john of all people it was philip hale speaking winston nkata joined him saying hang on man you lot might start thinking about whats going on was stewarts reply youve been tiptoeing round every mad thing this womans said like we owe the bloody slag allegiance jesus man this came from hale you pig was the cry from one of the female constables and you wouldnt know a killer if he stuck his in you and tickled you with it was stewarts reply to her at this chaos erupted aside from isabelle there were five young women in the room three constables and two typists the nearest constable came out of her chair as if propelled and one typist threw her coffee cup at stewart he shot up and went for her philip hale held him back he swung at hale nkata grabbed him stewart turned on him you fucking nig nkata slapped his face the blow was hard fast and loud like a crack stewarts head flew back when i say hang on i mean it nkata told him sit down shut your gob act like you know something and be glad i didnt punch your lights and break your goddamn nose well done winnie someone called out thatll do all of you isabelle said she could see that lynley was watching her from his place by the china board he hadnt moved she was grateful for this the last thing she wanted was his intervention it was bad enough that hale and nkata had had to sort out stewart when it was her job to do the sorting she said to stewart in my office wait there she said nothing more until hed slammed his way out of the room then what else do we have then jemima hastings had possessed a gold coincurrently missing from her belongingsand a carnelian that were roman in origin barbara havers had recognised the murder weapon and where is sergeant havers isabelle asked realising for the first time that the dowdy woman wasnt among the officers in the room why isnt she here there was silence before winston nkata said gone to hamshire guv isabelle felt her face go rigid she said hampshire simply because she could not think of another response in the circumstances nkata said murder weapons a crook barb an i we saw em in ham shire its a thatchers tool we got two thatchers on our radar down there and barb thought thank you isabelle said nother thing is crooksre made by blacksmiths nkata continued rob hastingss a blacksmith and since i said thank you winston the room was silent phones were ringing in another area and the sudden sound of them served as an unwelcome reminder of how out of control their afternoon briefing had become into this silence thomas lynley spoke and it became immediately apparent that he was defending barbara havers shes unearthed another connection among ringo heath zachary whiting and gordon jossie guv he said and how do you come to know this i spoke with her on her way to hampshire she rang you i rang her i managed to catch her when shed stopped on the motorway but the important thing is youre not in charge here inspector lynley i understand by which i take it that you also understand how out of order you were to encourage sergeant havers to do anything other than to get her bum back to london yes lynley hesitated isabelle locked eyes with him the same silence came over the room again god she thought first stewart now lynley havers gallivanting to hampshire nkata coming to blows with another officer lynley said carefully i see that but theres another connection barbaras come up with and i think youll agree its worth looking at and this connection is lynley told her about a magazine and its photos of the opening of the cadbury photographic portrait of the year show he told her about frazer chaplin in those pictures and there in the background gina dickens he concluded with it seemed best to let her go to hampshire if nothing else she can get us photos of jossie ringo heath and whiting to show round stoke newington and to show to matsumoto but knowing barbara shes likely to come up with more than that is she indeed isabelle said thank you inspector ill chat with her later she looked at the rest of them and read on their faces the varying degrees of discomfort she said to them the lot of you have your activities for tomorrow well speak again in the afternoon she left them she heard her name called as she strode to her office she recognised lynleys voice but she waved him off i need to deal with di stewart she told him and then with hillier and that believe me is all i can cope with today she turned quickly before he could reply shed not made it to her office door when dorothea harriman told her that the assistant commissioner had personally just phonedthe emphasis she placed on personally expressing the urgency of the communicationand he was giving the superintendent a choice she could either come to his office at once or he could come to hers i took the liberty dorothea said meaningfully because with all due respect detective superintendent ardery you dont want the assistant commissioner coming tell him im on my way john stewart isabelle decided would have to wait briefly she wondered how her day could possibly become worse but she reckoned she was about to find out the key was to hold things together for another hour or so isabelle told herself she was capable of that she didnt need to fortify herself for a final sixty minutes at the yard she might have wanted to but she didnt need to want and need were completely different at ac hilliers office judi macintosh told her to go straight in the assistant commissioner was expecting her she said and did she want tea or a coffee isabelle accepted tea with milk and sugar she reckoned that being able to drink it without her hands shaking would make a statement about the control she was maintaining over the situation hillier was sitting behind his desk he nodded towards his conference table and he told her they would wait for stephenson deacons arrival hillier joined her there when isabelle sat he had several telephone messages in his hand slips of paper that he laid out on the table in front of him and made a show of studying the office door opened after two minutes tense silence and judi macintosh came in with isabelles tea cup and saucer milk jug and sugar stainless steel spoon these would be trickier to handle than a plastic or styrofoam cup this teacup would rattle on its saucer when she lifted it sounding a betrayal very clever isabelle thought please enjoy your tea hillier told her she reckoned his tone was similar to that which socrates heard prior to the hemlock she took milk but decided against the sugar sugar would have required her dexterous use of the spoon and she didnt think she could manage that as it was when she stirred the milk into the tea the sound of steel hitting china seemed earsplitting she didnt dare raise the cup to her lips she set the spoon in the saucer and waited it was less than five minutes before stephenson deacon joined them although it seemed much longer he nodded at her and sank into a chair placing a manila folder in front of him his hair was thin and the colour of mouse fur and he ran his hands through it as he said well after which he leveled a gaze at her and added we do have something of a problem superintendent ardery the problem had two parts and the head of the press bureau shed light upon them without further prefatory remarks the first part constituted unauthorised deal making the second part constituted the result of that unauthorised deal making both were equally damaging to the met damaging to the met had nothing to do with real damage isabelle quickly discovered it did not mean the police had lost any power over the criminal element rather damage to the met meant damage to the image of the met and whenever the mets image was sullied the sullying generally came from the press in this case what the press were reporting appeared to have come verbatim from zaynab bourne she had embraced the deal offered by detective superintendent isabelle ardery at st thomas hospital unfettered access to yukio matsumoto in exchange for the mets admission of culpability for the japanese mans flight and his subsequent injuries the final edition of the evening standard was leading with the story but unfortunately the standard was leading with only half of it and that was the culpability half met admits wrongdoing was how the paper was phrasing it and they were doing their phrasing in a threeinch banner below which were printed photos of the accident scene photos of the solicitor at the press conference where shed made this announcement and a publicity shot of hiro matsumoto and his cello as if he and not his brother were the victim of the accident in question now that scotland yard had admitted its part in causing the terrible injuries from which yukio matsumoto was heroically trying to recover mrs bourne had said she would be exploring the monetary compensation owed to him they could all thank god that no armed officers had been involved in chasing the poor man by the way had the police been wielding guns she had little doubt that mr matsumoto would now be awaiting burial isabelle reckoned that the real reason she was sitting in hilliers office with the assistant commissioner and stephenson deacon had to do with the monetary compensation that zaynab bourne had mentioned feverishly she went back over her conversation with the solicitorheld in the corridor outside of yukio matsumotos roomand she recognised an element of that conversation that bourne had not taken into account prior to speaking to the press she said mrs bourne is exaggerating sir she spoke to hillier we had a conversation about what led up to mr matsumotos injuries but that was the extent of it i no more agreed to her assessment of the circumstances than i offered to slash my wrists in front of television cameras she winced inwardly as soon as shed spoken bad choice of visual image she thought from the expression on the assistant commissioners face she reckoned that he would have been only too happy had she slashed her wrists or any other part of her body for that matter she said the two of us talked alone as well and she hoped theyd fill in the blanks from there so that she would not have to do so there were no witnesses to their conversation it mattered little what zaynab bourne said the met could simply deny it hillier looked at deacon deacon raised an eyebrow deacon looked at isabelle isabelle went on beyond that she said theres the not inconsiderable matter of public safety to be looked at explain hillier was the one to speak he glanced at the phone messages fanned out on the table isabelle assumed they were from bourne the media and hilliers own superior officer there were hundreds of people in covent garden when mr matsumoto bolted isabelle said its true we gave chase and mrs bourne can certainly argue that we did so despite knowing the man is a paranoid schizophrenic but we can counter that claim with the weightier claim that we gave chase for precisely that reason we knew he was unstable but we also knew he was involved in a murder his own brother had identified him from the efit in the newspapers beyond that we had hairs on the body that we knew were oriental in origin and that in conjunction with a description of this very man running from the scene of a violent murder clothing disheveled she let the remainder of the sentence dangle for a moment it seemed to her that the rest was implicit what option had the police possessed other than to give chase we had no idea if he was armed she concluded he might very well have struck again hillier looked at deacon another time they communicated wordlessly it was then that it came to isabelle that something had already been decided between them and she was in the room to hear that decision rather than to defend what had happened out in the street hillier finally spoke the press isnt stupid isabelle theyre fully capable of working on your time line and using it against you and by extension against the met sir she frowned deacon leaned towards her his voice was patient we try not to operate like our american cousins my dear he said shoot first and ask questions later thats not quite our style at his patronising tone she felt hairs rise on the back of her neck i dont see how then let me clarify deacon interrupted when you gave chase you had no idea the hairs from the body belonged to an oriental let alone to mr matsumoto you had less idea that he was indeed the person whod been fleeing the crime scene that turned out to be well yes it did and isnt that a relief but the problem is the chase itself and your admission of culpability for it as i said there were no witnesses to my conversation with and thats what you would have me declare to the press its our word against hers and so there thats actually the best response you have to offer sir this she said to hillier i had little choice in the matter at the hospital we had yukio matsumoto conscious we had his brother and his sister willing to let me talk to him and we had him talking as well we ended up with two efits and if i hadnt made a deal with the solicitor wed not have anything more than we had yesterday ah yes the efits deacon was the one to speak and he opened the manila folder hed brought with him isabelle saw hed come to hilliers office armed hed already managed to get copies of the efits himself he looked at them then at her he handed the efits over to hillier hillier examined them he took his time he tapped the tips of his fingers together as he made his assessment of what isabelles deal making with zaynab bourne hadand had notgained them he was no more a fool than she was herself than deacon was than any of the investigating officers were he drew his conclusion but he didnt speak it he didnt need to instead he raised his eyes to her blue soulless were they also regretful and if they were what did he regret two days to finish this up he told her after that i believe we can assume that your time with us has come to an end lynley found the house without too much difficulty despite its being south of the river where a single wrong turn could easily put one on the road to brighton instead of perhaps the road to kent or the road to cambridgeshire but in this case his clue to location was that according to the az the street he wanted lay squarely between wandsworth prison and wandsworth cemetery insalubrious his wife would have called it darling the place has everything to recommend it to the suicidal or the permanently depressed helen wouldnt have been wrong especially with regard to the structure in which isabelle ardery had established her digs the house itself wasnt entirely baddespite the dying tree in front of it and the concrete pad that surrounded the dying tree and made it a dying tree in the first placebut isabelle had taken the basement flat and as the house faced north the place was like a pit it put lynley immediately in mind of welsh miners and that was before hed even got inside he saw isabelles car in the street so he knew she was at home but she didnt answer the door when he knocked so he knocked again and then he banged he called out her name and when that didnt do it he tried the knob and found that she hadnt locked herself in a foolhardy move he entered there was little light as would be the case in any basement flat dim illumination came through a crusty kitchen window but that was supposed to provide daylight for not only the kitchen but the room that opened off it which appeared to be the sitting room this was furnished cheaply with pieces suggesting a single hasty purchase trip to ikea settee chair coffee table floor lamp a rug intended to hide the occupants household sins there was nothing personal anywhere lynley saw save for one photograph which he picked up from a shelf above the electric fire this was a framed picture of isabelle kneeling between two boys her arms round their waists she was obviously dressed for work while they wore school uniforms with their caps set jauntily on their heads their arms slung round their mothers shoulders all three of them were grinning first day at school lynley wondered the age of the twins seemed right for it he put the picture back on the shelf he looked round and wondered at isabelles choice of habitation he couldnt imagine bringing the boys to live in this place and he wondered why isabelle had chosen it housing was expensive in london but surely there had to be something better a place where the boys could if nothing else see the sky when they looked out of a window and where were they meant to sleep he wondered he went in search of bedrooms there was one its door standing open it was situated at the back of the flat its window looking out on a tiny walled area from which he supposed access to the garden might be gained if there was a garden the window was closed and it looked as if it hadnt been washed since the construction of the house itself but the illumination it provided was enough to highlight a chair a chest of drawers and a bed upon this bed isabelle ardery sprawled she was breathing deeply in the manner of someone who hasnt had a good nights sleep in days he was loath to awaken her and he considered writing a note and leaving her in peace but when he walked round the bed to ease open the window in order to give the poor woman a bit of fresh air he saw the glint of a bottle on the floor and he understood from this that she was not asleep at all as one would think of sleep rather she was drunk christ he muttered damn fool woman he sat on the bed he heaved her upward she groaned her eyes fluttered open then closed isabelle he said isabelle howd you ge in eh she squinted at him then closed her eyes again hey m a police officer you her head flopped against him ill ring somesomeoneill dof you dont leave get up lynley told her isabelle get up i must speak with you done speaking her hand reached up to pat his cheek although she didnt look at him so she missed her mark and hit his ear instead finished he said anyways and she seemed to fall back into a stupor lynley blew out a breath he tried to remember when hed last seen anyone as drunk as this but he couldnt she needed a purgative of some sort or a pot of coffee or something but first she needed to be conscious enough to swallow and there seemed to be only one way to manage that he pulled her to her feet it was impossible he knew for him to carry her from the room in the fashion of a cinematic hero she was virtually his own size she was dead weight and there was not enough room to manoeuvre her into position anyway even if hed been able to load her fireman style over his shoulder so he had to drag her ingloriously from the bed and just as ingloriously into the bathroom there he found no tub but only a narrow stall shower which was fine by him he propped her into this fully clothed and turned on the water despite the age of the house the water pressure was excellent and the spray hit isabelle directly in the face she shrieked she flailed her arms wha the hell she cried out and then seemed to see him and recognise him for the first time my god she clutched her arms round her body as if in the expectation that she would find herself naked finding herself instead fully clotheddown to her shoesshe said oh nooooo i see i have your attention at last lynley told her dryly stay in here till you sober up sufficiently to speak in coherent sentences im going to make some coffee he left her he went back to the kitchen and began a search he found a coffee press along with an electric kettle and everything else he needed he spooned a copious amount of coffee into the press and filled the kettle with water he plugged in its flex by the time the coffee was ready and hed put mugs milk and sugar on the tablealong with two pieces of toast which he buttered and cut into neat trianglesisabelle had emerged from the bathroom her sodden clothing removed she was wearing a toweling dressing gown her feet were bare and her hair clung wetly to her skull she stood at the door to the kitchen and observed him my shoes she said are ruined hmm he replied i daresay they are my watch wasnt waterproof either thomas an unfortunate oversight when it was purchased how did you get in your door was unlocked also an unfortunate oversight by the way are you sober isabelle more or less coffee then and toast he went to the doorway and took her arm she shook him off i can bloody walk she snapped weve made progress then she moved with some care to the table where she sat he poured coffee into both the mugs and pushed hers towards her along with the toast she made a moue of distaste at the food and shook her head he said refusal is not an option consider it medicinal ill be sick she was speaking with the same kind of care shed used in moving from the doorway to the table she was fairly good at feigning sobriety lynley saw but he reckoned shed had years of practice have some coffee he told her she acquiesced and took a few sips it wasnt the entire bottle she declared apropos of what hed found on the floor of her bedroom i just drank what was left of it thats hardly a crime i wasnt planning on driving anywhere i wasnt planning to leave the flat its no ones business but my own and i was owed thomas theres no need to make such an issue out of it yes he said i do see your point you could be right she eyed him he kept his face perfectly bland what are you doing here she demanded who the hell sent you no one not hillier wanting to know how i was coping with my defeat eh sir david and i are hardly on those kinds of terms lynley said whats happened she told him about her meeting with the assistant commissioner and the head of the press bureau she appeared to feel there was no point to obfuscating because she told him everything from her bargain with zaynab bourne in order to maintain access to yukio matsumoto through her acknowledgement that the efits theyd had off matsumoto were completely useless despite what shed said to the team in the incident room to stephenson deacons thinly disguised condescensionhe actually called me my dear if you can believe it and whats worse is that i didnt smack his smug faceto the end of it all which was hilliers dismissal of her two days she said and then im finished her eyes brightened but she shrugged off the emotion well john stewart will be delighted wont he she gave a weak chuckle i forgot him in my office thomas hes probably still waiting there dyou think hell spend the night god i need another drink she looked round the kitchen as if preparing to rise and fetch another bottle of vodka lynley wondered where she kept her supplies they needed to be poured down the drain shed only get more but at least her immediate desire for oblivion would be thwarted ive made a dogs dinner of this she said you wouldnt have done malcolm webberly wouldnt have done even that blasted stewart wouldnt have done she crossed her arms on the table and put her head upon them im completely useless and hopeless and buggered and selfpitying as well lynley put in her head jerked up and he added pleasantly with all due respect guv is that remark part of being his ermineclad lordship or just part of being a judgmental arse lynley made a show of thinking about this as wearing ermine gives me nettle rash i suspect the latter just as i thought youre out of order if i want to say im useless hopeless and buggered im damn well going to say it all right he added coffee to her mug isabelle he said its time to buck up youll get no argument from me that hilliers a nightmare to work for or that deacon would sell his own sister to a new york pimp if it meant keeping the met looking good but thats hardly the point just now weve got a killer needing to be arrested and a case against that killer needing to be built for the cps neither is going to happen if you dont pull yourself together she picked up her mug of coffee and lynley wondered briefly if she intended to throw it at him but rather than that she drank from it and looked at him over the rim as she did so she finally seemed to realise that hed never answered her question about his presence in her flat because she said what the hell are you doing here thomas why did you come this isnt exactly your part of town so i dare say you werent just passing by and howd you find out where i live anyway did someone tell you did that judi macintosh overhear did she send you i wouldnt put it past her to listen in at doorways theres something about her control your paranoia for five minutes lynley said i said from the first that i wanted to talk to you i waited more than an hour in the incident room dee harriman finally told me youd gone home all right talk to me about what she asked frazer chaplin what about him ive had most of the day to think about this from every angle i reckon frazers our man she waited for lynleys explanation she drank more coffee and decided to make an attempt with the toast her stomach didnt recoil altogether at the thought of food so she lifted one of the triangles lynley had made for her and she took a bite she wondered if this was the extent of the inspectors culinary talents she thought it likely hed used far too much butter as hed done earlier in the incident room lynley spoke of a magazine hed had from deborah st james frazer chaplin was in one of the pictures that could indicate several things he told her paolo di fazio had been claiming from the first that jemima had been involved with frazer despite the household rules that mrs mchaggis had put up for all her tenants to see abbott langer had said much to support this claim and yolandaat a stretch lynley admittedhad also indicated an involvement of some kind on jemimas part with a dark man so were going to listen to a psychic now isabelle wailed just hang on lynley told her they knew jemimas involvement wasnt with di fazio since shed asked yolanda repeatedly about whether her new lover returned her affections and shed hardly be asking that about di fazio after shed ended her relationship with him so wasnt it safe to assume that frazer chaplinhis denials to the contrarywas the man they were looking for how the hell did that follow isabelle demanded even if he was involved with jemima that hardly meant hed murdered her wait lynley told her if she would just hear him out please oh bloody all right isabelle was weary she waved at him to continue lets assume a few things he said first lets assume that prior to her death jemima was indeed involved romantically with frazer chaplin fine lets assume isabelle said good next lets assume her possession of a gold coin and a carved carnelian are indications not that she carried a good luck charm or is sentimental about her fathers belongings or anything of the like lets assume from these items that a roman treasure hoard has been found then lets assume that she and gordon jossie are the individuals who found that hoard and they found it on their holding in hampshire finally lets assume that prior to reporting that hoardwhich must be done by lawsomething occurred between jemima and jossie that brought their relationship to a precipitate halt she decamped to london but all the time she knew there was a treasure to be had and that treasure was worth a fortune what on earth brought their relationship to such a halt that she actually went into hiding from him isabelle asked we dont know that yet lynley admitted wonderful isabelle muttered i can hardly wait to let hillier know for gods sake thomas this is too much assuming what sort of arrest d you expect we can manage from all this speculation no arrest at all lynley said not yet at least there are pieces missing but if you think about it for a moment isabelle motive isnt one of them isabelle considered this jemima hastings gordon jossie and a buried treasure she said jossie has a motive thomas i dont see how frazer chaplin has of course he has if theres a buried treasure and if jemima hastings told him about it why would she have done why wouldnt she if shes in love with him if she hopes hes the one theres a good possibility that she told him about the treasure to make sure he stayed the one all right fine so she told him about the treasure doesnt it stand to reason that hed want to get rid of gordon jossie and not jemima hastings that would secure him the treasure only if he could hold on to jemimas affections her various visits to the psychic indicate she may well have been having second thoughts about frazer why else keep asking if he was the one suppose he knew she was having doubts suppose he saw the handwriting on the wall lose jemima and he loses the fortune the only way to prevent this would be to get rid of them bothjemima and jossieand he doesnt have to worry about anything isabelle considered this as she did so lynley rose from the table and went to the sink he leaned against it and was silent watching her and waiting she finally said its such a leap thomas theres too much to account for hes been alibied mchaggis could be lying she could also be mistaken she says he was home taking a shower but thats what he always did didnt he she was asked days later isabelle and she could well want to protect him anyway why shes a woman oh for gods sake whats that supposed to everyone agrees he has a way with women why not with bella mchaggis as well what then hes sleeping with her with her with jemima withwho else thomas with gina dickens i dare say she stared at him gina dickens think about it there she is in the magazine pictures of the portrait gallerys opening show if frazer was thereand we know he washow impossible is it to believe he met gina dickens that night how impossible is it to believe that meeting gina dickens he fell for her wanted to add her to his list of conquests ultimately decided to replace jemima with her sent her down to hampshire to get herself involved with jossie so that dyou realise how many things are unaccounted for in all of this she put her head in her hands her brain felt sodden we can suppose this and suppose that thomas but we have no evidence that anything youre saying actually happened so whats the point lynley went on seeming undeterred they did have evidence he pointed out but he reckoned they hadnt been putting it together correctly what for example the handbag and the bloodstained shirt from the oxfam bin just to begin he said weve assumed someone planted them there to implicate one of the inhabitants of bella mchaggiss house we havent considered that knowing the bin wasnt emptied regularly one of the inhabitants of the house put the items there merely to store them store them until they could be taken down to hampshire handed over to gina dickens and placed somewhere on gordon jossies property god this is madness why wouldnt he just listen lynley returned to the table and sat he leaned across it and put his hand over her arm isabelle its not as mad as it seems this crime depended upon two things first the killer had to have knowledge of jemimas past her present and her intentions towards gordon jossie second the killer couldnt have worked alone whyever not because he had to gather what evidence was going to be necessary to frame gordon jossie for this murder and that evidence was to be found in hampshire the murder weapon and a yellow shirt from jossies clothes cupboard i expect at the same time the killer had to know what jemima was doing with regard to jossie if frazer was indeed her lover isnt it reasonable to assume that she showed him those postcards that jossie had put up round the gallery in an attempt to locate her isnt it reasonable to conclude that learning about these cards and already being involved with gina dickens frazer chaplin began to see a way in which he could have everything the treasure that hed learned about a means to get to that treasure and gina dickens as well isabelle thought about this she tried to see how it had been managed a phone call made to the number on the postcard that would tell gordon jossie where to find jemima jemimas decision to meet jossie in a private location someone in hampshire to keep an eye on jossie and monitor his movements and someone in london doing the same with jemima and both of these someones intimately involved with jossie and with jemima privy to the nature of the relationship theyd had with each other both of these someones additionally in contact both of these someones engaged in a delicate minuet of timing it makes my head swim she finally said its impossible it isnt he said especially if gina dickens and frazer knew each other from the night of the gallery opening and it would have worked isabelle carefully planned as it was it would have worked perfectly the only thing they didnt take into account was yukio matsumotos presence in the cemetery that day frazer didnt know matsumoto was being jemimas guardian angel jemima likely didnt know it herself so neither frazer nor gina dickens took into account that someone would see jemima meet gordon jossie and also see gordon jossie leave her very much alive if that was gordon jossie at all i dont see how it could have been anyone else do you isabelle considered this from every angle all right it could have happened that way but there was a problem with everything lynley had said and she couldnt ignore it any more than he could she said jemima left hampshire ages ago thomas if theres a roman treasure hoard sitting down there on the property she shared with gordon jossie why the hell in all that time did neither one of themjossie or jemimado a single thing about it thats what id like to find out he said but id like to break frazers alibi first still in her dressing gown she walked outside with him she didnt look much better than when he dumped her into the shower but it seemed to lynley that her spirits were raised enough that she was unlikely to drink again that evening he was reassured by this thought he didnt like to think why she came as far as the narrow stairs that led from her basement flat up to the street hed mounted the first two steps when she said his name he turned she stood beneath him with one hand on the rail as if she intended to follow him up and the other hand at her throat holding her dressing gown closed she said all of this could have waited till morning couldnt it he thought about it for a moment before he said i suppose it could why then why now instead of the morning dyou mean yes she tilted her head towards the flat the door standing open but no lights on within did you suspect what you know i thought there was a chance of it why bother then to sober you up i wanted to toss round ideas with you and i could hardly do that if you were in a stupor why i like the give and take of a partnership its how i work best isabelle you were meant to do this she touched her fingers to her chest seeming to indicate with this gesture that she was referring to the superintendents job i wasnt she added thats clear enough now i wouldnt say that you made the point yourself the case is complicated youve been handed something with a learning curve steeper than any curve ive had to travel i dont believe that at all thomas but thank you for saying it youre a very good man often i think the opposite youre thinking nonsense then her eyes held his thomas she said i but then she seemed to lose the courage to say anything more this seemed uncharacteristic of her so he waited to hear what she wanted to conclude with he came down one step she was directly below him no longer virtually eye to eye with him but instead her head reaching just beneath his lips the silence between them stretched too long it evolved from quiet into tension it moved from tension into desire the most natural thing in the world became the simple movement to kiss her and when her mouth opened beneath his that was as natural as the kiss itself her arms slipped round him and his round her his hands slid beneath the dressing gowns folds to touch her cool soft skin i want you she murmured at last to make love to me i dont think thats wise isabelle he said i dont care in the least she replied chapter thirty gordon hadnt phoned the scotland yard detective when gina returned home on the previous night he wanted instead to watch her he had to learn exactly what she was doing here in hampshire he had to know what she knew he was rotten at acting but that couldnt be helped shed realised something was wrong the moment shed come onto the property and found him sitting in the front garden at the table in the darkness she was very late and he was grateful for this he let her think that the hour of her return was the reason for his silence and his observation of her she said shed got caught up in things but she was vague when it came to what those things were shed lost track of time she said and there she was in a meeting with a social worker from winchester and another from southampton and there was a very very good chance that from a special programme established for immigrant girls funding could be diverted for the use ofon and on she chattered gordon wondered how he hadnt seen earlier that words came far too easily to gina theyd got through the rest of the evening and then to bed shed spooned against him closely in the darkness and her hips moved rhythmically against his bum he was meant to turn and take her and he did his part they coupled in a furious silence meant to pose as wild desire they were slick with sweat when the act was done she murmured wonderful darling and she cradled him as she fell into sleep he remained awake with despair rising in him which way to turn was his only concern in the morning she was wanton as shed been so often her eyelids fluttering open her long slow smile her stretching of limbs the dance of her body as she eased beneath the sheet to find him with her mouth he pulled himself away abruptly he swung out of bed he didnt shower but dressed in what hed worn on the previous day and went downstairs to the kitchen where he made himself coffee she joined him there she hesitated at the doorway he was at the table beneath the shelf where jemima had displayed a row of her childhood plastic ponies a minor representation of one of her many collections of items she couldnt bear to part with he couldnt remember where hed put those plastic ponies now and this concerned him his memory didnt generally give him any problems gina cocked her head at him and her expression was soft youre worried about something whats happened he shook his head he wasnt yet ready speaking wasnt the difficult part for him it was listening that he didnt want to face you didnt sleep did you she asked whats wrong will you tell me is it that man again she indicated the outofdoors the driveway onto the property was just outside the kitchen window so he assumed she was talking about whiting and wondering if thered been another visit from him while shed been gone from home there hadnt but gordon knew there would be whiting had not yet got what he wanted gina went to the fridge she poured an orange juice she was wearing a linen dressing gown naked beneath it and the morning sunlight made of her body a voluptuous silhouette she was he thought a real mans woman she knew the power of the sensual she knew that when it came to men the sensual always overwhelmed the sensible she stood at the sink looking out of the window she said something about the morning it was not yet hot but it would be was it more difficult she wanted to know working with reeds when the day was so hot it didnt seem to bother her when he didnt reply she bent forward as if something outside had caught her attention then she said i can help you with clearing the rest of the paddock now the horses are gone horses he wondered for the first time at the word at the fact that she called them horses instead of what they were which was ponies shed called them horses from the first and he hadnt corrected her becausewhy he wondered what had she represented to him that he hadnt wondered about all the things that had told him from the first there was something wrong she continued im happy to do it i could use the exercise and ive nothing on for today anyway they think itll take a week or so for the money to come through less if im lucky what money for the programme she turned to look at him have you forgotten already i told you last night gordon whats wrong dyou mean the west paddock he asked her she looked puzzled before she apparently twigged how his line of thought was zigzagging helping you clear the rest of the west paddock she clarified yes i cn work on that overgrown bit by the old section of fence like i said the exercise would be leave the paddock alone he said abruptly i want it left the way it is she seemed taken aback but she collected herself enough to curve her lips in a smile and say darling of course i was only trying to that detective was here he told her that woman who came before with the black the scotland yard woman she asked i cant remember her name havers he said he reached beneath a holder for paper napkins that stood on the table and he brought out the card that ds havers had given him what did she want gina asked she wanted to talk about thatching tools crooks especially she was interested in crooks whatever for i think she could be considering a new line of work she touched her throat youre joking of course gordon darling what are you talking about you dont look at all well can i do something he waited for her to finish but she didnt her words drifted off and she was left gazing upon him as if waiting for inspiration he said you knew her didnt you ive never seen her before in my life how would i know her im not talking about the detective he said im talking about jemima her eyes widened jemima how on earth could i have known jemima from london he said thats why you call them horses isnt it youre not from round here youre not even from winchester and youre not from the countryside its to do with their size but you wouldnt know that would you you knew her from london gordon this is rubbish did that detective tell you showed me what what he told her then about the magazine spread the society pictures and her own among them at the national portrait gallery he told her there she was in the background at the gallery show where jemimas photo had been hung her posture altered as her body stiffened that she said is absolute rubbish the national portrait gallery i was no more there than i was in oz and when was i supposed to have been there the night the show opened my god she shook her head her eyes fixed on him she placed her orange juice on the work top the click made by the glass against the tiles sounded so sharp he expected the glass to shatter but it did not and what else am i supposed to have done killed jemima as well is that what you think she didnt wait for a reply she strode to the table and said give me that card whats her name again where is she gordon havers he said sergeant havers i dont know where shes gone she snatched the card from him and grabbed up the phone she punched in the numbers she waited for the call to go through she said at last is this sergeant haversthank youplease confirm that for gordon jossie sergeant she extended the phone to him she said id like you to be sure ive phoned her gordon and not someone else he took the phone he said sergeant her unmistakable london workingclass voice said bloody hell dyou know what time whats going on is that gina dickens you were sposed to ring me when she came home mr jossie gordon handed the phone back to gina who said to him archly satisfied darling and then into the phone sergeant havers where are yousway thank you please wait for me there i shall be half an hour all rightno no please dont ill come to you i want to see this magazine photo youve shown to gordontheres a dining room in the hotel isnt thereill meet you there she hung up the phone then turned back to him she looked at him the way one might view roadkill she said its extraordinary to me his lips felt dry what that it never occurred to you that it might only be someone who resembled me gordon how completely pathetic you and i have become after a night in which michele daughertys paranoia had entirely robbed her of sleep meredith powell had departed her parents house in cadnam leaving a note to tell her mother that shed gone into ringwood earlier than usual to deal with a massive pile of work after the previous days lecture from mr hudson meredith knew she couldnt afford any sort of cockup without putting her job in jeopardy but she also knew there was no way shed be able to apply herself creatively to graphic designs if she didnt sort out the enigma that was gina dickens so at five in the morning shed given up on the idea of sleep and shed brought herself down to gordon jossies holding where shed found a suitable place to park her car in the rutted entrance to a farmers field a short distance down the lane she reversed into this spot and settled down to gaze in the direction of gordons cottage itself hidden by the hedge at the edge of the property she spent a good deal of time trying to go over everything that gina dickens had said to her from the moment theyd met she found however that there was simply so much information that it was difficult to keep everything straight but that had likely been ginas intention from the first she concluded the more details gina dickens threw out the more difficult it would prove for meredith to sort through them all and get to the truth she just hadnt counted on meredith hiring michele daugherty to do the sorting for her because of the way things were developing meredith reckoned they were all in cahoots chief superintendent whiting gina dickens and gordon jossie she wasnt sure how the partnership among them worked but she was certain at this point that each of them had played a part in what had happened to jemima it was just after seven in the morning when gina reversed her shiny red mini cooper into the lane she headed in the general direction of mount pleasant and beyond it the southampton road meredith waited a moment and followed her there werent so many lanes in the area that she was likely to lose her and she didnt want to risk being seen gina drove casually the sunlight glinting off her hair because as before the top was down on her mini cooper she drove like someone out for a day in the countryside with her right arm resting on the upper ledge of the door when it wasnt raised to finger her windruffled hair she wound through mount pleasants narrow byways taking care to honk as a warning to potential oncoming cars when she rounded a curve and finally when she came to the southampton road she turned in the direction of lymington had the hour been later meredith would have assumed gina dickens meant to do her shopping indeed when she drifted across the roundabout and headed into marsh lane meredith briefly considered that gina might actually be getting a very early start on things by parking somewhere near lymington high street and perhaps having a morning coffee at a café that she knew would be open but in advance of the high street gina made another turn which took her over the river and for a moment that chilled her with its implication of flight meredith was certain gina dickens meant to catch the ferry that would take her to the isle of wight here again meredith was wrong albeit relieved gina went in the opposite direction when she reached the other side of the river setting a course towards the north in very short order she was on the straight towards hatchet pond meredith dropped back to remain unseen she worried she might lose gina at the junction just beyond hatchet pond and she peered ahead through the windscreen grateful for the bright sun and the way in which it winked on the chrome bits of ginas car allowing them to act as a guide as the pond loomed ahead meredith gave thought to the fact that gina dickens might be meeting someone there much as she herself had met gina a few days earlier but here again gina kept going and meredith saw her make the turn east towards beaulieus georgian redbrick cottages but instead of driving into the village gina went northwest at the triangular junction above hatchet pond and in less than two miles she turned into north lane yes was merediths thought north lane was an absolute treasure trove of meeting places while it was true that gina had taken a completely mad route to get to the area what couldnt be denied was that its woodlands and its inclosures provided the kind of seclusion that someone like ginawho was bloody well up to something meredith reckonedwould require north lane followed the beaulieu river which disappeared from sight off to the left beneath the trees and meredith dropped back once again she was familiar with this area as it ultimately brought one to the marchwood bypass which was the route to her own home in cadnam and when gina led her directly to this bypass instead of stopping anywhere at all along north lane merediths first assumption was that the other woman had spotted her following and intended to drive to merediths house where she would park get out of her car and wait for meredith to come sheepishly upon her but again she was wrong gina did indeed take them to cadnam but she made no stop there any more than shed stopped anywhere else along the way instead she now headed south towards lyndhurst and while meredith gave fleeting thought to the mad hatter tea rooms and gina dickens bedsit it made absolutely no sense to her that gina would drive to lyndhurst by this circuitous route thus meredith could hardly call herself surprised when gina cruised even farther south kept up the pace through brockenhurst and finally dipped onto the road towards sway sway of course was not her destination and meredith had twigged this long before gina made no turn towards that village instead she ended up back at gordon jossies holding where she had begun her wild ride like mr toad in his new motorcar as if out for a morning cruise to waste petrol and time meredith cursed for being a fool for putting her employment at risk and for being seen as she must have been seen for gina to have driven so uselessly round the countryside she also cursed gina for being wily more than a match for meredith and likely more than a match for everyone else still she paused for a moment instead of admitting defeat and heading to ringwood with a ready excuse to give to mr hudson as to the lateness of her arrival she pulled back into the spot shed earlier chosen to keep watch on gordon jossies house and she thought about her own consideration of ginas lengthy drive round the new forest wasting petrol and time shed concluded just a moment earlier and she realised there was something to this simple conclusion and that something was the wasting of time killing time was the expression she wanted if gina dickens hadnt spotted meredith wasnt it possible that killing time was what she had been doing as meredith weighed this possibility and the reasons for it the likeliest was the most obvious as well she was killing time so that gordon jossie would leave the property for his own employment allowing gina to return this did actually seem to be the reason meredith saw for from her place of hiding she heard the slam of the mini coopers door followed by a second door slam coming from the cottage as gina went inside meredith left the polo then and she sought a vantage point where roaming animals had munched a spy hole in the hedge along gordons property from here meredith could see both the cottage and the west paddock and as she observed them gina emerged from the cottage again shed changed her clothes where before shed worn a summer sundress now shed donned jeans and a tshirt and shed covered her blond head with a baseball cap she strode over to the barn disappeared within and a few moments later came out trundling a wheelbarrow from which the handles of various tools stuck out she wheeled this over to the west paddock there she opened the gate and then went inside considering the wheelbarrow and the tools meredith first concluded that now the ponies were gone gina intended to shovel up their manure and cart it off to a compost heap for future use it seemed a mad sort of employment for someone like gina but at this point meredith was beginning to reckon that pretty much anything was possible gina however began gardening of all bloody things not taking up or putting down manure but rather clipping madly away on an overgrown area at the far side of the paddock where gordon jossie had not made much progress in his rehabilitation of the fencing bracken weeds and brambles grew here they formed a mound that gina was attacking with some considerable vigour reluctantly meredith had to admire the energy that the young woman was putting into the activity she herself could have lasted no more than five minutes given the strength and the fury of ginas progress she clipped she threw she dug she clipped she threw she dug she clipped again the casual nature of her drive round the countryside appeared to be cast aside she was completely singleminded of purpose meredith wondered what the purpose was she had no time to dwell on possibilities however as she watched a car pulled into the holdings driveway having come to gordon jossies property from the direction beyond where meredith was standing she waited to see what would happen next and somehow she was not the least surprised when chief superintendent whiting looked round for a moment as if for watchers just like meredith and then walked over and into the paddock to speak to gina dickens when after a fortyminute wait gina dickens had still not shown up at the forest heath hotel in sway barbara havers reckoned that she was not coming sway was less than a tenminute drive from gordon jossies holding and it was inconceivable that gina had somehow got lost between the two locations barbara rang gordon jossies mobile phone in an attempt to locate her only to be told by jossie that gina had departed not fifteen minutes after phoning barbara she says its not her in that magazine picture he added yeah right was barbaras mental reply she rang off and shoved her mobile into her bag there was always the unlikely possibility that gina dickens had run herself off the road somewhere along the route to sway so she thought a quick recce of the area wouldnt be entirely amiss it took barbara little enough time to accomplish this the entire journey from sway to jossies holding required exactly two turns and the most complicated part was making a quick jog when one came to birchy hill road this was hardly a complex manoeuvre nonetheless barbara slowed to a crawl and peered round just in case there was a car upended into a hedge or catapulted into the sitting room of one of the nearby cottages there was nothing of the like and nothing at all the entire way to gordon jossies property when barbara arrived she found the place deserted jossie had gone off to work she reckoned and shed caught him on a rooftop when shed rung his mobile as for gina dickens who the hell knew where shed taken herself off to what was interesting though was what her disappearing act implied barbara had a look round the property to make sure that ginas car was not hidden away somewhere with gina herself cowering behind the cottage curtains finding no other car but jemima hastings figaro in its usual place barbara returned to her mini burley she thought was her next stop her mobile rang midway to the village at a point where shed pulled to the side of the road to have a look at her map in order to make sense of the myriad lanes she was finding herself in she flipped it open assuming that she was finally hearing from gina dickensno doubt with a ready excuse as to how she managed to get lost on the way to barbaras hotelbut she found it was di lynley ringing her superintendent ardery he informed her was more or less on board with barbaras unauthorised trip to hampshire but barbara needed to make it a quick one and she needed to bring back some sort of result whats that mean exactly barbara asked him it was the more or less part she questioned i assume it means she has a lot on her plate and shell deal with you later ah thats bloody reassuring barbara said shes getting rather a lot of pressure from hillier and from the directorate of public affairs he told her its to do with matsumoto shes come up with two efits but im afraid theyre not much use and the manner in which she got them turned out to be questionable so hilliers had her on the carpet hes given her two days to bring the case to a close if she doesnt shes finished theres a chance shes finished regardless as well lord and she told the team this thatll bloody well inspire confidence among the foot soldiers eh there was a pause no actually the team havent been told i found out yesterday evening hillier told you christ why he wants you back on leading the team another pause no isabelle told me lynley went on quickly saying something about john stewart and a confrontation but what barbara had heard served to block her awareness of anything else isabelle told me isabelle she thought isabelle when was this she finally asked him at the briefing yesterday afternoon he said im afraid it was one of johns typical i dont mean her faceoff with stewart barbara said i mean when did she tell you why did she tell you i did say yesterday evening where barbara what does this have to do with anything and by the way im telling you in confidence i probably shouldnt be telling you at all i hope you can keep the information to yourself she felt chilled at this and she didnt particularly want to consider what lay behind his remark she said politely so why are you telling me sir to bring you into the picture so you understand the needthe need towell i suppose the best way to put it is the need toto lasso information and bring it back as quickly as possible at this barbara was utterly gobsmacked she had no words with which to frame a reply hearing lynley stumble round in such a mannerlynley of all peoplelynley whod learned what he knew on the previous evening from isabellebarbara didnt want to venture another inch closer to the subject that she was inferring from his remarks his tone and his awkward language she also didnt want to think about why she didnt want to venture into that subject she said briskly well right cn you get those efits down to me cn you ask dee harriman to send them by fax i expect the hotel has a machine and you cn ask dee to ring them for the number forest heath hotel theyve probably got a computer as well if emails better dyou think theres any chance that one of the efits could be a woman disguised as a man lynley seemed relieved at this change in direction he matched her briskness when he said truth to tell i think anythings possible were relying on descriptions supplied by a man whos drawn sevenfoottall angels on the walls of his bedsitting room bloody hell barbara murmured quite she brought him up to date on gordon jossie his crooks and whether they matched up with the sort of crook that was used by the killer his reaction to the photo of gina dickens and the phone call shed had from that same woman she told him she was heading to burley for another conversation with rob hastings as well crooks and blacksmithing would be among her topics she said what she asked lynley was on for him frazer chaplin he told her and an earnest attempt at alibi breaking didnt he think that was akin to spitting in the wind she enquired when in doubt go back to the beginning he replied he said something about ending up in the beginning at the end of a journey and knowing the place for the first time but she reckoned this was some sort of mad quote come into his mind so she said yes well right whatever and rang off to go about her business going about her business she decided was the best balm for the disturbance she was feeling towards whatever business was going on with lynley she found rob hastings at home he was doing some kind of major cleaning of his land rover for he seemed to have it stripped of everything it could be stripped of without removing its engine tyres steering wheel and seats what had been inside it now lay on the ground round the vehicle and he was sorting through it he didnt exactly keep a pinneat land rover from the amount of clobber it looked to barbara as if the bloke used it as a mobile home late spring cleaning she asked him something like his weimaraner had come loping round the side of the house at the sound of barbaras mini and he told the dog to sit which it did at once although it panted and looked pleased to have a visitor on the property barbara asked hastings if he would show her his blacksmithing equipment and logically hastings asked her why she thought about deflecting his question but she decided his reaction to the truth might be more revealing she said that the weapon used upon his sister had likely been handmade by a blacksmith although she didnt tell him what the weapon was at this he didnt move his gaze fixed on her he said dyou think i killed my own sister now were looking for someone with access to blacksmiths equipment or to tools made by blacksmiths equipment barbara told him everyone who fits the bill and knew jemima is going to be examined i cant think youd want it any other way hastings dropped his gaze he admitted that he wouldnt she could see however when he showed her the equipment that it hadnt been used in years she knew little enough about the workings of a smithy but everything he owned that was related to his training and time as a blacksmith suggested that neither he nor anyone else had interfered with so much as its placement since it had first been deposited in the outbuilding where he kept it now everything was shoved and piled together with no room to move among it a heavy bench held most of the equipment tongs preens chisels forks and punches wroughtiron bars lay disused to one side of this in a hotchpotch pile and two anvils were upended against the front of the bench as well there were several old tubs three vices and what looked like a grinder there was tellingly however no forge even had this last not been the case the unmolested dust upon everything bore not a mark of having been disturbed in ages barbara saw all this at once but still took her time with an examination of everything there she finally nodded and thanked the agister she said im sorry it had to be done what was used to kill her then hastings sounded numb barbara said im sorry mr hastings but i cant it was a thatching tool wasnt it he said it has to be it was a thatching tool why because of him hastings looked towards the broad doorway through which theyd entered the old building in which his equipment was stored his face hardened barbara said mr hastings gordon jossies not the only thatcher weve spoken to in the investigation he has thatching equipment indeed no doubt but so does a bloke called ringo heath hastings thought about this heath trained jossie yes weve spoken to him my point is that every connection we make has to be tracked down and ticked off the list jossies not the only what about whiting he asked what about that connection between him and jossie we know theres something but thats all at this point were still working on it as well you might its taken whiting to jossies holding to have more than one hearttoheart with the bloke hastings told barbara about jemimas old friend and schoolmate meredith powell about what meredith powell had revealed to him about whitings trips to see jossie she had the information from gina dickens he said and he ended with and jossie was in london on the day jemima died or isnt that one of the connections youve made gina dickens found the rail tickets she got her hands on the hotel receipt barbara felt her eyes widen and her breath hissed in how long have you known this you had my card why didnt you ring me in london mr hastings or ds nkata you had his card as well either one of us because whiting said it was all in hand he told meredith the information had been sent up to london to you lot to new scotland yard a dirty cop she wasnt surprised barbara had known from the first that something was off with zachary whiting right from the moment hed looked at those forged letters in praise of gordon jossies performance as a student at winchester technical college ii hed slipped up there with his remark about the apprenticeship and now she and the good chief superintendent were going to have a little chat about it praise god she saw as she looked feverishly at her map of the new forest she had only to retrace her route from honey lane back through burley village from there it was a straight route to lyndhurst possibly she thought the only bloody straight route in all of hampshire she set off her mind was spinning gordon jossie in london on the day of jemimas death zachary whiting paying calls upon him ringo heath in possession of thatching tools gina dickens giving information to the chief superintendent and now meredith powell whom theyd have tracked down earlier had that bloody stupid isabelle ardery not ordered them precipitately back to london isabelle ardery isabelle told me which took barbara back to considering lynleythat last place she wanted to beso she forced herself again to whiting disguise that was it shed been thinking that the baseball cap and sunglasses comprised the disguise because it seemed so obviously one but what about the other dark clothes dark hair god whiting was bald as a newborn but putting his mitts on a wig would have been childs play for him wouldnt it her mind tumbling from point to point she paid scant attention to the road there was a y she hadnt taken note of on the map and she veered left when she came to it at the queens head pub on the edge of burley village she saw her error at once as the road began to narrowshed been meant to veer rightand she zipped into the broad car park behind the pub to turn round she began to negotiate her way past the tour coaches and that was when her mobile rang she excavated it and barked havers when she finally got it open drinks tonight luv a mans voice asked her what the bloody hell drinks tonight luv he sounded extremely intense drinks who the hell this is ds barbara havers who is this i realise that drinks tonight luv he spoke as if through gritted teeth drinks drinks drinks at this barbara twigged it was norman whatsisname from the home office her own official snout brought to her courtesy of dorothea harriman and her friend stephanie thompsonsmythe he was giving her the code words and they were meant to meet at the barclays cashpoint machine in victoria street and he had something for her and bloody hell she said norman im in hampshire tell me on the phone cant do darling he said breezily absolutely crushed with work at the moment but drinks tonight would be the ticket how about our regular watering hole cn i talk you into a gin and tonic at the regular place she thought frantically she said norman listen i cn get someone there inlets say an hour itll be a bloke hell say gin and tonic all right thats how youll know him in an hour norman at the cashpoint machine in victoria street gin and tonic norman someonell be there in the uk detention at the pleasure of the reigning monarcha euphemism for imprisonment for lifeis the only sentence that can be given to someone who is convicted of murder but that is the law as it is applied to murderers over twentyone years old in the case of john dresser the killers were children this as well as the sensational nature of the crime could not but have had an impact on mr justice anthony cameron as he considered what recommendations he would make upon intoning the required sentence the climate that surrounded the trial was hostile with an undercurrent of hysteria that could be seen most often in the reaction of those gathered outside the royal courts of justice whereas within the courtroom there was tension but no overt display of aggression towards the three boys outside the courtroom this was not the case initial displays of rage towards the three defendantscharacterised first by the moblike gatherings at their homes and then by repeated attempts to attack the armed vans in which they daily traveled to and from their trialsegued into organised demonstrations and culminated in what became known as the silent march for justice a noiseless gathering of an astonishing twenty thousand people who walked the distance from the barriers to the dawkins building site where they were led in candlelit prayer and where they listened to alan dressers broken eulogy for his little boy johns passing cannot go unmarkedalan dressers words of conclusionbecame the watchword for public sentiment one can only imagine how justice cameron wrestled with his decision regarding the recommendation he would make it was not for nothing that hed long been known as maximum tony for his propensity to let stand the maximum sentence at the conclusion of trials in his courtroom but hed never been faced with tenand elevenyearold criminals before and he could not have been blind to all the ways in which the perpetrators of this horrible deed were themselves only children his brief however demanded he consider only what would be appropriate for both retribution and deterrence his recommendation was a custodial sentence of eight years a punishment that in the eyes of the public and the tabloid press was deemed akin to walking away scotfree thus a series of heretofore unheardof legal maneuvers were made within a week the lord chief justice reviewed the case and increased the sentence to ten years but within six months the dressers had amassed a petition of signatures demanding that the killers be jailed for life this was a story that refused to die the tabloids had seized hold of john dressers parents and of john himself and had made his death a cause célèbre once the verdicts were handed down in the trial of his killers their identities and photographs could be revealed to the public as could salient details of his murder the monstrous nature of his killing became a rallying point for those who deemed punishment the only appropriate response to such a crime thus the home secretary became involved increasing the sentence once again to an incredible twenty years in order he said to assure the public that their confidence in the judicial system is not misplaced to allow them to see that crime will be punished no matter the age of the perpetrator there the sentence remained until it went before the european court in luxembourg where it was successfully argued by the boys lawyers that their rights were being infringed by the fact that a politicianwho would perforce be influenced by public opinionwas allowed to set the terms of their imprisonment when the boys prison term was reduced back to ten years the tabloids flung themselves once again into the fray those who loathed the entire idea of european unification seeing it as the root of all evils in the country used the luxembourg decision as an example of outside intrusion into the internal affairs of british society what would come next they pondered would it be luxembourg forcing the euro upon us what about a declaration that the monarchy would have to be abolished those who supported unification saw the wisdom in making no comment at all for any agreement with luxembourgs decision was a dangerous position to take somehow implying that a mere decade was suitable punishment for the torture and death of an innocent baby no one could possibly envy the officialselected or notwho had to make the decisions about the fate of michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker the nature of the crime has always suggested that the three boys were deeply disturbed social victims themselves there can be no doubt that their family circumstances were wretched but there can also be no doubt that other children grow up in circumstances just as wretched or worse and they do not kill small children in reaction perhaps the truth is that on their own as individuals the boys would not have committed an act of violence such as this one perhaps the truth is that it was a confluence of events that day that led to the abduction and the death of john dresser as an enlightened society surely we must admit that something at some level was wrong with michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker and equally as an enlightened society surely we owed those three boys relief in the form of direct intervention long before the crime ever occurred or at the very least therapeutic assistance once they were taken from their homes and held for trial can we not say that in failing to provide either intervention or assistance we as a society failed michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker just as surely as we failed to protect young john dresser from their attack upon him its a simple matter to declare the boys evil but even as we do so we must keep in mind that at the time of the crimes commission they were children and we must ask what purpose is served by putting children on public display for a criminal trial rather than by immediately providing them with the help they need chapter thirtyone shed said afterwards im not in love with you its just something that happened hed replied of course i understand completely shed gone on with no one can know about this hed said i think that might be the most obvious point shed said why are there others what obvious points other than im a woman and youre a man and these things sometimes happen of course there were other points hed thought aside from raw animal instinct there was his motivation to consider there was hers as well there was also what now what next and what do we do when the ground has shifted beneath our feet regret i suppose hed told her and do you because i dont as i said these things happen you cant say they havent happened to you of all people i wont believe that he wasnt quite as she seemed to think him but he didnt disagree with her he swung himself out of her bed sat on the edge and considered her question the answer was yes and it was also no but he didnt speak either hed felt her hand on his back it was cool and her voice had altered when she said his name no longer clipped and professional her voice waswas it maternal god no she was not in the least a maternal sort of woman shed said thomas if were to be lovers i cant just now had been his reply not that he couldnt conceive of himself as the lover of isabelle ardery but that he could conceive of it only too well and that frightened him for all it implied i ought to leave he said well speak later she had responded hed arrived home quite late hed slept very little in the morning he spoke by mobile to barbara havers a conversation hed have preferred to avoid as soon as he was able afterwards he set upon the work of frazer chaplin and his alibi dragonfly tonics had its offices in a mews behind brompton oratory and holy trinity church it faced the churchyard although a wall a hedge and a path separated the two across the alley from the establishment he saw that two vespas were parked one bright orange and the other fuchsia each bore transfers with dragonfly tonics printed upon them much like those hed seen on frazer chaplins motor scooter outside dukes hotel lynley parked the healey elliott directly in front of the building he paused to look at the array of goods that were displayed in its front window these consisted of bottles of substances with names like wakeup peach detox lemon and sharpenup orange he inspected these and thought wryly of the one hed choose had they only manufactured it show some sense strawberry came to mind so did get a grip grapefruit he could have used two of those he reckoned he went inside the office was quite spare aside from some cardboard boxes with the dragonfly tonics logo printed on the side there was only a reception desk with a middleaged woman sitting behind it she wore a mans seersucker suit at least it looked like a mans since its jacket hung loosely round her it was a size that would have fitted churchill she was stuffing brochures into envelopes and she continued with this as she said help you she sounded surprised it seemed that her day was rarely interrupted by someone wandering in off the street lynley asked her about their method of advertising and she jumped to the conclusion that he meant to cover the healey elliottvisible through the window from within the reception areawith dragonfly tonics transfers he shuddered inwardly at the thought of such a desecration he wanted to demand in outrage are you quite mad woman but instead he maintained an expression of interest she pulled from her desk a crisp manila folder from which she slid what appeared to be a contract she spoke of rates paid for the size and number of transfers applied and the typical mileage expected from the driver of the vehicle obviously she noted black cabs received the most money followed quite closely by motorcycle and motor scooter couriers what sort of driving did he do she asked lynley this prompted him to correct her notion he showed her his identification and he asked her about the records kept of people who had vehicles of one sort or another decoratedand he used that term looselywith the transfers from dragonfly tonics she told him that of course there were records because how else were people meant to be paid for swanning round london and regions beyond with advertising plastered to their vehicles lynley was hoping to discover that there was no frazer chaplin with a contract to advertise dragonfly tonics at all from this he had decided it could be assumed that the vespa frazer had shown to lynley outside dukes hotel was not his at all but one produced on a moments inspiration and declared to be a chaplin possession he gave the receptionist frazers name and asked if she could produce his contract unfortunately she did just that and all of it was as frazer had avowed the vespa was his it was lime green to it transfers had been applied they were in fact applied professionally in shepherds bush since dragonfly tonics hardly wanted a slapdash job done with them they were put on to last not to be easily removed and when they were removed at the end of the contract the vehicle would be repainted lynley sighed when he saw this unless frazer had used a different vehicle to get up to stoke newington they were back to any and all cctv films from the area and the possibility that one of them had recorded his vespa in the vicinity of the cemetery they were also back to the doortodoor slogwhich was going on anyway per isabelles instructionsand the hope that someone had seen the scooter or he reckoned they were down to frazer using someone elses scooter or motorcycle to get there because with ninety minutes to do what needed to be done and to get to dukes hotel on time afterwards he would have had to go to north london by that means there was simply no other way that he could have managed the traffic lynley was considering all this when his eyes lit upon the date of the contract one week before jemima died this prompted him to dwell on dates in general which made him realise there was a detail he had overlooked there was indeed another way the murder of jemima hastings could have been managed he thought he was getting into his car when havers rang him he said lynley whereupon the sergeant began babblingthere was no other word for itabout victoria street a cashpoint machine the home office and having a gin and tonic he thought at first that was what shed donehad a gin and tonic or two or threebut then in the midst of her frantic monologue he picked up the word snout and from this he finally was able to decipher that she was asking him to meet someone at a cashpoint in victoria street although he still wasnt sure why he was meant to do this as she finally drew breath he said havers whats this got to do with he was in london the day she died jossie and whitings known it all along that got his attention whos given you that information hastings the brother and then she banged on about gina dickens and someone called meredith powell as well as tickets receipts gordon jossies habit of wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap and wasnt that exactly how yukio matsumoto had described the man hed seen in the cemetery and please please get down to victoria street to that cashpoint because whatever norman whatsisname knows he isnt spilling it on the phone and they need to know what it is she herself was going to beard whiting in his den or whatever the proper term was but before she could do that she needed to know what norman had to say so they were back to norman and lynley had to get to victoria street and where was he anyway she took another breath which gave lynley the chance to tell her he was in ennismore gardens mews behind brompton oratory and holy trinity church he was working on the frazer chaplin end of things and he reckoned sod frazer chaplin for a lark was her reply this is hot this is whiting and this is the trail for gods sake inspector i need you to do this what about winston where is he it has to be you look winnies doing those cctv films isnt he the stoke newington films and anyway if norman whoevergod why cant i remember his bloody namehes a public school bloke he wears pink shirts hes got that voice he says every sentence so far back in his throat that you practically need to perform a tonsillectomy just to excavate the words if winnie shows up at the cashpoint machine and starts talking to himwinnie of all peoplewinniesir think it through all right lynley said havers all right thank you thank you she intoned this things all a tangle but i think were getting it sorted he wasnt so sure for every time he made that his consideration further facts seemed only to complicate matters he made good time over to victoria street by carving a route that took him ultimately through belgrave square he parked in the underground car park at the met and walked back over to victoria street where he found the barclays cashpoint machine closest to broadway next to a rymans stationery shop havers snout was a case of byhisclothesshalttheeknowhim his shirt wasnt pink it was bright fuchsia and his necktie featured ducklings he clearly wasnt cut out for a life of intrigue since he was pacing the pavement and pausing to peer into the window of rymans as if studying which kind of filing tray he wished to purchase lynley felt inordinately foolish but he approached the man and said norman when the other started he said to him affably barbara havers thought i might interest you in a gin and tonic norman cast a look left and right he said christ for a moment i thought you were one of them one of whom look we cant talk here he looked at his watch one of those multidial affairs useful for diving and one presumed going to the moon as well he said as he did so act like youre asking me the time please reset your own watch or somethingchrist you carry a pocket watch ive not seen one of those in family heirloom lynley looked at the time as norman made much of showing him the face of his own piece lynley wasnt sure which one of the dials he was meant to look at but he nodded cooperatively we cant talk here norman said when theyd completed this part of the charade whyever cctv norman murmured weve got to go somewhere else theyre going to pick us up on film and im dead if they do this seemed wildly dramatic until lynley realised norman was talking about losing his job and not his life he said i think thats a bit of a problem dont you therere cameras everywhere look go up to the cash machine get some money im going into rymans to make a purchase you do the same norman rymans will likely have a camera just bloody do it norman said through his teeth it came to lynley that the man was honestly afraid not just playing at spies and spy masters so he fished out his bank card and went to the cashpoint machine cooperatively he withdrew some money ducked into rymans and found norman looking at a display of sticky pads he didnt join him there assuming that proximity would unnerve the man instead he went to the greeting cards and studied them picking up one then another then a third and fourth a man intent upon finding something appropriate when he saw norman at last approach the till he chose a card at random and did likewise it was there they had their extremely brief têteàtête spoken in a fashion that norman seemed intent upon making look as casual as possible if such was even conceivable considering he spoke out of the side of his mouth he said theres something of a scrum over there at the home office whats going on its definitely to do with hampshire he said its something big something serious and theyre moving dead fast to deal with it before word gets out isabelle ardery had spent a good number of years putting the details of her life into separate compartments thus she had no difficulty doing just that on the day following thomas lynleys call upon her there was di lynley on her team and there was thomas lynley in her bed she had no intention of confusing the two besides she was not stupid enough to consider their encounter as anything other than sex mutually satisfying and potentially duplicable beyond that her daytime dilemma at the met did not allow for even a moment of recollection about anything and especially about her previous night with lynley for this was day one in the end of days scenario that assistant commissioner hillier had spelled out for her and if she was going to be shown the door at new scotland yard then it was her intention to go out of that door with a case sewn up behind her this was her thinking when lynley arrived in her office she felt a disagreeable jump of her heart at the sight of him so she said briskly what is it thomas and she rose from her desk brushed past him and called into the corridor dorothea whatre we hearing from the stoke newington doortodoor and wheres winston got to with that cctv footage she got no reply and shouted dorothea where the hell and then said damn it and returned to her desk where again she said what is it thomas but this time remained standing he started to close the door she said leave it open please he turned this isnt personal he said nonetheless he left the door as it was she felt herself flush all right go on whats happened it was a mix of information from which she ultimately sorted that ds haverswho seemed to have a bloodyminded bent for doing whatever the hell she felt like doing when it came to a murder investigationhad unearthed someone within the home office to do some digging on the topic of a policeman in hampshire hed not got farthis snout of haverswhen he was called into the office of a significantly placed higherup civil servant whose proximity to the home secretary was rather more than disturbing why was zachary whiting on the mind of a home office underling was the enquiry that was made of norman norman did some fancy footwork to save his own skin lynley said but hes managed to come up with something we might find useful which is what whitings apparently been given the charge of protecting someone extremely important to the home office someone in hampshire someone in hampshire its a highlevel protection the highest level its the sort of level that causes bells and whistles to go off everywhere when anyone gets remotely close to it the bells and whistles norman gave me to understand go off directly within the home secretarys office isabelle lowered herself into her chair she nodded at a second chair and lynley sat what dyou expect were dealing with thomas she considered the options and saw the likeliest someone whos infiltrated a terrorist cell with the informer being protected now thats highly possible lynley said but therere other possibilities as well arent there not as many as youd think not at the highest level he said not with the home secretary involved theres terrorism as youve said with an infiltrator going into hiding prior to a bust theres protection for a witness set to testify in a highprofile case coming to court like an organised crime case a sensitive murder case where the repercussions a stephen lawrence thing indeed theres also protection from hired killers a fatwa or the russian mafia or albanian gangsters but whatever it is its something big its something important and whiting knows exactly what it is right because whoever it is the home office is protecting this persons in whitings patch in a safe house perhaps but he might also be living under a new identity she looked at him he looked at her they were both silent both evaluating the possibilities and comparing those possibilities to everything else they knew gordon jossie isabelle said at last protecting jossie is the only explanation for whitings behaviour those forged letters of recommendation from winchester technical college whitings knowledge of an apprenticeship for jossie when barbara showed those letters to him lynley agreed havers is on the trail of something else isabelle shes fairly certain jossie was in london the day that jemima hastings was murdered he told her more about his phone call with havers her report to him on the subject of her conversation with rob hastings hastings revelation about the train tickets and the hotel receipt and whitings assurances given to a woman called meredith powell that this information had been sent to london she said shes called meredith powell whyve we not heard about her before now and why frankly is sergeant havers reporting to you and not to me lynley hesitated his frank gaze shifted from her to the window behind her it came to her that hed occupied this office himself only a short time ago and she wondered if he wanted it back now that she was done for he was certainly in line to have it back if he so desired and he could have little doubt that he was better equipped to have it back as well she said sharply thomas why is barbara reporting to you and whyve we not heard about this meredith powell before now he returned his gaze to her he answered only the second of her questions although an answer to the first was implied when he said you wanted havers and nkata to return to london he didnt say it as an accusation it was hardly his style to mention what a cockup shed made of things but then he didnt need to when everything was so obvious now she swung her chair to the window god she murmured ive been wrong from the first about everything i wouldnt say oh please she turned back to him lets not go easy on me thomas its not that its a matter of guv at the doorway philip hale was standing he had a slip of paper in his hand found matt jones he told her the matt jones are we sure of that pieces seem to fit and mercenary soldier of fortune whatever works for a group called hangtower most of the time in the middle east is anyone telling us what sort of work just that its top secret for which we can read assassinations probably thank you philip isabelle said he nodded and left them casting a glance at lynley that needed no translation so clearly did it telegraph hales own conclusion about how their superintendent had deployed him in the investigation had she left him where hed belonged theyd have sorted out matt jones and everyone else days ago instead shed forced him to remain at st thomas hospital it had been a punitive measure she thought now showing the worst kind of leadership she said i can hear hillier already lynley said isabelle dont worry about hillier nothing that weve learned so far today why are you operating from the whats done is done school of thought with that bit of advice or is this a case of things about to get worse she eyed him and read on his face that there was something else he hadnt yet told her his mouth curved in a half smile a fond sort of expression that she didnt much like she said what last evening he began we arent going to talk about that she said fiercely last evening he repeated firmly wed worked it all out and it came down to frazer chaplin isabelle nothing weve learned today changes that indeed what barbaras managed to come up with reinforces the direction were heading and as she was about to question this he said hear me out if whitings charge is to protect gordon jossie for whatever reason we know two things that were stymieing us last evening she considered this and saw where he was going the roman treasure she said if there is one lets assume there is we were asking ourselves why jossie wouldnt have immediately reported what hed found as he was meant to do and now we know consider his position if he digs up a roman hoard or even part of a roman hoard and phones the authorities the next thing is that a pack of journalists show up to talk to him about the whys and the wherefores of what hes found this sort of thing cant be kept under his hat not if its a hoard remotely like the mildenhall or the hoxne treasures in very short order the police turn up to cordon off the area archaeologists arrive experts from the bm show up i daresay the bbc show up as well and there he is on the morning news hes supposed to be in hiding and the gaffe is irredeemably blown isabelle its the last thing he could have wanted she said thoughtfully but jemima hastings doesnt know that does she because she doesnt know hes being protected exactly he hasnt told her he hasnt seen the need or perhaps he doesnt want to tell her perhaps she was with him when he found the treasure isabelle said or perhaps he brought something into their house because he himself didnt yet know what he had he cleans it off he shows it to her they return to the spot where hes found it and and they find more lynley finished jemima knows it has to be reported or at least she assumes theyre supposed to do something besides dig it up clean it off and display it on the mantelpiece and they can hardly spend it can they isabelle said theyd want to do something with it so shed need to find outanyone wouldwhat one actually does with such a find this lynley noted puts jossie in the worst possible position he cant allow his discovery to be publicly known so he kills her thomas isabelle felt deflated be reasonable hes the only one with motive lynley shook his head isabelle hes practically the only one without a motive the last thing on earth he wants is to have anyones attention focused on him and its going to be focused on him intensely should he kill her because she lives with him if hes in hiding hes going to be desperate to remain in hiding isnt he if jemima is insistent upon dealing with the treasure appropriatelyand why wouldnt she be since selling it on the open market will bring them a fortunethen the only way to stop this and to keep himself out of the public eye isnt to kill her at all my god isabelle murmured her glance locked on his its to tell her the truth and thats why she left him thomas she knew who he was he had to tell her and thats why he came looking for her in london because he was worried that she might tell someone else isabelle saw the pieces click neatly into place which was what she did she told frazer chaplin not at first of course but once she saw those postcards of her photo from the portrait gallery with gordon jossies mobile number on them but why why tell frazer is she afraid of jossie for some reason if shes left him i think we can assume she either wanted nothing more to do with him or she wanted time to consider what she was going to do shes afraid shes repulsed shes worried shes staggered shes concerned shes greedy for the treasure shes had her life fall to pieces she knows that to continue living with him puts her in dangerit could be any number of things that send her to london it could be one reason that morphed into another she runs away first she meets frazer second they become involved she tells him the truth so you see it comes back to frazer isabelle said why doesnt it come back to paolo di fazio since shes been lovers with him and hes seen the postcards or abbott langer for that matter or she ended her relationship with paolo prior to the postcards and langer never saw them jayson druther if it comes down to it frazer has a bloody alibi thomas lets break it then lets do it now first lynley told her they needed to stop in chelsea for another call upon deborah and simon st james it was on the route they were going to take anyway he said and he reckoned the st jameses had in their possession something that might prove quite useful a pause in the incident room brought forth information from winston nkata that the cctv tapes were showing nothing more than they had showed before which was also nothing specifically there was documented on film no limecoloured vespa belonging to frazer chaplin and shouting advertisements for dragonfly tonics hardly a surprise isabelle thought she also discovered that like lynley ds nkata had spoken to the maddening barbara havers that morning according to barb tip of the thatchers crook shows who made it he said but she says to cross the brother off the list robert hastingss got blacksmith clobber on his property she says but its not been used n the other hand jossies got three kinds of crooks and one of the kindss like our weapon she wants to know bout the efits s well ive asked dee to send them down to her lynley told him isabelle told nkata to carry on and she followed lynley to the car park at the st james house they found the couple at home st james himself came to the door with the family dachshund barking frantically round his ankles he admitted isabelle and lynley and admonished the dog who blithely ignored him and continued barking until deborah called out good lord simon do something about her from a room to the right of the staircase this turned out to be the dining room a formal affair of the sort one found in creaking old victorian houses it was decorated as such as well at least as far as the furniture went there was mercifully no plethora of knickknacks and no william morris wallpaper although the dining table was heavy and dark and a sideboard held a mass of english pottery when they joined her deborah st james was apparently using the table to examine photographs which she quickly gathered up as they entered lynley said to her ah no in some sort of reference to these deborah said really tommy id be far happier if you read me less easily teatime not being my cup of tea right thats disappointing lynley said but i did think afternoon tea might not behmmshall i say a strong enough vignette to display your talents very amusing simon are you going to allow him to make fun or do you plan to rise to my defence i thought id wait to discover how far the two of you could carry an appalling pun st james had come only to the doorway and he was leaning there against the jamb youre as merciless as he is deborah said hello to isabellecalling her superintendent arderyand she excused herself to throw this wretched stuff into the rubbish over her shoulder as she went out of the room she asked if they wanted a coffee she admitted that it had been sitting on the hot plate in the kitchen for hours but with the addition of milk and several tablespoons of sugar she reckoned it would be drinkable or i could make fresh she offered weve not got time lynley said we were hoping to have a word with you deb isabelle heard this with some surprise as shed concluded theyd come to chelsea not to pay a call on deborah st james but rather on her husband deborah seemed as surprised as isabelle but she said in here then its much more hospitable in here was a library of sorts isabelle reckoned as she and lynley entered it was situated where one would normally expect to find a sitting room with its window overlooking the street there were masses of bookson shelves on tables and upon the flooralong with comfortable chairs a fireplace and an ancient desk there were newspapers as well piles of them it looked to isabelle as if the st jameses subscribed to every broadsheet in london as a woman who liked to travel light and live unencumbered isabelle found the place overwhelming deborah appeared to note her reaction because she said its simon hes always been like this superintendent you cn ask tommy they were at school together and simon was the despair of their housemaster hes not improved in the least since please just shove something to the floor and sit and its not usually this bad well you know that tommy dont you she glanced at lynley as she said this last then her gaze went back to isabelle and she smiled quickly it was not in amusement or friendliness isabelle realised but to cover something isabelle found a spot that required the least amount of removal she said please its isabelle not superintendent and again that quick smile in return from deborah followed by her glance at lynley she was reading something directly off him isabelle reckoned she also reckoned that deborah st james knew thomas far better than her airiness suggested isabelle then deborah said and then to lynley hes got to have it tidied by next week at any rate hes promised your mothers paying a visit i take it lynley said to st james all of them laughed it came to isabelle once again that the group of them spoke some form of shorthand she wanted to say yes well lets get on with things but something held her back and she didnt like what that something told her either about herself or about her feelings she didnt have feelings in this matter lynley brought them round to the purpose of their call he asked deborah st james about the national portrait gallery show might he have another copy of the magazine with pictures taken on the opening night barbara havers had the magazine off him but he recalled deborah had another deborah said of course and went to one of the stacks of periodicals where she dug down to unearth a magazine she handed this over then she found anothera different one thisand handed that to lynley as well she said really i didnt buy them all tommy simons brothers and his sisterand then dad was rather proud her face had coloured lynley said solemnly in your position id have done exactly the same shes claiming her fifteen minutes st james said to lynley youre both impossible deborah said and to isabelle they like to tease me st james asked not unreasonably what lynley wanted with the magazine what was happening he wanted to know this had to do with the case hadnt it indeed lynley told him they had an alibi to break and he reckoned the photos of the gallery opening were going to be helpful in breaking it with the magazines in their possession they were ready to set out on the next phase of their journey isabelle couldnt see how a set of society photographs were going to be useful and that was what she told lynley once they were out on the pavement again they got into the healey elliott before he replied he handed the magazines to her he leaned over when she found the photos of the national portrait gallerys opening show and he pointed to one of them frazer chaplin he said the fact that he was at the opening was going to serve as the wedge they needed for what to separate a lie from the truth she turned to him he was of a sudden disturbingly close he seemed to know this because he looked as if he was about to say something else or worse do something that both of them would come to regret she said and exactly what truth would that be he moved away he turned on the ignition he said when i thought about it the date on his contract didnt mean anything what date what contract the contract with dragonfly tonics frazer chaplins agreement to use his vespa to advertise the product the contract called for a bright colour of paint it designated the number of transfers required his signature makes it appear as if he went out directly and had the work done he didnt she said understanding now winstons watching those films for a lime green vespa with transfers the house to house is asking about a lime green vespa with transfers something likely to be seen and remembered when he didnt use a lime green vespa with transfers to get up to stoke newington at all he nodded i rang the paint shop in shepherds bush after i spoke to barbara about meeting her snout frazer chaplin went there indeed to have the vespa painted and the transfers applied but he did it the day after jemima died bella mchaggis was wrestling a new wormcomposting bin from her car when scotland yard arrived her visitors comprised the two officers shed spoken to at the met on the day when shed found poor jemimas handbag they parked across the street from bellas house in an antique motorcar which was how she noticed them at first because of the car itself the appearance of such a vehicle in oxford roador any road she reckonedwas going to draw attention it spoke of indulgence money by the bucketful and petrol swallowed down willynilly where was conservation she wondered where was good sense she couldnt remember their names but she nodded a greeting as they came across the street towards her the manhe politely reintroduced himself as di lynley and his companion as superintendent arderytook over the removal of the composting bin from bellas car he had manners there was no doubt about it somebody had brought him up correctly which was more than one could say about most people under the age of forty these days obviously they hadnt come to putney to help her with her worm composting so bella asked them into the house the inspector needed to put the bin into the back garden anyway and since the only way to get there was through the house once they were inside bella did the proper thing and offered them a cup of tea they demurred but they did saythis was the woman superintendent arderythat theyd like a word bella said of course of course and she added stoutly that she hoped theyd come to tell her an arrest had been made in this terrible affair of jemimas death they were close di lynley said theyd come to talk to her about frazer chaplin the superintendent added she said it kindly and the kindness made bellas antennae go up she said frazer whats this about frazer havent you done anything at all about that psychic mrs mchaggis it was lynley now bella didnt half like the way he sounded which was unaccountably regretful less did she like his expression because it suggested to her an element ofwas it pity she felt her spine stiffen what she barked she felt like showing them the door she wondered how many more times she was going to have to direct these stupid people where they needed directing which was on to yolanda the flipping psychic lynley again he began an explanation of sorts it had to do with jemimas mobile and calls made to it on the day of her death and calls made to it after her death and pinging towers whatever they were frazer had rung her within the time frame of her death it seemed but he had not rung her afterwards which apparently was suggesting to the coppers that frazer thus had murdered the poor girl if there was ever anything more nonsensical than that bella mchaggis did not know what it was then the woman copper chimed in her explanation had to do with frazers motorbike she banged on about its colour the transfers he had put upon it to raise a bit of needed money and how transporting oneself on a scooter like frazers made getting round town a rather simple thing bella said hang on just a minute because she wasnt as thick as they seemed to think and she suddenly understood where this was heading she pointed out that if it was scooters they were interested in had they thought about the fact that the scooter they were yammering about was an italian scooter and italian scooters could be hired for the day and she had an italian living right there in her house one whod been thick as you know what with jemima before jemima had ended things between them and didnt that damn well suggest that they ought to be looking at paolo di fazio if they were so intent upon pinning this crime on someone in bellas house mrs mchaggis lynley again those soulful eyes brown why did the man have hair so blond and yet eyes so brown to go with it bella didnt want to listen and she certainly didnt want to hear she reminded them that nothing of what they were saying mattered because frazer hadnt been anywhere close to stoke newington on the day of jemima hastings death hed been exactly where he always was between his work at the ice rink and his job at dukes hotel hed been here in this house showering and changing shed told them that shed bloody well told them how many more times was she going to have to has he seduced you mrs mchaggis it was the woman who asked the question and she asked it baldly they were all sitting at the kitchen table and there was a set of condiment containers on it and bella wanted to hurl them at the woman or perhaps at the wall but she didnt do so she said instead how dare you which she realised was an antique remark that betrayed her age more than anything else she might have said young peoplepeople like these two officerstalked about this sort of thing all the time they didnt use the word seduce either when they talked about it among themselves and they thought nothing of what it meant to invade someones privacy in such a way its what he does mrs mchaggis the superintendent said we already have confirmation on this from this house has rules bella told them stiffly and im not that sort of woman to suggesteven to thinkeven to begin to think she was sputtering and she knew it she expected this made her seem a perfect fool in their eyes an old bag whod somehow fallen victim to a smoothtalking lothario come to remove her from her money when she had no money in the first place so why would he have even bothered with the likes of her she gathered her wits she gathered what dignity she had left she said i know my lodgers i make a habit of knowing my lodgers because im sharing a bloody house with them and im not very likely to want to share my house with a murderer am i she didnt wait for them to reply to this question which was largely rhetorical anyway she said so you listen to me because im not going to repeat myself frazer chaplins been here in this house from the first week i started letting rooms and i think id have sorted out that he waswhatever you seem to think he isa bloody long time before now dont you the two cops exchanged a long look it was the man who picked up the conversation next he said youre right that wasnt a particularly helpful direction i think the superintendent merely meant that frazers got something of an appeal for women what if he does she demanded its hardly his fault i wouldnt disagree lynley went on to ask could they just go back over what shed told them about frazers whereabouts on the day that jemima hastings died she said shed told them shed told them and told them and telling them again was not going to change things frazer had done what he always did which turned out to be their point if one day looked exactly like another in the life of frazer chaplin was there a possibility that she was mistaken that she was merely telling them what she thought hed done that he had perhaps done or said something later on to make her believe or assume hed been home during that time when he was usually home while the truth of the matter was that he wasnt at home at all did she always see him when he came home to shower and change between his two jobs did she always hear him was she always in fact here at that time did she sometimes go to the shops putter round the back garden meet a friend go out for a coffee become caught up in a phone conversation or a television programme or a commitment to something that took her out of the house or even to another part of the house resulting in the possibility that she didnt actually know couldnt swear to hadnt seen couldnt confirm bella felt dizzy they were spinning her round and round with all their possibilities the truth of the matter was that frazer was a good boy and they couldnt see this about him because they were cops and she knew about cops she did didnt they all didnt they all know that what cops did best was find a supposed killer and then massage the facts to pin guilt upon him and hadnt the newspapers shown that to the public time after time with the met putting supposed ira blokes away for years on spurious evidence and god god frazer was irish god he was irish and didnt that make him guilty in their eyes then lynley started talking about the national portrait gallery he mentioned jemima and jemimas picture and bella understood from this that the topic had changed moving from frazer to society photos and frankly she was only too happy to look at them something too coincidental for our liking lynley was saying he mentioned someone by the name of dickens and he connected that person to hampshire for some reason and then he said something more about frazer and then jemima and then it didnt matter at all because whats she doing there bella demanded she went quite lightheaded and her hands got icy who lynley asked her her and bella used her icy finger to point at the picture that was bringing reality home it was coming at her fast an express train from the truth its whistle blew fool fool fool and the sound was deafening as the train screamed towards her thats the woman were talking about the superintendent told her leaning over to have a look at the woman in the photograph thats gina dickens mrs mchaggis were assuming that frazer met her that night gina dickens bella said youre both mad thats georgina francis large as life i tossed her out last year for breaking one of my rules which rule the superintendent asked the rule about fool fool fool yes the detective inspector urged her frazer her bella said fool fool fool fool he said she was gone he said he never saw her once she left he said she was the one who wanted himbut he didnt want it at allnot with her ah i expect he lied to you lynley told her may we talk again about what you remember of the day that jemima hastings died chapter thirtytwo she was in big trouble no doubt about it she was already so late for work that meredith knew she was going to have to come up with an excuse for her absence that was akin to an alien abduction anything less was unlikely to result in her continued employment and it was going to be absence at this point not mere tardiness that was certain for once she saw zachary whiting in conversation with gina dickens meredith felt afire to take action and the action she felt afire to take had nothing to do with driving over to ringwood and sitting obediently within her cubicle at gerber hudson graphic design still she didnt ring mr hudson she knew she ought but she couldnt bring herself to do it he was going to be livid and she reckoned if she could somehow sort out gina dickens zachary whiting gordon jossie and jemimas death by the end of the day emerging as a heroine who wrestles villains into submission would bring her enough glory to translate into a chance that she wouldnt lose her job she felt a bit like a headless chicken at first seeing the chief superintendent chatting with gina dickens she hadnt known what to do what to think or where to go she crept back to her car and started off in the direction of lyndhurst because that was where the police station was and one was meant to rely on the police only what was the point in going there she realised when the head of the lyndhurst police was here and he was obviously thick as thieves with gina dickens meredith pulled to the side of the road and she tried to sort through what shed heard from gina dickens what shed discovered about her during her own investigation and what shed learned about her from michele daugherty she tried to remember every statement made to her and from these statements she tried to sort out who gina dickens really was what she ended up with was the decision that there had to be something somewhere about gina a piece of truth about her that gina herself had not realised she was revealing meredith needed to find that truth because when she found it it would tell her exactly what to do the problem of course was the where of it where was she supposed to find this piece of truth if gina dickens did not actually exist then what was shemeredith powellsupposed to do to sort out who she really was and why she was in cahoots with chief superintendent whiting in the matter ofwhat what exactly was the reason for their partnership it seemed to meredith that any information about gina her purpose in hampshire and her true identity was information that gina herself would keep quite close she would keep it secreted on her person or in her bag or in her car perhaps except meredith thought that didnt make sense gina dickens couldnt risk it for gordon jossie might well stumble upon it if she kept it nearby and gina would know that so shed want some place far more secure to keep the key to who she really was and what she was up to meredith grasped the steering wheel tightly as she realised the obvious answer there was one spot where gina could be freely who she really was within the four walls of her own bedsitting room for while meredith had searched that room from top to bottom she hadnt looked everywhere had she she hadnt looked between the mattress and the box springs on the bed for instance nor had she removed drawers to look for anything that might be taped beneath them or behind pictures for that matter that damn bedsitting room had to hold all the answers meredith reckoned because when it came down to it it had never made sense that gina would be living with gordon while maintaining her own digs did it why go to the expense of doing that unless there was a reason so the answers to every riddle about gina dickens were in lyndhurst where they had always been for not only was lyndhurst the site of ginas room but it was also the location of whitings police station and how bloody convenient was that despite all of this delicate thinking and supposing meredith knew she was perilously close to being completely out of her depth in the situation murder police malfeasance false identitiesnone of this was exactly up her alley still she knew she had to get to the bottom of everything because there seemed to be no one else who was interested in doing so althoughof course meredith thought she took out her mobile and punched in rob hastings number he wasas wonderful luck would have itactually in lyndhurst he wasas less than wonderful luck would have itjust stepping into a meeting of all the agisters which was likely to go on for more than ninety minutes and closer to two hours she said to him in a rush rob its gina dickens and that chief superintendent its them together and theres no gina dickens at all anyway and chief superintendent whiting told michele daugherty that she had to stop looking into gordon jossie but she hadnt even started the process of looking into him yet and hang on whatre you banging on about rob asked merry what the hell whos michele daugherty she said im going to her room in lyndhurst michele daughertys room ginas room shes got a bedsit over the mad hatter rob on the high street you know where it is the tea rooms over the road from course i know he said but theres got to be something there something i overlooked the last time will you meet me there its important because i saw them together on gordons property rob he drove right up and got out and went into the paddock and they stood there talking whiting yes yes who else thats what ive been trying to tell you he said scotland yards back merry its a woman called havers you need to ring her about this ive got her number scotland yard rob how cn we trust them if we cant trust whiting theyre all cops and what do we tell them that whitings talking to gina dickens who isnt really gina dickens anyway except we dont know who she is no no weve got to merry for gods sake listen i told this womanthis haverseverything what you told me about whiting how you gave him the information how he said it was all in hand shell want to hear whatever else you know i expect shell want to see that bedsit as well listen to me that was when he told her he was heading into the agisters meeting he couldnt skip it because among other things he had tooh never mind he said he just had to be there and she had to ring the detective from scotland yard oh no she cried oh no oh no if i do that theres no way shell agree to break into ginas room you know that break in he said break in merry whatve you got planned he went on to ask could she wait for him he would meet her at the mad hatter immediately after his meeting he would be there as soon as he could dont do anything mad he told her promise me merry if something happens to you he stopped at first she said nothing then she promised and quickly rang off she intended to keep her promise and to wait for rob hastings but when she got to lyndhurst she knew that waiting was out of the question she couldnt wait whatever was up there in ginas room was something she intended to put her hands on now she parked by the new forest museum and hoofed up lyndhurst high street to the mad hatter tea rooms at that time of morning the tea rooms were open and doing a brisk business so no one took notice of meredith as she went through the doorway set at an angle to the tea rooms themselves she dashed quickly up the stairs at the top she was stealthy about her movements she listened at the doorway of the room opposite ginas no sound from within she tapped upon it just to make sure no one answered good once again there would be no witness to what she was about to do she fished in her bag for her bank card her hands felt slick but she reckoned it was nerves there was more menace about breaking into ginas room than there had been the last time shed done so then her suspicions had driven her now she had certain knowledge she fumbled with the card and dropped it twice before she finally managed to get the door open a final time she looked round the corridor she stepped inside the room there was sudden movement to her left a rush of air and a blur of darkness the door shut behind her and she heard an inner bolt driven home she swung round and found herself facetoface with an utter stranger a man for a moment and it was just a single moment her mind said ridiculously and in rapid succession that shed got the wrong room that the room had been let out to someone else that ginas room had never been here above the mad hatter in the first place and then her mind said she was in real danger for the man grabbed her arm swung her round clamped his hand brutally over her mouth she felt something press into her neck it was wickedly sharp now what have we here he whispered in her ear and what are we going to do about it once he received the phone call from the scotland yard sergeant gordon jossie knew hed reached the absolute endgame with gina there had been a moment in the kitchen that morning when ginas denials about jemima had nearly convinced him she was speaking the truth but after ds havers phoned him wondering why gina had not shown up at her hotel in sway he understood that being convinced by gina had more to do with how he wanted things to be than how things actually were that indeed served as a good description of his entire adult life he thought morosely there had been at least two years of that lifethose years after hed first met jemima and become enmeshed with herwhen hed developed a fantasy future it had seemed as if the fantasy could be turned into reality because of jemima herself and because shed seemed to need him so shed appeared to need him the way a plant needs decent soil and adequate water and hed reckoned that that kind of need would make the mere fact of having a man in her life more important than who the man was shed seemed exactly what hed been looking for although he hadnt been looking at all there had been no sense to looking hed decided not when the world he had constructed for himselfor perhaps better said the world that had been constructed for himcould come crashing down round his ears at any time and then suddenly there she had been on longslade bottom with her brother and his dog and there he had been with tess and she had been the one to make the first move as it was called an invitation to her brothers house which was her own house an invitation for drinks on a sunday afternoon although he didnt drink couldnt and wouldnt ever risk a drink hed gone because of her eyes ridiculous now to think thats why hed driven to burley to see her again but that was it hed never seen anyone with two entirely differentcoloured eyes and hed liked studying them or at least that was what hed told himself so hed gone and the rest of it what did it matter the rest had brought him to where he was now her hair was longer those months later when he saw her in london after shed left him it seemed a bit lighter as well but that could have been a trick of memory as to the remainder of the package that was jemima she was all the same he hadnt understood at first why shed chosen the cemetery in stoke newington for their meeting but when he saw the place with its winding paths ruined monuments and unrestrained growth of vegetation he realised her choice had had to do with not being seen in his company this should have reassured him about her intentions but still hed wanted to hear it from her lips hed also wanted both the coin and the stone returned to him those he was determined to have he had to have them because if she kept them in her possession there was no telling what shed do with them shed said so how did you find me i know about the postcards but how who he said he didnt know whod phoned him just that it was a blokes voice telling him about the cigar shop in covent garden shed said a man to herself not to him she seemed to be going over in her mind the various possibilities there would he knew likely be many jemima had never gone in for friendship with other women in a big way but men she had sought men who somehow completed her in ways that friendship with women never could he wondered if that was why jemima had died perhaps a man had misunderstood the nature of her need wanting something from her that far exceeded what she wanted from him it explained in some ways the phone call hed received which itself could be described as a betrayal a tit for tat as it were you dont do what i want and i turn you over towell to whoever seems to be looking for you because i dont care who it is i only want to balance the scales in which you and i do harm to each other hed said have you told anyone thats why youve been looking for me jemima have you told anyone do you actually think id want anyone to know he could see her point although he felt it like a wound she was inflicting upon him instead of merely an answer to his question still there was something in the way she said it that made him doubt her he knew her too well dyou have a new bloke he asked her abruptly not because he really wanted to know but because of what it could mean if she had i dont see thats any business of yours do you why you know i most certainly do not know he said if youve toldjemima just tell me if youve told someone why worried are you yes i suppose you would be id be worried as well so let me ask you this gordon have you thought how id feel if other people knew have you considered the wreck my life could become just please give us an interview miss hastings just a word about what its been like for you did you never suspect did you not recognise what sort of woman wouldnt know there was something terribly wrong here dyou actually think id want that gordon my picture smeared on the front of some tabloid along with yours theyd pay he said like you said itd be a tabloid theyd pay you a lot for an interview theyd pay you a fortune shed backed off white faced youre mad she said if its even possible youre actually madder than you were all right hed said fiercely then whatve you done with the coin where is it wheres the stone why she asked hows that your business i mean to take them back to hampshire obviously do you indeed you know i do they must go back jemima its the only way no theres another way entirely what way is that i think you might already know especially as youve been looking for me that was the moment when he knew she did indeed have someone else that was when he understood despite her declarations to the contrary how likely it was that the darkest part of his soul was going to be revealed to someone if it had not already been revealed his only hopehis guarantee of her silence and the silence of whoever else knew the truthlay in complying with whatever she was about to ask of him he knew she was about to ask something because he knew jemima and his curse for the rest of his life was going to be the knowledge that once again he and no one else had put himself into a place of complete destruction hed wanted to return the coin and the stone to the earth in which theyd laid buried for more than a thousand years more than that hed wanted to know that jemima would keep his secret safe so hed put up those cards and in doing so hed forced her hand and now she was going to play it shed said we need the money what money whos we you know what money we have plans gordon and that money thats what this is about then thats why you left not because of me but because you want to sell whatevers dug up from the ground and thenwhat but no that hadnt been it at all not at first money was fine but money had not driven jemima money bought things but what it didnt buy could never buy had never bought was what she needed most he said understanding things further its the bloke hes the one isnt he he wants it for whatever your plans are hed known hed hit upon the truth hed seen as much in the high colour that swept across her cheeks indeed she had left him to get away from the truth of who he was but shed met another man in her inimitable fashion and it was to this other man that shed told his secrets he said why did it take you so long then all these months whyd you not tell him at once after a moment in which shed looked away from him she said those postcards and hed seen how his own fear of discovery his own need for reassurance which was unlike her need and yet ironically identical to it had brought about this very meeting between them any new lover of hers would have asked why someone was trying to find her where she could have lied she had told the truth he said to her what do you want then jemima ive already told you to which hed said ill need to think about what how to make it happen what do you mean its obvious isnt it if you mean to dig the lot of it up i have to disappear if i dontor is it that you want me found out as well perhaps you want me dead i mean we were something to each other for a while werent we she was silent at this the day around them was bright and hot and clear and the sounds of the birds intensified suddenly she finally said i dont want you dead i dont even want you harmed gordon i just want to forget about it about us i want a new life were going to emigrate and open a business and to do thatand its your own fault if you hadnt put up those cards if you hadnt i was in a state and he wanted to know so i told him he askedwell anyone wouldhow id come to find out because he reckoned itd be the last thing youd tell anyone so i told him that part as well about the paddock not the paddock itself but what youd found there how i expected wed use it or sell it or whatever one does how you hadnt wanted to and thenwell yes why i had to tell him why had to of course dont you see there arent supposed to be secrets between people who love each other and he loves you he does yet gordon could see her doubts and he understood how the existence of her doubts had also served a role in what was happening she wanted to secure him whoever he was he wanted money these desires combined to produce betrayal when he asked her what when did you decide to do this jemima im not doing anything you asked to see me i didnt ask to see you you looked for me i didnt look for you if you hadnt done any of that thered have been no need to tell anyone about you and when money had come up between you what then it never did come up till i told him why her voice drifted off at that point and he could tell that she was reasoning something out on her own determining the possibility of something that he himself was only too able to see he said its the money he wants the money not you you see that dont you she said no thats not the truth he said and i expect youve had your doubts all along he loves me if thats how you see it youre a rotten person i suppose i am hed said that he would cooperate with her plan to return to the holding and stake her claim he would be gone but it would take time to effect the sort of disappearance that was required she asked how long and he said he wasnt sure he would have to speak to certain people and then he would let her know she could naturally ring up the media in the meantime and make some additional cash that way he said this last bitterly before hed walked off what a mess hed made of everything he thought and now gina or whoever the hell she was he told himself that if he hadnt decided to replace the bloody fence of the bloody paddock none of this would have happened but the truth of the matter was that the first event that had brought him ultimately to this moment had occurred in a crowded mcdonalds when lets jus take him had led to lets make him cry had led to shut him up how do we shut him up when zachary whiting showed up at the royal oak pub a few hours after his arrival at the work site gordon was up on the roofs ridge he saw the familiar vehicle pull into the car park but he felt neither nervous nor afraid hed prepared himself for whitings eventual appearance since theyd been interrupted during their last encounter gordon knew the chief superintendent was probably unwilling to let that moment between them go uncompleted the cop signaled him down from the roof cliff was handing a bundle of straw up to him so gordon told him to take a break the day was as hot as every day that had preceded it so he said have a cider and he said the cider would be on him enjoy he told him ill be along directly cliff was happy to comply although he muttered anything wrong mate as whiting approached he likely didnt know who whiting was but he could sense the mans menace whiting wore it like skin not a bit was gordons reply take your time in there he added with a nod to the doorway and he repeated ill be along with cliff out of the way he waited for whiting the chief superintendent stopped in front of him he did his usual getting in too close but gordon didnt pull away from the man youre out of here whiting said what you heard youre being moved home office orders youve an hour lets go leave the pickup you wont be needing it my dogs in fuck the dog the dog stays the pickup stays this with a jerk of his head towards the pub by which gordon reckoned he meant the thatching the job he was doing his source of employment thiss done for get in the car where are they sending me no bloody idea and even less interest get in the fucking car we dont want a scene you dont want a scene gordon wasnt about to cooperate without more information he wasnt about to get into that car unprepared there were any number of isolated lanes between this spot and his holding near sway and the unfinished business between him and this man suggested that he wouldnt be driven home directly no matter what whiting was claiming he had no way to be sure the cop was even telling the truth although jemimas death and the presence of new scotland yard in hampshire suggested that it was likely still he said im not leaving that dog here i go she goes whiting took off the clipon sunglasses and polished them on the front of his shirt it was clinging to him where he was sweating heat of day or anticipation gordon reckoned it could be either whiting said do you think you can negotiate with me im not negotiating im stating a fact are you now laddie i expect your brief is to take me somewhere and hand me over i expect youve got a time line involved i expect youve been told not to cock it up not to cause a scene not to make it look like anything other than two blokes having a chat right here with me climbing into your car at the end of it anything else and its likely to attract notice eh like the notice of those people in the beer garden over there you and i have a dustup and someones going to ring the cops and if its a proper dustupa headbanging sort of dustupthen it gets even more attention and someone wonders how you managed to make such a mess out of something so simple as fetch the sodding dog whiting said i want you out of hampshire you pollute the air gordon smiled thinly the truth of the matter was that sweat was dripping down his sides and pouring like a waterfall along his spine his words were hard but there was nothing behind them except the only means he had to protect himself he went to the pickup tess was within thank god dozing across the length of the seat her lead was looped through the steering wheel and he took it up swiftly and dropped it on the floor where it was safe to fumble round tess awakened blinked and yawned widely exhaling a cloud of dog breath she began to rise he told her to stay and climbed inside with one hand he attached the lead to her collar while with the other he made himself ready he had a windbreaker so he donned it he flipped down the sun visors he opened and closed the glove box he heard whiting approaching across the gravel car park and he said i expect you dont want me to go into the pub cliffll need a note and he was thankful he had the presence of mind to say that much whiting said hurry it up then and returned to his car he didnt get inside but rather lit a cigarette and watched and waited his note was brief this is yours till i need it mate cliff didnt need to know anything else if gordon had a chance later to get the vehicle back hed do so if not at least it wouldnt fall into whitings hands hed left the keys in the ignition which was his habit he removed the cottage key from the ring told tess to come and climbed out of the truck the whole procedure had taken less than two minutes less than two minutes to alter the course of his life once again im ready he said to whiting as he and the dogwagging her tail as always as if the wanker in front of them was just another someone who might pat her damn headapproached the man oh i expect you are was whitings reply chapter thirtythree later barbara havers would think with some astonishment that everything ultimately had come down to the fact that lyndhurst had a oneway traffic system in the heart of the village it formed a nearly perfect triangle and the direction from which she was traveling forced her to follow the triangles northern side this put her into the high street where midway down the street and just beyond the halftimbered front of the crown hotel she was meant to turn into the romsey road which would take her to the police station because of the traffic light at the romsey road junction a tailback formed during most hours of the day this was the case when barbara followed the curve round the expanse of lawn and thatched cottages comprising swan green and set her course into and through the village she found herself caught behind a lorry belching a hideous amount of exhaust fumes through her open windows she reckoned she might as well have a smoke as she waited for the light to change no point in avoiding an opportunity to add to the pollution that was blackening her lungs she thought she was reaching for her bag when she saw frazer chaplin he came out of a building just ahead of her and there was no mistaking the bloke she was quite close to the lefthand kerb in preparation for her turn into the romsey road and the building in questionits sign identified it as the mad hatter tea roomswas on the left side of the street she thought briefly what the bloody helland then she clocked the woman with him they came onto the pavement in the unmistakable manner of lovers in posttrysting mode but there was something about frazers twohanded hold upon his companion that wasnt quite right he had his right arm tightly round her waist he had his left arm across his own body to grip her left arm above the elbow they paused for a moment in front of the tea room windows and he said something to her then he kissed her cheek and gave her a look that was soulful admiring and love struck had it not been for that grip and a decided stiffness about the womans body barbara might have thought frazer was up to what shed quickly concluded he was apt to get up to the only time shed met him that widelegged posture of his when he was sitting that lookwhativegotforyouherebaybee expression in the eyes and the rest was history but the woman with himwho the hell was she barbara wondereddid not appear to be floating somewhere in the aftermath of sexual rapture instead she appeared to bewell captive seemed a fairly good description they headed in the same direction barbara was taking a few cars ahead of her however they crossed the road they continued down the pavement and within a few yards disappeared into an alley on the right barbara muttered damn damn damn and waited in mounting agitation for the lights at the junction to begin their change from red to amber to green she saw that the alley on the right was marked with that universal white p on a square blue background indicating that there was a car park somewhere behind the buildings in the high street she reckoned it stood to reason that frazer was taking the woman to it she said come on come on come on to the lights and they finally cooperated the traffic began to move she had thirty yards to go to get to that alley it felt like forever till she made the turn and zoomed between the buildings where she saw that the car park was not only for shoppers come to do their weekly business in the village it also served the new forest museum and the public facilities as well so it was massed with cars and for a moment barbara thought shed lost frazer and his companion somewhere within the rows of vehicles but then she saw him some distance away at the side of a polo and if before she might have given idle thought to this being the end of a romantic tryst between frazer chaplin and his companion the manner in which they got into the vehicle put the matter to rest the woman entered the passengers side as one would expect but frazer kept his grip upon her and climbed right in behind her from there barbara couldnt see the action but it seemed fairly clear that frazers goal was to force his companion into moving over to the drivers side and he had no intention of losing his grip upon her while she did so a horn honked suddenly barbara looked into her rear view mirror naturally she thought this would be the moment that someone else would come into the car park she couldnt wave them round her for the passage was far too narrow she turned into one of the rows of cars and blasted up it and down another by the time she had herself back into a position where she could see the vehicle into which frazer had climbed it had pulled back from the bay where it had been parked and was heading in the direction of the exit barbara followed hoping for twofold luck that no one would come along and keep her from catching frazer up that traffic in the high street would allow her to slip in behind him relatively easily and unseen for it was obvious to her that she had to follow her intention to confront chief superintendent whiting at the police station had to be set aside for the moment because if frazer chaplin had come to the new forest she reckoned that he hadnt done so to take pictures of the ponies the only question was the identity of the young woman with him shed been tall thin and decked out in something that looked like an african nightdress it covered her from shoulders to toes she was either in costume or protecting herself from the summer sun but in either case barbara felt sure shed not seen her before these moments in lyndhurst from what shed learned earlier from rob hastings barbara concluded that it had to be meredith powell if indeed meredith powell had been conducting some sort of mad investigation on her ownas according to hastings it seemed she had donethen it stood to reason that somehow shed stumbled upon frazer chaplin whose presence here in hampshire suggested he was into things up to his neck as well and the body language between them told a tale didnt it meredithif that was who it was and who else could it be if it wasnt meredithdidnt want to be in frazers company while frazer had no intention of allowing her to set off somewhere on her own at the bottom of the high street they headed due south into another leg of the lyndhurst oneway system barbara followed the signs she saw indicated brockenhurst and at yet another point of this traffic triangle they turned into the a there they dipped almost immediately into a vast area of woodland everywhere was green and lush and the traffic flowed well but with an eye for the animals as the road was arrow straight for some distance barbara dropped back the polo well within her sight there were very few options for turning when one came to brockenhurst and barbara had a fairly good idea which one they intended to take she was unsurprised when they took it a few minutes later the route to lymington this she knew was going to put them within range of gordon jossies holding she reckoned that was where they were heading she meant to know why she received at least a partial answer to this question when her mobile sounded peggy sue since shed dumped her shoulder bags contents onto the passenger seat when looking for a fag the mobile was easy enough to snatch up she barked havers into it and added be quick i cant pull over who is this frazer what the hell no way could he have her number barbara thought her mind was wrestling with all the possibilities of how hed managed to get it as she demanded whos that with you in the bloody car whatre you barbara she realised it was di lynley she said damn sorry i thought you werewhere are you are you here where hampshire where else listen im following weve broken his alibi whose frazer chaplins he wasnt at home the day she died not that bella mchaggis can actually verify she assumed he was there because hed always come home between his jobs and he encouraged her to think hed done his usual thing that day and the woman in the picture from the portrait gallery he stopped as someone in the background spoke to him he said yes right to that person and then shes called georgina francis barbara not gina dickens bella mchaggis identified her someone spoke to him again in the background he then said as to whiting what about whiting barbara asked whos georgina francis whore you talking to anyway she reckoned she knew the answer to this last but she wanted to hear it from lynleys own lips the superintendent he said he went rapidly on to tell her how georgina francis fitted into the picture former lodger at the home of bella mchaggis tossed out on her ear for violating the mchaggis dictum against fraternisation among those living beneath her roof frazer chaplin had been the man involved what the hell was she doing at the portrait gallery barbara asked thats some bloody coincidence isnt it not if she was there to check out the competition not if she was there because she was and is still involved with frazer chaplin why would their relationship have ended just because she had to find other lodgings we reckon who she couldnt help herself although she hated herself the moment she said it what who reckons barbara for gods sake he was not a fool all right sorry go on weve spoken to mrs mchaggis at some length he banged on then about dragonfly tonics transfers frazers lime green vespa winston nkatas viewing of the cctv films in the area the two efits and the yellow shirt and jemimas handbag found within the oxfam bin about which he concluded we reckon his intention was to hand them over to georgina francis to plant somewhere on gordon jossies holding but he didnt have the time to do it once bella saw the story in the paper about the body she called the police and you turned up there was too much risk at that point for him to do anything but sit tight and wait for a better opportunity hes here in hampshire sir hes here who frazer chaplin im following him just now hes got a woman with him and were heading shes got frazer chaplin in sight lynley said to his companion on the other end of the conversation the superintendent said something quite sharply lynley said to havers phone for backup barbara thats not from me thats from isabelle isabelle barbara thought bloody isabelle she said i dont know where we are or where were going so i dont know where to ask backup to go sir she was playing fast and loose for reasons she didnt want to explore lynley said get close enough for the number plates if you can and you can tell the make of car cant you you can see the colour just the colour she said ill have to follow god damn it barbara then phone for backup explain the situation and give your own bloody number plates and a description of your own car i dont have to tell you this blokes dangerous if hes got someone with him hes not going to hurt her while shes driving sir ill phone for backup when we get where were going what about whiting barbara if nothing else youre putting yourself in danger this is not the time for you to whatve you learned sir what did norman tell you there was more talk from ardery at his end lynley said to the superintendent she thinks barbara cut in airily with im going to have to ring off sir terrible traffic and i think im losing the connection anyway and whiting he said she knew he did it to get her attention typical of him she was forced to listen to a catalogue of facts whiting charged by the home office with the highest level of protection of someone lynley and ardery were concluding the person was jossie it was the only explanation for why whiting hadnt turned over to new scotland yard the evidence of jossies trip to london whiting knew the met would focus on jossie because of it that couldnt be allowed to happen even if the evidence made it look like jossie killed someone barbara demanded bloody hell sir what kind of highlevel protection asks for that who is this guy they didnt know but it didnt actually matter at the moment because frazer chaplin was the one they were after and since barbara had frazer chaplin in view blah blah blah barbara thought she said right right got it oh damn i think im losing you sirbad connection hereim getting out of range phone for backup and do it at once were the last words she heard she was not out of range but ahead of her the car she was following had made a sharp turn into a secondary road on the edge of brockenhurst village she couldnt be bothered arguing with lynley at that point she put her foot down to catch up and veered right just ahead of an oncoming removals van where a sign pointed to sway her mind was swarming with a horde of details facts names faces and possibilities she reckoned she could pause sort through it all and phone for the backup lynley was insisting upon or she could get to wherever they were going first suss out the situation and make her decisions accordingly she chose the second option tess rode in the back seat of whitings vehicle dumb as the poor dog was she was dead delighted to be going for a ride in the midst of a workday since she usually had to hang about waiting for gordon to finish up before she was able to do anything other than lie in the shade and hope for the diversion of a squirrel to chase now though the windows were open her ears were flopping and her nose was catching the delightful smells of high summer gordon realised that come what was likely to come the retriever wasnt going to be able to help him what was going to come soon became apparent instead of heading in the direction of frithamthe first enclave of cottages they should have come to on the route to gordons holdingwhiting drove in the direction of eyeworth pond there was a track in advance of the pond that they could have taken to get over to roger penny way and another road that still would have made quick work of reaching gordons cottage but whiting passed this by and went on to the pond where he parked on the upper level of the two terraces that comprised the roughly hewn car park it overlooked the water this delighted tess no end as the dog clearly expected a walk in the woods that edged the pond and stretched out to encompass a vast acreage of trees hills and inclosures she barked wagged her tail and looked meaningfully out of the open window whiting said either shut the dog up or open the door and get it out of here gordon said arent we shut the dog up from this gordon understood that whatever was to happen was going to happen right there in the car and this made sense didnt it when one considered the time of day the season and the fact that they were not alone for not only were there vehicles in the lower section of the car park at this very moment there were also two families feeding ducks on the distant pond a group of cyclists setting off into the woods an elderly couple in deck chairs having a picnic beneath one of the distant willow trees and a woman taking a pack of six corgis on a midday stroll gordon turned to his retriever he said down tess later and he prayed that she would obey he knew the dog would run into the trees if whiting forced him to open the door he also knew how unlikely it was that the cop would allow him to fetch her once shed done so suddenly tess was more important to him than anything else in his pathetic excuse for a life her affection for him in the way of all dogs was unconditional he was going to need that in the days to come the dog lowered herself to the seat with great reluctance before she did so she cast a soulful look from the outdoors to him later he told her good dog whiting chuckled he moved his seat back and adjusted its position he said very nice very very nice didnt know you had such a way with animals amazing to learn something new about you when i reckoned i already knew it all he made himself more comfortable then and he said now weve some unfinished business you and i gordon said nothing in reply he saw the genius in what whiting had planned and how well the cop had been able to read him from the first their last interaction had been interrupted but it had gone on long enough for gordon to know where every future interaction would lead whiting understood that gordon would never again see him both alone and unprepared to defend himself but defending himself against whiting in a public place would lead to an exposure he could not afford he was caught again he was caught on all sides and it was always going to be that way whiting lowered the zip on his trousers he said consider it this way laddie i reckon youve taken it in the arse but i dont fancy that the other will do come along and be a good boy eh then well call it quits you and i off youll go with no one the wiser about anything my dear gordon knew he could end itnow in this moment and forever but the aftermath of doing so would end him as well and his cowardice was that he could not cope with that he simply lacked the bottle that was who he was and who he had always been how long would it take and what would it cost him to perform for whiting surely he thought he could live through this when hed lived through everything else he turned in his seat he glanced back at tess her head was on her paws her eyes gazed at him mournfully her tail wagged slowly he said to whiting the dog goes with me whatever you like whiting smiled merediths hands were slick on the steering wheel her heart was pounding she couldnt catch her breath the bloke had something poked into her sidethe same something sharp that hed likely been holding in readiness when shed stupidly broken into gina dickenss bedsitting roomand he murmured how dyou reckon it feels when it pierces the flesh in reference to it she hadnt a clue who he was but he evidently knew exactly who she was because he called her by name hed said within moments and into her ear and this must be meredith powell who pinched my pretty gold coin ive been hearing about you meredith i have but sure i didnt expect wed ever get the chance to become acquainted shed said who are you and even as shed said it she knew there was something familiar about him that he said is one of those needtoknow questions meredith and you as it happens dont need to know the voice shed heard enough at that point to connect him to the phone call shed intercepted in ginas bedsitting room shed thought at the time it was chief superintendent whitingwhen shed thought at all she concluded bitterlybut this had to be the man whod placed that phone call the voice seemed right your arrival changes the nature of things a wee bit hed said to her so they had gone to her car her mind began racing when he forced her into the drivers seat he said she was to take them to gordon jossies property so first she concluded that here was the answer this bloke and gordon in cahoots and jemima dying because shed discovered it that however brought up the question of gina dickens and how she fitted in which forced meredith to decide that it was gina and this bloke who were in cahoots but that brought up the question of who gina was which brought up the question of who gordon was which brought up the question of where chief superintendent whiting fitted in since according to michele daugherty it was jossies name that had brought whiting to her office making whatever threats hed made and that brought up the question of whether michele daugherty herself was involved because perhaps she was a liar as well since it seemed they all were liars oh god oh god oh god meredith thought she should have gone into work at gerber hudson that day she considered driving wildly round hampshire instead of heading to gordons holding when the man told her to take him there she reckoned if she drove fast enough and wildly enough there was a chance that she could attract the attention of someonea policeman out on patrol definitely wouldnt have gone amissand save herself that way but there was that thing poked into her side and the suggestion it made of a slow and painful entry somewhere in the vicinity ofwhat was it her liver down there where were her kidneys exactly and how much did it hurt to be stabbed was she enough of a heroine to undergoand if she didbut would he really stab her if she was driving the carand what if she drove erratically and he told her to stop and then he marched her into the woodsinto one of hundreds upon hundreds of woodshow long would it take someone to find her while she slowly bled to death like jemima had done oh god oh god oh god you killed her she blurted it out she hadnt intended to shed intended to remain calm sigourney weaver in that old film about the space creature even older ancient even telly shows featuring diana rigg in her highheeled boots kicking bad guys in the teeth what would they do in this situation she wondered ridiculously what would sigourney and diana do easy for them because it was all in the script and the alien the bad guy the monster whateverit always dies at the end doesnt it only jemima was already dead and you killed her you killed her meredith shouted the deadly point of his weapon pressed harder against her drive he said killing ive found is rather easier than i thought it would be she thought of cammie her vision went blurry she got a grip she would do what was asked and what was necessary in order to get back to cammie she said ive a little girl shes five years old do you have children he said drive what i mean is you have to let me go cammie doesnt have another parent please you dont want to do this to my little girl she glanced at him he was dark like a spaniard and his face was pockmarked his eyes were brown they were fixed on her they held nothing they were she realised like gazing at a blackboard she looked away and kept her attention on the road then she began to pray barbara reckoned that if the other car was heading to gordon jossies holdingas it apparently was since she could come up with no other reason that it had turned towards swaygina dickens had to be there or georgina francis or whoever the bloody hell she was in the middle of the day they wouldnt be taking a trek out to jossies property in order to meet jossie himself who would be at work instead they were on their way to meet someone else and that person had to be ginageorgina all barbara needed to do was to follow at a safe distance to make certain they ended up where she suspected they would and then to ring for backup if it looked as though she wasnt going to be able to deal with them by herself if she moved too soon against frazer chaplin then it stood to reason georgina francis would get away in this part of the country that would not be difficult reaching the isle of wight took only a ferry ride reaching its airport from yarmouth would not be difficult southampton was no great distance either nor was southamptons airport so she had to be cautious the last thing she wanted was to play her hand too soon her mobile rang again i love you peggy sue she glanced at the phones screen and saw it was lynley no doubt ringing because he assumed theyd been cut off earlier she let her voice mail take the message as she kept driving the polo ahead of her made a turn into the first of the narrow lanes that led in the end to gordon jossies cottage they were less than two minutes from their destination now and when they reached it and the car ahead turned into gordon jossies drive barbara was unsurprised she zipped pastjust another car in the lane as far as they were concerned she hopedand she found a spot farther along the way where she crammed her mini into an opening provided by the access into a local farms field there she parked grabbed up her mobile phone in a bow to cooperating with her superior officersalthough she was careful to switch it offand hurried back in the direction from which shed come she reached jossies cottage first not his driveway the hawthorn hedge hid the dwelling from the lane but it also provided her a shelter from being seen she crept along it far enough to gain a view of the driveway and at least part of the west paddock beyond it she saw that frazer chaplin and his companion had entered that paddock and were crossing it they passed out of her field of vision though within ten yards she went back along the hedge she didnt fancy clawing her way through it it was thickly grown and for all practical purposes impassable so she needed another way to get onto jossies property she found this way where the hedge made an angle and headed inwards to run along part of the propertys east boundary there she discovered it gave onto another paddock defined by the same wire fencing that was used elsewhere on jossies land this was easier to climb through and she did so now what stood between her and the west paddock and frazer chaplin within that paddock was the barn in which jossie kept jemimas car and his thatching equipment if she circled that barn she knew she would arrive at the north side of the west paddock where frazer chaplin had taken the woman who was with him there was no immediate sign of gina dickens but as barbara slunk in the direction of the barn and towards its rear she could see ginas wellkept mini cooper in the drive now was the moment to phone for backup but before she did that she had to make certain that the shiny red vehicle did indeed indicate the presence of its owner she gained the rear of the barn behind it some fifty yards away the woods began edged thickly with chestnuts and crowned with oaks they could have afforded her excellent refuge a place of hiding from which she could observe what was going on in the paddock but from that distance there was no way to hear what was being said and even if shed had the means to hear getting to the woods without being seen from the paddock itself was impossible even low crawling wouldnt do it for the paddock was fenced in wire not in stone and the area between paddock and woods afforded only the protection of occasional gorse anyone on the outside was going to be easily seen by anyone on the inside that worked both ways though for from the edge of the barn barbara could see within the paddock easily enough and what she saw when she eased her head round to have a peek was frazer chaplin with his fist clenching a weapon and that weapon held to the neck of meredith powell his other arm gripped meredith round her waist if she moved what frazer heldand it had to be a thatchers crook barbara reckoned considering where they werewas going to pierce meredith powells carotid artery just as another crook had pierced jemimas artery in abney park cemetery backup was utterly useless barbara realised by the time the cops from lyndhurst arrived meredith powell would likely be severely injured or entirely dead if that was to be avoided barbara was going to have to come up with the way he called her george meredith thought stupidly what sort of name is that for a woman until she understood it was short for georgina for her part gina called him frazer and she wasnt exactly pleased to see him theyd interrupted her in the midst of what looked like a spate of gardening in the paddock where gordon kept ponies off the forest when they needed special care shed been clearing out a mass of growth on the northwest edge of the paddock and shed uncovered an old stone trough that had likely been there for two hundred years shed said what the hell are you when shed turned from what she was doing and spied meredith being frogmarched in her direction shed added oh christ fraze what in gods name happened to which he answered a surprise im afraid she cast a hurried look at meredith before she said to him and did you have to couldnt leave her there now could i george well this is just grand what in gods namere we supposed to do with her she gestured towards her gardening project its got to be here theres nowhere else we dont have time to mess about with any more problems than we already have that cant be helped frazer sounded quite philosophical i didnt meet her in the street did i she broke into your bedsit shes got to be dealt with and theres an end to it and it makes more sense to deal with her here than anywhere else got to be dealt with meredith felt her bowels loosen she said you mean to blame gordon dont you thats what you did from the first so as you see frazer said to gina he had a meaningful tone to his voice it didnt take genius to work out what he meant the bloody cow has got to the bottom of things and now shes got to die they would kill her the same way they had killed jemima then they would plant her bodythat was the word for it wasnt iton gordons holding perhaps shed lie undiscovered for a day or a week or a month or a year but when she was discovered gordon would take the blame because the two of them would be long gone but why meredith wondered why she hadnt realised shed spoken till frazers arm tightened round her waist and the tip of his weapon dipped into her skin she felt the skin break and she whimpered and he murmured just a taste and shut the fuck up and then he said to gina we need a grave he gave a rough laugh as he noted hell you were going to dig anyway itll just be a twoforone deal right here in the paddock gina asked why the hell would anyone ever believe that hed bury her here we dont have the luxury of answering that question do we he noted start digging georgina we dont have the time we dont have a choice it doesnt have to be deep just enough to cover her body get a better shovel there has to be one in the barn i dont want to see it when you fine shut your god damn eyes when it comes down to it but just get the fucking shovel and start digging her sodding grave because i cant fucking kill her till weve got a place where she can bleed out meredith whimpered again please ive a little girl you cant oh thats where youre very much wrong frazer said they rode in silence whiting occasionally broke it with a lilting tune that he whistled in some merriment tess occasionally broke it with a long whine that told gordon the dog understood something was wrong the journey took no longer than it would ever have taken to bridge the distance between fritham and sway in the middle of the day it felt as if they were crawling though it seemed to him hed be trapped forever in the passenger seat of whitings car when they finally turned into pauls lane whiting gave him his instructions one suitcase and he was meant to pack it in a quarter of an hour as to gordons question of what would be done with the rest of his belongingshe would have to take that up with whatever authority came to fetch him since the matter was of no interest to whiting the chief superintendent made a gun of his thumb and index finger and used his next statement as the trigger which he cocked while saying consider yourself lucky i didnt pull the plug on you when i first got told about that little trip of yours up to london could have done it then you know he said consider yourself bloody well lucky gordon saw how it had worked in whitings mind and understood how his trip to londonrevealed to whiting by gina there could be no doubt of thathad obliterated whatever caution whiting might have felt in dealing with him in the past before that trip to london whiting had merely lurked on the periphery of his life showing up to make sure he was keeping the snout clean as hed put it time and again intimidating him but not crossing any lines other than those defined by garden bullying learning hed been to london however and connecting that knowledge to jemimas death had opened the floodgates that had previously held back the waters of the chief superintendents loathing one word from him to the home office and gordon jossie went back inside a violator of the conditions of his release and always a danger to society the home office would remove his liberty first and ask questions later gordon had known how it would play out and this knowledge had kept him cooperative and nowat this point whiting could hardly tell the home office about gordons journey up to london on the day that jemima had died questions would arise concerning whitings possession of this knowledge gina could step forward and disclose exactly when shed passed the information along whiting would be forced to explain gordons continued liberty then and the chief superintendent wouldnt want to do that better to have his final bit of fun at eyeworth pond and then hand gordon over to whoever was coming to fetch him he said to whiting it doesnt actually matter to you that shes dead does it whiting glanced at him behind his dark glasses his eyes were shielded but his lips moved with distaste he said you want to yammer about someones dying do you gordon said nothing ah yes i shouldnt think thats a conversation the likes of you would ever want to have but we cn have it if you like you and i im not averse you know gordon looked out of the window he understood that it would always come down to this in the end not only between himself and whiting but also between himself and anyone that would eternally be the measure of his life and hed been mad to think otherwise even for a moment and especially in the moment those years ago when hed accepted jemima hastings invitation for drinks at her brothers house he wondered what hed been thinking in deciding he could have a normal life half mad and threequarters lonely hed thought that was him in a tablespoon the companionship of a dog was not enough when they came to his holding he immediately saw the cars in the driveway he recognised both gina was at home but meredith powell was also there for some reason he said to whiting how dyou want to manage this then as the chief superintendent pulled past the cottage and parked in front of the hedge cant exactly call it an arrest can you all things considered whiting looked at his watch gordon reckoned the chief superintendent was thinking about the wheres and the whens where he was supposed to hand gordon over to the home office and at what time he was likely also considering how much time had already passed since the home office had told him to collect gordon time accounted for by their interlude together at eyeworth pond the clock was ticking so they could hardly come back later for his belongings once gina and meredith were off the holding he reckoned whiting would tell him hed have to leave without the previously allowed single suitcase he worked it out that whiting would tell him his thingssuch as they werewould be sent along later but instead whiting said with a smile oh i do expect youll come up with something interesting to tell them my dear and gordon realised that the chief superintendent saw this as part of the overall fun he intended to have at gordons expense first eyeworth pond and now this gordon packing and having to come up with a reason that would explain to gina why he was about to disappear whiting said quarter hour i wouldnt waste a second of it chatting with the ladies me but you cn use it as you like the dog stays here by the way to make certain you know call it insurance tess wont like it gordon said she will if you tell her youve a way with the ladies dont you my love at that gordon realised it was actually to his benefit to have the retriever remain in the car if tess bounded out she would no doubt set out to find gina thus betraying his own presence without her he might be able to get into the cottage by the front door make his way quietly upstairs do what he needed to do and leave unseen no explanation required no conversation at all he nodded at whiting told the dog to stay and got out of the car he reckoned gina and meredith were inside the cottage probably in the kitchen but in any case not upstairs in the bedroom if he went in the front door he could ease up the stairs without being seen the floors creaked like hell but that couldnt be helped hed do what he could to be quiet and hed hope that whatever conversation they were having would be sufficient to cover his noise as to why meredith was there on the propertyhe didnt see how working out the answer to that was going to get him anywhere he also couldnt see that it mattered once in the front door he listened for their voices but the cottage was silent he moved quietly for the stairs the only sound was from his weight upon them as he climbed he went to the bedroom a single suitcase and a quarter hour gordon knew that whiting would be as good as his word one minute more and hed come sauntering onto the property leaving gordon to explain why he was being carted off or perhaps doing the honours himself gordon fetched his suitcase from beneath the bed he went to the chest of drawers and slid the top one open the chest of drawers was next to the window and he was careful with his movement here trying to keep out of sight for if gina and meredith were outside and looked uphe gave a glance to make sure he saw them at once the window overlooked the driveway and part of the west paddock empty now of the ponies hed used to keep gina from going inside the inclosure she was inside the paddock now and so was meredith but with them was a man he didnt recognise he was standing behind meredith and he was gripping her round the waist in a manner that suggested she wasnt a willing participant in what was going on and what was going on was a spate of digging gina had one of the shovels from the barn and she was frantically applying it to a rectangle of earth just beyond the old horse trough shed cleared away a mass of vegetation he saw she must have been working like mad since shed returned from wherever shed gone that morning at first he thought what an excellent job hed done things looked exactly as he hoped they would look then he realised that he owed jemima a debt of gratitude for this moment she clearly had revealed some of the truth but she had for some reason not told it all perverse loyalty to him suspicion of the other he wouldnt ever know he started to move from the window knowing that the three of them would dig all the way to china before they found what they were looking for but meredith made a sudden moveas if she was trying to escape the hold the strange bloke had on herand in doing so she swung round and he swung with her so that they were no longer facing gina and her digging but rather the cottage gordon saw the bloke held something to merediths neck and his glance went from the couple to gina he clocked what gina was actually doing the size and the shape of it and he whispered a curse she was digging a grave so these were jemimas killers he thought hed been sleeping with one of them she was the woman from london that the scotland yard detective had declared was in the pictures of that photo show shed come to hampshire in order to snare him and eternal fool that he was hed walked right into her arms he saw how hed helped them by placing those bloody postcards round have you seen this woman and of course they had jemima had confided in the bloke the bloke had confided in gina theyd set the rest up from there one of them in london and one of them in hampshire and when the time was right the rest was childs play a phone call to hampshire made by the bloke this is where she is this is where you can find her and then the wait to see what he would do and now this moment outside in the paddock this was meant to be as well there was going to be another body but this one on his very own property he didnt know how theyd managed to pick up meredith powell and get her here he didnt know why theyd done so but as he watched he saw what they intended as clearly as if the plan had been his own the conclusion to it all was written out before him he headed for the stairs once gina dickens began to dig in earnest barbara phoned nine nine nine she reckoned frazer was going to wait to dispatch his captive till he had a place to put her body the only way to make it look as if gordon jossie had killed her was to plant her somewhere and hope to avoid detection till shed been in the ground long enough to make the exact time of deathand hence jossies alibisomewhat uncertain this required a grave to her credit meredith powell wasnt cooperatively waiting for the blow that would kill her she struggled as best she could when she did so though frazer applied the crook to her neck she was bleeding profusely down the front of her body but hed so far avoided making the blow fatal just enough to settle her barbara thought what a piece of work he was when her call went through barbara identified herself in a whisper she knew the emergency operator could be anywhere in hampshire and this in combination with her own inability to make perfectly specific her exact location meant that timely intervention was unlikely but she reckoned chief superintendent whiting knew where gordon jossie lived so that was the information she passed along ring the lyndhurst station tell chief superintendent whiting to send backup at once to gordon jossies holding outside of sway he knows where it is im on the property a womans life hangs in the balance for gods sake hurry send an armed response team and do it now then she turned off her mobile she had no weapon but the odds were even she was fully capable of bluffing with the best of them and if she had nothing else on her side she still had surprise it was time to use it she headed towards the far side of the barn meredith couldnt cry out the pointed thing was inside her flesh for the third time hed pierced her neck once twice and now again a different spot each time the blood was seeping down her bony chest and between her breasts but she didnt look to see it for fear she would faint she was faint enough already why was the only word that escaped her she knew that please was out of the question and the why referred to jemima not to her there were any number of whys that dealt with jemima she couldnt work out why they had killed her friend she saw that they had likely done it in a way that would lead the police to gordon she concluded from this that they wanted both jemima and gordon out of the way but she could not come up with a reason for this and then it didnt matter did it because she was going to die as well just like jemima and for what for what and what would become of cammie without a dad without a mum growing up without knowing how much sheand who would find her they would bury and then and then and afterwards and god she tried to be calm she tried to think she tried to plan it was possible it was she could she needed and then there was pain again tears seeped though she didnt want to cry they came with the blood she could no more produce a way to save herself from this than she couldwhat she didnt know so bloody stupid her whole life was a shining example of just how stupid one person could be no brains girl completely utterly maddeningly incapable of reading a person for what he was for what she was for what anyone was and now hereso what are you waiting for she asked herself are you waiting for what youve always been waiting forrescue from where youve placed yourself for being so bloodyminded since the day you were born that this is where it stops everything halted the world spun but then it was not the world at all but the man who held her who was spinning round and she went with him and there was gordon hed come into the paddock he was coming forward he held a pistolof all things a pistol and where in gods name had gordon got himself a pistoland had he always had a pistol and why and she felt weak with relief she wet herself hot urine splashed down her leg it was over over over but the bloke didnt release her nor did he ease his grip he said to gina ah i see well need to make it deeper george every bit as if he wasnt the least bit fazed by what gordon jossie was holding gordon said unaccountably and its not there gina with a nod to where shed been clearing the paddock thats why you killed her though isnt it and to the stranger you heard me this stops here let her go or what the man said youll shoot me be the hero have your picture on the front of all the papers on the evening news on the morning chat shows tsk tsk ian you cant want that keep digging george she told you then gordon said in reply well of course she did one asks you know after all she didnt want you to find her she waswell i dont mean to offend but she was rather repelled once she knew who you are then when she saw those postcardsshe came home in a panic andone asks when ones loversorry george but i think were even on that score arent we darlingone does ask she loathed you just enough to tell me you should have left well alone you know once shed taken herself off to london why didnt you ian dont call me that its who you are isnt it george darling it is ian barker isnt it not one of the other two not michael or reggie but he talks about them when hes dreaming right nightmares gina said such nightmares you cant imagine let her go gordon gestured with the pistol the man tightened his grip cant wont he said not so close to the finish sorry lad im going to shoot you whoever you are frazer chaplin at your service he said he sounded quite cheery he gave a little twist to what he held at merediths neck she cried out he said so yes indeed she saw those postcards ian my friend she panicked she ran hither and yon talking nonsense about how this bloke in hampshire mustnt ever find her so one asked why well one would do and out it all tumbled nasty little boy werent you theres lots out there whod like to find you people dont forget not that kind of crime which is why of course youre not going to shoot me aside from the fact that youd likely miss and hit poor little meredith right in the head not a problem as i see it gordon said he swung the gun towards gina shes the one to be shot throw the shovel down gina this business is finished the hoards not there merediths not dying and i dont bloody care who knows my name meredith whimpered she had no idea what they were talking about but she tried to extend a hand of thanks to gordon hed sacrificed something she didnt know what she didnt know why but what it meant was pain ripped into her fire and ice it shot upward into her head and through her eyes she felt something bursting and something else releasing she toppled unstrung to the ground barbara had gained the southeast corner of the barn when she heard the gunshot shed been moving stealthily but she froze in place only for an instant however a second shot went off and she charged round to the front she gained the paddock and threw herself inside she heard noise behind her heavy footsteps running in her direction and a mans harsh yelling of drop that fucking gun she took it all in like a frozen tableau meredith powell on the ground with a rusty crook sticking out of her neck frazer chaplin sprawled not five feet from gordon jossie gina dickens backed into the wire fence with her hand clasped over her mouth jossie himself with the pistol held stiffly still in position from the second shot hed fired straight into the air barker it was a roar not a voice from chief superintendent whiting he was storming up the driveway lay that god damn gun on the ground do it now now you heard me now and then passing whiting the dog of all things bounding forward howling running in circles drop it barker youve shot him youve killed him gina dickens at last screaming running to frazer chaplin throwing herself on him backups coming mr jossie barbara said put the gun stop him hell kill me next the dog barked and barked see to meredith jossie said someone god damn see to meredith drop the bloody gun first i told you want her to die as well just like the boy you get off on death ian jossie turned the gun then he pointed it at whiting some deaths he said some god damn deaths the dog howled dont shoot it barbara cried dont do it mr jossie she dashed to the crumpled figure of meredith the crook was planted to its halfway point but not into the jugular vein she was conscious but overcome by shock time was crucial jossie needed to know it she said shes alive mr jossie shes alive put the gun down let us get her out of here theres nothing else you need to do at this point youre wrong there is jossie said he fired again michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker went into secure units for the first part of their custodial sentences for obvious reasons they remained separated and units in different parts of the country were used to house them the purpose of the secure unit is education andfrequently but not always and generally dependent upon the cooperation of the detaineetherapy information as to how well the boys did in these units is unavailable to the public but what is known is that at the age of fifteen their time in these secure units ended whereupon they were moved to a youth facility which has always been a euphemism for prison for young offenders at eighteen they were moved from their separate youth facilities and sent on to different maximumsecurity prisons where they served the remainder of the term determined by the luxembourg courts ten years that time has of course long since passed all three of the boysmen nowwere returned to the community as was the case for such notorious child criminals as mary bell jon venables and robert thompson the boys were given new identities where each was released remains a closely guarded secret and whether they are contributing members of society is also unknown alan dresser has vowed to hunt them down and give them a taste of what they did to john but because they are protected by law from even having a photograph of them published its unlikely mr dresser or anyone else will ever be able to find them was justice served this is a question nearly impossible to answer to do so requires one to see michael spargo reggie arnold and ian barker either as hardened criminals or as utter victims but the truth lies somewhere in between excerpted from psychopathology guilt and innocence in the matter of john dresser by dorcas galbraith phd presented to the eu convention on juvenile justice at the request of the right honourable howard jenkinsthomas mp chapter thirtyfour judi macintosh told lynley to go straight in the assistant commissioner was waiting for him she said did he want a coffee tea she sounded grave as she would do lynley thought word as always and especially when it had to do with death had traveled quickly he demurred politely he wouldnt actually have minded a cup of tea but he hoped he wouldnt be spending a long enough time in hilliers office to drink it down the assistant commissioner rose to meet him he joined lynley at the conference table he dropped into a chair and said what a bloody cockup do we at least know how the hell he got his hands on a gun not yet lynley said barbaras working on that and the woman meredith powell shes in hospital the wound was very bad but not fatal it came close to the spinal cord so she could have been crippled she was lucky and the other georgina francis in custody all in all it wasnt exactly textbook sir but it was a good result hillier shot him a look a woman murdered in a public park another woman seriously injured two men dead a paranoid schizophrenic in hospital a lawsuit hanging over our headswhat part of this is actually a good result inspector weve got the killer who is himself a corpse weve got his accomplice who may not ever go to trial for anything what do we know about this georgina francis that we can take into court she once lived in the same house as the killer she once was at a national portrait gallery show for some reason she was the killers lover she was the killers killers lover she may have done this and she may have done that and theres an end to it give that information to the cps and watch them roar hillier raised his eyes heavenward in an uncharacteristic indication of seeking divine guidance when he apparently had it he said shes finished she had a decent opportunity to demonstrate her leadership abilities and she failed to do so she alienated members of the team she was working with she assigned officers inappropriately and without regard for their expertise she made judgement calls that put the met into the worst possible position she undermined confidence in here and out therebe so good as to tell me tommy wheres the result lynley said i think we can agree that she was hobbled sir oh can we hobbled by what by what the home office knew and couldntor wouldnttell her lynley paused to let his point sink in there was little enough to use in defence of both isabelle ardery and her performance as acting detective superintendent but he believed he owed it to her to try he said did you know who he was sir jossie hillier shook his head did you know he was being protected then hilliers eyes met his he said nothing and in that lynley had his answer at some point during the investigation he reckoned hillier had been brought into the picture he may not have been told that gordon jossie was one of the three boys responsible for little john dressers terrible murder all those years ago but hed known he was someone into whose life no one else was supposed to delve lynley said i think she should have been told not necessarily who he was but that he was being protected by the home office do you hillier looked away he steepled his fingers beneath his chin and why is that it could have led to jemima hastings killer could it indeed sir yes hillier observed him i take it youre arguing on her behalf then is this noblesse oblige tommy or have you perhaps another reason lynley didnt look away hed certainly considered this point before coming up to the acs office but he hadnt been able to get to what felt like the whole truth of the matter as far as his intentions were concerned he was going on instinct alone and he had to hope that the instinct he was operating under was the lofty instinct for justice it was after all so easy to lie to oneself when it came to sex he said evenly its neither sir shes had a rough transition with little time to adjust to the job before she was thrust into the middle of an investigation in addition to that enquiries into murder beg for facts she never had them all and that with respect cant be attributed to her are you suggesting im not suggesting it can be attributed to you either sir your hands were tied as well i suspect then its because of this that she needsi thinkanother opportunity thats all im not saying she should be given the position permanently im not saying that you should even consider giving her the position permanently im merely saying that based upon what i saw during these past days and based upon what you yourself asked me to do with respect to her being here she should have another go hilliers lips curved it was not a smile so much as it was acknowledgement of a point well made and a point perhaps reluctantly taken he said a compromise then sir lynley said your presence here hillier chuckled but it seemed selfdirected it declared itself as who could have thought i would end up here back at work at the met you mean lynley noted that would be the deal on offer lynley nodded slowly in comprehension the assistant commissioner would always he thought play a very decent game of chess they hadnt come to checkmate yet but they were close may i think about it sir before i commit myself he asked you absolutely may not hillier said isabelle was on the phone with chief superintendent whiting out of the operational command unit at the lyndhurst station the gun in question he told her belonged to one of the agisters he didnt explain what an agister was and she didnt ask she did ask who the agister was and how gordon jossie had come to have his weapon the agister turned out to be the brother of their original victim and hed reported his gun missing only that morning he didnt tell the police however not at first and not that it would have helped had he done so he told the head agister during a meeting which set the wheels in motion which was of course too late jossie whiting continued apparently had the gun upon his person either in his windcheaters pocket or tucked into his trousers with the windcheater covering it or whiting went on as if to test the waters of another theory he could have been keeping it in the cottage as hed gone inside to pack the first theory seemed likeliest whiting said but he gave no cogent reason why theres a chance a treasure hoards involved in all this isabelle told him youll want to keep an eye out for that a what whiting wanted to know treasure he asked treasure what the hell a roman treasure isabelle told him we reckon thats behind whats gone on we reckon jossie was doing something on the propertylikely some kind of workand he came across the first of it he was able to sort out what hed come upon but so was jemima and then what whiting asked she probably wanted to report it it would be valuable and the law requires that considering who he was though he probably wanted to keep it buried hed have had to tell her why eventually because keeping it buried wouldve made no sense once he told herwell there she was living with one of the most notorious child killers weve ever locked away that must have been a rather staggering piece of information for her to process whiting made a sound of agreement so is there anything on the property to indicate hed been doing some work i mean doing some work during which he might have stumbled upon evidence of a treasure hoard there was whiting told her in a meditative tone part of a paddock had been refenced while the other part had been left as it was when everything was blown to hell a short time earlier that day the womangina dickenshad been working in part of the paddock that hadnt yet been seen to perhaps that was why isabelle thought about this it would be the other part she noted the newer section the part already worked on because it stands to reason that jossie would have discovered something where he himself had been digging any digging thats gone on there anything new in that spot anything unusual new fence posts new wire fencing new trough whiting said bloody huge trough if it came down to it mustve weighed half a tonne there you have it isabelle told him you know second thought on this im going to set things in motion myself from this end on that score the treasure well get the authorities to come out there you have enough on your plate she looked up at a movement in her office doorway lynley was standing there she held up a finger a gesture that asked him to wait he came inside and took the seat that angled from her desk he looked relaxed she wondered if anything ever ruffled the man she completed her phone call the duty press officer from lyndhurst would be identifying gordon jossie as ian barker while this would undoubtedly drag forth all the details of john dressers inhuman murder once again the home office wanted it known that one of the three killers of the toddler was now dead himself at his own hand isabelle wondered at this was it supposed to be a cautionary tale something to give the dresser family peace at last something to strike fear into michael spargo and reggie arnold wherever they were she didnt see how releasing gordon jossies true identity would serve to do any of that but she had no say in the matter when she and whiting rang off she and lynley sat in silence for a moment outside of her office the sounds of a day ending were unmistakable she badly wanted a drink but more badly did she want to know about lynleys meeting with sir david hillier she knew that was where hed disappeared to she said its a form of blackmail he drew his eyebrows together his lips parted as if he would speak but he said nothing he had a faint scar she noted for the first time on his upper lip it looked like quite an old one she wondered how hed come to have it what hes said is that hell keep it under wraps as long as the boys stay in kent with him and sandra he says you dont want a custody battle over them isabelle you dont want to end up in court you know what will come to light and you dont want that so im stuffed he can destroy my career and even if he didnt have that power id lose custody permanently if we went to court he knows that lynley was silent at first he regarded her and she couldnt tell what he was thinking although she reckoned it had to do with how to tell her that her career was over anyway despite her efforts to save it when he spoke however it was just to say alcoholism she said im not an alcoholic tommy i drink too much occasionally most people do thats all isabelle he sounded disappointed she said its the truth im no more an alcoholic thanthan you are than barbara havers is where is she by the way how the hell long does it take someone to drive from hampshire to london he wasnt to be diverted he said there are cures there are programmes there areyou dont have to live it was stress she said how you found me the other night thats all it was for gods sake tommy you told me yourself that you drank heavily when your wife was murdered he said nothing but his eyes narrowed the way ones eyes would do when something is thrown sand a handful of earth an unkindness she said forgive me he stirred in his chair he keeps the boys then he keeps the boys i can havehe calls it supervised visits what he means is that i go to kent to see them they dont come here and when i see them he and sandra or he or sandra is present and thats how it stands till when till he decides otherwise till he decides what i must do to redeem myself tilli dont know she didnt want to talk more about it she couldnt think why shed told him as much as she had it indicated an opening where she couldnt afford one and didnt want one she was tired she thought he said you stay she didnt understand at first that hed switched the topic stay i dont know how long he agrees this wasnt the best test of your skills ah she had to admit that she was surprised but he did saybecause with stephenson deaconthey told me that was before the home office business came to light tommy you and i both know my mistakes had nothing to do with the home office and whatever mad secrets they were keeping over there he nodded it was useful nonetheless had everything been straightforward from the first the ending to this story would be different i daresay she was still astonished but astonishment slowly gave way to realisation the assistant commissioner at the end of the day would hardly have granted her a stay of professional execution merely because the home office hadnt told her the real identity of gordon jossie there was more involved and she had a very good idea that the additional bargaining to keep her in place had to do with promises made by lynley she said exactly what did you agree to tommy he smiled you see youre learning quickly what did you agree to something i was likely to do anyway youre coming back permanently for my sins yes why as i said i was likely no i mean why did you do this for me he fixed his eyes on her she didnt look away im not sure he finally said they sat in silence for another moment observing each other at last she opened the centre drawer of her desk she took out a metal ring that shed placed there earlier in the day from this dangled a single key shed had it made but hadnt been sure and she still wasnt sure if the truth had to be told but shed long been adept at avoiding truths so she did so now she slid the ring across her desk to him he looked from it to her there can never be more between us than there is just now she told him we need to understand that from the first i want you but im not in love with you tommy and i never will be he looked at the key then her then the key again she waited for him to make his decision telling herself it didnt matter knowing the truth was that it always would finally he reached for what shed offered i understand he said the loose ends took hours so barbara havers didnt arrive back in london till quite late shed considered staying the night in hampshire but at the last moment she decided that home was more appealing despite the fact that her bungalow was likely to be the temperature of a sauna after being closed up in the heat for two days on the drive back she replayed what had occurred in the paddock and she looked at it from every angle wondering if any other ending had been possible at first she hadnt recognised the name shed been a young teenager at the time of john dressers murder and while the name ian barker was not completely unfamiliar to her she had not immediately connected it with that death in the midlands and with the man standing in the paddock with a gun in his hand her more immediate concern had been meredith powells injury frazer chaplins condition and the distinct possibility that gordon jossie was going to shoot someone else she hadnt expected him to turn the gun on himself afterwards however his reason for doing so was more than clear he was at that point hemmed in on all sides there would be no escaping the public revelation of his true identity in one way or another when that occurred the incomprehensible evil act of his childhood would be once more dissected before a public who always eternally and understandably demanded payment with the dog barking herself shouting whiting roaring and georgina francis screaming hed put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger and then utter silence the poor damn dog crawled on its belly then like a soldier in battle she reached her master whimpering while the rest of them raced to look to the injured a helicopter came from the air support unit near leeonsolent to fetch meredith to hospital officers arrived from the lyndhurst station hot on their heels as always came the journalists and to attend to them the duty press officer manned a position at the end of pauls lane georgina francis was taken off to the custody suite at the lyndhurst station while everyone waited two hours for the forensic pathologist to arrive eventually matters came to a close as far as barbaras participation was concerned she spent some time on her mobile with lynley in london some time with whiting going over the situation in hampshire and then she was finished time to stay the night or time to go she chose to go she was completely done in by the time she arrived in london she was surprised to see that lights were still on inside the groundfloor flat of the big house as she trudged through the gate but she didnt give much thought to it she saw the note on her door as she used her key in the lock it was too dark outside to read it but she could see her name written in hadiyyahs hand with four exclamation marks after it she opened the door and flipped on the lights she halfexpected another fashion offering to be laid out on the daybed there was nothing however she slung her shoulder bag on the table where she took her meals and she saw that the message light on her answer phone was blinking she went for the phone as she unfolded hadiyyahs note to her both contained the same communication come to see us barbara no matter what time barbara was knackered she didnt much feel like a spate of socialising but as it was hadiyyah making the request she thought she could survive a few minutes of conversation she returned the way shed come as she was crossing the patch of lawn to the french windows that served as entrance to taymullah azhars flat one of those doors opened mrs silver emerged calling back over her shoulder delighted truly with a happy wave she saw barbara then and said really quite charming and she patted her turbanned head and went on her way to the front steps of the house barbara thought what the hell as she approached the door she reached it at the same moment that taymullah azhar was about to close it he saw her he said ah barbara and then he called back over his shoulder hadiyyah khushi here is barbara oh yes yes yes hadiyyah cried she appeared beneath her fathers arm beaming so much that her face alone could have lit a room come see come see she called out to barbara its the surprise then a womans voice from within the flat and barbara knew who it was before she appeared ive never been called a surprise before introduce me darling but at least call me mummy barbara knew her name angelina shed never seen a photograph of her but shed allowed herself to imagine what she might look like she hadnt been far wrong the same height as azhar and thin like him transluscent skin blue eyes dark brows and lashes fashionably cut hair slim trousers crisp blouse narrow feet in heelless shoes they were the sort of shoes a woman wore when she didnt want to be taller than her partner barbara havers barbara said to angelina youre hadiyyahs mum ive heard volumes about you she has hadiyyah crowed mummy ive told her lots about you youll be such friends i hope we will angelina put her arm round her daughters shoulders hadiyyah put her arm round her mothers waist will you come in barbara angelina asked ive been hearing volumes about you as well she turned to azhar hari do we have dead knackered barbara cut in hari no she couldnt take part in the moment i only just got back from work rain check tomorrow whatever that okay with you kiddo to hadiyyah hadiyyah hung from her mothers waist and gazed up at her she spoke to barbara but looked at her mother oh yes oh yes oh yes she declared weve lots of time tomorrow dont we mummy angelina replied lots and lots of time darling barbara said good night she gave a mad little salute to them all she was far too done in to process all this tomorrow would be time enough to do so she was heading for her bungalow when he called her name she paused on the path at the side of the house she didnt want to have this conversation but she reckoned there wasnt much hope of avoiding it this is azhar began but barbara stopped him youll never get her to sleep tonight she said cheerfully i expect shell be dancing round till dawn yes i expect he looked back the way he had come and then at barbara she wanted to tell you earlier but i thought it best that she wait until he hesitated there was an entire relationship between him and hadiyyahs mother that rested in the pause absolutely barbara said to rescue him if she did not return you see as she said she would do i didnt wish hadiyyah then to have to explain it seemed to me it would make her disappointment that much worse absolutely barbara said so you see clear as anything hadiyyah always believed she did she always said i dont know why well its her mum after all theres a bond shed know that shed feel it you dont quite azhar felt in his pockets barbara knew what he was looking for but shed come without her cigarettes he found his own packet and offered her one she shook her head he lit up himself why she returned he said what the truth behind why she returned is what i do not yet know oh well barbara didnt know what to say the subject of exactly why angelina had left azhar and her daughter in the first place was something that had never come up the euphemism had long been a trip to canada while barbara had reckoned it stood for something other than a tour round that countryif that was even where angelina had beenshe had never pressed for more information hadiyyah she assumed would not have it and azhar would not be willing to give it i suspect it wasnt quite what angelina thought it might be azhar said living with him barbara nodded right well thats usually the story isnt it she said the bloom fades and at the end of the day peoples knickers start showing no matter how they try to hide them eh you knew there was another then another bloke barbara shook her head i wondered why she left and where she really was but i didnt know there was someone else involved she looked towards the front of the house when she went on f im honest with you azhar it always seemed dead mad to me that shed leave the two of you especially hadiyyah i mean men and women have their troubles and i get that but i never got her leaving hadiyyah so you understand he drew in on his cigarette the lighting was dim along the path on the side of the house and in the darkness barbara could barely see his face but the tip of his cigarette glowed fire with how deeply he drew upon it she recalled that angelina didnt like his smoking she wondered if he would now give it up understand what she asked him that she will take hadiyyah barbara next time she will take her and that is somethingi cannot lose hadiyyah i will not lose hadiyyah he sounded so fierce and if it was possible at the same time so bleak that barbara felt something give way within her a crack in a surface she would have preferred to keep forever solid she said azhar youre doing the right thing here id do the same anyone would for he had no choice and she well knew it he was caught in circumstances of his own devising having left his wife and two other children for angelina having never divorced having never remarriedit was a nightmare situation that would end up in court if angelina so chose and hed be the loser and what hed be the loser of was the only person left in his shattered life who mattered to him i must do what i can to keep her here he said i completely agree barbara said and she meant those words despite the fact that they changed her world as much as they changed the world of the man who stood in the darkness with her chapter thirtyfive twelve days went by before rob hastings could bring himself to call upon meredith during that time he rang the hospital daily till she was at last released into the care of her parents but he found he could do no more than merely ask for information about her condition what he gathered from these phone calls was little enough and he knew he could have learned more had he gone in person he could indeed have seen her for himself but it was too much for him and even if it hadnt been he found he had no clear idea how to talk to her any longer in those twelve days he discovered who had taken the pistol from his land rover and what had been done with that gun it had since been returned to him but it was a black mark on his career that hed managed to have the weapon taken in the first place two people were dead because of this and had he not been a hastings with the hastings history of service to the new forest behind him hed likely have been given the sack the news was bursting with the story of ian barker the wicked child killer of a toddler a bloke whod managed to keep his identity secret for the years since his release from wherever he and his murderous mates had been held reporters from every media source in the country had at first sought out everyone whose life had touched on gordon jossies no matter how remotely there was it seemed a hideous kind of romance to the story that the tabloids especially wanted to feature it was the story of the notorious child killer who killed again with a minor headline indicating that this time hed done it to save a woman in danger before going on to kill himself this didnt actually appear to be the case according to meredith powell and chief superintendent zachary whiting since the truth of the matter according to them was that frazer chaplin had charged towards jossie and only then did jossie shoot him but that wasnt as symbolic an act of redemption as was the idea that jossie had saved someone prior to ridding the world of his presence so it was that story and not the other that got the most ink from the tabloids ian barkers childhood photo was printed every day for a week along with gordon jossies more recent visage some of the tabloids demanded how people in hampshire had possibly failed to recognise the bloke but really why would they have recognised in a quiet thatcher a longago child who they probably suspected had cloven hooves for feet and horns beneath his schoolboy cap no one was looking for ian barker to be hidden away in hampshire anyway leading an unassuming life neighbours along pauls lane were interviewed never suspected and ill keep my doors locked from now on i will were the general comments both zachary whiting and a home office spokesman made a few statements about the duty of the local police in matters of new identities and for several days sightings of both michael spargo and reggie arnold were reported but finally the story faded away as these stories do when a member of the royal family got into an unfortunate struggle with a paparazzo in front of a nightclub at am in mayfair rob hastings had managed to weather all this without speaking to any of the journalists he let his phone take the messages but he returned no calls he had no desire to discuss how the former ian barker had come into his life he had less desire to talk about how his sister had taken up with the bloke he understood now why jemima had left the new forest he did not understand why she had not confided in him however he spent days pondering this question and trying to work out what it meant that his sister had not told him what had driven her from hampshire he was not a man prone to violence and she surely had known that so she could hardly have expected him to accost jossie and do damage to him for deceiving jemima what would have been the point of that anyway he could also keep a secret and jemima had to have known that as well beyond that he would have only too happily welcomed his sister home without question had she wanted to come back to honey lane he was left considering what all of this said about him but the only answer he was able to come up with was the one that asked another question what would have been the point of your knowing the truth robbie and that question led to the next what kind of action would you have taken you who have always been so fearful about taking action in the first place the why of that fear was what he couldnt cope with in the aftermath of all the revelations and the deaths the why of that fear led directly to the heart of who and what he was of who and what he had been for years solitary not out of choice solitary not out of necessity solitary not out of inclination the sad truth was that he and his sister had long been in fact much the same sort of people it was only the manner in which theyd muddled through their lives that was different understanding this at the end of days and days upon horseback on the forest was what finally prompted robbie to go to cadnam he went at midafternoon with the hope that meredith might be alone at her parents home at that time of day so he could speak to her without anyone being there this was not to be her mother was in so was cammie they answered the door together hed not seen janet powell in ages he realised in the early years of the girls friendship he and merediths mother had met now and again when the act of fetching meredith and jemima from this place or that had been called for but hed not seen the woman once the girls had each been old enough to have a driving licence which put an end to the adults in their lives having to ferry them here and there he recognised her though he said by way of introduction missus powell afternoon im well hullo robert she broke in kindly what a nice surprise it is to see you do come in he didnt know quite how to react to the welcome what he thought was well of course she would remember him he had a rather unforgettable face hed worn his baseball cap as was his habit but he removed this as he stepped into the house he glanced at cammie as he tucked the cap into the back pocket of his jeans she dodged at once behind her grandmothers legs and she peered out at him with rounded eyes he offered the little girl a smile he said spect cammie doesnt remember me eh been donkeys years since ive seen her mustve been only two years old last time maybe less she wont know who i am bit shy with strangers she is janet powell put her hand on cammies shoulder and drew her forward cuddling her to her hip thiss mr hastings luv she said you say hullo to mr hastings its rob he said or robbie want to shake a hand here cammie she shook her head and she took a step backward gran she said she hid her face in her grandmothers skirt ah its no matter robbie said he added with a wink present something of a sight i do this toothy old face eh but the wink was forced and he saw that janet powell knew this she said you come right in robbie ive a lemon cake in the kitchen thats begging to be eaten will you oh ta but no i was on my way toactually i just come toi was hoping meredith was he drew in a calming breath it was the fact that the little girl was hiding and he knew she was hiding because of him he didnt know how to put her at ease and he wanted to do so he said to mrs powell i was wondering if meredith of course janet powell said youve come to check on meredith havent you terrible thing to think i had that young woman here in the house for a night she might havewell you know she cast a glance at cammie she could have murdered us all in our beds merediths just in the garden with the dog cammie luv will you take this nice gentleman out to see mummy cammie scratched one ankle with the toes of her other bare foot she seemed to hesitate she kept her gaze on the floor when her grandmother said her name again the little girl murmured mummys been in hospital aye robbie said that i know its why ive come to say hullo and to see how shes feeling bet you were a bit worried about her werent you cammie nodded she said to the floor that dogs taking care of her though and then looking up hospitalsre like where the hedgehogs go really robbie said you like hedgehogs do you cammie they got a hospital for them gran told me she said we cn go there an see them i spect theyll like that the hedgehogs she says not yet though she says when im older cos were meant to spend the night when we go cos its far right that makes sense i spect she wants to make sure you dont miss your mum if you spend the night rob said cammie frowned and looked away howd you know that she asked the bit about missing your mum and when she nodded i had a little sister once like me she asked just like you he said that appeared to put her at ease she stepped away from her grandmother and said to him quietly we got to go through the kitchen to get to the garden the dog might bark but shes quite nice and she took him outside meredith was sitting on a lounge chair in the only shade there was on the far side of a garden shed the rest of the area was given over to rose bushes and they filled the air with a fragrance so intense that robbie imagined he could feel it move like a silk scarf against his skin mummy cammie called as she led him along a gravel path are you still resting like youre meant to are you asleep cos theres someone to see you meredith wasnt asleep she had been drawing robbie saw she had a large sketch pad spread on her knees and shed used coloured pencils upon it shed created squares of patterns he saw fabric designs he reckoned she still held on to her original dream at the side of the lounge chair lay gordon jossies dog tess raised her head then lowered it to her paws her tail swished twice on the ground in greeting meredith closed her sketch pad and set it to one side she said why hullo rob and as cammie made to climb into her lap she said not yet darling still a bit too much for me but she moved to one side and patted the seat cammie managed to squeeze in next to her squirming round to make her little bottom fit the space meredith smiled rolled her eyes at robbie but kissed the top of her daughters head she was worried she said in explanation nodding at the little girl ive never been in hospital before far as shes concerned didnt know what to think he wondered what merediths daughter had been told about what had happened to her mother on gordon jossies holding that day very little he expected she didnt need to know he said with a nod at the golden retriever howd you come by her i asked mum to fetch her it seemed likepoor thing i couldnt bear the thoughtyou know aye good for you that merry he looked round and spied a wooden folding chair leaning against the garden shed he said to meredith mind if i with a gesture towards it she said colouring oh of course im sorry do sit dont know what i wasonly its quite nice to see you rob im glad youve come they told me at the hospital youd phoned i wanted to see were you coping he said oh i was that she touched her fingers to the bandage on her neck doubtless a much smaller one than what shed had wrapping her wound originally the gesture seemed an unconscious one to him but it was apparently not because she said with a humourless laugh well ill look like frankensteins wife when this comes off i spose whos that cammie asked her frankensteins wife just someone from a story meredith said means shell have a bit of a scar robbie told her itll give her distinction that will whats distinction something making one person look different from everyone else robbie said oh cammie said like you you look different i never saw anyone looks like you cammie meredith cried aghast her hand went down automatically to cover her daughters mouth ts all right robbie said although he felt himself go red in the face not like i dont know that but mummy cammie had wiggled from beneath her mothers grasp he does look different cos his camille stop that this instant silence at that into it cars from the road in front of the house swooshed by a dog barked tess lifted her head and growled the motor of a lawn mower sputtered suffer the little children robbie thought bleakly didnt they always tell the truth he felt all thumbs and elbows then he might as well have been a twoheaded bull he looked round and wondered how long he had to remain in the garden in order not to seem rude by running off at once meredith said in a low voice im that sorry rob she doesnt mean anything by it he managed a chuckle well its not like shes saying something we dont all know is it cammie he offered the little girl a smile still and all meredith said cammie you know better than that cammie looked up at her mother then back at rob she frowned then she said quite reasonably but i never ever saw two colours of eyes before mummy did you merediths lips parted then closed then she rested her head against the back of her chair she said oh lord and then to cammie only once before cam youre completely right she looked away and robbie saw to his surprise that meredith was deeply embarrassed not by her daughter however but by her own reaction by what shed assumed yet all she had done was reach the same conclusion that he himself had reached hearing cammies words he was truly ugly and all three of them knew it but only two of them had thought the matter worthy of comment he sought a way to smooth the moment but he could come up with nothing that didnt draw further attention to it so he finally just said to the little girl so its hedgehogs is it cammie she said not illogically whats hedgehogs i mean what youre liking hedgehogs thats it what about ponies dyou like ponies as well cammie looked up at her mother as if to see if she was meant to answer or to hold her tongue meredith looked down at her fondled her rumpled hair and nodded how do you feel about ponies she asked her i like em best when theyre babies cammie said frankly but i know im not meant to get too close whys that robbie asked her cos theyre skittish whats that mean then means theyre cammies brow wrinkled as she thought about this means theyre scared easy an if theyre scared easy youve got to be careful mummy says you alwaysve got to be careful round anyone scares too easy why oh cos they misunderstand i expect sort oflike if you move too fast round them they cn think the wrong thing about you so you got to be quiet and you got to be still or move real slow or something like that she wriggled round again the better to look up at her mothers face thats right isnt it mummy thats what you do thats exactly right meredith said very good cam you take care when you know somethings scared she kissed the top of her daughters head she didnt look at rob then there seemed to be nothing else to say or at least that was what robbie hastings told himself he decided he had done his duty and all things considered it was time for him to leave he stirred on his chair he said so just as meredith said rob their eyes met he felt himself colouring once again but he saw that she too was red in the face she said cammie darling will you ask gran if her lemon cakes ready id like a piece and i expect you would as well hmm oh yes cammie said i love lemon cake mummy she clambered out of the lounge chair and ran off calling to her grandmother in a moment a door slammed shut behind her rob slapped his hands on his thighs clearly shed given the signal for him to take himself off he said well dead happy youre all right now merry she said ta and then funny that rob he hesitated what no one else calls me merry no one ever has but you he didnt know what to say to this he didnt know what to make of it either i quite like it she said makes me feel special you are he said special that is you too rob you always have been here was the moment he saw it clearly more clearly than hed seen anything ever her voice was quiet and she hadnt moved an inch but he felt her nearness and feeling this he also felt the air go dead cold round him he cleared his throat she didnt speak then on the roof of the garden shed a birds feet skittered he finally said merry as she herself said will you stay for a piece of lemon cake with me rob and ultimately he saw the reply was simple i will he replied id like that very much acknowledgments the new forest itself served as enormous inspiration for this novel but inspiration is nothing without details so im grateful to people both in hampshire and in london who assisted me with various aspects of the book first among them must be simon winchester master thatcher who allowed me to observe him at work in furzey gardens and who explained the myriad techniques and tools of his craft additionally mike lovell met with me in lyndhurst and explained his work as one of the new forests five agisters while the honourable ralph montagu and graham wilson added a great deal of information both on the history of the new forest and on the purpose and employment of verderers and keepers respectively alan smith of hampshire constabularly supplied me with all of the policing details and in london terence pepper and catherine bromley of the national portrait gallery gave me the necessary information that allowed me to create my version of the competition for the cadbury photographic portrait of the year jason hain kindly allowed me access to the segar and snuff parlour in covent garden and a lovely peruvian mask maker in jubilee hall nearly convinced me to have my likeness rendered in plaster thereby inspiring me to create my own mask maker in this novel the always resourceful swati gamble sorted out the answers to countless questions i threw at her regarding everything from the home office to the location of educational institutions finally the new forest museum was a treasure trove of information in lyndhurst as was the british museum in london in the united states dr tom ruben once again fielded medical questions for which i thank him my assistant leslie kelly did mountains of research for me on dozens of topics and both my longtime reader susan berner and my new reader debbie cavanaugh gave me extremely valuable feedback on the penultimate
