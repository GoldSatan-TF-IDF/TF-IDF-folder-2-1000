greg iles third degree bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh genesis chapter floating in the halfworld between sleep and wakefulness laurel reached down and slipped her hand into the crack between the mahogany bed rail and the box springs searchingsearching for her connection to life the cool metal of the razr pricked her nervous system enough to make her freeze a millisecond later she was fully awake and turning her head slowly on the pillow her husbands side of the bed was empty in fact it looked as though warren had not come to bed at all resisting the compulsion to check the razr for a text message she slipped the cell phone back into its hiding place then rolled out of bed and padded quickly to the bedroom door the hall was empty but she heard sounds from the direction of the den not kid sounds something else a strange thumping laurel whisked down the hall and peered into the great room across the vast open space she saw warren standing before a wall of bookshelves in his study half a dozen medical textbooks lay at his feet more on the red leather sofa beside him as she watched warren stepped forward and with an angry motion began pulling more books off the shelves six or eight at a time then piling them haphazardly on the couch his sandy blond hair spiked upward like bushy antennae and unless she was mistaken he was wearing the same clothes hed worn to work yesterday which meant that he really hadnt come to bed last night on any other day this would have worried laurel but today she closed her eyes in gratitude and hurried back to the master suite when she entered the bathroom her throat clenched tight she had put this decision off for days praying in vain for deliverance but now she had no choice only now that she was set up to go through with it something in her rebelled the mind would do anything to deny certain realities she thought or at least to postpone them kneeling before her washbasin she reached into the cabinet removed a walgreens bag and carried it into the private cubicle that surrounded the commode then she latched the slatted door opened the bag and took out a large tampon box from this box she removed the small carton shed concealed inside it yesterday afternoon the side of this carton read ept with shaking fingers she removed a plastic bag ripped it open and took out a testing stick not much different from the one that had struck terror into her heart as a nineteenyearold remarkably she felt more fear in this moment than she had as an unmarried teenager holding the stick between her legs she tried to pee but her urine wouldnt come had someone walked into the bathroom one of the kids hearing no breath or footfall she forced her mind away from the present to the parentteacher conferences she had scheduled today as she thought of the anxious mothers she would have to deal with later on a warm rush of fluid splashed her hand she withdrew the stick from the stream wiped her hand with tissue then closed her eyes and counted while she finished she wished shed brought the razr in with her it was crazy to leave that phone in the bedroom with warren home crazy to have it in the house at all really the cell phone laurel called her clone phone was a second razr identical to the one on their family account but registered in someone elses name so that warren could never see the bills it was a perfect system for private communicationunless warren saw both phones together yet despite the danger laurel could no longer stand to be apart from her clone phone even though it hadnt brought her a single message in the past five weeks realizing that shed counted past thirty she opened her eyes the testing stick was fancier than the ones she remembered from college with a tiny screen like the ones on cheap pocket calculators no more trying to judge shades of blue to see if you were knocked up before her eyes written in crisp blue letters on the gray background were the letters pregnant laurel stared waiting for a not to appear before the other word it was an infantile wish for part of her had known the truth without even taking the test her too tender breasts and the seasick feeling shed had with her second child yet still she waited with the testing companys new sloganwe call it the error proof testplaying in her mind she must have heard that slogan twenty times during the past week chirped confidently from the television during inane childrens sitcoms and warrens overheated cop melodramas while she waited in agony for her period to begin when the letters on the stick did not change she shook it the way her mother had shaken the thermometers of her youth pregnant the letters screamed pregnant pregnant pregnant laurel wasnt breathing she hadnt exhaled since the letters first appeared had she not been sitting on the toilet she might have fainted but as it was she sagged against the nearby wall her face cold the sob that broke from her chest sounded alien as though a stranger were wailing on the other side of the door mom said grant her nineyearold son was that you laurel tried to answer but no words came as she covered her mouth with shaking fingers tears streamed down her face mom asked the voice behind the door are you okay she could see grants thin silhouette through the slats no im not sweetheart im going insane sitting right here on the toilet dad called grant staying put i think moms sick im not sick baby im watching the goddamn world endim fine sweetie laurel choked out perfectly fine did you brush your teeth already silence now a listening silence you sound funny laurel felt herself gearing down into survival mode the shock of the positive pregnancy test had caused a violent emotional dislocation from there it was only a small step to fullblown dissociation suddenly her pregnancy became a matter of academic interest one small factor to be weighed in the days long list of deceptions eleven months of adultery had schooled her well in the shameful arts but the irony was shattering they had ended the affair five weeks ago without a single moral lapse since and now she was pregnant she shoved the stick back into the ept carton carefully fitted the carton back into the tampon box and stuffed it into the walgreens bag after stashing the bag on the floor behind the toilet she flushed the commode and stood grant was waiting beyond the door his face would be alert for any sign of anxiety in his mother laurel had seen that watchful face many times in the past few months and every time she did a blade of guilt sliced through her grant knew his mother was in emotional turmoil he knew it better than his father did being far more perceptive when it came to such things laurel carefully wiped away her tears with tissue then gripped the doorknob willing her hands to stop shaking routine she thought routine will save you play your usual role and no one will notice a thing its june cleaver time again she opened the door and smiled broadly wearing nothing but a tony hawk skateboard tshirt grant stood looking up at her like a nineyearold interrogation specialist which he was he had laurels eyes in his fathers face but the resemblance grew less marked every day lately grant seemed to change at the rate of a fastgrowing puppy is beth awake she asked you know we need to go over your spelling before we leave grant nodded irritably his eyes never leaving her face your cheeks are red he noted his usually musical voice almost flat with suspicion i did some situps when i woke up he pursed his lips working through this explanation crunches or the real thing crunches laurel used his preoccupation to slide past him and head for her closet she slipped a silk housecoat over her cotton nightie and walked down the hall toward the kitchen can you make sure beth is up she called over her shoulder im going to start breakfast dads acting weird grant said in a jarring voice sensing something very like fear laurel stopped and turned focusing on the slim figure framed in the bedroom door what do you mean she asked walking back toward her son hes tearing his study up she remembered warren pulling books from the shelves i think its just the tax thing we told you about thats very stressful honey whats an audit anyway thats when the government makes sure youve paid them all the money youre supposed to why do you have to pay the government money laurel forced a smile to pay for roads and bridges andand the army and things like that we talked about that honey grant looked skeptical dad says they take your money so lazy people wont have to work and so they get free doctor visits while working people have to pay laurel hated it when warren vented his professional frustrations to the children he didnt understand how literally they took everything or maybe he did dad told me hes looking for something said grant did he say what a piece of paper laurel was trying to stay tuned in but her plight would not let her i told him id help grant went on in a hurt voice but he yelled at me she squinted in confusion that didnt sound like warren but neither did staying up all night in yesterdays clothes maybe the audit situation was worse than hed led her to believe however bad it was it was nothing compared to her situation this was disaster unless no she thought with desolation even that would be a disaster she knelt and kissed grant on the forehead did you feed christy yep he replied with obvious pride christy was the childrens increasingly overweight welsh corgi then please go make sure your sister is awake sweetie im going to start breakfast grant nodded and laurel rose egg with a hat on it he gave her a grudging smile two two it is laurel didnt want to look warren in the eye this morning on any given day she had about a percent chance of not having to do it half the time he left early to put in between five and fifty miles on his bicycle an obsessive hobby that consumed huge chunks of his time to be fair it was more than a hobby during his early twenties warren had been classed as a category one rider and hed turned down slots on two prestigious racing teams to enter medical school he still completed category two races often against men fifteen years his junior on mornings when he wasnt training he sometimes left early to make morning rounds at the hospital while she was getting the kids ready for school but today since he obviously hadnt showered he was likely to be here until after she left her mind jumped to the walgreens bag sitting under the commode the odds were one in a million that warren would even notice it much less look inside and yettheir commode sometimes spontaneously began to run water and wouldnt stop unless you jiggled the handle warren was compulsive about things like that what if he rolled up his sleeves and got down on the floor to fix it he might move the bag out of his way or even knock it out of his way in frustration its the little things that kill you danny had told her enough times for it to stick and he was speaking from experience not only of extramarital affairs but also as a former combat pilot after a moment of doubt laurel went quickly back to the bathroom opened one of the windows then took the bag from beneath the toilet and dropped it out the window she leaned out far enough to watch it fall behind some shrubbery shed retrieve it before she left for school then toss it in a dumpster at a gas station somewhere as she closed the window she looked across her lawn a vast dewy expanse of saint augustine grass dotted with pecan trees greening up for spring there was almost no chance of her little disposal mission being seen their house stood on a tenacre lot with their nearest house on this sidethe elfmansalmost two hundred yards away with much foliage between now and then laurel saw the husband cutting grass where the property line ran near her house but it was early for that before the full psychic weight of the pregnancy could crash back into her thoughts laurel pulled on some black cropped pants and a white silk top then applied her makeup in record time she was putting on eyeliner when she realized she was avoiding her own gaze as much as she might her husbands as she stepped back from the mirror for a final appraising glance a wave of guilt hit her shed put on too much makeup in a vain attempt to hide that shed been crying the face looking back at her belonged to what more than a few women privately accused her of beinga trophy wife because of her looks they discounted her education her work her energy her devotion to causesall of it most days she didnt give a damn what people thought especially the women who gossiped nonstop about her but todaythe pregnancy test had confirmed every savage insult those witches had voiced about her or it almost certainly had anyway how the hell did i get here she whispered to her reflection the reproof in the large green eyes staring back at her was enough she pulled down a curtain of denial in her mind then turned and hurried down the hall to face her family the kids had almost finished breakfast before warren looked out of the study laurel had just washed the skillet and was turning back to the granite counter where the kids were eating the last of the biscuits when she caught warrens deepset eyes watching her from the study door he hadnt shaved and the shadow on his chin and jaw gave him a look of unusual intensity his eyes looked hollow and his expression gave away nothing except perhaps a sense of malice but she wrote that off as hatred of the irs she raised her eyebrows silently asking if he needed her to walk over for some private words but he shook his head if the earth keeps getting hotter asked beth her sixyearold will the oceans boil like when you boil eggs for tuna fish no punkin laurel assured her although it doesnt take much of a temperature change to melt a lot of ice at the north and south poles and that can have very serious consequences for people living at the beach actually warren said from the study door his deep voice carrying easily across the great room the oceans will eventually boil beth knit her brow and turned on her barstool warren said the sun will eventually heat up and grow into a massive ball of fire and the oceans will bubble away just like water in a pot on the stove seriously asked beth her voice filled with concern yes and then daddys talking about millions of years from now punkin laurel cut in wondering what the hell had got into warren to be telling beth that kind of thing she would worry about it for days your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgranddaughters wont even have been born by then so its nothing to worry about supernova cried grant thats what they call that right when a star explodes right said warren with obvious satisfaction thats so cool grant said its a boy thing laurel explained to beth the end of the world sounds really cool to boys despite her predicament laurel was tempted to give warren a chiding glanceits what she would have done had things been normalbut when she looked up again he had gone back into the study and she could no longer see him more thumping sounds announced that he was still searching for something on any other day she would have gone in and asked what he was looking for and probably even helped him but not today grant slid off his stool and opened his backpack now laurel felt some satisfaction without a word from her he had begun reviewing his spelling words for the day beth went to a chair at the kitchen table and started putting on her shoes which always had to be tied with equal tightness a ritual that occasionally caused paroxysms of obsessivecompulsive panic but on most days went fine laurel sometimes felt guilty when other mothers complained what a nightmare it was to get their kids off to school in the mornings her kids pretty much did their preparations on autopilot running in the groove of a routine so well established that laurel wondered if she and warren had some sublimated fascist tendencies but the truth was for someone who spent her days teaching specialneeds students handling two normal children was a nobrainer should i go into the study she wondered again isnt that what a good wife would do express concern offer to help but warren didnt want help with things like this his medical practice was his business and his business was his own he was obviously preoccupied with the audit and yet that prolonged stare from the door had disturbed her on a deep level it seemed months since warren had given her even a long look it was as though he were intentionally giving her the space she had silently requested he never looked too deeply because she didnt want to be seen and he didnt want to see it was a conspiracy of silence a mutual denial of reality and they had become expert at it were going to be late grant said youre right laurel agreed without looking at the clock lets move she helped beth get her backpack on then picked up her own computer case and purse and walked toward the door to the garage with her hand on the knobalmost outshe glanced back over her shoulder half expecting to find warren gazing at her but all she saw was his lower legs he had climbed a small ladder to search the top shelves of his custom bookcases ten feet up the wall she breathed a sigh of relief and led the kids out to her acura grant called shotgunbeth never thought of it in timebut laurel motioned for him to get in back which earned a smile from her daughter and an angry grunt from her son after they were belted in laurel mockslapped the side of her head and said i think i forgot to turn off the sprinkler last night ill check it cried grant unbuckling his seat belt no ill get it laurel said firmly and quickly got out of the car she hit the button on the wall and ducked under the rising garage door as soon as it was four feet off the concrete then trotted around to the back of the house she would retrieve the walgreens bag crush it into a ball then slip it into her trunk and dispose of it sometime during the school day at a gas station or convenience store shed done the same with a valentine card and roses and a few actual letters during the past year she was making for a gap in the shrubbery when a womans voice called out laurel over here laurel froze and looked toward the sound just twentyfive yards away almost obscured by some boxwoods knelt a woman wearing a straw hat and bright yellow gloves bonnie elfman was about seventy but she moved like a woman of forty and for some reason she had chosen this morning to beautify the western boundary of her considerable property im just adding some nasturtiums to this bed bonnie called whatre you up to retrieving a positive pregnancy test so my husband wont find it i thought i left the sprinkler on she called back thatll sure kill your water bill bonnie said standing and walking toward laurel laurel felt a flutter of panic to compound her troubles christy came tearing around the corner of the house desperate for someone to play with her if laurel picked up the bag from behind the shrubs the corgi might just leap up and rip it out of her hands she gazed along her own line of shrubs with exaggerated concern then waved broadly to mrs elfman i guess i got it after all ive got to run bonnie the kids are waiting in the car ill find your sprinkler and make sure bonnie promised laurels heart thumped like a bass drum dont trouble yourself really i thought id left it out here but i took it back to the storeroom i remember now dont you get too hot either its been really warm for april dont worry about that its going to rain bonnie said with the confidence of an oracle its going to cool off too by the time you get back from school youll need a jacket laurel looked up at the sun clear and bright in the sky if you say so see you later bonnie looked miffed over laurels escape she would have much preferred to stand around gossiping for a half hour laurel knew from past experience that like most gossips bonnie elfman was as quick to repeat stories about her as she was to confide in laurel about others shit shit shit laurel cursed as she hurried back around to the garage the walgreens bag would have to wait until after school christy was trotting at her heels so the dog was no problem but mrs elfman wasnt going anywhere soon laurel prayed that the old busybody would stay on her own property until school was out chapter laurel pulled her acura up to the elementaryschool door leaned over and kissed beth on the cheek mrs lacey had door duty today and she helped beth out while grant sprang out of the backseat like a monkey escaping from a zoo cage and darted into the school building to find his buddies after mrs lacey escorted beth through the door laurel drove around the elementary school and parked in her reserved space beside the special students building it was a small brick box two classrooms with a unisex bathroom and an office but it was better than nothing which was what athens country day had had for the past fifty years a generous endowment by a local geologist had made the building possible he had a niece in new orleans who was mildly retarded and so understood the need laurel looked down at her computer and purse which had lain under beths feet during the drive over but she didnt reach for them the engine was still running she made no move to switch it off she wasnt sure she could face what lay ahead her students could be trying enough but today she had parent conferences and her first was with the wife of her former lover the prospect of facing starlette mcdavitt while pregnant by the womans husband was almost unendurable if starlette werent the first appointment laurel would have tried to cancel the meeting but it was too late for that she didnt know she was crying until she tasted tears in her mouth it wasnt the impending appointment she realized it was that she didnt know for sure whose baby she was carrying the odds were it was dannys they had ended their affair five weeks ago but in the three weeks prior to thatthe three weeks after her last periodthey had made love at least a dozen times shed only had intercourse with warren twice since her last period both times after she and danny had ended it she hadnt even wanted sex with warren but how else could she make an honest try and what alternative did she have but to try given dannys decision walk out on warren to live alone in some lonely apartment surrounded by other divorcées and waiting for a man who couldnt come to her for another fourteen years if ever not an attractive option even before she was pregnant now laurel wasnt even sure whether a fetus conceived while you were on the pill was viable or not she would have to look it up on the internet she should already have done it but that kind of practical act didnt square with her strategy of intense denial she still couldnt believe she was pregnant she was on the pill for gods sake ninetyeight percent effective how could she be in the unlucky percent shed had some bad luck in her life but never the worst luck it was the rotavirus she knew last month she had somehow contracted the same gastrointestinal virus that had required the quarantining of major cruise ships cnn had said the virus was sweeping the country people were simultaneously puking and pooping from coast to coast three to five days of that laurel had learned could eject from the system the progestin contained in a womans birth control pills since shed had sex almost every other day last month pregnancy must have been a near certainty she laid her forehead against the steering wheel and allowed herself a single sob shed always believed she was a strong woman but now fate had colluded with chanceand stupidityto make the prospect of raising an illegitimate child in her husbands house a reality and that she could not face there are probably women doing it said a rebellious voice in her head right here in this town desperate to avoid thinking of her impending meeting with starlette laurel spun through the possibilities if you were going to be stuck in a loveless marriage for the rest of your life that love child might be your only link to sanity or at least to the life that might have been but could she live a lie for the rest of her life she had found it difficult enough to lie about even small things over the past year to bring off the thousand tiny deceptions that an extramarital affair required the thrill of the forbidden had lasted about three weeks for her and after that the lies had begun to produce a sort of psychic nausea every lie generated the need for a dozen otherslies and sublies danny called themsprouting like heads on an endlessly replicating hydra yet she had worked hard to maintain the charade of normalcy shed even become good at itso good that lying had become automatic she felt the dishonesty corroding her soul yet still she lied so desperately did she need the love that danny mcdavitt gave her yet what she was contemplating now was no simple deception she wouldnt be the only one lying she would be forcing her unborn child into a lie from the moment of its birth its very life would be a lie and what about warren he would try to love this baby but would he actually feel love or would he sense something alien in the little interloper in his house something inexplicably but profoundly wrong a disturbing scent a genetically dissonant sound a shiver at the touch of skin or hair and of course the baby wouldnt look like warrenit couldntexcept by the merest chance laurel actually knew one woman who had done it kelly rowland a sorority sister at ole miss who had become pregnant by a onenight stand while engaged to the boy she had been dating for three years kellys fiancé had been a good stable somewhat bland boy of medium attractiveness and excellent financial prospects in short the ideal husband for a sorority girl at ole miss kelly had always insisted that her fiancé wear condoms religiously during sex so it struck laurel as odd when kelly allowed one of the houseboysa devastatingly hot soccer playerto screw her brains out sans protection one night after a candlelight ceremony for one of the other sisters but when kelly learned she was pregnant she had simply moved up her wedding date scheduled her own candlelight ceremony and never looked back that was thirteen years ago and the couple were still married and living in houston laurel drew no inspiration from this memory but what was the alternative abortion how could she abort the child of the man she truly loved and even if she convinced herself she could bear that how could she tell her husband she wanted an abortion you get the abortion without telling him youre pregnant said a cold darwinian voice with dread she pictured herself running a gauntlet of antiabortion protesters to sit alone in the waiting room of some distant womens clinic shed have to go at least three states away to avoid any possibility of being recognized and even then the physician might a fist rapped on the window beside laurels head she jerked away from the noise like a woman being carjacked then looked back to see diane rivers the thirdgrade homeroom teacher mouthing her name with obvious concern diane was a bighaired southern belle with a heart of gold almost a throwback to laurels mothers generation though she was only fortythree laurel had seen pictures of diane in a glittering sequin unitard as she twirled two batons at a national college competition diane made a cranking motion with her hand meaning that laurel should roll down her window though almost no cars had window cranks anymore at least not in the parking lot of athens country day laurel wiped her tears on the shoulder of her blouse smearing mascara on the white silk then pressed the window button the glass sank into the door with a low whir whats the matter honey diane asked are you all right do i look all right laurel silently responded but what else was someone supposed to ask when they found you crying in a parking lot some teachers would have derived savage ecstasy from finding her in this state but diane wasnt one of them she really meant well i think im getting a migraine laurel said im getting that aura you know christ on a crutch diane said with empathy seems like a long time since you had one over a year since before danny and i got together laurel realized do you think you can handle your conferences if it was just classes id sit with your kids but i wouldnt know what to tell specialed parents ill be all right laurel asserted leaning down to lift her purse and computer off the floor sometimes i just get the aura but not the headache they call that a silent migraine im hoping this is one of those diane shook her head oh honey i dont know you dont have one of those shots with you the stuff that heads it off imitrex its been so long since i had a migraine that i stopped carrying the kit diane gave her a look of maternal reproach i know laurel said getting out of her car stupid you should run to warrens office diane suggested get that shot you know whats the use of having a doctor for a husband if you dont take advantage now and then i could cover for you till you get back my homeroom knows ill skin them alive if they misbehave laurel almost laughed diane had a glare that could paralyze a mischievous boy from a hundred paces after locking the acura laurel started toward the special students building ill be all right di seriously i saw some spots thats all you were sobbing in pain girl noi was just overwhelmed i really believed i might be over them thats why i was crying facing reality realitys a bitch all right diane said under her breath then she giggled like a s wife whod accidentally said shit she squeezed laurels wrist as she left the door of the special students building her touch was oddly comforting laurel felt an irrational urge to pour out her heart to the older woman but she didnt say a word diane couldnt possibly help with her predicament even were she so inclined and diane was unlikely to feel sympathy for the deranged slut who was cheating on her husbanddianes personal physicianand was stupid enough to get pregnant while doing it laurel nodded once more that she was okay then walked down the short hall to her classroom easily found by the raucous chatter of specialneeds kids in the grip of their morning energy after an aide escorted her students to the playground laurel sat at the round table she used for parental meetings sitting across a desk made parents feel they were being lectured to the round table made them feel like partners in educating their children laurel had eleven specialneeds children in her program almost too many given that she had only limited help from an aide but athens point was a small town and parents had few options she hated to turn anyone away her kids problems ran the gamut from add and oppositionaldefiant disorder to mental retardation and autism handling such a broad spectrum was hard work but laurel relished the challenge to insure that parental meetings went as smoothly as possible she kept meticulously organized records during the year and none was more detailed or better organized than the file on michael mcdavitt the way to get through this she thought is to focus on my secondmeeting that way i can keep starlette at arms lengthpsychologically speakinguntil im actually facing her across this table it was a nice idea only laurel couldnt manage it even when she closed her eyes she saw the former tennessee beauty queen sweeping into her classroom wearing her latest catalog purchases her bleached hair perfectly coiffed her nails flawlessly painted her waist pathologically thin her fancy cowboy boots which must surely be passé by now shimmering laurels negative feelings toward starlette mcdavitt had not begun during the affair that happened during their first meeting when it became clear that mrs mcdavitt saw her autistic son as a burden dumped on her by an unjust god starlette had run on for half an hour about how some parents claimed that autism was caused by mercury in governmentmandated vaccinations but deep down she knew it was a divine punishment something so deeply destructive simply had to be gods will she believed and it wasnt necessarily anything youd done it could be retribution for some sin committed far back down the ancestral line rape or incest or something you didnt even know about in less than an hour it had become clear that michael mcdavitts primary caregiver was his father daniel who was fifteen years his wifes senior danny mcdavitt was a softspoken man a year shy of fifty he looked younger but his eyes held a quiet wisdom that bespoke considerable experience it wasnt long before laurel learned that mcdavitt was a war hero an athens point native who had left town at eighteen and returned as a prodigal thirty years down the road all hed told her during the first weeks of michaels assessment was that hed flown helicopters in a couple of wars that he was now retired due to wounds received and that he was giving fixedwing flying lessons out at the county airport laurel soon decided that either flying or combat experience must be good training for men dealing with special kids because in nine years of teaching she had never seen a father work harder to connect with a developmentally challenged son than did danny mcdavitt the problem was his wife the only mystery about starlette mcdavitt was why danny had married her this single act betrayed a serious lapse of judgment which seemed uncharacteristic in him of course laurel had noticed that even brilliant men could be outandout fools when it came to picking women they were like little boys at a baskinrobbins ill have some of that hmm that tastes good i want some more pretty soon they bought the whole bucket of ice cream to keep a steady supply but once they had access to that bucket all day every day they didnt like the taste so much that ice cream didnt even look the same as it had behind the frosted glass with the big silver scoop stuck in it starlette looked tasty enough and her looks matched her name she was a former miss knoxville or something not quite a miss tennessee but something higher up than a soybean queen yet her tv spokesmodel beauty was offset by bitter eyes that told you shed already learned the lesson that pageant victories only take girls a short way down the road of life the real irony was that in starlettes view laurel had won the marital lottery shed married a doctorcount your blessings and keep your mouth shut honey and your legs open if you know whats good for you starlette had never verbalized any of this per se but it had seeped out between her little digs at other doctors wives none present to defend themselves and in her limited observations on her own lot in life danny had married starlette seven years ago a year before hed planned to retire from the air force first marriage for both of them hed waited a long time to make that mistake he told her but the waiting hadnt made him any wiser after nineteen years in the service hed flown to nashville to buy a house in anticipation of working as a songwriter in his retirement something hed always done during downtime in the air force to protect his savings hed lined up a job with a local flying service the owner was a big admirer of dannys war record and one job perk was flying country music stars around the state starlette had been working for a real estate agency and shed showed danny a couple of houses in franklin his songwriting aspirations hadnt impressed her in fact shed questioned his ability to buy in that neighborhood but his upcoming gig flying country music stars had the glamour shed come to the city to find danny still had a year left at eglin air force base in florida to round out his twenty but he was soon commuting to nashville on every leave to shop his songs and to spend time with starlette when she turned up pregnant they decided to marry and six months later their daughter jenny was bornbeautiful and healthy danny was only two weeks from retirement when the world trade center was attacked after that hed refused to consider quitting despite starlettes protestations she didnt have to wait long for his return he deployed to afghanistan but was shot down three months later in an incident he was lucky to survive he took this as a hint from fate and returned to nashville with his discharge papers in hand soon he was dividing his time between flying singers selling songs sleeping with his new wife and raising his daughter the only problem in paradise was that he quickly tired of being a flying chauffeur jetset hillbillies were getting on his nerves some were truly wonderful people but others were real jerks with the fans they were warm and sincere but as soon as they hit the chopper they were bitching about the hassles of dealing with the public after six months without selling a song danny was ready to bail out he hadnt returned to mississippi except for funerals and one high school reunion hed enjoyed but ever since he hit fortyfive hed had an inexplicable itch to head back south the next time a singing cowboy millionaire said the wrong thing danny told him off and that was that it took some talking but he finally convinced starlette to give his hometown a try promising that if it didnt work out they could move back to tennessee laurel set aside michael mcdavitts file and forced herself to stop thinking about his father her strategy had been to focus on the conference after starlette and all she had done was rewind to the beginning of her relationship with danny god was she messed up she pulled out her file on carl mayer her most serious add case and tried to focus on the words and numbers on the page mean median stanineno matter how hard she stared the data wouldnt coalesce into anything coherent and why should it in less than five minutes she would be facetoface with a woman she had willfully betrayed for almost a year a woman who had never liked her probably out of anxiety about being judged a bad parent there was no way to avoid making those kinds of judgments but laurel always tried to keep them out of her eyes the problem was she didnt respect starlette mcdavitt most of the mothers laurel worked with bordered on sainthood when it came to dealing with their children starlette was on the opposite end of the spectrum laurel didnt think she could have betrayed a woman she respected although that might just be wishful thinking as danny had often said you never knew what you would do until life tested you a soft knock sounded at the door which should have given her a moments warning but she was so busy putting up her defenses that she forgot starlette always made grand entrances so laurel was totally unprepared when danny mcdavitt stepped into her classroom looking like a man hovering in some netherworld between life and death chapter im sorry danny said closing the door behind him starlette wouldnt come why not laurel almost whispered danny shrugged and shook his head you know what shes like said his eyes she found an excuse not to come he nodded i had to cancel a flying lesson to get here laurel studied him without speaking she hadnt laid eyes on danny for a week and then shed only caught a glimpse of him in his beatup pickup truck dropping michael at the front door the pain of not seeing danny was unlike anything she had ever known a hollow wasting ache in her stomach and chest she felt purposeless without him as though shed contracted an insidious virus that sapped all her energyepsteinbarr or one of those she was glad shed been sitting down when he opened the door should i come in or what he asked diffidently laurel shrugged then nodded not knowing what else to do she watched him walk toward the rows of miniature chairs near the back wall hes avoiding the table she realized giving me time to adjust danny moved with an easy rhythm even when he looked as if he hadnt slept or eaten for days he stood an inch under six feet with wiry muscles and a flat stomach despite his age with his weathered face and yearround tan he looked like what he was a workingman not a guy who had grown up privileged moving from private school to college fraternity to whatever professional school he could get into the son of a crop duster danny had gone to college on a baseball scholarship but quit after his second season to join the air force there hed aced some aptitude tests and somehow gotten into flight school he was no pretty boy but most women laurel knew were attracted to him his curly hair was gray at the temples but dark elsewhere and he didnt have it colored it was his eyes that pulled you in though they were deepset and gray with a hint of blue like the sea in northern latitudes and they could be soft or hard as the situation demanded laurel had mostly seen them soft or twinkling with laughter but they sometimes went opaque when he spoke of his wife or when he answered questions about the battles hed survived danny was in every respect a man whereas most of the males laurel knew even those well over forty seemed like aging college boys trying to find their way in a confusing world he turned one of the little chairs around and sat astride it placing the back between them as if to emphasize their new state of separation his grayblue eyes watched her cautiously i hope youre not angry he said i wouldnt have come but it wouldnt have looked right if one of us hadnt i dont know what i am he nodded as though he understood now that she was over the shock of seeing him here need and anger rose up within laurel like serpents wrestling each other her need made her furious for she could not have him and because her desire had been thwarted by his choice however noble that choice might have been the only thing worse than not seeing danny was seeing him and the worst thing was seeing him and being ignored as she had been for the past month no covert glances no accidental brushes of hands no misdirected smilesnothing but the distant regard of casual acquaintances in those crazed moments the hollowness within her seemed suddenly carnivorous as though it could swallow her up and leave nothing behind to be ignored by danny was not to exist and she could never convince herself that he was suffering the same way but looking at him now she knew that he was how could you come here she asked softly he turned up his palms i wasnt strong enough to stay away honesty had always been his policy and it was a devastating one can i hold you he asked no because there are people around or because you dont want me to she regarded him silently im sorry for how its been he said haltingly its justimpossible his eyes narrowed you look really thin good though she shook her head dont do this im not good im thin because i cant hold down any food i have to pretend to eat im barely making it if you want to know so lets just stick to michael and get this over with therell be another parent outside my door in fifteen minutes danny was clearly struggling with selfrestraint we really do need to talk about michael he knows somethings wrong he senses that im upset laurel tried to look skeptical do you think he could danny asked its possible all im saying is when im not okay hes not okay and i think you come into it as well you mean i mean when youre hurting he knows it and he cares a lot more than he does about his mother laurel wanted to deny this but shed already observed it herself i dont want you to talk like that anymore theres no point danny looked at the wall to his right where clumsy finger paintings of animals hung from a long board he had attached to the wall last year while he drilled the holes hed confided to her what he thought the first time he saw the pictures that the kids whod drawn them were never going to design computers perform surgery or fly airplanes it was a shattering realization for him but he had dealt with it and moved on and though laurels students were unlikely ever to fly a helicopter every one of them had ridden in one with their parents joyful permission danny had taken each and every child on spectacular flights over the mississippi river hed even held a contest for them and the winner got to fly with him on balloonrace weekend when dozens of hotair balloons filled the skies over natchez thirtyfive miles to the north this memory softened laurel a little and she let her guard down slightly youve lost weight too she said too much he nodded sixteen pounds in five weeks i cant hold nothing down improper grammar usually annoyed laurelshe had worked hard to shed the southern accent of her birthplacebut dannys slowtalking baritone somehow didnt convey stupidity danny had that lazy but coolasacucumber voice of competence like sam shepard playing chuck yeager in the right stuff it was the pilots voice the one that told you everything was under control and made you believe it too and when that voice warmed upin privateit could do things to her that no other voice ever had she started to ask if danny had seen a doctor about losing so much weight but that was crazy dannys doctor was her husband besides it didnt take a doctor to diagnose heartbreak i wish youd let me hug you danny said dont you need it she closed her eyes you have no ideaplease stick to michael okay what specific changes have you noticed in his behavior while danny answered slowly and in great detail laurel doodled on the postit pad on her table danny couldnt see the pad from where he sat it was blocked by a stack of books after covering the first yellow square with spirals she tore it off and started on the next one this time she didnt draw anything this time she wrote one word in boldface print pregnant then without knowing why she added im above it as soon as she wrote the second word she realized she meant to give the note to danny on his way out she wasnt going to tell him out loudnot here there would be no way to avoid a tense discussion or maybe something far less controlled the note would work he could dispose of it on the way home the same way she had disposed of the scrawled missives hurriedly passed to her at her classroom door like the ept box she would ditch later today all the detritus of an extramarital affair like that baby youre carrying said a vicious voice in her head the thing was she couldnt be sure the baby was dannys she certainly wanted it to be as absurd as that was given their situation but she didnt know and regardless of what kelly rowland had done in college laurel needed to find out who the father was only a dna test could determine that she was pretty sure you could analyze the dna of an unborn child but it would require an amniocentesis another thing shed have to go out of town to have done if she was going to keep it from warren she would have to get some of warrens dna without him knowing about it probably a strand of hair from his hairbrush would be enough so what do you think danny concluded youre the expert for the first time in her life laurel had not been listening to what danny was saying about his son for more than a year michael mcdavitt had been her highest priority in this classroom it wasnt fair but it was true she loved danny and because michael meant everything to him she had let the boy far inside her professional boundaries not that he was more important than the other kids but until last month she had believed she would one day become his stepmother and that made him different danny youve got to go she said with sudden firmness his face fell but we havent talked not really i cant help it i cant deal with us right now i cant im sorry that doesnt help he stood and it was clear that only force of will was keeping him from crossing the classroom and pulling her close i cant live without you he said i thought i could but its killing me have you told your wife that pretty much a wave of anxiety mingled with hope swept through laurel you told her my name danny licked his lips then shook his head sheepishly i see has she changed her mind about keeping michael if you divorce her no then we dont have you dont have to say it she could see that he hated his own weakness which had brought him here despite having no good news nothing had changed and therefore nothing could change for her he put his hands in his jeans pockets and walked toward the door laurel quietly tore the im pregnant postit off the pad and folded it into quarters when danny was almost to the door she stood are you sleeping with starlette she asked in a voice like cracking ice danny stopped then turned to face laurel no he said obviously surprised did you think i would she shrugged her shoulders so tight with fear and anger that she could hardly move them the thought of danny having sex with starlette could nauseate her instantly though hed sworn he wouldnt do it her mind had spun out endless reels of pornographic footage in the lonely darkness before sleep danny so desperate from going without laurel that he screwed his exbeautyqueen wife just for reliefand found that it wasnt so bad after all laurel was sure that starlette would be trying extra hard to make danny remember why hed married her in the first place midnight blow jobs were her specialty laurel had dragged this out of danny one night when hed drunk more whiskey than he should have apparently starlette would wait until he was sound asleep then start sucking him while he slept sometimes he wouldnt wake until the instant before orgasm and his expression when hed told laurel about this said all she needed to know about how much he enjoyed this little ritual once or twice she had thought of trying it herself but in the end she decided it was better not to compete with starlette at her game better to stick to her own bedroom tricks or invent some new onesand she had were broken up laurel said shes your wife i just assumed danny shook his head no what about you no laurel lied hating herself for it but too afraid of giving him an excuse to make love with starlette to tell him the truth besidesif she admitted to sleeping with warreneven just twice which was the truththe pregnancy would become a nightmare of doubt for danny danny was watching her closely then as he so often did and warren almost never he read her mind and did exactly what she wanted him to do he marched up to her and smothered her in his arms his scent enfolded her and the strength in his arms surprised her as it always did when he lifted her off her feet she felt herself melting from the outside in the note stayed clenched in her hand for until he let go there was no way to slip it into his pocket when he finally let her down she would squeeze his behind then slide the folded square into his back pocket she could text him later and tell him to look in his pocket he was murmuring in her ear i miss youjesus i miss you but she felt only the moist rush of air which sent bright arcs of arousal through her body as he lowered her to the floor he slid her crotch along his hard thigh and a shiver went through her she would be wet in the time it took him to slide his hand past her waistband she was thinking of helping him do just that when she saw a dark flash at the window in the door as though someone had looked in and then jerked suddenly out of sight she clutched dannys arm with her right hand and dragged it away from her stomach keep hugging me she told him youre an upset parent what he groaned theres someone at the door i think they saw us dannys body went limp and laurel patted his back as though comforting him then she pulled away and assured him that everything was going to work out eventually that michael might make surprising progress before the school year ended danny stared back like a lovesick teenager deaf to her words his eyes trying to drink in every atom of her being i love you he said under his breath i think about you every minute i fly over your house every day just hoping to get a glimpse of you i know she had seen the cessna he taught lessons in buzzing over avalon several times in the past five weeks the sight had lifted her heart every time in spite of her vows to forget him please shut up its better that you know than not i dont want you thinking theres anything between me and starlette other than the kids she felt a surge of brutal honesty but whats the point either you talk some sense into your wife or you may as well start sleeping with her again this is the last hug well ever have i mean it he nodded soberly danny she said realizing that she had not yet given him the note what she moved forward but now there was a face at the door and this time it did not retreat it belonged to ann mayer mother of carl the severe add case ann was staring at danny with undisguised curiosity to hell with her danny whispered stepping between laurel and the door what were you going to say nothing dont worry about it it was important i could tell laurel waved mrs mayer in and the door opened immediately michaels going to be fine major mcdavitt laurel said using dannys retired rank to put some distance between them i appreciate you saying so mrs shields danny replied a note of surrender in his voice im sorry i got upset like that dont give it another thought its tough raising a special boy especially for fathers mrs mayer nodded encouragingly to danny at last she thought she understood what shed witnessed goodbye laurel said and then she turned and led mrs mayer over to the round table not even looking up when danny closed the door is he all right mrs mayer asked her eyes hungry for details he will be lord he really lost it didnt he looked like he flat broke down to me laurel frowned im sure he wouldnt want anyone to know oh of course not you dont have to worry about me im just surprised thats all why well my husband told me major mcdavitt killed dozens of al qaeda terrorists over there in afghanistan he flew with some kind of commando unit thats what the newspaper said anyway this local legend was partly true laurel knew but in some ways a gross exaggeration i think he saved more people than he killed mrs mayer her eyes flickered oh really did he tell you that laurel pulled carl mayers file from her stack no major mcdavitt taught my husband to fly last year he doesnt like to talk about his war experiences but warren dragged a few things out of him oh i see said mrs mayer relievedor boredto hear the word husband brought into the equation laurel could plainly see that in mrs mayers eyes she and danny made far too natural a couple to spend any innocent time alone laurel felt precisely the same chapter laurel was in the middle of her seventh conference when her vision started to go the rapt face of the mother across the table wavered as though fifty yards of broiling asphalt separated them then the center of laurels visual field blanked out leaving a void like a tunnel through the world oh god she said in utter disbelief oh no she had lied to diane rivers about having a migraine now the lie was coming true already the blood vessels were dilating pressing on the cranial nerves interfering with her vision soon those nerves would release compounds that would drop her to her knees in unremitting agony what is it asked rebecca linton a woman of fifty with a mildly retarded daughter are you all right could the pregnancy be causing it laurel wondered shed read that some womens migraines worsened during their first trimester but in other women they improved its probably the shock of finding out im pregnant on top of all the other stress ultimately the cause didnt matter but coming on the heels of the positive pregnancy test the incipient migraine made her feel she was being pursued by furies intent upon delivering retribution for her moral transgressions a wave of nausea rolled through her which might be part of the prodrome or merely fear of the crippling agony that would soon lay her low a shower of bright sparkles burst like fireworks beside mrs lintons right ear jesus laurel breathed pressing her fist into her eye socket youre covered in sweat cried mrs linton are you having a hot flash i mean youre too young for it but thats what happens to me when i get them laurel gripped the edge of the table trying to get her mind around the situation best case she had fortyfive minutes before the headache hit worst case fifteen just enough time to make arrangements for the kids and get home to her dark and silent bedroom im afraid i need to cut our meeting short of course is there anything i can do could you wait here and tell my last appointment i had to leave im about to have a migraine headache of course ill wait darling whos coming next laurel looked at her schedule sheet a blank spot like a bullseye hovered in the middle of it mrs bremer you go on sweetheart ill call mary lou all us moms are like family now thank you so much laurel said grateful for the graciousness of southern women i dont get these much but when i do theyre severe say no more go go go she picked up her purse and computer case and hurried across the driveway to the elementary buildings office she told the secretary that she had to leave then walked down to diane riverss classroom and poked her head through the open door twentynine thirdgraders looked up as one diane looked over from her desk and saw instantly that laurel was in distress she got up and walked out into the hall her face lined with concern migraine worse deadly i have to go home do you think you could drop my kids off after school you know i will its right on the way laurel squeezed dianes hand then walked to the door at the end of the hall she was crossing the drive to her car when her aide called out from the playground behind the school where the children of the parents laurel had been meeting were playing erin sutherland was a local girl in her early twenties an education major from usm laurel didnt want to stopif her students saw her some would come runningbut erin waved both hands as she jogged to the fence so laurel walked over and forced a smile hello erin is something wrong i wanted to tell you one thing early this morning major mcdavitt came out and sat with his son for a while i figured it was okay since you and he are friends and i know how much he does for all the kids laurel nodded warily then cringed as another wave of nausea hit her the thing is erin went on he looked really upset i think maybe he was crying michael definitely was laurel had known danny was upset but crying was totally out of character for him she looked past erin scanning the playground until she found michael he was sitting alone on a motionless swing a small darkhaired boy with his hands floating before him as he rocked forward then back again and again did major mcdavitt say anything to you no i went up and asked if everything was all right but he just kind of waved me away you know like mind your own business and then he left erin nodded as though worried laurel would scold her laurel was about to reassure the girl when her cell phone vibrated against her left thigh it had been so long since danny had texted her that she ignored it at first then she remembered that her clone phone was in her left pocket and her legit one in her right the clone was registered to a friend of dannys and danny paid the bill in cash danny also carried a duplicate phone so that he could speak to laurel without starlette finding out about it this message could only be from danny laurel patted erins arm then turned and walked briskly to her acura flipping open the razr as she went dannys text read sorry about today please call star gone to baton rouge for the day laurel shut the phone without typing an answer then climbed into her car and drove quickly out to highway in her mind michael still sat on the motionless swing endlessly rocking with a stab of maternal guilt she forced the image from her mind she needed to drive to warrens office and get a shot of imitrex but warren was the last person she wanted to see right now he rarely noticed when she was angry or upset but he would have to be braindead not to see that she was on the ragged edge of a breakdown today besides she was pretty sure that her old imitrex injection kit was still at the house in the back of warrens medicine cabinet onlythere was dannys message to consider her pride told her to ignore it but she had been praying for just such a message for more than a month and now shed gotten it danny was waiting to hear from her right now waiting in his lovely old cypress house on fifty acres at the end of deerfield roadless than five miles from where she stood that was where theyd spent most of their extended time together except for a couple of overnight trips theyd managed to take last summer starlette frequently left town usually driving to baton rouge to shop in the upscale stores there or to have her hair and nails done in a real salon her expensive habits had given danny and laurel hundreds of hours to get to know each other over the past year so that instead of a frenetic affair that consisted of hurried sex in cramped and inconvenient places theyd enjoyed long afternoons taking walks swimming riding horses and even flying together the temptation to turn north on highway was strong all laurel had to do was send a reply and danny would be waiting in the clearing he had cut out of the forest just for her ostensibly a feed plot designed to attract deer the clearing was a circular opening in the trees about fifty feet across covered with clover a foot deep laurel had often lain in that fragrant green lake with danny inside her watching the clouds drift from one edge of the sky to the other to get to the clearing she used a small gate in the barbedwire fence that lined deerfield road danny had given her a key which she kept in the inside zip pocket of her purse but whenever he knew she was coming he unlocked the gate so that she could nose her acura through it without even getting out thirty seconds later she would be in the clearing where danny sat on his fourwheeler waiting to chauffeur her up to his house sometimes sitting behind him she would open his belt and squeeze him as he drove along the trail on rainy days hed let her drive and cup her breasts to protect them as the fourwheeler bounced along the deep ruts like a tractor crossing rows in a cotton field if he sensed that she was in the mood he would rub gentle circles around her nipples as she drove so that by the time they reached the house she was well and truly ready laurel shifted on the seat as she stopped for a traffic signal five weeks without danny had given her a constant lowgrade ache down low and sex with warren had done nothing to alleviate it the stoplight was a robert frost moment a left turn would take her home a right would carry her toward dannys property even with blank spots floating before her eyes she felt compelled to turn right two or three shattering orgasms might just nip her migraine in the bud but then where would she be back in an affair with a man who wouldnt leave his wifeor his son rather whichever the result was the same the secondclass citizenship of other womanhood laurel turned left and angrily gunned the motor her mind on the imitrex waiting at home as she neared the stately new homes of avalon the seemingly idyllic sameness of the place began to close in on her perfectly manicured lawns oceans of pink azaleas wellplaced magnolias brick border walls wroughtiron gates and cookiecutter colonials that held every antique armoire topend deer rifle and flatscreen television that the upper crust of athens point could buy on credit much of it had been purchased to distract the owners from marriages in various states of decomposition or so it seemed to laurel who heard the inside story on every couple in the teachers lounge at school as she turned onto her street lyonesse drive instinct suddenly got the better of her pride she took out her clone phone and texted danny without taking her eyes off the road she had sent so many text messages in the past year that she could work the keypad as effortlessly as any high school girl at athens country day give me mins she typed driving as swiftly as she dared between the mountainous speed humps she slid the razr back into her pocket she needed imitrex in her system as fast as she could get it but she needed danny just as bad images of past lovemaking fragmented into another shower of sparkles and she clenched her shoulders against what could be the first hammer blow to the side of her head why am i going to dannys place she wondered to pour out my heart to him so what if she was pregnant would danny abandon his autistic son to take care of a child that only might be his what if he suggested that she get an abortion shed probably kick him in the ballssomething to hint at the pain she would have to endure on an abortionists table there was no equivalent analog of the emotional loss she would endure in that case not for a man with that thought laurels father popped into her mind this was strange because she hadnt seen him for more than three years god would he rant if he knew about her situation at least she didnt have to worry about that the reverend tom ballard was off on a missionary trip in eastern europe an endless one apparently hed tried to explain his goals before he left but the more hed told laurel the more it had sounded like recruitment for some sort of christian cult so shed tuned out her father was a lay minister whod spent more time and money on other peoples children than he ever had on his own nominally baptist but really more of a roving tent show built around his own unconventional beliefs toms ministry was based in ferriday louisiana forty miles up the river from athens point this onehorse town had also produced jimmy swaggart and jerry lee lewis and tom carried the spirits of both men within him itinerant by nature he traveled ceaselessly to spread his version of the good news which always included music and sometimes involved an intimate laying on of hands laurels clearest and most embarrassing childhood memories were of squatting on the shoulders of highways in half the states in the union while her father tried to repair whatever brokendown junker he happened to be driving at the time laurel would wait in mute rage sweating or freezing as the case might be while her mother implored her father to let her flag down a passing motorist translation a man with more practical sense than the one shed entrusted her future to tom wasnt a bad man but he was a poor father about the only two benefits laurel had derived from his peripatetic lifestyle were world travel and books their rickety old house in ferriday contained more books than many of the big houses by the country club in athens point she had spent her preteen years reading a motheaten cambridge history of the ancient worldall fifteen volumesand vowing to marry a man opposite from her father in almost every way in warren shields she had found that man warren was so organized that at twenty hed kept meticulous records of his mileage and car maintenance in hindsight that should have signaled a seriously analretentive personality but to laurel ballard those records were flags marking a safe harbor warren hadnt come from a rich family but during his first year of medical school he was already buying bargain stocks and calculating which specialties would allow him to retire soonest only later did she begin to see the dark side of these traits such as being kept on a strict household allowance one that barely allowed her enough money to buy decent clothes warren also attended a real church with hardwood pews and stained glass not a oneroom saltbox with an aluminum steeple clapped on top with baling wire in warrens church the congregation spoke softly and needed hymnals to follow the hymns the minister always acted with great rectitude and no one evereverdanced or fainted in the aisles by marrying warren laurel got exactly what shed thought she wanted and then shed begun the long slow realization that financial security could be expensive to the soul warren too discovered that life didnt unfold according to even the bestlaid plans during the second year of his surgical residencyin boulder colorado which laurel had lovedwarrens mother had been diagnosed with a progressive nerve disease warrens father a school principal whod preached toughness his whole life had proved unequal to the task of caring for his wife as she moved toward death and because warrens mother refused to move to colorado for palliative care she claimed she had to take care of her husband while she could warren decided to take a sabbatical from his residency to return home and care for his mother laurel understood his motives but she had taught special ed for years to put warren through medical school and she finally had a year of architecture school under her belt she didnt think either of them should stop their educations even for one year but when warren pressed her she gave in and they returned to athens point when mrs shields lived longer than her doctors expected the temporary sabbatical slowly became permanent like a mining encampment becoming a town warren took a position in a local family practice and real money began flowing in then mrs shields let it be known that the one thing that might bring some joy to her last days was to see a grandchild born this time laurel dug in her heels her eyes on the receding horizon of their former future but how could she deny warrens mothers last request after some terrible arguments she relented and nine months later grant was born mrs shields lived ten months after that and grant certainly brought her joy but less than a month after her funeral as laurel was prodding warren to get everything in order for their return to colorado warrens father had a crippling heart attack thirty seconds after they got the call laurel realized that they would never go back to colorado shed tried to make the best of her life in athens point since there was no fouryear college in townmuch less a school of architectureshed joined the clubs that medical wives were expected to join to further their husbands careers the junior auxiliary the medical auxiliary the garden club the lusahatcha country club she went to church every sunday and even taught sunday school an immense personal sacrifice given her background but all this frenetic social networking did nothing to replace the dream she had given up rather it created an emotional tension that fairly screamed to be released for years laurel had tried the traditionally accepted outlets step aerobics tae bo reading groups invariably chick lit which made her want to slash her wrists in frustration at the heroines actions or lack of them shed even circulated through various walking groups in the hope of finding a friend who shared her frustrations with martha stewart land but in none of those clubs and groups had she discovered a single kindred spirit her ultimate solution had been to go back to work teaching solved several problems at once it gave her life a single focus one that excused her from the wearisome club duties she was accustomed to taking on she really cared about her students and felt she was giving them help that might otherwise be denied them in a small town teaching also brought her money that she could spend on whatever she wanted without the auditing glance warren always gave her when she made a purchase of even minor extravagance finally teaching had given her danny mcdavitt the kindred spirit she had been searching for all along moreover an unexpected lagniappe this kindred spirit came with an anatomically correct fully functioning penis and that she thought bitterly is what got me where i am now at least i hope it was his she thought passing the elfmans flowerlined driveway her own house appeared on a gentle rise farther on but the sight gave her no pleasure it was a contemporary version of a colonial at six thousand square feet twice the size of the homes that had inspired it laurel had wanted to design their home herself in conjunction with a professional architecther year of architecture school had made her proficient with the top cad programsbut warren had been against it hed marshaled a half dozen excuses for his opposition teaching wouldnt allow enough time for her to adequately supervise the project time spent dealing with contractors would steal hours from the children but the real reason was simpler warren knew that if she designed their home it would look nothing like the rest of the houses in avalon his instinct toward conformity was so strong that he could not bear what the neighbors might say about something that broke the carefully established pattern of the development and so laurel lived in a house much like those of her neighbors one her mother thought perfect but which she herself saw as one more cell in the suburban hive called avalon she swung into her driveway and hit the brakes warrens volvo was still parked in the garage she sat with her foot heavy on the brake unsure what to do something told her to back out and leave but there was no rational reason to do that besides warren might have seen her pull up the kitchen had a direct line of sight to the driveway why is he still home she wondered did he come home early for lunch no he was running late when i left for school this morning if he skipped hospital rounds and went straight to the office he would have had to make rounds at lunch he wouldnt be here has he been here all morning nothats impossible warren didnt take off from work unless he was seriously ill it took the fullblown flu to hold him down a paralyzing thought surfaced in the swirling sea of speculation what if he found the ept carton the used test strip from the pregnancy test no laurel said aloud no way not unless he went behind the shrubs under the bathroom windowand why in gods name would he do that theres no garden hose or anything else back there theres only mrs elfman could the old busybody have seen her drop the box from the bathroom window doubtful even if she had why would she give it to warren not even bonnie elfman was idiotic enough to congratulate her doctor on something he might not yet know himself but she might be malicious enough to do it laurel and mrs elfman had once quarreled over the boundary line of their lots a dispute resolved when a second survey proved laurel correct was the woman still bitter enough to take her revenge in such an extreme way no laurel decided warrens still here because of the irs audit the situation was probably worse than hed admitted warren never burdened her with business worries and he also knew that laurel had never trusted kyle auster his senior partner not even during the honeymoon years of the partnership austers smile was too broad his patter too slick for a physician with his priorities in line and he spent far too much money for the first few years warren had defended his older partneronly ten years older but that was sufficient to engender a little blind hero worshipbut in the last couple of years some of the shine had rubbed off of the statue in warrens mind he had seen austers human side too many times and hed revised his opinion accordingly she recalled the wild look in warrens eyes as hed searched the bookshelves this morning it took a great deal of stress to make her husband betray any emotion at all given his mental state this morning she wondered whether auster might have gotten them into serious legal trouble that must be it she decided worried for warren but also relieved for a distraction to keep him occupied during her present crisis she eased her foot off the brake and idled toward the garage wondering what she could do to soothe his nerves she was putting the car in park when she remembered the note in her pocket the one shed meant to give danny this morning a note saying im pregnant might give warren a stroke today even if he thought the child was his laurel considered stashing the note in her car but something told her not to take any chances depressing the cigarette lighter with her thumb she rolled down her window and switched the ac control to max then she fished the yellow postit from her pocket and touched the redhot lighter to its corner the gluecoated back of the note caught first then the draft from the air conditioner stoked the flame soon the note was burning in the ashtray laurel leaned out of her window to keep the smoke out of her hair when nothing remained but ash she grabbed her purse and computer and walked up to the house just as she would have on any other day squeezing past warrens volvo she remembered that she still had both razrs in her slacks habit was a strong force it would probably be better to leave the clone in the car but danny was liable to text her with more information about their meeting and she needed to stay abreast of the situation so that she could tell warren whatever would get her the most free time she took out the clone razr switched it to silent then slid it into her back pocket on the opposite side from the legit phone in front at least warren wouldnt see the flat bulges of two phones from any angle as soon as laurel entered the pantry she knew something was wrong moving into the kitchen she sensed that things were out of place as though they had been moved and then put back by someone who didnt know exactly where they went she heard nothing but there seemed to be a residue of anger in the air as though the house itself were disturbed she thought she smelled alcohol a faint trace coming from deeper in the houseand maybe burnt food yesthere was a microwave carton in the sink with something black leaking out of it warren had never been much of a cook he didnt care about food she left the kitchen and stepped down into the great room with its twostory windows and oversize fireplace several seconds passed before she realized that she was not alone warren was sitting so still that he didnt seem to be alive but his eyes were open and they were watching her warren was hunkered down on the ottoman of laurels eames lounger which he had dragged up to their thick glass coffee table he was still wearing yesterdays clothes warren she said are you all right the eyes blinked slowly but he said nothing she took a step closer then stopped still five yards from him come sit down he said i need to talk to you he motioned toward the sectional sofa that half surrounded the coffee table laurel started forward then checked herself something in his voice had set off an alarm in her head or maybe something lacking from it that was it all the life had gone out of his voice warren whats the matter she asked gently is it something to do with the tax audit he pointed at something on the coffee table a piece of paper i want to know about that laurel leaned forward and looked down and an explosion of panic detonated at the base of her brain now she understood everything the frantic searching shed witnessed this morning had nothing to do with the irs warren had somehow discovered the sole handwritten letter laurel had kept from her relationship with danny shed recognized it instantly because danny had written it in green ink the blockprinted letters shrieked up at her like an accusation of adultery when did warren find that she thought frantically since he hadnt come to bed last night it was possible that hed found the letter many hours ago found it read it and then begun tearing the house apart looking for more evidence probably the only reason he hadnt snatched her out of bed and confronted her last night was because the letter wasnt signed except for the word me which on the day laurel had received the letter made it sound like a note from a junior high school boy but which she now thanked god that danny had done im surprised you kept that warren said youre usually such a detail person i guess that letter means a great deal to you laurel stood frozen her eyes on the letter other than outright panicsquashed by survival instincther mind was blank she gazed at the green letters trying to keep the muscles of her face motionless she felt warren staring relentlessly at her not blinking and blood rushed into her cheeks nothing could stop that she could blame it on warrens confrontational posture but that would only postpone the inevitable from the moment warren found that letter the truth was bound to come out well he prompted his voice exquisitely controlled are you going to stand there and lie to me laurel knew what his exaggerated control signaled rage danny had always warned her to be prepared for this moment for getting caught anyone might have seen them on any day without their even knowing it danny had told her that people who had affairs behaved as though they were invisible as though passion created some sort of force field through which common people couldnt see but this was a chemical illusion and it took only a single unexpected glance to destroy it dannys letter was much more than that it was as deadly as a shot fired through the heart and it had probably destroyed warren to read it worse that shot had triggered an avalanche from the frozen heights above their marriage even now mountains of denial and repression were hurtling down upon them at two hundred miles an hour the silence in the room was the prelude to the roar of being buried alive youre not going to say anything warren demanded her mind grasped at the nearest concrete detail im getting a migraine thats why i came home early you poor thing whatever she said turning away im going to try to find the imitrex dont try to walk away from this as she looked back at him dannys voice spoke softly in her mind never admit anything no matter what he confronts you with deny it deny deny deny it may seem ridiculous but hell be desperate for any excuse to believe you if you admit cheating on him youll regret it later think before you act she knew danny was right but looking at warren now and knowing what was in the letter she saw how impossible that advice was she had no option but to tell the truth even if it meant living alone forever but first she needed the imitrex she couldnt complete the destruction of her marriage while having a migraine im going to find the imitrex she repeated firmly and walked away before warren could respond will you give me the injection come back here he shouted dont walk away from me laurel she waved acknowledgment but kept walking her eyes brimming with tears i said turn around goddamn it it was his tone that turned her not the goddamn there was something in it she had never heard before a fury that bordered on madness and she could imagine nothing more alien to warren shields than madness facing him again she saw that hed gone pale his right hand gripped the edge of the coffee table like that of a drowning man clinging to the gunwale of a lifeboat the sight triggered something deep within her something far deeper than thought an impulse concerned with her survival alone and then she saw why warrens other hand was holding a gun a black revolver pressed against the outside of his thigh only part of the gun was visible but there was no mistaking what it was my head is about to explode she said her eyes locked on to his by force of will alone whatever that piece of paper is ive never seen it before in my life chapter youre lying warren said still clutching the gun beside his leg i have to say thats the last thing i expected from you laurel refused to acknowledge the guns existence yet it filled her mind with terrifying power where had warren gotten a pistol he owned a rifle and a shotgun but so far as she knew there wasnt a single handgun in the house yet he was holding one now should she acknowledge it was it riskier to pretend the gun wasnt there would that reinforce the idea that she was lying warren was almost hiding it from her though for now she decided she would pretend she hadnt seen it i dont know what youre talking about she said in a level voice she pointed at the letter on the coffee table what is that he slid the letter toward her why dont you read it she picked up the note and scanned the words she knew by heart her eyes swimming aloud please warren said what read the letter aloud she looked up youre kidding right do i look like im kidding itll be so much more powerful that way warren read it will you give me the injection when im done he nodded shed read dannys last letter so many times that she could recite it from memory she reminded herself not to glance away from the paper as she read a mistake she might pay for with her life she began reading in a lifeless monotone i know the first rule of this kind of relationship is never write anything down but in this case i feel i have to a you skipped the salutation warren said coldly she sighed then backed up and gave him what he wanted laurel she said blah blah blah a transient wisp of electrons wont do it theres no need to go over the facts weve both done that until were almost insane but before i say what i want to say let me remind you that i love you i feel things for you that ive never felt before she looked up and spoke sharply warren this is bullshit where did you get this he looked back at her without speaking did someone give you this an odd smile touched his lips i actually found it in your copy of pride and prejudice but then you know that already dont you i told you ive never seen this before in my life he shook his head deny till you die huh i really expected more from you than this wheres the woman of principle whos always criticizing people why cant you tell me the truth because this guy dumped you are you scared to leave me without another man to run to the words rolled right over her she couldnt get past the gun it seemed unreal in warrens hand a mockery of everything he stood for he had never liked guns he knew how to shoot of course like any man raised in a small southern town but he wasnt like a lot of the men she knew who had fetishes about guns many homes in athens point held half a dozen firearms and some forty or fifty a couple of doctors actually carried guns on their person and had built pistol ranges on their property shed heard warren make disparaging comments about those men something to the effect that they used the idea of selfdefense to justify the macho feeling that guns gave them laurel agreed but warrens take on things had surprised her because unlike most people he had actually used a gun to defend his family when he was fifteen years old a prowler had broken into his parents house looking for anything he could steal to buy drugs warren had awakened crept down the hall and found a hoppedup teenager pointing a gun at his fathers chest and demanding money without thinking warren rushed to his parents room and grabbed his fathers loaded from the top shelf of the closet then he ran back to the front room and shot the yelling prowler in the back he didnt yell out a warning or call he saw his parents in mortal danger and he responded with deadly force the police saw things the same way and within hours warren shields was a local hero a week later the nra sent a reporter to town to get the story to run it in their the armed citizen column in american rifleman warren and his parents declined this celebrity as it turned out the boy warren had shot was only three years older than warren himself warren had played baseball against him when he was still in high school as far as laurel knew warren had never fired another pistol since that day yet now he was holding one in his hand dont look at the gun she told herself somebodys screwing with your head warren thats the only explanation for this another faint smile as though he could appreciate her efforts to deny the obvious the way grant tried to deny peeing on the toilet seat then it shouldnt bother you to keep reading he said maybe together we can figure out who wrote this warren read she closed her eyes for a few moments then continued i think of you in everything i do youre as much a part of my being as i am this emotion feels unselfish but its not because you are my salvation and not only mine as you know no lesser thing could keep me from coming to you i know you know that and thats not why im writing you im writing to tell you something else you already know hopefully to give you the last push you need you deserve more than i can give you and thats why were not together but you also deserve more than warren can give you much more you have to leave him laurel he can never make you happy and you know it he doesnt even know you if he did he would never have let you give up so much to come here over the top of the letter she saw warrens mouth tighten into a grimace of hatred she stopped but he motioned for her to go on you and warren are complete opposites he is cold logical heldin almost sterile youre warm vibrant creative sensual all the things youve shown me this past year im not trying to denigrate him i know he has good qualities hes an honest man a good provider i dont care much for his parenting style but im not sure we have much choice in that were all victims of our fathers that way but your needs are so deep emotionally sexually intellectuallywhile his seem so limited and concrete youve told me that yourself he doesnt really want a wife but a beautiful servant that role will never be enough for you and the sooner you admit that the better off youll be warren will be too the only way you could stay with him is by becoming a lifelong martyr to your children ive known women who did that zoloft for the daytime sedatives at night a vibrator in the drawer and too many glasses of wine at parties they all regret it later laurel paused for breath too afraid to look up she pushed forward on autopilot please dont choose that life dont sell yourself short the simple truth is that you married too young should you pay for that mistake for the rest of your life i know i knowdo as i say not as i do but were in very different situations grant and beth will be all right no matter what you choose im going to abide by our agreement i never thought of myself as weak until i was inside you now i know how weak i truly am ill never get myself out of you and ill never get you out of me im sorrier than youll ever know she paused trying to blot danny from her mind as though not thinking of him might somehow protect him its signed me how convenient warren said acidly dont you think and the writer seems to have his finger on the pulse of our marriage doesnt he or he thinks he does anyway who do you think might know us that well she kept staring at the paper wishing harder than she had as a child forced to sing in front of her fathers congregation that she could magically be transported elsewhere as she stared the periphery of her vision shrunk and went dark until she was staring at the letter through a round window her dread of pain returned with enough force to take her out of the momentalmost just tell me the truth warren said softly please i wont be angry glancing up at his slitted eyes she felt she had just heard a rattlesnake hiss just step right here on my tail i promise i wont bite you i have told you the truth you dont want to hear it she dropped the letter on the floor i got a migraine aura thirty minutes ago if i dont get that injection ill be flat on my back all afternoon unable to speak you wont be able to continue this ridiculous interrogation he regarded her coolly withstanding his scrutiny as best she could she tried to make a plan of action given the asyetunmentioned gun she should probably get out of the house as fast as possible but that wasnt as simple as it sounded she couldnt outrun warren and no one could outrun a bullet it seemed inconceivable that he would actually shoot her but if someone had asked her whether warren would threaten her with a gun she would have declared that impossible too noshe was going to have to talk her way out of this talk and bluff is that a gun in your hand she asked in a neutral voice he lifted the pistol into plain sight this yes that it is is it loaded of course an unloaded gun is useless oh boy where did you get it i bought it a couple of months ago some punks hassled me one night when i was riding my bike on the south end of town i carry this in my seat bag now ive got a permit for it warren was still an obsessive cyclist hed won dozens of regional races and even a couple of nationals a few years ago he rode countless miles in training but shed heard nothing about any gun or any incident where hed needed one you keep that in the house with our children shed tried to sound suitably shocked but warren ignored her apparent concern i have a lockbox for it in the storeroom top shelf its kidproof dont worry its not the kids im worried about right now that doesnt mean its grantproof a smile crossed warrens face as he thought of his mischievous son why are you holding it now she asked because im very angry and this makes me feel better oh god apparently he went on you dont want to tell me the truth but you should know this youre not leaving this house until i know who wrote that letter i dont want to leave the house warren i want a shot of imitrex he frowned as though he were being greatly inconvenienced give me your cell phone a shiver of panic went through her until she remembered she was carrying both phones there had been days when shed only had her clone phone in her pocket hand it over your car keys too she slid her hand into her right front pocket and drew out her legitimate razr warren reached out and took it then laid it on the coffee table ive already gone over your cellular records online ive got a couple of questions for you she shrugged there was no danger there she had always used her clone phone to call danny the keys come on she drew her car keys from her left front pocket and passed them to warren who shoved them into his own pocket she hated to give them up but she couldnt risk him searching her and finding the clone phone in her back pocket danny was probably trying to call her right now he would be sitting in the clearing on his fourwheeler expecting to see her acura come rolling between the big oak trees hed wait awhile thinking she was only running late then he would start to worry she had to contact him a sickening wave of nausea hit her and she tensed against it as it passed she got an idea about how to text danny i want your computer too warren said where is it in the kitchen the blood drained from her face there were things in her computer that could destroy her danny too im going to throw up she groaned she ran for the master bathroom goddamn it warren cursed jumping up and rushing after her she ran all the way to the toilet cubicle hoping that warren would stop in the bedroom but he didnt he stood over her as she fell to her knees and put her face in the toilet bowl she had no choice now retching loudly she stuck her finger down her throat and brought up what remained of her breakfast warren didnt flinch hed seen things in his medical career that made a little vomit look like a picnic she was terrified that he would notice the flat rectangular bulge of the second razr in her back pocket but he suddenly walked out of the cubicle she heard him rummaging in the medicine cabinet on his side of the marblefloored bathroom could she risk texting danny now is the imitrex in there she coughed did you find it ive got it come lie on the bed and ill give you the shot stay away from the bathroom windows i noticed mrs elfman nosing around out there this morning laurels throat constricted in terror she prayed that the ept box still lay behind the hedge beneath the bathroom window hurry up warren said irritably suddenly standing above her again youre done arent you im still nauseated the sooner the better then he grabbed her pants right above the pocket that held the razr as she screamed and tried to protect the phone he yanked down her waistband and jabbed a needle into her hip after what seemed a savage twist he yanked it out again ow she cried whats wrong with you me im cold logical heldin almost sterile he slapped the spot where hed injected her something nurses did to distract patients from the pain of injectionsusually before the needle went inbut his slap was hard enough to bruise tell me who wrote that shit tell me who else has been looking at that ass his voice had a proprietary edge no one i told you when was the last time you fucked him laurel tried to stand but warren seized her neck and pressed her back down in twelve years of marriage he had never laid a hand on her in anger fresh fear twisted her insides warren that hurts please think about what youre doing you want to talk about pain thats funny i dont need to think about this yes you do i havent cheated on you id never do that to you youre a liar he shoved her against the toilet then walked away again she scrambled to her feet and ran to her side of the bed there was no point in trying to flee the house unless she could slow him down first pulling back the comforter and sheets she crawled under them and pulled them up to her neck get up warren said from the foot of the bed i want to check your computer go get it then im going to lie here until the aura goes away if i leave you here youll climb out the window damn right i will ten minutes in the dark warren please if the aura stops ill do whatever you want she closed her eyes you can lie here with me if you want to i dont he said but he flicked off the light switch the windows are locked by the way all of them she shifted under the covers then slid her hand into her back pocket and eased out the clone razr in one continuous motion she opened the phone and slipped it into her front pocket warren was a black silhouette in the dark leaning on his bureau when i read that letter he said hoarsely i felt like someone had stabbed me in the heart she slid her thumb lightly over the razrs keypad keying in a message was childs play but blindly pressing the proper sequence of buttons to put the phone into text mode wasnt she turned her head and looked at warren as she worked her thumb over the faintly tactile buttons trying to keep his eyes focused on her face im not having an affair she said softly i havent had one in the past either i would never do that to grant and beth warren flipped out the cylinder of his revolver and spun it i wouldnt have thought you could the cylinder snicked home but the letter says different that letter is bullshit laurel had the razr in text mode she began keying her message to danny her eyes never leaving her husbands face someone faked it to mess with your head to her surprise warren seemed to be considering her suggestion who would fake something like that he asked as though talking to himself somebody who wants to drive you crazy and its obviously working warren if you lift a hand to me again im calling the police and hiring a divorce lawyer this was pure bravado even in near darkness she could see his neck and jaw muscles tightly flexed dannys letter had utterly transformed him with an infinitesimal movement of her right thumb she pressed send and slid her hand out of her pocket i still have the aura she said with genuine anxiety my arms are tingling and im craving ice cream imitrex only shortens the headache you know that she closed her eyes again youve got to get up warren said i want to see your computer you can lie on the sofa in the great room laurel prayed that danny was already reading her message shed risked a lot to send it and she hadnt sent the message danny would have wanted her to but she still had the phone and in her heart she still believed she could talk warren down from this flight of rageso long as her computer concealed its secrets at bottom the idea that warren shields md might shoot the mother of his children was preposterous but what he might do to a man who had fornicated with and impregnated her was another matter get up goddamn it warren snapped kicking the side of the mattress the violence of his anger was what worried her for it was wholly new laurel stood slowly gathered the comforter around her shoulders and padded into the hall that led to the kitchen run danny she thought for michaels sake run chapter danny mcdavitt was lying on his back in a sea of clover when his cell phone chirped signaling the arrival of a text message he hadnt heard that sound since the day hed told laurel that he couldnt leave his wife and watched her crumble before him danny didnt reach straight for his phone he knew the true worth of lying in sundrenched clover waiting for the touch of a woman who loved him there had been more than a few moments in his life when hed been certain that he wouldnt survive into the next minute much less live to lie in a fragrant bower like this one waiting for a beauty like laurel shields in the air force danny had been known as an eventempered guy even among pilots but falling in love with a woman he could not possess had rewired part of his brain an emotional volatility was loose in him and it frightened him sometimes the chirping phone for example laurels reply to the text message hed sent after their parentteacher conference had lifted him from depression to blissful anticipation in the span of four seconds but this time the chirp had sent a tremor of fear through him laurel was already late and a new text message was likely to tell him shed decided not to meet him after all he couldnt blame her it had been unfair of him even to ask nothing had changed in his marital situation hed simply reached a point of such desperate longing that hed been unable to keep from begging he hated himself for the weakness hed shown this morning it was true that starlette had bailed on the teacher conference that was par for the course but the second shed started making excuses dannys heart had soared her avoidance would give him an excuse to see laurelin privateand even though hed known she would be upset hed gone to her classroom anyway danny dug his hand into the deep clover and found his phone but still he didnt read the text message he didnt want to shatter his dream yet twentyone years of military service had taught him to let good things linger while he could even if they were illusory danny had seen the world from the cockpit of an mh pave low helicopter starting with the original bird in antidrug operations out of the bahamas in not the dream duty it sounded like and winding up in the futuristic pave low iv in afghanistan where in late he was shot down and finally retired in between he had served on almost every continent with bosnia and sierra leone proving particularly memorable pave lows from dannys group the elite twentieth special operations wing had opened gulf war one by crossing the desert in pitch blackness and taking out iraqs air defenses opening the skies for the armys betterknown ah apaches danny still remembered the unparalleled rush of flying a massed formation of birds into what everyone knew was going to be the first real war since vietnam his own personal apocalypse now moment his sound track rather disappointingly in hindsight had been willie nelsons on the road again rather than wagners ride of the valkyries though desert storm had ended faster than anyone expected thered been no shortage of adrenalinecharged missions to follow but they paled in comparison to what hed endured in the hellish mountains of afghanistan a land that bred warriors the way america now bred lawyers give me some good news he murmured raising the cell phone at last he held the device far enough from his aging eyes to read the tiny letters on the screen and pressed read laurels message materialized almost instantly warren knows getmichael leavetownasap no heroics danny stopped breathing this was the last thing hed expected after all the times they might have been caughtand there had been some close callshed thought the danger had finally dropped to zero he reread the message as he got to his feet trying to work out what might have happened some sort of confrontation obviously but why was she telling him to run did she think he was in danger that was difficult to imagine danny had given warren shields flying lessons for four months and hed come to know the doctor as a quiet restrained methodical man just what you wanted in a physician and indeed in a pilot the idea of warren shields harming his wife seemed silly and the possibility of him coming after danny even more farfetched and yetdanny had seen enough men under severe stress to know they were capable of wildly unpredictable behavior hed seen soldiers do things in battle zones that no one back home would have believedsome good things but more of them bad there was no question of taking laurels advice if she was in danger he wasnt about to cut and run the question was what could he do to help her if he shed his anonymity as her lover he would bring about the very thing he was trying to avoid by remaining with starlette he would lose custody of michael but if laurel was truly in danger he started to text her back and tell her that she wasnt alone that he would solve whatever problem had come up but she was alone at least in the sense that he wasnt with her and fighting with warren almost certainly one call or text message from danny might give away everything or hurt her in some way that he couldnt guess at he trotted to his fourwheeler cranked the engine and wrestled the honda onto the track that led up to the house his chest thrummed with nervous energy the shock of her message had been profound hed been dreaming of the moment that laurel would rush into his arms after five weeks apart she would melt under his hands hell shed started melting in her classroom to be ripped from that fantasy into this reality had disconcerted him but danny knew how to shift neural gears in a hurry countless times hed been roused from dreams by a klaxon calling him to battle or to rescue men barely clinging to life their limbs shredded guts puddled in their laps like bowls of pasta his ability to adapt quickly was one reason he was still alive he jiggered the honda into his garage hit the kill switch and jumped off first he needed to know where laurel was the school home warrens office he started to get his car keys from the kitchen but stopped at the door danny drove a dodge charger hed restored himself warren knew the car well so it was useless in this context climbing back onto the honda danny drove down to the shed where he kept his lawn equipment hed bought an ancient ford pickup to make runs to the hardware store and to the nursery he and michael used it to tool around the property together michael had steered it from dannys lap several times an experience akin to flying over baghdad on a bad night danny parked the fourwheeler jumped into the cab of the truck backed out of the shed and drove across his lawn toward deerfield road as he passed his house he considered stopping to get his ninemillimeter from the bedroom but that would be plain crazy he decided serious overkill hold on babe he said pushing the old truck toward the paved road im coming laurel lay silently on the great room sofa her comforter pulled up to her neck warren was sitting on the ottoman hed dragged over to the coffee table and staring at laurels sony vaio which hummed in front of him like a willing informer his forefinger slid steadily over the computers trackpad he was working methodically through her file tree in windows explorer laurels computer posed several risks some minor others grave she kept some files on it that while they would not implicate danny directly would certainly make warren suspicious there were stored aol messages that could cause her trouble but he was unlikely to see them as significant unless he crossreferenced everything he found against a calendar but there was one thing she absolutely could not afford for him to discoverthe digital equivalent of an atomic bomb laurel maintained a secret email account that warren knew nothing about ostensibly they both used aol as their mail server and laurel did use aol for her official email life notes to friends school announcements and the like but her correspondence with danny was run through a free hotmail account protected by a password laurels hotmail username was misselizabethhotmailcom corny perhaps cribbing a digital alias from jane austen but what else was she going to choose agent hester prynne the sony was programmed to forget her username and password every time she logged off but she knew that these keys to her secret life must reside somewhere on the hard drive as did her past email messages a forensic computer expert would doubtless be able to call up that data like a boy rubbing a genies lamp what warren could accomplish on his own was open to question he knew how to operate most mainstream windows programs but he was no wizard he was patient though and if he was willing to hack at the sony for hours who knew what he might uncover if he stumbled onto that hotmail account or god forbid somehow guessed her password her secret life would be served up on a plattera poisonous platter that would kill warren even as he devoured it his eyes glowed with feral hunger as his fingers flew over the keys and his orbits almost black from lack of sleep gave him a desperate mien danny had said warren would want to believe that shed been faithful despite evidence to the contrary but she saw no such desire in his face now warren wanted only one thing the identity of the man with whom she had betrayed him as he punched at the keys she noticed how unhealthy he looked competitive cycling had sculpted warren into a figure of toned muscle prominent veins and limber tendons but in the past couple of months shed noticed an unusual puffiness in his face his neck and even on his body he still had heroically defined leg muscles but he was looking soft around the edges with a womanly sort of fat accruing around his hips and upper back shed assumed this was due to age or maybe even depression but the truth was shed been too selfabsorbed to ask about it besides warren had always been touchy about his body and a question like that might offend him looking at him now she saw a depth of fatigue that could not be explained by a single night of sleep deprivation its got to be work she decided kyle auster must have finally gotten the practice in bad trouble kyle was capable of anything in laurels estimation hed made it clear from the outset of the partnership that he would dearly love to sample her physical charms and warren stayed so busy with his patients that he might easily be duped into anything but what exactly warren wouldnt get this bent out of shape over some tax penalties what was the next step prison surely that was impossible you had to commit outright fraud to go to jail and warren would never have let kyle go that far she wondered though if the senior partner could have committed fraud without warrens knowledge if so then todays manic persecution made at least some sense warren might be displacing the anger he felt at his former mentor and venting it on her what was warren looking for when he found dannys letter she wondered should i ask him or is it safer to lie here with my mouth shut and pray that my digital secrets remain inviolate with a giddy rush laurel realized that the blank spots in her visual field were gone the imitrex was working she still had the dislocated feeling of a migraine aura but the aura wasnt metastasizing into a headache that could still happen of course and at any moment she wondered if the imminent danger rather than the imitrex had shut down her headache get back on point said a voice in her head youre drifting the kids will be home before you know it and then youre looking at a real nightmare even the thought made her breath go shallow it was well after noon already she couldnt know exactly how late it was without checking her cell phone which was what she used for a watch these days and that was buried in her pocket she considered asking warren the time but asking questions would only emphasize that she wasnt free to get up and walk into the kitchen trying to gauge elapsed time was tricky under stress she remembered that from her labor with grant but she figured that in two hours more or less diane rivers would drop grant and beth off at the end of the sidewalk the children would race up to the front door unaware that their father was waiting inside with a loaded gun i cant wait for that she decided i cant bank on talking warren around to reason before the kids get home because i might not be able to talk him down she stole another look at his eyes which tracked across her computer screen with laserlike precision sucking up every character on the screen hes not going to stop until he finds out what he wants to know and hes not going to accept innocence until hes turned over every goddamned rock he can find even then will he believe me once somebody begins to doubt your honesty wiping away suspicion is almost impossible thats why people never survive public investigations some of the mud always sticks justified or not and in my case it is im guilty and on some level warren knows that if he gets deep enough into my sony hell have the proof hes starving for or what if he doesnt what if he finds my hotmail account but not my password would he use the kids as leverage over me searching for a crack in the mask of jealousy that was warrens face she began to wish shed sent danny a very different message i should have dialed the second i saw the gun im like one of those stupid babysitters in a slasher movie tstl too stupid to live she still had her clone phone of course she could dial right now if she wanted but warren had once explained to her that there was no autolocation system in place for cell phones yetnot in mississippi anyway if you didnt tell the dispatcher where you were it could take a long time for help to reach you if ever what if she called and simply left the line open the dispatcher might eventually hear enough of warrens threats to realize a dangerous situation was in progress but againhow would they find her if she dialed it would have to be from the house phone they knew where you were the second you dialed in from a landline laurel had already taught grant and beth this if she could get close enough to one of the home extensions she could definitely bring the police to the house even if she simply opened the line and said nothing and yet calling the police might be the most dangerous action she could take athens point was a small town sixteen thousand people avalon was outside the city limits in lusahatcha county home to another ten thousand souls that meant it was policed by the sheriffs department laurel didnt know how much training local deputies had but she was pretty sure there was no stateoftheart crisis management team or hostage negotiator an image of the local sheriff standing outside her house yelling into a bullhorn came into her mind what were the odds that this situation could peacefully be resolved by a man like billy ray ellis hed been a petroleum land man before winning the post of sheriff and he was a patient of warrens how long would he wait before ordering an allout assault on the house his deputies would probably be exhighschool jocks with an excess of testosterone warren could easily wind up dead or locked in parchman farm for the rest of his life and even if he chose not to punish her for calling she might be killed by a stray bullet or tear gas canister shed seen that kind of thing enough times on cnn such thoughts might be extreme but he had threatened her with a gun noshe needed to resolve this situation herself and soon before the kids got home i can text diane she thought with dizzying relief tell her to take the kids home with her rather than drop them here laurel was about to slip her hand into her pocket when she realized the risks that such a move would entail shed be texting from her clone razr which was registered to dannys helpful friend the unfamiliar number might confuse diane enough to make her call the house or what if diane had something else to do after school what if she tried to call back laurels razr was set to silent but if diane got no answer she might call the house phone warren would answer and in less than a minute hed learn that laurel had just texted diane from a cell phone game over laurel slid her hand away from her pocket she couldnt risk losing the clone phone yet ive got to get out of here she thought could she hit warren hard enough to disable him if so she could take back her car keys which would seriously shorten the distance she had to run she looked around the great room for a heavy object a thick blownglass vase on the console table against the far wall might do but shed have to choose her moment perfectly if she tried to hit warren and missed there was no telling how he might react at the very least he would tie her up and then shed be truly helpless when the kids walked into this horror show with that thought came the first ripples of true panic fluttery jerks in the heart muscle that made her swallow hard even as the saliva evaporated from her mouth dont give in to panic she told herself the phrase made her recall her days as a counselor at a girls summer camp where shed taught lifesaving to young teens panic will kill you so do everybody a favor remain calm and focus on safety even if youre partying safety she said softly what asked warren looking over at her with redrimmed eyes nothing im out of it my heads starting to hurt bad the imitrex will kick in its working on those vessels now warren was talking on medical autopilot shed heard that robotic voice thousands of times when nurses called the house at night for instructions but laurel wasnt listening now she was thinking about a room that shed insisted be added to the house before they moved in some people called it a panic room but the architect theyd worked with had simply called it the safe room located under the staircase it was a windowless eightbytenfoot cubicle with steel walls a reinforced door and an electronic lock that operated from the inside the safe room also had a dedicated phone line that ran underground to a box at the street warren had stocked the safe room with canned food and water for use during hurricanes and also with blankets and pillows for comfort grant and beth had camped out in the safe room a couple of times they called it their fort the place theyd run to if bad guys broke into the house laurel had never imagined a day when the bad guy she would need to escape would be her husband but that day had come she knew she could reach the safe room before warren stopped her he was so deep into her computer files that she could be halfway there before he got up off the ottoman wait she thought already flexing her calf muscles beneath the comforter think it through so i get to the safe room then what call no call diane and tell her to take the kids to her house without telling anyone else about it if i say family crisis diane will handle it no questions asked once the kids were safe laurel could call the police or better yet a lawyer she knew who was friendly with the sheriff he would get a more serious hearing and when the law arrived at the house warren would have no hostage to threaten he would effectively be alone with his gun and his wifes computer the most likely risk at that point laurel realized would be suicide she closed her eyes wondering if warren could really be that far gone he seemed more angry than depressed but more was going on inside him than she knew there had to be but now wasnt the time to question him about it leave that to the tstl girls she flexed her fists beneath the covers then her forearms when she felt the blood flowing she tensed her biceps shoulders and abdomen then her thighs flex release flex release it was like warming up for one of those classes at curves only her life might depend on this little exercise she wasnt about to spring up off her sofa like a lioness and then collapse in a heap because her feet were asleep should i grab the computer she wondered that would be a tacit confession of guilt plus warren might tackle her before she could get clear with it she could wait until he walked farther away to make her move but that might not happen for hours warren could go for most of a day without urinating and he might well be expecting her to try to damage the machine while she debated when to run warren stood without a word and walked away from the sony laurel didnt follow him with her eyes she flexed her calves but maintained the illusion of a woman at rest his footfalls stopped then started again she risked cutting her eyes to the left warren had walked most of the way to the door that led to the master bedroom but now hed stopped again he was watching her with obvious suspicion what the hell is he doing she thought as if in answer he muttered something then took the blownglass vase off the sideboard unzipped his pants and began to urinate into the vase he looked straight at laurel as he did this a cloud of selfdisgust over his features see what youve brought me to he seemed to be saying laurel didnt give a damn she used his primitive act as an excuse to sit up then she gave him a withering glare thats gross she said listening to the steady splash of piss in her expensive vase cant you use the toilet i didnt think youd want to get up she shook her head as though this were beneath contempt warren often peed for more than a minute but she wasnt counting on that as though battling nausea she hung her head between her knees then she exploded off the couch snatched the sony off the coffee table and raced for the front stairs the ac cord nearly jerked the computer out of her hands but it popped free as warren screamed the urinefilled vase rang against the maple floor as she reached the first door and cut left warren roared with anger and heavy footsteps pounded after her go go go she cried darting through the foyer and snatching open the wooden closet door that concealed the steel entrance to the safe room joy flooded through her as she grabbed the handle and pulled and almost ripped her shoulder out of its socket at first she thought warren had yanked her arm back but the truth was simpler the safe room was locked a racking sob burst from her throat as she wrenched the handle once more but it was no use then she realized what was wrong there was a childprotection mechanism to keep children from inadvertently getting locked inside the safe room a threedigit code that could seal the safe room from outside but not override the master lock which was controlled from the inside laurel frantically punched then jerked the handle again it didnt budge horrified she whirled to try for the front door but warren was already standing outside the little closet staring at her with a malevolence she had never suspected in him i changed the code he said she felt tears on her cheeks youre like a fiveyearold caught in a lie he went on totally predictable nothing he could have said would have enraged her more give me the computer he demanded holding out one hand she lifted the lightweight vaio and hurled it at the floor with all her strength warrens foot shot out to deflect the computer and the machine hit the carpet with no more force than her cell phone did when she dropped it at the market laurel balled her hands into fists and screamed at the top of her lungs she didnt know what she was saying but whatever it was it was the wrong thing warren raised the gun aimed at her face and pulled the trigger fire spurted from the muzzle and something stung her face she reeled back in shock her ears ringing from the blast in the confined space her left cheek hurt badly but she didnt think shed been hit by a bullet the pain was in her skin warren must have aimed just to the right of her ear she wanted to slap him but she didnt dare risk it that shut you up he said his eyes like blue ice and dont think the police will come running because of that shot not even the elfmans heard it and theyre the closest to us now pick up that computer and hand it to me she blinked away tears of impotent rage no he stepped forward and laid the hot barrel flush against her forehead she jerked away from the scalding steel and stared back at the man she had slept with for more than a decade and saw no one she recognized she bent at the waist picked up the sony and handed it to him what now warren smiled like a wolf at cornered prey lets see what youre hiding danny mcdavitt turned his pickup truck east off of highway and rolled into avalon he drove as fast as he could without drawing attention to himself in this neighborhood in this truck everyone would assume he was coming to cut someones grass or to fix a faucet danny had been to a few parties in these palatial houses some moneyed folk in athens point didnt mind mixing with the common people and he had actually been making some pretty good money himself for the past year hed sold two songs before march but that was chicken feed compared to what he was making on his oil deals with john dixon the geologist had invited danny to buy into a couple of wildcats he felt good about and one had come in with twelve feet of pay at abarrel oil even dannys oneeighth interest was worth real money but the timing was bad maritally speaking that oil wellplus the four others they were working over nowwas the main reason starlette wanted to stay married to him danny turned left onto lyonesse drive and slowed down the shields house was a big colonial set well back from the road on a wooded lot if the garage door was shut he wouldnt be able to tell a thing but three seconds later danny saw laurels midnight blue acura parked behind her husbands gray volvo which stood halfway out of the open garage theyre both at home he thought in the middle of the day he knew from experience that this almost never happened for one thing laurel should still be at the school for another dr shields didnt usually get home until after his evening rounds unless his kids had an athletic event scheduled danny could hardly believe that hed coached soccer with warren shields only last year but he had their daughters were the same age and since danny had been teaching shields to fly the doctor had suggested that they coach a team together all in all the experience had been good but danny had discovered that warren shields approached everything with deadly seriousness even soccer for five and sixyearold girls danny drove to the end of lyonesse then executed a threepoint turn and rode back by the house nothing had changed of course he felt like a high school boy cruising past the home of a girl he had a crush on as a teenager hed swing past a girls house five or six times a night just on the off chance of catching a glimpse of her stupid and yet as primal as the mating rituals of cromagnon man jesus he muttered pulling to the curb what the hell am i supposed to do now laurels message had been too vague warren knows how about a little detail with that lady warren knows what exactly did he know that his wife had recently had an affair or did he know shed had an affair with danny mcdavitt danny had to assume the latter otherwise why would she warn him to get out of town and to take his son with him that was the worrisome part why the hell would laurel think michael was at risk maybe she knew danny wouldnt leave town without his son so shed named michael in the message but then againmaybe things were worse than danny was letting himself believe he craned his neck over his shoulder and looked at the house worst case what could be happening in there shields could be beating the hell out of his wife he might even be threatening her with a weapon truth be told danny thought he could have killed her already but that was nuts warren shields was no killer danny hated to make assumptions but shields wasnt going to shoot the mother of his childrennot for screwing somebody on the side maybe if hed walked in on danny doing her doggystyle in the conjugal bedmaybe but certainly not based on hearsay evidence which was all he could possibly have barring a confession someone must have seen danny and laurel together somewhere it could have been the hug theyd risked this morning and that was easily deniable danny had coached laurel on what to say in this type of situation she knew to deny everything no matter what he didnt envy her having to bluff it out with her husband warren shields was smart and not just regulardoctor smart danny had known doctors who couldnt pour piss out of a boot with the instructions printed on the heel but shields wasnt one of them he was obsessive about everything he did he had only been flying for a year but he probably knew more aerodynamics than danny did after thirty years in the cockpit if warren really suspected that laurel was cheating on him hed tear at it like a bulldog until he was satisfied on the other hand he was like any other man deep down he didnt want to believe that his wife would open her legs for anyone but him it just went against the grain of the masculine mind if laurel stuck to the plan and denied everything she would be fine danny wondered if he should risk sending a reassuring text message if warren had possession of laurels secret cell phone it was all over anyway he would already have seen dannys message about star going to baton rouge for the day from that alone he could figure out everything even if laurel had deleted that message as soon as she read it warren could trace the phone to dannys obliging friend so where was the additional risk in texting her another possibility was that laurels clone phone was stashed safely in her car as it should be but danny knew from experience that she sometimes risked taking it into the house with her at least on those occasions she always set it to silent his only other optionthe only one that didnt involve losing michaelwas reporting a peeping tom at the shields house or better yet a bomb threat the sheriffs department would have to go inside then but if laurel had things under control that kind of intrusion would only make things worse best to leave it at sending a reassuring text message hey there called a scratchy male voice in the upper register you lost or something danny looked across the passenger seat at the sunburned face of a bald man in his late seventies no sir just sitting for a minute you making a delivery out here nope i thought you might be bringing me my crossties pardon the man spread his arms as far as they would go railroad ties to border my garden shore up the bank danny smiled no sir but ive used some of those myself now and again the man stared at him as though awaiting an explanation of what danny was doing on this street well danny said grinding the truck into gear i guess do i know you i dont think so sure i saw you in the newspaper something about the war iraq or somewhere you won some medals over there right military fame is a funny thing you can leave a town as a pimply faced teenager and not come back for anything but funerals but as long as you have a living relative there or somebody still remembers you your picture will pop up in the sunday paper above an announcement of your latest promotion or rarely an item trumpeting the receipt of a medal for bravery under fire no sir danny lied im over from mccomb checking out sites for cellular towers the mans face scrunched into a near parody of suspicion cell towers here in avalon now listen we got restrictive covenants against that kind of thing is that right damn straight we do thats why these lots are so expensive you need to just drive on down to lake forest or belle rive mister aint gonna be no cell towers round here i reckon not danny said smiling my mistake thanks again dont thank me you get on out of here danny drove off wanting to make a last pass by laurels house but knowing he was already late for a flying lesson with a lady lawyer he wondered if the old man had noticed that his truck had lusahatcha county plates warren held the barrel of his revolver against laurels right ear as he searched a pantry drawer with his free hand his motions were jerky his breath bad he hasnt brushed his teeth since yesterday laurel realized her left cheek stung as though someone had poured acid over it and when she ran her fingers over the skin she felt hard particles embedded in her flesh gunpowder the idea was too surreal to fully accept then warren lifted a heavy roll of duct tape from the pantry drawer hes gone over the edge she thought im in serious fucking trouble here get back into the great room warren said shoving her ahead of him driving her through the kitchen and back down to the sectional by the coffee table when laurel reached the sofa he forced her down onto it lie on your back he ordered warren shut up he ripped a long strip of tape off the silvergray roll and wrapped it tight around her ankles why are you doing this i dont understand you understand all right its because i cant trust you youve proved that another long strip of tape tightened around her ankles all that remains is to find out how deeply youve betrayed this family warren you dont have to do this cant we just talk sure we can a false smile split his lips tell me why youre so afraid of me looking into your computer and ill send you on your way right now send me on my way what the hell does that mean freedom or death more love letters warren asked pictures what just tell me where the files are and you can sit with me and have a glass of pinot noir while we look at them together she couldnt think of a thing to say he nodded slowly as though settling something in his mind every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie he wrapped two more lengths of tape around her calves i ought to tape your goddamn mouth shut hold out your arms laurel began to cry she didnt want to but the realization that she was now helpless was overwhelming not in her deepest troughs of guilt had she imagined something like this warren bound her wrists with the thick tape then pulled her into a sitting position dont move unless i tell you to he dropped the tape roll onto the coffee table and retrieved her vaio from the kitchen where hed left it he set it up on the coffee table again carefully plugging in the ac cable which looked as though it had suffered minor damage when laurel ripped the computer loose lets see if this baby survived your little escape attempt he pressed the power button avidly watching the screen laurel prayed that the sonys hard drive had been smashed but a moment later she heard the halting mechanical sounds of the computer booting up then the clicking stopped prematurely she thought warrens face was taut he unplugged the sony removed its battery shook the computer then reinserted the battery and plugged the ac cord back in this time the vaio booted normally you just dazed it he said with a smile laurel smelled adhesive as her skin warmed the duct tape when she moved her wrists farther apart the tape tugged painfully at the hair on her arms you may as well come clean now i know theres something on this computer or you wouldnt have tried to stop me from looking at it youre wrong she said in a shaky voice thats my computer mine those are my things on it my personal things i have a right to my own things you know my own thoughts you dont own me im your wife not your property he shook his head ive treated you like a queen for twelve years and this is how you repay me she closed her eyes trying to find some way to break through to him warren what were you looking for when you found that letter will you please tell me that you were awake all night you must have been looking for something related to the irs audit right the skin around his eyes tightened what do you know about that i know what youve told me which is almost nothing as usual his stare intensified why wont you tell me whats really going on she asked youre the only one in this room who knows whats really going on laurel shook her head in frustration i know nothing please tell me what you were looking for last night he was studying the computer screen again the letter thats what i was looking for why would you be looking for a love letter his gaze came back to her and his eyes smoldered with fury because someone in this world actually cares about me a lot more than you do obviously this floored her are you saying someone told you to look specifically for a letter in this house warren snorted you dont get it do you i already know who wrote the letter and i already know who youre fucking behind my back cold sweat popped out on her neck had someone spotted her and danny together after all maybe because no onenot even dannyknew she had kept that letter laurel paid a cleaning lady to come in once a week but it seemed unlikely that her maid would flip through her collection of jane austen cheryl tilley had got married in the eleventh grade and by her own admission had read nothing since her graduation two decades earlier but star magazine which she bought religiously after her weekly grocery shopping at walmart even if cheryl had accidentally found dannys letter would she have told warren about it the two had hardly spoken to each other since she began working at the house nor was cheryl a patient of warrens i see goose bumps warren said his eyes glinting piloerection who told you i was having an affair laurel asked whoever it is theyre lying to you does it matter its someone whos offended by adultery unlike you and your lover and half this goddamn town i think sometimes warren i didnt did you think i wouldnt find out he shouted his eyes blazing did you really think that she drew back from the force of his fury right in my fucking face both of you youve lied every single day him too every day smiling and acting like a friendgoddamn him both of you laurel sat stunned trying to puzzle out warrens words him too acting like a friend warren didnt see danny every day not even when danny had taught him to fly could warren be referring to the time theyd spent coaching together who are you talking about she asked softly dont insult my intelligence warren screamed she squinted against the roar of his voice please warren tell me he leaned over her and spat the words like a priest naming a demon kyle auster her mouth fell open did warren really believe she was sleeping with his partner kyle she asked still in shock warren raised his hand as though to strike her but then he turned away and muttered all those times you told me he came on to you when he was drunkchristmas parties weekends at the lake you told me he repulsed you lies every damn bit of it he turned to face her again disgust etched into his tired face do you know how many nurses that bastard has slept with itll be a miracle if you dont have every std in the book me too by now jesus laurel felt hysterical laughter rising in her throat but she didnt dare release it why in gods name would you think im involved with kyle auster warren picked up his revolver and pointed it at her face i dont think it he said with certainty i know chapter nell roberts hibernated the insurance computer and looked over at her sister vida who was talking to an angry patient at the reception window this morning had been hell mainly because dr shields hadnt shown up for work nell couldnt remember dr shields missing a single day because of sickness and he always called ahead if he got hung up at the hospital dr auster had instructed the sisters to call every number they had for dr shields but warren remained unreachable even his wifes cell phone went unanswered vida was so surprised by this that shed called the er to find out if dr shields had been in a car accident unlike vida and dr auster nell was not surprised by warren shieldss uncharacteristic absence she had a pretty good idea why he hadnt shown up for work this morning two days ago nell had overheard dr auster and her sister talking about their recent business problems in the coffee room after work they thought shed left the office already but nell was in the storeroom culling some old files problems was actually a mild word for what had been going on around the clinic for the past ten days first had come the letter from the irs the agency was doing an audit of the austershields medical partnership this had sent both physicians into a barely controlled frenzy dr shields because he deeply resented the governments intrusion into every sphere of medicine and dr auster for darker reasons for the past three years kyle auster had been defrauding the government in various ways some of which nell knew about while others were known only to her elder sister nell kept her emotions under tight rein but she was easily the most frightened person in the office dr austers scams were only possible because she and vida made them so and nell was deathly afraid of prison twentyseven years old was too young to live behind bars especially if you were white and pretty and basically innocent looking back now she couldnt quite believe shed done the things she had but it was like pastor richardson used to say a slippery slope you started small looking the other way while your sister did this or that fudging a couple of small things because she asked you to and pretty soon you were outright lying to help steal from the medicaid program it was easy to justify if you tried like cheating on your taxes the government did so much to screw doctors out of fees and vida made it sound as if they were only getting dr auster his due but if that was the case why were she and vida getting a big cut of the money and the irs letter was only the beginning next had come a phone call informing dr auster that an irs investigation was under way that ratcheted things a little tighter and pushed the doctors closer to panic then came the call from a friend of dr austers in jackson a school friend who worked in the state government this friend had apparently tipped dr auster that the medicaid fraud unit was investigating his practice no announcement no courteous letter filled with legalese to give them plenty of time to cover their tracks just a latenight warning that someone had made kyle auster a target and why because somebodyprobably a pissedoff patienthad called the medicaid office and told them that dr auster was lying to the government presto an investigation began a secret investigation that was all nell knew and more than she wanted to know the scariest thing was that vida had started it all nell had been working in new orleans when her sister called and told her there was a job waiting for her in dr austers clinic no experience required to someone making decent money as an assistant manager at an uptown hotel working as an insurance clerk in athens point sounded like a step backward but vida had cryptically promised that she was likely to earn double what shed been making in new orleansand vida hadnt exaggerated she had omitted to say exactly what nell would be doing for the money according to vida the scams started this way shed been skimming a little money from austers tillon cash payments onlyand fudging the books to cover it up just enough to cover essentials while her husband missed some work at the paper mill certainly no more than she deserved but there was a bluehaired lady working as austers insurance clerk an old battleax named bedner who should have retired years before and she hated vida after catching on to vidas scheme she had gone straight to dr auster at this time dr shields was only an associate he hadnt yet bought into the practice and so had no involvement in the business side of things dr auster confronted vida after work one day armed with evidence supplied by mrs bedner he told vida he was letting her go but wouldnt press charges if she left immediately and without a fuss true to her nature vida denied all wrongdoing and claimed she was being framed dr auster said that if vida believed she was being framed she could explain her side of the story to the police vida sat quietly for a few moments then asked dr auster whether in exchange for a firstclass blow job she could explain her side of things to him instead vida had always been pragmatic about sex shed been shocking people with her frankness for years she knew that kyle auster had screwed a couple of hospital nurses and shed caught him looking down her top whenever he thought he could get away with it after he heard her offer auster told her hed decide what to do about the embezzlement after evaluating how good a job she did apparently shed done pretty well because dr auster gave her plenty of time to talk afterward and vida used her time well shed spent her adult life working in medical offices and shed learned some sweet accounting tricks though vida only had a year of junior college shed always been quick with numbers when auster heard how easy it was to hide cash he decided to listen to the rest of vidas ideas on increasing his income she sold him in half an hour the key to it all she told him was having control of the front office you couldnt have church ladies like mrs bedner looking over your shoulder while you were upcoding medicaid claims two weeks later dr auster called a puzzled mrs bedner into his office and told her shed been mistaken about vida and that she couldnt continue working for him after making that kind of accusation nell replaced mrs bedner the next day that was the beginning the crest of the slippery slope once the money started rolling in dr auster only wanted more he was that kind of doctor cars motorcycles gambling trips to vegas wild investments big charity donations expensive medical equipmenthe wanted everything bigger than life and his wife wanted the same of course he and vida went fulltime after the scams started she stayed late almost every day working on the second set of books the one the government would see if it ever came to an audit which it finally had dr auster stayed late about half the days and on most others stopped by for a quickie before going home after evening rounds nell liked to leave right at five thirty so as to witness as little illegality as possible and none of the illicit intimacy between auster and her sister that had bothered her from the beginning and nowadays she couldnt stand the thought of it it was too pathetic because as pragmatic as vida could be about life she actually believed that dr auster was going to leave his wife and marry her nell figured the chance of this happening was about the same as the chance of toyota building an automotive plant in athens point but her sister believed and without that faith nell knew vida would have nothing in her life but two highschooldropout sons and an exhusband on the dole the strange thing was nell now believed shed been wrong about auster he was willing to leave his wifeonly not for vida two days ago nell had overheard him talking on his cell phone to someone whose name she hadnt picked up shed only heard a few seconds of the call but austers tone had definitely been intimate and hed been talking about getting married nell didnt know how a married man could remarry without getting divorced first but then she realized that auster was talking about down the road she was pretty sure hed said i just have to keep youknowwho on my side until warren takes the fall after that i can leave and we can be together thered been a pause while the woman replied a tinny sound with a cadence nell was strangely certain shed heard before and then auster said in a bitter tone im so tired of servicing that little redneck i could kill myself she scares me but shell have too much at risk to retaliate hed ended the conversation with a whispered i love you too then crossed the hall and walked back into his private office nell stood shaking in her tracks for almost a minute then put on a fake smile and went back to the front desk where her sister sat working diligently to protect the man she loved from the law im so tired of servicing that little redneck she scares me one overheard conversation had split open nells world she and vida had been living in a dream auster was cheating on his wife and his mistress and just as disturbing to nell he was planning to blame dr shields for everything that had been going on in the office auster was obviously counting on vida to back this story up in court if necessary nell couldnt believe her sister would be willing to do that but when she thought about all that was at stake she realized that vida would probably see the situation as a case of straight survival him or us if somebody had to go to jail better it be warren shields than the man she loved vida would solemnly swear that every illegal act she had committed was at the express order of dr shields and that kyle auster had known nothing about it nell couldnt live with that the truth was so different warren shields was not only innocent of fraud he was also a good and conscientious physician moreover hed always treated nell with respect hed never even remotely crossed the line into inappropriate behavior with her which made him different from almost every other man shed ever worked with dr shields had a beautiful wife at home but in nells experience that wasnt enough to keep a man faithful especially after twelve years of marriage she figured dr shields really loved his wife and that made nell sad for reasons she couldnt quite understand she was only three years shy of thirty and though most men found her attractive her faith that she would find a husband like warren shieldsa good provider and father who would truly love her for herselfwas almost gone she had held out a long time for her prince charming turning down two proposals of marriage from decent men she felt intensely jealous of laurel shields and yet also protective of her nell had enough generosity of spirit to wish another woman well if that woman had indeed found happiness with all this in mind nell had called vida at home last night after lenos monologue shed been on the verge of telling vida about austers shady phone call when vida warned her that there were likely to be some big doings at the office over the next couple of days when nell asked why vida told her that the less she knew the better off shed be vida also said that if she or nell was arrested they shouldnt say a world until they met with a lawyer kyle would arrange for that when nell heard the word arrested shed almost peed in her pants after getting up the nerve she asked why they would be arrested vida took some time then said softly theres something in dr shieldss house honey and if someone searches theyre going to find it i hate that its come to this but things are worse than you know a lot worse we have to think about ourselves now do you understand nell had mumbled that she did then told vida shed see her at work the next morning after hanging up shed sat hunched over the phone for several minutes regretting every dollar shed ever taken from dr auster and wishing shed never left the quiet old hotel on tchoupitoulas street she cried for a while then petted her cat and cried some more then shed put on her coat and gone out for a walk she did a lot of thinking during that walk and when she got back she sat down at her computer and typed a brief email to dr shields shed never sent him anything before but she knew his aol address from work she used her hotmail address which not even vida knew and which had no obvious connection to her real name after she was sure the message had gone through she took two lorazepam copped from the samples room washed them down with a glass of white zinfandel and crashed so hard that she was an hour late getting to work this morning when dr shields failed to show up nell had felt a quiet somewhat nervous satisfaction she assumed that hed found whatever had been planted in his house and that he would know what to do with it smart guys like dr shields always knew what to do for most of the morning nell had been expecting the fbi to come crashing through the door with dr shields behind them ripping computers off the desks and confiscating files it would almost be a relief at this point nell honey said vida nell looked up at her sister who as usual was wearing too much blue eye shadow vida was watching her intently from the front desk are you all right im fine nell assured her youve been staring at the same insurance claim for ten minutes youre real pale too honey you look like youre in a daze nell summoned her cheerleader smile the best fake smile in her repertoire and said i drank too much wine last night thats all im fine wine vidas eyes twinkled did you hook up with somebody that drug rep didnt come back to town did he nell quickly shook her head god no thats so over are you sure youre all right this could be a rough day you have no idea vi im fine i swear several seconds passed before vida looked away and nell sighed inwardly with relief it would only be a matter of time before dr shields straightened everything out and when he found out it was nell who had warned him in the nick of time wellit was only natural that he would be grateful it wasnt hard to imagine the office running just fine without dr auster in it or vida either she thought with a pang of guilt it would definitely be a nicer place to work and nell was sure she could find a hundred ways to make dr shieldss days less stressful all she wanted was a chance to show what she could do laurels hands were almost numb shed lost the sensation in her feet fifteen minutes ago when she complained to warren hed assured her that there was no real danger unless her skin turned black she asked about blood clots in her legs but he waved away her fears and went back to searching the hard drive in her laptop two improbable facts kept pinging around in laurels brain first that someone had told warren she was having an affair with kyle auster and second that warren had believed it kyles interest in laurel had been obvious years ago when warren entered practice with him auster was a wellknown ladies man who got out of hand when he was drinking shed warned warren about kyles advances and warren had told her to be firm with him but not to make a big deal of it so long as the incidents remained rare this hadnt been the answer laurel was looking for but they had a lot riding on the success of the partnership not least the matter of paying back warrens school loans austers interest in her never faded but he did stop making overt passes which allowed everyone to settle down to a tolerable undercurrent of anxiety about the issue if not to put it behind them altogether clearly someone had resurrected the issue by lying to warren about an affair but why would he be willing to view her as austers paramour rather than a putupon wife it must have to do with the identity of the informer that person must be someone in a position to know about such an affair if it were really happening but what reason could someone have for telling such a lie the longer laurel thought about it the more confused she became according to popular rumor auster who was currently married to his second wife was involved with a nurse at st raphaels hospital blond and busty naturally and possibly someone in the office as well why anyone would believe that laurel would waste time on him was beyond her then suddenly she saw the logic if she was miserable at home and she blamed warren for her misery might not she get involved with auster simply to hurt warren to publicly embarrass him as profoundly as she could some wives she knew had played that game but dannys anonymous letter hadnt exactly bolstered this scenario it had painted a picture of soul mates finding each other after years of searching but considering warrens mental state when hed discovered the letter she could understand his glossing over the details she thought back over what hed said about the informer supposedly it was someone who cared about his welfare more than laurel did someone offended by adultery but had that person told warren to look specifically for a letter the informer couldnt have betrayed the existence of dannys letter because no onenot even dannyknew that shed kept it warren claimed to be certain she was having an affair with auster yet how could he be certain without hard evidence a photograph or a tape recording but if he had seen such evidence why would he care so much about the unsigned letter he had found in pride and prejudice instead of searching her computer hed be waving the evidence in her face the facts didnt add up not as she knew them anyway but if warren had been told to search their house and he had claimed to be looking for the letter not anything to do with the irs audit then the informers warning must have been more general unless there was another letter waiting to be found a planted letter whose purpose she could not know or maybe it wasnt a letter maybe some other incriminating piece of evidence had been planted in the house one that warren had been prompted to find if so he had stopped searching for it because he had stumbled onto dannys letter instead laurel thought of voicing her reasoning to warren but there was no point hed only think she was trying to stop him from searching her computer rather than ponder what the planted evidence might be she focused on who might have planted it who could possibly profit from warren thinking his wife was screwing his partner a woman who wanted warren for herself laurel couldnt believe that warren had given any woman enough encouragement to take such drastic steps as she watched him probing her computer a flash of insight struck her what if the source of the lie about laurel and kyle was auster himself if kyle had committed crimes at workcrimes that had come to the attention of the authoritieshe would desperately need to distract warren while he tried to save his own skin it would take a lot to distract warren from an irs investigation but a bombshell like marital infidelity would do it witness todays freakout and once warren began to hate kyle for something so personal as cuckolding him he would be unlikely to see him straight in business matters moreover any subsequent accusations of mismanagement that warren might make about auster would be viewed through a distorted lens laurel could admire the logic of the scheme if she removed herself sufficiently from the reality as she thought it through from various angles excitement began to build inside her if she was right her salvation might still be waiting in the house for warren to discover it what might kyle have planted she wondered an article of clothing underwear a cuff link auster actually wore french cuffs whenever he went out a nude photo of himself what about a love letter in his own handwriting a crudely sexy letter knowing kyle laurel thought back over the past couple of weeks trying to remember if auster had visited their house she didnt think so but the house usually stood empty for most of the day and she wouldnt be surprised to learn that kyle had a key of his own if they had ever lent him a keyand she was pretty sure they had early on during a disney world vacationthen he still had a copy in his possession kyle was that kind of guy laurel counted herself lucky that he hadnt simply let himself in one day when warren was off at a bike race and climbed into the shower with her regardless of how it had happened the odds were that someonepossibly kyle austerhad planted something far more damaging than dannys letter in the house and it was still waiting to be found whatever that something was there was a good chance that it might not jibe with dannys letter since the person who planted it had known nothing of that letter a strange pair of underwear or a used condom wouldnt help her case but a different letter written in a different handand outlining a different scenariomight sell warren on her frameup theory going in that direction was certainly less risky than letting him continue to dig through her computer warren she said evenly we need to talk he glanced up then returned his attention to the screen i think i have an idea whats really going on here no response i think i know whos sent you on this wildgoose chase warren seemed to have frozen in his chair what is it she asked panic fluttering in her chest well well he crowed isnt this special a hidden folder under the windows system folder its labeled ropn any idea what this could be her belly knotted she wished she could twitch her nose like samantha stephens and delete the folder in question look and see she said trying not to sound defensive warren stared at her for several seconds then clicked on the folder she didnt know what hed expected to find but his eyes quickly widened as he scrolled through the images and video clips she kept in that folder where did you get this stuff he asked without looking up the internet did you pay for it no i downloaded it off limewire and its not really hidden you know i made the folder invisible so grant or beth wouldnt stumble onto it if they booted up my computer by next year grant will know how to find that kind of folder warrens eyes jerked right and left he was probably scanning thumbnail images of her explicit video clips he bit his upper lip looking angry and disturbed why havent you ever told me you look at this stuff i dont know i didnt think youd be interested he snorted you know thats not true looki know you okay i didnt think youd like me looking at that kind of thing by myself his eyes remained riveted to the screen why do you look at it by yourself why do you look at porn by yourself he shrugged as though the answer were selfevident thats different how im a guy she couldnt believe it so so i just use it to masturbate i see she waited a few moments what do you think i do with it his eyes opened wider are you serious what else would i do with it warren wrestled silently with this for a while how long have you been doing this since it got easy to get video clips like those online so youve been unsatisfied for that long of course i have for gods sake she replied in the silence of her head and you should have known that long before you found my porn cache you would have known if youd paid any attention at all but what she said aloud considering the gun and warrens fragile mental state was havent you always masturbated he nodded rigidly have you been unsatisfied with me all that time no but im a guy jesus i mean of course id like to do it more often i justyou dont seem like you want to so i dont push it she wasnt sure how to respond for the past three or four months warren had hardly touched her yet he seemed to be speaking as though this sexual dry spell had not occurred she decided to take a chance it was a risk but if she played doormat and acquiesced to everything he said he wouldnt believe she was telling the truth about anything thats not very perceptive havent you ever noticed that after you finish i still want more not really you never come out and say that thats because i dont want to hurt your feelings in case you cant perform again right away but ive tried to show you well no guy can do it again right away she nodded though she knew this assertion to be untrue im sure youre right warrens eyes hardened with suspicion are you i dont have much to compare you to as you know so you told me to tell you the truth i never really believed the number you gave me not deep down how many people did you really sleep with before me here we go warrendo you see why i dont talk to you about these things im trying to be honest with you and the first thing you do is accuse me of lying even before we got married he stared at her a long time before replying this isnt spontaneous honesty youre caught in a lie already and youre trying to sell me a bill of goods two men before you she said flatly two boys actually god dont strike me dead she thought as warren looked down and clicked the mouse again cries and groans came from the laptops tiny speakers as though miniature humans were copulating inside the carbonfiber case warren would have freaked out at any number higher than two and even that made him nervous it bothered him no end that he hadnt taken her virginity but at least he understood that everyone had to lose it to somebody and that wasnt usually the best sexual experience anyway but the second guy had always worried him warren wanted to know exactly how many times shed had sex with him and every act shed ever tried with him laurel had strained her imagination to invent a bland physical relationship with a college boyfriend of six months someone from a northern state whom they would never run into in the future after seeing warrens reaction to even this small revelation it hadnt taken a brain surgeon to figure out that it was best to banish her other partners to the female bermuda triangle of never happened after all it wasnt as if shed slutted around or anything shed held on to her virginity until eighteen which was a record in her high school class but during college shed had a couple of inebriated hookups that went further than shed initially planned handsome boys she had screwed on the first date for no reason other than she was lonely and theyd made her feel good and she just by god wanted sex then there was the architecture professor shed slept with for eight months all on the dl because he was married warren would have lost it over that the affair had been laurels real initiation into sex and if she had left any corner of her body or psyche unexplored it wasnt for lack of trying shed actually tried a few things she learned in that relationship on warren and sometimes theyd worked after a fashion but anything really edgy always brought probing postcoital questions so shed stopped experimenting she had mistakenly thought hed be glad for the variety but warren was different from most men or maybe most men were more like warren than she knew twelve years of faithful marriage had effectively removed her from the research pool shed had no trouble telling danny about her sexual past he wouldnt have minded if shed slept with a half dozen or more men before him so long as she ended up with him in that relationship she was the insecure one danny had made love with women all over the world and no matter how much he said to boost her confidence laurel felt that she could never outdo the exotic courtesans who now populated her mind but then trying to was half the fun god warren exclaimed breaking her reverie some of this stuff is sick laurel felt herself blush im human okay this stuff turns you on some of it wasnt what i thought based on the file names but most of it does yes warren looked at his wife as though seeing her for the first time do it right now then what masturbate she searched his face for sarcasm but found none youre joking right not at all dont be ridiculous im dead serious laurel weve been married twelve years and ive never seen you do that not for real today seems as good a day as any im not going to do that warren i couldnt anyway why not she closed her eyes then screamed her answer at nearly full volume because im ducttaped like a fucking al qaeda terrorist and youre holding a gun on me how about that for starters warren remained unmoved from what i see in these videos you ought to like the idea sorry wrong girl maybe so he said softly i dont know you at all do i youve never really been honest with me she looked hard into his eyes you never wanted me to be honest not really he drew back then looked away how often do you do it play with yourself i mean in laurels experience if she wasnt having much sex she felt little need to masturbate she would have thought the opposite would be true that during dry spells she would need to do it more but shed found that the reverse applied to her it was when she was being well looked after that she needed constant release whether she had access to her lover or not after she became involved with danny masturbation had become as important a part of her sex life as intercourse on days they couldnt meet it was essential and when they could meet she sometimes did it just to warm up for the rendezvous so that he wouldnt be ahead of her on the arousal curve then they could share everything equally from the beginning laurel she looked up for the first time today warren looked as vulnerable and confused as grant sometimes did so i guess this guy youre seeing is some kind of sex god or something huh warren im not having an affair he grunted in stubborn disbelief besides she said what do you mean this guy i thought you said you know its kyle he laid his hand on the letter beside the computer this doesnt really sound like kyle i know hed fuck you without a seconds hesitation and i dont know what you might do to hurt me but this letter warren shook his head this really hurt even sitting ducttaped like a prisoner awaiting execution laurel felt guilt surge within her had getting involved with danny been the only answer to her marital problems of course not she simply hadnt been brave enough to confront them directly or to face what leaving warren might mean shed waited for an emotional parachute and only by chance had she found real love tell me what its like warren said dully with the guy who wrote this i mean tell me what you feel when he does it to you you mean with me she thought not to me warrens transition from fury to depression had been almost instantaneous laurel felt as if someone had slammed on the brakes of a speeding car and she hadnt yet recovered all she knew was that she wasnt about to tell her husband one detail about how being with danny compared to her conjugal sex warren was like the boys she had known in high school he had a powerful biological urge that needed release and her body was the vehicle for that release his sexual routine hadnt varied significantly in years the tension would build in him for a few days or even a couple of weeks and then he would come to her and spend himself she occasionally managed a vaginal orgasm by sitting astride him but the only reliable orgasms she got were from his licking her and as the years passed he had become less and less willing to devote the time required to bring her off this way she was always left wanting more and the few times hed been able to go back inside her shed been unable to reach the peak she sensed just beyond the horizon danny on the other hand instinctively understood the dynamics of female arousal and release some days laurel wanted hours of foreplay punctuated by staggered moments of release and other days she wanted to be stormed like a city under siege plundered until nothing remained but a faint pulse of life and dreamless sleep danny knew within moments of seeing her which kind of day it was and he could often tell by the timbre of her telephone voice as they arranged their rendezvous laurel had once arrived at a hotel room only to have a gloved hand clapped over her mouth from behind her skirt hiked up and her body ravished from behind without ever seeing the mans face only after he had ejaculated and let her fall to the bed had she been positive it was danny she didnt want that kind of adventure regularly but to know that it might happen at any timethat was the thing warren could pound violently at her in a fit of drunken passion and still leave her unsatisfied while danny might force her to lie absolutely still while he moved at a glacial pace within her yet by the time he finished her body felt like a desiccated husk of fruit sucked dry of all moisture laurel watched her husband from a bottomless well of sadness the truth might set people freein theorybut it was difficult to see any upside to sharing her most intimate secrets with warren his jealousy had always followed his insecurities hed never worried about buff pool boys or bohemian types however sexy they might be warren worried about other doctors or businessmen who earned more money than he did anyone who might be ahead of him in the eternal competition that was life if he were to learn that his whole worldview was wrong that the greatest threat to his marriage had come from a man who wasnt competing with him in any waywho in fact cared nothing about competition but was only and profoundly glad to be alive and who touched a part of laurel so deep that her husband had never even glimpsed itwarren might not survive that watching him now laurel suddenly understood the essential nature of what was unfolding before her warren was a control freak who sensed control slipping inexorably away first at work and now at home the fear growing inside him probably had no limit hey warren said softly if i untaped you now would you go in the bedroom and make love with me she closed her eyes involuntarily if you really want it i suppose i would but what we need to do right now is talk i think someone is trying to hurt you warren maybe to destroy you his chin began to quiver like grants when the boy tried not to cry yeah warren said his voice completely different from the one hed spoken in a moment ago you i dont know what i was thinking asking you for sloppy seconds i just wish i knew how long ive been getting them the words stung her more deeply than she would have imagined warren please listen to me im going to find out he vowed slapping the side of the sonys screen this porn is just the beginning im sure im going to dig out every last secret in this pile of garbage before im through laurel felt tears coming again a savage light had entered his eyes maybe we should show some of these pictures to the kids when they get home show them what mom does in her spare time her heart seized at the mention of the kids so warren was well aware that they would soon be home but how did he think they would get here with her trussed up like a turkey did he plan to lock her in the trunk of his volvo and pick them up himself the idea didnt seem as impossible as it would have an hour ago screw you she said you want them to stay up and watch you jerk off to softcore on cinemax after were asleep dictating medical charts my ass he stared at her with visceral hatred god were pathetic she said meaning it she had no idea what to do or say next warren wasnt going to listen to anything from her his obsession with her infidelity had nothing to do with love it was about possession ownership someone had appropriated his personal property and he wanted revenge she was like all his other possessions something to be jealously guarded not because of her intrinsic worth but because she was his that concept was laughable now the issue of ownership had been decided within two weeks after she first kissed danny mcdavitt no matter whose ring laurel wore no matter who mounted her in the dark of the night danny owned her body and soul that was the reality and nothing but death could change it chapter kyle auster sat on the stool in examining room five and silently regarded his nineteenth patient of the day arthur m johnston white male fiftythree years of age forty pounds overweight high cholesterol hypertension enlarged prostate erectile dysfunction history of persistent alcohol abuse osteoarthritisthe chart went on and on an intern might look at johnstons record and think this guy is sick but auster knew he was looking at a classic malingerer after working seven years at the now defunct chemical plant johnston had somehow talked his way into a full social security disability for back pain of course that was a couple of decades back now he spent his days cushioned on a carpet of pain medication watching daytime tv working in his garden and taking his grandkids fishing in a boat purchased with government money as he droned on about his need for constant pain relief which only opiates could provide auster wondered how hed gotten to this little chamber of hell hed been a goddamn ace in medical school the only reason he hadnt specialized in surgery was that hed had to get out into the real world and start making money it wasnt as if hed had a choice he had an expensive lifestyle even then people had no idea how much money changed hands in a frat house during football season you could dig a deep hole without ever rolling out of bed what do you think doc the patients question penetrated austers reverie i think youre doing about as well as youre going to do mr johnston youre not going to play ball for the yankees but youre not going to drop dead anytime soon either youll probably still be fishing when they bury me johnston gave a little laugh i hope so no offense but i was thinking doc you know i might need some tests auster looked back in puzzlement johnston had the tone of a patient whod read some article on preventive medicine in readers digest he probably wanted a goddamn sixtyfourslice cat scan of his heart what kind of tests johnstons face looked blank as a babys well youre the doctor i thought maybe you could tell me austers financial antennae went on alert he glanced at the upperright corner of mr johnstons file searching for a faint check mark in pencil there was none as he had suspected if there had been it would indicate that mr johnston was a special patient meaning that hed undergone some tests that might have been unnecessary in a strictly medical sense but which had proved lucrative for both doctor and patient but there was no pencil mark so what the hell was johnston hinting at what are your symptoms mr johnston a sly grin now minus three front teeth well doc i thought maybe you could tell me that too a few months ago auster would have been happy to oblige mr johnston thorough lab work was good sound medicine and a chest xray never hurt anybody but given the present state of affairs mr johnstons notsosubtle hints were like the blare of a fire alarm auster put on his soberest countenance the face he used when telling people they had a disabling or deadly illness mr johnston in the past ive worked with patients to solve their health problems as creatively as i could given the state of government regulations but recently the government has taken a dim view of that kind of alternative medicine its become very risky to do anything unconventional these days anyone who does could be subject to severe penalties abusing the social security disability program would be a good example mr johnston blanched am i being clear enough sir johnston was already getting up you know i think im doing fine doc except for this back of mine if you could just renew that prescription ill be on my way auster stood and patted him on the shoulder happy to do it he wrote out another prescription for vicodin then cursing under his breath marched out of the exam room and down the hall to his private office things were spinning out of control vida was doing everything she could to erase all trace of questionable activity but people kept crawling out of the woodwork with their hands out the patients werent even the main problem the real threat was the states medicaid fraud unit five attorneys eleven investigators and four specially trained auditors birddogging every medical practice in the state that accepted medicaid patients the injustice chapped austers ass no end many doctors refused even to treat medicaid patients so pathetic was the level of reimbursement it was the humanitarians who found it in their hearts to treat the poor and indigent who got raped by the government it made you want to leave the damn country auster knew the fraud unit was on his tail patrick evans his doubles partner on the high school tennis team was an executive assistant to the governor pat was wired into every agency in the state and a week ago hed quietly informed auster that paul biegler the pit bull of the fraud unit had begun investigating him based on a tip called in to the attorney generals office the whistleblower could have been anybody but it was probably a disgruntled patient someone whod made a little extra money off auster then wanted more and got angry after being turned down or maybe it was a woman auster didnt get many attractive female patients but when he did he wasnt above a little horsetrading an er doc had taught him this racket during his residency five mepergan could get you a hell of a blow job from a strungout woman and that beat seventy taxable dollars for an office visit any day of the week medicaid investigations typically lasted months before an indictment but auster sensed imminent danger he felt like a rebel village waiting to be hit by government troops the blow could fall at any hour of the day or night the irs was already auditing the partnerships schedule cs for the past five years and probably his personal returns too god knows what theyd found already his gambling income was the problem there although lately all hed had to report were losses auster was a good gambler he just didnt always know when to stop that was why hed spent a lot of weekends working seventytwohour shifts in emergency rooms doctors were so reluctant to move to mississippi that rural hospitals would pay large sums for er coverage but auster was too old to be scrounging extra money that way his colleagues thought it unseemly and worse the work itself was becoming a lot more technical the standard of er care was higher auster didnt have time for the continuingeducation classes he needed to stay competent in that arena so that extra income had faded away it was vida whod helped him replace it theyd started small sliding a little cash off the books for example what smart businessman didnt do that but theyd quickly moved on from there and soon auster had found himself making serious misrepresentations of fact upcoding medicaid claimscharging for a level exam when youd only spent five minutes with the patient that kind of thing but it was the collusion with patients that had really kicked up the cash flow vida got the idea from an internet story about some korean doctors in new york city theyd persuaded members of the korean immigrant community to pretend to have various ailments then had done loads of tests and procedures on those patients and paid them a fee for their trouble vida figured the poorer africanamerican patients would jump on a chance like that if auster put it to them right but shed been wrong everybody jumped on it in a big way not one patient auster had ever pitched had turned him down it was a nobrainer everyone felt dehumanized by the healthcare system and thus eminently justified in screwing it backjust as auster did when he thought about how many hours hed spent with indigent patients for no pay he had no qualms about finding another way to get compensated for his time the medicaid fraud unit wouldnt see it quite the same way of course guys like paul biegler were congenitally blind to the color gray if i hadnt pushed it so far so fast auster thought uselessly but he knew enough psychiatry to diagnose his own problem poor impulse control nature had combined with nurture to make him the kind of man who confronted with a hundred grand in blackjack losses would double down rather than walk away from the table he had the same habit with women two were better than one and three better still ideally you had several available at various hours of the day every day of the week including sundays that way you moved so fast from woman to woman that you never had to focus on the complications with any particular one nevertheless auster had somehow acquired two wives along the way probably because he tended to tell people what they wanted to hear regardless of his true feelings just now he was managing three women fulltime wife number two vida and a drug rep from hoche he had a backup stable of parttimers but lately hed been unable to do much there his problem was vida she was the classic doubleedged sword an asset and a liability rolled into one for an exwaitress with a year of junior college she was a whiz at accounting and she gave great head no question but she had some very unrealistic expectations about the future shed cling to him like a terrier biting his leg or in her case his prick vida definitely didnt fit into any of the scenarios he saw in his future she probably wouldnt cause much of a stir in vegas but theyd laugh her out of the clubs he liked to frequent in la or even atlanta auster was thinking of taking out the bottle of diaka vodka he kept in his bottom drawer when his phone buzzed he put his hand on the drawer handle dreaming of the transparent fluid that dedicated poles filtered through diamonds before bottling it in crystal one sip could erase an hours worth of stress i have a phone call for you doctor nell said through the phones staticky speaker an agent paul biegler from the medicaid office in jackson auster let his hand fall from the handle he had the sensation of a sailor who has stared for days over threatening seas finally seeing an enemy periscope rise in front of him at least it wasnt a complete surprise for the hundredth time he congratulated himself on making the right political donations over the years that was how you stayed wired in this statein any state for that matterand staying wired was how you protected yourself ah is vida up there nell no sir i think she went out for a smoke break you want me to try to find her he thought about it the last thing he wanted was vida standing at his shoulder trying to coach him through a phone call this couldnt be too bad if it were biegler would have shown up at the clinic door with a search warrant not called him on the telephone from jackson did the guy say he was in jackson nell no but the caller id shows a stateofmississippi number auster suddenly had visions of a government surveillance van parked outside his office a convoy of black cars filled with agents ready to tear his office apart could it be a cell phone looks like a landline prefix to me but i cant be sure you want me to take a message auster didnt want biegler thinking he could be intimidated by a phone call hed been expecting a surprise search for the past few days that was the governments style theyd show up with a search warrant a stack of subpoenas and a team of agents theyd confiscate your files your computers every damn thing you needed to run your practice theyd act friendly and have informal chats with you and your staff every word of which would be recorded and used against you later then theyd stop all medicaid payments to your business before youd had a chance to say one word in your defense in short they would ruin you months before you ever saw a courtroom sometimes they even denied you a jury trial austers lawyer had given him careful instructions on how to respond in the event of a surprise search but no advice on how to deal with an informal phone call he would just have to wing it thats all right nell he said expansively ill take the call he pressed the button that transferred the caller this is dr auster what can i do for you agent biegler hello doctor nothing today actually this is an informal call for your benefit more than mine right im calling as a courtesy to let you know that youve been the subject of a medicaid fraud investigation for some weeks now were you aware of that how could i be aware of that a pregnant silence are you one of those people who answers every question with a question doctor this might actually be fun auster thought that depends on the question well up to this point weve mostly been conducting interviews i wanted to let you know that were about to move to the more proactive phase of the investigation and thats likely to disrupt your normal business affairs for a short time jesus christ how would an innocent person react im not sure i understand who have you been interviewing and why patients of yours sir sir always sounded bad in the mouth of a cop patients why have you been talking to my patients the answering silence felt smug somehow do i really need to explain that to you doctor fear and anger rippled through austers gut im afraid you do he heard paper shuffling notebook pages do the names esther whitlow george green rafael gutierrez quinesha washington or sanford williams mean anything to you auster swallowed hard against a geyser of gastric acid rushing up his esophagus pulling open his top drawer he took out a halfempty bottle of maalox and chugged it theyre all patients of mine he coughed im glad we can agree on that at least thats probably all i should say at this time i just wanted you to know that were moving to the next phase of our investigation weve sometimes been criticized in the past for conducting surprise searches ive even heard the phrase storm trooper tactics used in your case i want to make sure that you have every opportunity to prepare your staff for the disruption i dont want you to feel weve made our investigation unduly burdensome in any way what the hell is this guy up to in my experience you need to take certain steps if you want to be able to continue practicing medicine during the investigative process youll probably want to make copies of your business software i would also suggest purchasing some new computers since we almost always remove the onsite computers from the practice austers head was spinning he opened his bottom drawer and unscrewed the cap from the diaka bottle a hundred dollars worth of vodka slid down his throat as biegler continued you should photocopy any and all documents necessary for the running of your business since well probably be taking those away as well it could be months before you see them again and when are you moving to this next phase eight am tomorrow tomorrow agent beagle i biegler the agent cut in his irritation plain right listen i couldnt do the things you just suggested by tomorrow if i kept the staff working overnight youre getting eighteen hours more notice than most people do dr auster stay calm be courteous and professional at all timeshis lawyers voice in his ear be that as it may sir tomorrow presents real problems my partner dr warren shields is out due to illness and consequently i have an especially heavy patient load tomorrow it would be a huge help if you could delay your search until after the weekend biegler cleared his throat dr auster perhaps this might be a good time to inform you that destroying medical records that are under subpoena constitutes obstruction of justice in your case those would be felony charges anger began to override the fear in austers pounding heart are you saying my records have already been subpoenaed thats correct sir and i should inform you that digital files are no less a legal record than hard copies if anyone attempts to erase any digital files we will know it and we will recover them the penalties are quite severe i see auster took a quick slug of vodka then wiped his chin with the sleeve of his lab coat you know what i think agent biegler i dont think you called me out of courtesy i think you called to kick my blood pressure up you called me to gloat this is how you get your rocks off isnt it youve got a bug up your ass about doctors and you spend every day trying to bankrupt them or put them in jail well ive got news for you youve picked on the wrong doctor first of all im not guilty of anything second ive got lawyers out the wazoo and i can afford to pay them for a long long time and third auster tried to remind himself that this conversation was almost certainly being recorded it wouldnt be good to threaten bodily harm or death by the intervention of third parties he might know in a questionable line of work never mind about third he ended lamely you get the idea yes i do said biegler you paint a vivid picture doctor now let me paint you one youre going to be indicted under a number of federal statutes many of which have been newly created to deal with predatory physicians like you you have violated the false claims act the false statements act several sections of the social security act and most importantly the kennedykassebaum health insurance portability act also by mailing fraudulent bills to patients in louisiana youve violated the federal mail and wire fraud act each instance punishable as a separate offense furthermore there are civil penalties for all the above crimes you have violated the civil false claims act and the civil monetary penalties law auster was having difficulty breathing the diaka wasnt going to do it this time he opened a prescription bottle in his drawer and swallowed twenty milligrams of propranolol to slow his heart are you still there doctor of course to sum up under the new sentencing laws you are facing the possibility of one hundred and seventyfive years in prison and sixtyfive million dollars in penalties that doesnt include punitive damages which the government is entitled to pursue up to three times the cost of actual damages in each instance of course auster felt a sharp pain radiating down his left arm even the hint of a heart event sent his pulse into the stratosphere dr auster auster shut his eyes and forced himself under control all these sensations were simply a stress reaction paul biegler had ambushed him and the panic now redlining his vital signs was exactly the result biegler had sought to produce but he would not give the agent that victory this was like tournament poker in vegas it was all about balls cojones nerves of steel you might have bet heavy on the come and drawn a shit hand but you couldnt let anybody know that especially the guy sitting across the table from you daring you to call you knew he had the cardsyou could read them in his eyes as surely as if his corneas were mirrors reflecting what was in his hand but you had to call the bastard and play it out anybody could win with a royal flush it was how you played the shit hands that proved your mettle did you hear what i said doctor biegler repeated sixtyfive million dollars somehow auster found it within himself to chuckle that figure is a fantasy agent biegler none of that will ever happen you know why youre rattling off all those numbers to scare me into settling out of court you want me to pay uncle sam a big chunk of extortion money well guess what i have committed no crimes none and i already pay the government my fair share of extortion money its called taxes and i shell out close to a million dollars every year so kiss my sanctified ass you pencilpushing cocksucker for a few glorious moments kyle auster felt the euphoria of having done what every hardworking american wanted to do in his heart of hearts tell the government to go to helland it felt good then agent biegler started laughing youre something arent you he said his voice betraying something like admiration i heard that about you highstakes gambler they tell me boy this ones gonna be fun by noon tomorrow youre going to think youre dealing with a proctologist not a medicaid investigator what exactly are you agent biegler are you really an investigator because i smell a lawyer i can respect a cop you know but a lawyers something else again i have a law degree couldnt pass organic chemistry huh bieglers laughter stopped i should also inform you that as of nine am tomorrow all medicaid payments to the partnership of austershields medical services will cease you are being excluded from the medicaid program pending the outcome of your criminal trial have a nice day doctor auster slammed down the phone before biegler could hang up vida he yelled at his door vida nothing he buzzed the front nell tell vida to come back here yes doctor auster put away the diaka bottle and took three deep breaths to try to calm down a moment later vida stepped into his office her face lined with worry nell told me who it was she said you shouldnt have taken that call kyle yeah well you should have been here to tell me not to take it let me guess you got into a pissing contest auster shrugged helplessly do you know what he said im facing jail i guess auster leaned forward and looked hard into vidas heavily madeup eyes not just jail a hundred and seventyfive years in prison she didnt flinch no way never happen then theres the little matter of sixtyfive million dollars in penalties at last her face lost some color sixtyfive million can that be true oh yes and thats not counting punitive damages you need to start researching the kennedykassebaum law if you want to know what the rest of your life looks like that is vida walked halfway around the desk and looked down at him dont let that asshole get to you hes just talking tough like all cops do hes pretty good at it it doesnt matter ive been sterilizing records for the past ten days we never did anything stupid ive been working in medical offices for eighteen years everything we billed for can be defended on medical grounds but the special patientsthey can blow us out of the water the stuff we did on them was based on total fiction wrong they said the words to you kyle they made the complaints you did what any conscientious physician would do even if you thought the complaints might be psychosomatic jesus vi she reached out and brushed some hair from his eyes youve got to hold your nerve baby we paid them to say that stuff vida shook her head never happened untraceable cash and long gone now i promise you but if they testify they wont wheres the upside for them from us they get cash and free medical care from the government they get jack shit anybody makes trouble well buy them off what if somebody has an attack of conscience they wont i didnt pick a bunch of holy rollers to do this i picked good compromised christians the only thing we have to worry about is somebody you pissed off somebody testifying out of revenge like a woman say austers mind flew back to a couple of attractive female patients one of whom biegler had called by name in the natural course of things they had offered him certain sexual favors in exchange for certain prescriptions and he had not resisted as he should have when their requests got out of hand hed had to cut them off no matter what they offered one or both of those women might present problems particularly if the government had leverage over them based on drugrelated charges i see weve got a problem vida said harshly who is she nobody i was just going over it all in my mind bullshit spill it kyle paul biegler needed vida working for him she was relentless auster sighed heavily quinesha washington vida went pale that crackhead you went with that skank just a blow jobi never touched her otherwise vida shuddered in disgust well i hope it was a good one shes going to cost us plenty a good one more like a dozen good ones sorry you go tell janel to draw blood for an hiv test come on vi now damn it you dont have the sense god gave a tomcat auster held up his hands in surrender ill do it when were done were done until you get that test back im going back up front to try to save you from yourself she turned on her heel and stormed out auster leaned back in his chair and waited for his heart to slow a few blistering images of quinesha washington on her knees before him arced through his brain but they vanished as paul bieglers threats came rushing back the funny thing was the patients and the records werent what really worried auster what worried him was his partner taking on warren shields had been a mistake auster had assumed that shields like all the young docs was hungry for money and warren certainly had nothing against making money but he was constantly checking himself against a code of ethics that belonged to an older generation of doctorshell the generation behind auster even it was maddening on the other hand the affluent patients in town loved the guy so he was still good for business then like a gift from heaven shields had suddenly come around on the money issue about a year ago hed walked into austers private office after work and said pointblank that he needed to make more money auster told him it was no problem that the money had always been there for the taking had warren been ready to earn it warren had just nodded and said he was and that was that auster didnt know what had precipitated warrens sudden venalitya mistress a drug habit an expensive hobbynor did he care in short order hed put vida in charge of shields on a daytoday basis before warren checked the billing code after seeing a patient vida would ask him a few questions then check the appropriate box herself a busy physician like shields didnt have time to be bothered with trying to figure out the finer shades of what constituted a level exam within a month shieldss income almost doubled that abrupt uptick in billing might have been what attracted the attention of the medicaid fraud unit but auster knew why hed pushed it warren shieldss reputation was spotless he was the last doctor anyone would suspect of padding his charges and shields truly resented government intervention in medicine auster had no doubt that confronted by an accusing government lawyer warren would experience a primal burst of outrage if that pencil pusher biegler went after shields he would get a blast of righteous anger that would set him back on his heels then shields would use his considerable medical knowledge to defend every bill for every patient hed ever examined auster would do the same and if vida could really keep the special patients quietthen everything would be all right chapter laurel lay bound on the sofa trying to keep her mind from going as numb as her extremities she felt the minutes draining away like blood from a wound all thoughts of marriage adultery and even pregnancy had fled she lived only to discover the time only when she knew how long she had before the children got home could she plan her next move which might be something she would have thought abhorrent an hour ago escape had been her first priority but given warrens crazed emotional state she could not limit her goal to breaking out of the house the heavy glass vase he had urinated intoand then dropped during her race for the safe roomhad come to rest against the wall that separated the great room from the kitchen the handblown vessel heavy and round at the bottom with a long tapered neck had the makings of an ideal club a blow from that might crush warrens skull but anything was preferable to letting her children walk into this nightmare i told you im about to pee on myself laurel cried for the fifth time warren didnt even look up from her computer why dont you take a break from that thing and search the house some more i told you theres something else waiting for you to find it he chuckled softly what i want to find is buried in the circuits of this machine what you need to find is what kyle auster planted in here so you can start taking out your anger on the person whos your real problem warren ignored her she tried another tack do you really want our children to see me taped up like a hostage with urinesoaked pants how are you going to explain that you dont have to use the bathroom you just want to get loose im about to burst cant you see the sweat on my face he gave her a brief glance if you have to go that bad go in your pants ill throw them in the washer before the kids get here new anxiety awakened within her how are they supposed to get here if i dont pick them up are you going to get them maybe i emailed one of the girls at the office to get them she hadnt considered the idea that warren might be emailing people while he was carrying out his exercise in paranoia who nell roberts laurel pictured a pretty darkhaired louisiana girl the younger sister of the bleachedblond receptionist people said auster was sleeping with what would diane rivers do when nell roberts showed up at school to pick up the children diane had been asked to drop off shed call laurels cell phone which was now tucked into warrens back pocket and hed give some smooth explanation to allay any suspicion end of story how long till they get out of school laurel asked casually warren shrugged theyll get here when they get here but nells not bringing them i didnt email her youre such a perfect mother that i realized you would already have arranged to get them here right his sarcasm angered laurel but at least she had learned that the possibility to intervene with diane remained warren im begging you to let me go to the bathroom dont you have enough simple human decency left to allow that at last he looked over at her tell me the password to your hotmail account then you can go okay laurel thought angrily you asked for it she closed her eyes and relaxed her urinary sphincter within seconds her crotch was soaked then her inner thighs and bottom the smell would hit warren in a minute and he was unlikely to maintain a stoic front the sofa beneath laurels behind was a leather rochebobois imported from france and change through a boutique store in west palm beach she was still peeing when warren sat up straight n the ottoman fuck he cried you didnt pee on that couch i told you i had to go get off the damn sofa screw you cut this tape off me and ill get up he glared as though he wanted to hit her but laurel sat as calmly as a buddha almost blissful in the relief of her empty bladder youre disgusting warren said you asked for it you got it he went into the kitchen and came back with a razorsharp steak knife then he knelt and began cutting the duct tape away from her lower legs they burned as blood began flowing back into her skin she held out her hands for him to cut the tape from her wrists but he shook his head forget it take off your pants and throw them in the wash then well get you some new ones stripping off her pants presented a problem since her pants were the only thing concealing her clone phone carefully she slid them down her legs and bunched them around the pocket that held the razr then headed for the laundry room the pungent odor of urine reminded her of the days when grant and beth still wore diapers a memory that broke loose a calcified layer of fierce maternal instinct as she passed through the kitchen she glanced at the wall clock pm fifty minutes max until the kids burst through the front door fifty minutes to break out of the house or to hurt warren so badly that she could do anything she liked without fear of retribution he seemed to sense her hardening resolve he followed no closer than ten feet behind her as she walked to the laundry room and his gun stayed in his hand that distance allowed her to palm the razr as she tossed the dirty slacks into the washer but this presented another problem if she tried to sneak the phone to the bedroom while naked from the waist down warren was bound to see it she considered trying to slip it up under her arm but she could feel him watching her from the bifold doors get moving he said come on just a sec she wanted to check the phone for text messages but she didnt dare as she reached for the big jug of purex on the shelf above the machine she slid the razr onto the shelf and left it there just before the phone slid out of sight she saw new messages on its tiny exterior lcd screen her heart leaped for the messages could only be from danny but she didnt even consider trying to open the phone and read them that would have to wait after she got the wash going she left the purex on top of the dryer and walked halfnaked back to the master suite trusting that warren would prefer to watch her receding derriere rather than doublecheck the laundry room she got into the shower and cleaned herself as well as she could considering the duct tape on her wrists rather than loosening under the spray the tape became even stickier a gooey gray mess to her surprise warren hung a towel on the shower door while she scrubbed she dried herself with it pulled a fresh pair of panties from her drawer and selected a pair of stretchy black yoga pants from the closetjust the thing for sprinting if she got the chance as she sat on the bed to pull them on she caught warren staring at her pubic triangle hed always liked her to keep it shaved and she usually obliged him but danny had liked her natural and shed been more than happy to please him warren hadnt complained about the difference though he had mentioned it a few months back but now he was staring at her mons like a detective whod stumbled onto a clue that could solve the case of his life what she asked comments from the gallery kyle likes them shaved warren said almost to himself ive heard him say it a hundred times he would warrens eyes narrowed what does that mean laurel sighed debating whether to be honest i just think its juvenile the way men want women shaved down there i mean whats the deal do you really want a prepubescent girl and a shaved woman is the closest thing you can get warren had gone red your new friend is above all that right more mature than the rest of us youd better believe it im not going to dignify that she pulled on her panties and then the yoga pants what now general pinochet dont act like this is my fault you put yourself in this position ah so torture is the new legal remedy for infidelity it ought to be even if it were the betrayed person would still suffer more she dismissed his words with a flick of her hand and walked back toward the kitchen back to the couch he told her if theres room beside your wet spot no more duct tape my children will not see me like that and youre going to cut this tape off my wrists before they come in warren wasnt looking at her anymore he was staring at the computer on the coffee table as though seeing it for the first time she felt a sudden compulsion to distract him but saw no way to do so she knew that look warren could be maddeningly stupid when it came to human relations but when it came to quantitative matters he could be as smart as a treeful of owls as her grandfather used to say she could almost smell the rush of his neurotransmitters kicking into overdrive he started to laugh sending a chill through her what is it whats funny he perched on the eames ottoman and reached for the trackpad all this time ive been searching for data ive ignored the actual programs a worm of fear squirmed in laurels belly warren was already clicking away this time with his sights set squarely on her true vulnerability it took him less than five minutes to nail her she knew the exact moment because he smiled like the cheshire cat then looked up and spoke with almost obscene satisfaction hello misselizabeth how are we today adrenaline blasted through laurels system like a hit of pure cocaine but she looked back at him like a deaf woman who couldnt read lips dont even try warren said youre not meryl streep okay youre not even tori spelling i want your password i dont have the password for that account jesus would you stop it already whats the point of denying anything now i got that account when i first got my computer it was free i used it once or twice then never again uhhuh so its just a coincidence that i found that love letter in your copy of pride and prejudice and that your hotmail alias is miss elizabeth as in elizabeth bennet that warren would know even a single character from an austen novel stunned laurel you can thank keira knightley for that one he said when laurel didnt respond he squeezed his fists into his eye sockets in some sort of brutal massage then began stabbing the sonys keyboard again lets just check out your little story shall we an almost irresistible compulsion to flee gripped laurel only the memory of warren firing the pistol at her head kept her on the sofa the revolver now lay inches from her laptopand from warrens right hand okay he said like a desk clerk locating a hotel reservation heres the microsoft file where old email is stored for hotmail accounts your file totals exactly megabytes of data he looked up again his eyes glowing with triumph that sounds like about five hundred emails to me with a few candid snapshots thrown in maybe are we going to see some of your personal porn this time not without my password laurel thought but her confidence was wavering warren was driving her ever deeper into a corner this file was last accessed two days ago warren said at eleven forty am so you read your love notes while in your classroom at country day is that why i donated money to get wifi out there what were your poor students doing then miss elizabeth that sounds like negligence to me laurel stared determinedly at the floor the entire dynamic between them had changed but she could not acknowledge this i guess ill have to figure out your password on my own warren said cheerily the keyboard started clicking again laurel hugged herself and tried to think of a way to stop him but nothing came to her with the screen facing away from her she couldnt be sure what he was doing but he would almost certainly begin with her birthday then the kids birthdays then her social security number then hed move on to various inversions of those numerals warren had always excelled at puzzles so this kind of thing was very much to his taste yet after several abortive attempts to log into her account he got up hurried over to his study and quickly returned holding her copy of pride and prejudice i should have started with this he said i guess well try darcy first any thoughts retrieving this book had been a brilliant intuitive leap but it didnt worry laurel as much as warren probably thought it did even with a copy of pride and prejudice to work from it would take hundreds of hours to ever hit on fitzztif the password to her account shed created it by playing with the first half of mr darcys christian name fitzwilliam it was an almost childish choice but the odds against warren trying that particular sequence of letters were astronomical i wish i had a pet scanner that could read the folds of your traitorous little brain he said with sudden bitterness she pretended to ignore him but she was rejoicing inside trying to guess someones password was about as much funand as difficultas trying to open a safe by random turns of the dial i know why youre doing this he said over the screen stonewalling i mean its because he doesnt want you the letter was definite about that he used you and then he dumped you she gave warren nothing if hed wanted to run away with you youd be gone wouldnt you youre just afraid to jump ship without a lifeboat waiting to catch you youre gutless thats the ugly bottom of all this i dont know what the hell i ever saw in you she knew she shouldnt take the bait but she couldnt let this pass if thats how you feel why would you care if im seeing someone because im stuck with you he said still not looking up from the screen i take my marriage vows seriously and i take our childrens wellbeing seriously i happen to have the fortitude to stick it out and try even with a slut who hasnt got the nerve to bail out without a golden parachute me she whispered im a coward im gutless what about you the righteous indignation in her voice got his attention he peered over the top of the screen what are you talking about you know that night on highway on the way home from the criterium race in mccomb warren had gone still his face was pale but for the dark circles around his eyes he remembered all right they stared at each other over her computer each recalling the night that had opened a chasm between them one that had not been bridged since almost a year ago now after one of the few bike races laurel had traveled to watch warren had taken third place which most riders would have been happy to win but because it was only a regional race he had dumped the diminutive trophy in a garbage can and demanded that they leave for home immediately theyd covered about half of the sixtymile drive when it happened flames exploded out of the darkness far ahead as though from an impacting meteor as they drew closer laurel made out the silhouette of a burning pickup truck on the right shoulder its nose wedged tight against a massive oak tree more chilling she saw a prone form on the asphalt and it seemed to be moving she kept waiting for warren to hit the brakes but he never did and before she knew it they were hurtling past the flaming wreck the acrid stench of burning gasoline flooding through the ac vents like a ghostly accusation stop shed cried grabbing his arm but hed continued on his jaw set tight the argument that followed had altered her view of her husband forever while she pleaded for him to turn back and use his medical skills to save the victim she had seen on the road much less those who might be trapped inside the truck warren had calmly described the risks of such an act for him wasnt there a good samaritan law on the books in mississippi laurel shouted wouldnt make a bit of difference warren told her not once the personalinjury lawyers got into it shed been sobbing by then someone could be dying back there she screamed right now while we drive away i saw someone moving on the road but warren remained unmoved she still remembered his quiet soliloquy as they fled the scene listen to me thats probably some drunk black guy wrapped around that tree or white trash take your pick he probably never paid a dime for car insurance in his life i on the other hand studied for twenty grueling years to become a doctor im not risking everything ive built for you and the kids to try to help somebody wholl repay me for my efforts by suing me while laurel gaped in disbelief warren went on and his words were still engraved in her soul ive gone so far out of my way to help those peopleand i dont mean all of them you know that but i drove a blood sample to jackson late one friday so a family could find out as soon as possible whether their kid had leukemia or nothe didntand did i get one word of thanks no maam just a blank stare and theyre gone no thank you no payment no nothing so tonight we drive on laurel had settled back in her seat and closed her eyes but the flaming truck still burned behind her eyelids and the broken body still crawled along the lightless road the next morning she read in the newspaper that two people had died in a onecar accident on highway no witnesses according to the highway patrol the couple had been traveling home from the funeral of their grandson laurel could tell by their names that they were black she never looked at warren the same way again after that night and two weeks later shed begun her affair with danny mcdavitt danny she knew would never abandon someone in trouble on the side of a road he had the medals to prove it you dont know half what you think you know warren said with eerie certainty you think im a coward because of that night i dont want to think about that night ever again he nodded slowly thats a luxury you have i guess you think i dont have reasons to check out of this marriage she shrugged if you do then you should he shook his head like a man amazed is it really that easy for you you can look at grant and beth smile and say sayonara kids it was fun while it lasted you know its not that simple warren clenched his jaw muscles then got up and stood over her with the pistol in his hand she watched it hanging beside her head an efficient little machine of death dangling like a childs toy in his tanned hand he pressed the barrel against the crown of her skull this is how simple it is i know you had an affair i know because you wont give me that password you think youre sparing me pain by keeping the truth from me but youre not youre making it worse for me and for you be sure you understand that youre not leaving this house until i know whos been fucking you do you understand that laurel wanted to be brave but she felt herself trembling doyouunderstand she waited until she knew she could speak without sounding terrified i want you to listen to me warren i want you to think about all the things that have frightened us through the years everything that could take us away from our children cancer car accidents child molesters an intruder in the house weve taken steps to prevent all those things but right nowthe gun barrel scraped her scalp as she lifted her face to look at himright now you are the greatest threat to this family what if i did have an affair i understand you would feel hurt but does anything justify this would you murder the mother of your children think about grant and beth for just ten seconds picture them in your mind how innocent they are the smell of gun oil entered her nose after a few moments warren lowered the gun bent his knees and squatted before her seeing a change in his eyes she was sure she had broken through the anger and pain to reach him he still looked shellshocked but the tenderness in his gaze had not been there before however wounded it might be do you know what a family is he whispered what makes a family she nodded but warren shook his head trust he said thats what separates a family from the rest of the world blood isnt enough they say blood is thicker than water but brothers betray each other all the time trust is the glue that protects a family from the chaos outside she wanted to respond but it was coming to her that warren saw the world in a way that she did not and never could you he said with quiet force have destroyed that irrevocably the damage is done and i can never take you at your word again grant and beth can never trust you again warren dont speak he commanded standing suddenly he looked down at her like some kind of old testament judge you chose to place your selfish desires over the welfare of your children and you must pay the price for that all of us will have to im afraid warren youre not yourself she said starting to rise he slapped her with his left hand driving her down to the floor his palm had struck her right ear which was now ringing like the threeoclock bell at school it hurt but the shock of being hit far outweighed the pain she held up her hands to prevent another blow do you think i havent been tempted warren shouted do you think i havent had nurses offer me any damn thing i wanted no strings attached im sure you have not only nurses wives of friends teachers at the school friends of yours the signs are always up pussy for rent nobody has any honor anymore nobody keeps their promises laurel stayed on the floor trying to recall a dark religious strain in warrens childhood but she didnt remember one but the way he was talkingit was like hed been possessed by some wildeyed minister from another age or by her father on his worst day but not even her father would have resorted to violence he would have gotten her down on the floor to pray until god sent some sign that forgiveness was at hand but warren wasnt waiting for a sign he saw himself as the instrument of gods punishment im sorry youre hurting she said but theres no reason for it i wish youd believe me i would never do anything to hurt our children never get up he yelled almost jerking her arm out of joint she scrambled to her feet warren seemed about to drag her somewhere but then he shoved her back down on the sofa im so stupid he said how could it take me so long to see it my blood sugar must be in the basement he sat on the ottoman and started pecking at the computer again you can buy just about anything on the web these days i read an article in usa today about identity theft and computers apparently hackers have these programs called password crackers that will crank away for fifty hours in a row if necessary trying every possible combination of numbers and letters until they break into your email account or whatever ill bet for the right price i can download one of those cracker programs right into your little sony laurel had mistakenly invested in the idea that the gun was the greatest danger in the room this new digital wrinkle destroyed that illusion her computer was the real weapon or rather the detonator that could trigger the use of the gun in earnest if warren actually got into her hotmail account he would have dannys name almost instantly soon after he would read every piece of email that had passed between her and danny during the eleven months they had been together there were even photos embedded in some of those messages some were intimate others not but every one had the power to shatter what remained of her husbands sanity here we go said warren a note of triumph in his voice merlins magic sounds like just the ticket two hundred eightynine bucks and they wont even let you download a trial version that means they know their program works and they know the kind of situation someones likely to be in when they need it a oneshot deal with a lot riding on the outcome just as she began to hope that warren would have to get up to retrieve a credit card he said im going to use your paypal account to buy this isnt that sweet one click and were in business laurel closed her eyes while his fingertips clicked the keys how many minutes until the kids got home if she jumped up and raced for one of the house phones to call would warren shoot her even if he didnt had things deteriorated to the point that an armed siege was the best solution they have she said silently as long as the kids arent in the house all done warren said brightly he cut his eyes at her you might want to rethink your denial its only a matter of time until i read those emails and remember confession is good for the soul my soul is my own business thank you she thought looking past him to the heavy vase lying against the wall but if you turn your back on me before the kids get home adultery might end up being one of the lesser sins marked against my name chapter i have to tell you something vi nell whispered i dont want to but i think you need to know you deserve to know she and vida were sitting in the reception area of the office and nell had rolled her chair over next to her sisters away from the big patient window janel the lab tech had passed by in the hall a couple of times so nell kept her voice low well dont take all day vida said theres work to do im listening nell felt her lower lip quivering go on baby girl whatever it is i can take it i hope so nell thought i dearly hope so i think kyle is cheating on you vi vida stared back in silence with who i dont know what did you see or hear i heard him talking on his cell phone vida glanced over her shoulder at the hall door then leaned closer when was this day before yesterday back in the surgery room go on well the conversation was pretty intimate he had that tone you know loveydovey mmhm it seemed obvious that hes involved with whoever it was and i listen honey vida cut in i dont doubt you im sure kyles poking god knows who all and i wish he wasnt but let me tell you something youre gonna learn one way or the other someday they all do it every damn one of em thats the way men are they live for tail and theyre gonna chase it whether theyre married or single or whatever its a natural law like freakin gravity like the sun rising in the east soon as they get their ashes hauled theyre trying to figure out how to get away from whoever did the haulin unless they need you for something else and thats why im not worried nell sat quietly working through her sisters logic shed known vida was hard but she hadnt thought her sister would be willing to put up with infidelity to keep a man at her side most of all she hoped vida was wrong about menat least a few of them she considered keeping back the rest of what shed heard but if she did shed regret it later she could see vida standing outside her apartment one night waiting for dr austers jaguar to swing by and pick her up like a black carriage come to sweep her off to a castle but that jaguar would never arrive it would be long gone to pick up some princess who fit more smoothly into the castles of the rich and conscienceless let me finish vi she said louder than shed intended please vida laid a comforting hand on her knee go on baby it wasnt just sex talk okay he apologized to the person and then he said he had to keep putting up withwith somebodyfor a while longer before he could leave and be with whoever was on the phone something changed in vidas face she had the look of someone walking along a path as night fell one moment sure she knew the way home the next knowing she was lost keep going she said in a flat voice that told nell her walls had gone up dr auster said i hate servicing that little that little what asked vida her eyes as dead as marbles you can say it that little redneck nell whispered and vida flinched then he said but she scares me next was something else i couldnt hear but then he said but by then itll be too late for her to retaliate or something like that vidas face had lost its color and you think he was talking about me nell couldnt bring herself to drive the last nail home she shrugged i cant say for sure i will castrate his sorry ass vida hissed that nocount son of a bitch after all iveoh never mind serves me right for believing a man about anything was i wrong to tell you nell asked anxiously you had to tell me baby bloods thickern water thicker than anything its sure thicker than what comes out of a man christ almighty nell watched her sister adjusting to this new reality vida usually projected an air of coarse vitality but at this moment she looked like a roadweary woman from a depressionera photograph nell had triedsubtlyto suggest a few things to soften her older sisters appearance skin lotion for one thing which nell applied religiously every night before bed and all during the day on her face decades of smoking had turned vidas face into a hard carapace with a yellowish tint and her hair once a lustrous brown had become dry and frizzy and always stank of cigarettes when she went out at night she dressed one notch up from white trash halter tops and blue eye shadow worn like some sort of masknot to mention the line of mascara under her lower eyelid circa vidas great claim to fame was winning a televised wet tshirt contest in destinshed beaten other competitorsbut two children and ten thousand cheeseburgers had deflated her prized assets and hidden her waist in a roll of hard fat it was testament to her black sense of humor and lively personality that dr austerwho had his pick of twentysomething nurseshad looked past her obvious flaws what are you going to do nell asked softly a hard glint appeared in vidas eyes dont you worry about that i can take care of myself always could you know that nell was afraid to be honest about her other fears but she knew she had to speak up if she was to help in any way im worried about dr shields vi vida looked long and hard at her hes a lot better man than kyle isnt he nell nodded soberly youve got a thing for him dont you she closed her eyes and nodded again jesus girl have you done the dirty with him nell shook her head vehemently you swear i swear hes never touched me do you talk to him secretly i mean on the phone email like that nothing vi i swear to god hes not like that vida chuckled softly theyre all like that once the right woman comes along but i know what you mean im just afraid hell go to jail vida buried her face in her hands and rubbed it harder than nell would have dared then she looked up and said ill be honest with you sweetie until five minutes ago that was the plan him or us you know nell waited without breathing but nowmaybe its him or kyle you know a glimmer of hope what do you mean im not sure yet baby i need to think nell was shivering vida took her hand and said how about this whatever happens today ill make kyle go over to warrens house and take out the stuff he put there you promise i promise today vida patted nells knee today but what if dr shields is home or his wife oh kyles slick enough to get it out even if theyre there some things he is good at ill give him that hes a born con man but where is the stuff what is it i dont even know that the hardness returned to vidas face you dont need to know but ill tell you where it is its in that room they have under the stairs did you know about that nell shook her head its like in that jodie foster movie only not so fancy where you go if theres a tornado or somebody breaks in its a rich peoples thing nell said i remember mama used to throw us in the closet when a tornado came that was me mama was too drunk to worry about any tornado shame and love reddened nells face dont think about it vida said anyway kyle went over to dr shieldss house last saturday night when they were all gone to the movies he put the stuff behind some canned goods or something but you just stop worrying im going to take care of kyle and make sure your boyfriend is safe too as safe as he can be in the middle of this mess anyway safe as you and me nell forced herself to smile this was the best she could hope for vida leaned forward and hugged her tight the smell of marlboro ultralights wafting from her hair youre such a pretty girl vida cooed with maternal pride everythings gonna turn out perfect for you it has to she pulled back far enough to wink at nell one of us deserves a happy ending nell felt like crying but she held it in vida stood and walked to the patient window her hands accepting a form from a patient but her mind already plotting her next move nell didnt envy dr austers next meeting with her sister vida was hell on wheels when she was angryscarier than most men nell rolled her chair back to her computer but the longer she stared at the screen the less relieved she felt things were moving too fast and yet not fast enough what if the cops did something today what if they searched dr shieldss house before dr auster went over and removed the planted evidence could she afford to wait for that could she even trust dr auster to do what he was supposed to do even if he promised vida that he would the answer to that question was an unequivocal no nell couldnt leave warren shieldss future in the hands of his sleazy partner she would have to take responsibility herself after a quick glance at vida she opened her hotmail account and began to type two thousand feet above the city danny told his flying student to bank the cessna northward and head away from the mississippi river theyd been in the air forty minutes mostly on the south side of town but danny wanted to know if both cars were still parked at the shields house laurel had not replied to his last text message and he was worried that hed made a mistake by sending it a bad mistake you want me to go all the way to fort adams asked marilyn stone a local attorney whod dreamed for years of learning to fly no lets do our usual run out here when you get to avalon execute an sturn over belle chêne plantation then head back to the barn marilyn nodded her eyes on the gps unit mounted on the instrument panel why avalon all the time you buying a lot there or something you never know danny said with a forced laugh he looked down at the loess hills below and tried to settle his nerves athens point was a beautiful place and the verdant forests below reminded him why hed chosen to return after his military career unlike so many places that he had lived this city had a long and colorful history athens point had been founded in by a classically educated frenchman venturing downriver through the natchez territory the land was inhabited by the choctaw indians but they lasted only seventy years before vanishing into oklahoma or worse places removal was accomplished the way hemingways bill gorton went bankrupt slowly and then all at once after the treaty of dancing rabbit creek all that remained of the choctaw in that corner of mississippi was a few names like the one taken by the county lusahatcha black water which today seemed a misnomer since the great river stretching away behind the cessna looked reddish brown under the sun but the mississippi river had many faces and danny had seen them all while growing up beside it unlike natchez thirty miles to the north athens point had resisted the yankee invasion during the civil war the town sent three companies to fight under lee in virginia and those who remained behind held out until july being forced to surrender after the fall of vicksburg while the father of waters thereafter flowed unvexed to the sea as president lincoln put it the inland areas of southwest mississippi remained vexed indeed gangs of confederate deserters roamed the land and marauding union cavalry units under colonel embury osband pillaged what remained of the states resources for a hundred years afterward the towns hero was jean larrieu a diminutive but feisty planter who shot six cavalrymen from the windows of belle chêne plantation before being cut down on his porch by a saber during a parley a union private had struck his wife and larrieu refused to let the insult pass his statue still stood atop a column in the town square even today antebellum city buildings bore the scars of the shelling that resulted from the towns firing on admiral porters passing ironclads in a historical marker commemorated the seventeen citizens who perished in the fires that day while beside it a second marker memorialized six african americans who died in lusahatcha county during the struggle for civil rights the prejudice so prevalent in dannys childhood had diminished to a mild undercurrent between the races but even today black and white remained largely divided in the physical sense black families tended to congregate in the city proper or to the south while affluent whites and a few wealthy blacks built shining new subdivisions in the forests along highway to the north avalon was the newest and most exclusive of these patterned after subdivisions of the same name in gulfport and natchez apparently the developer intended to replicate his utopian concept across the state danny could just make out the serpentine bends of larrieus creek which marked one boundary of avalon there he said silently avalon had been tastefully carved out of forestland that had been locked up in the trust of an old athens point family for a hundred years a massive wroughtiron gate greeted prospective buyers as they turned off highway onto cornwall a broad street that wound its way eastward through the upscale development only fifteen houses had been built so far with a handful of others under construction the smallest lots available were acres the shields house was easy to spot from the air because its acreage was bordered by a bend of larrieus creek ive been thinking marilyn said i might want to try for an instrument rating after i get my vfr license danny chuckled youre always pushing arent you she grinned im a trial lawyer i guess its in my blood he knew she expected him to keep up the banter but his mind was on the land below he could see the shields house coming up on his left drop down to five hundred feet i think i see a herd of deer marilyn responded smoothly and the cessna quickly descended good stay well clear of those houses danny would have liked to let laurel hear the plane but if there was any chance that warren suspected danny was her lover then drawing attention to the cessna would be insane warren had flown this plane so often that he would recognize it at a glance and since laurelor warren for that matterhad not responded to the two text messages he had sent her he had to play things very cool somebody complained to me at the hardware store the other day danny added asked if were planning to bomb the neighborhood marilyn laughed and slid the plane a quarter mile to the east danny got a perfect view of laurels acura parked behind her husbands volvo the sight tied a knot in his stomach what the hell was going on down there maybe theyre getting it on he thought surprised that he almost wanted this to be true because any alternative was bound to be worse see any bucks marilyn asked what the deer see any bucks nah nothing but does and they skipped into the trees should i start my turn yeah go ahead danny closed his eyes and tried to think logically but his nerves kept getting in the way or was it his emotions an sturn over belle chêne marilyn asked lets skip that said danny glancing at his watch lets take her back to the airport ive got something i cant be late for suits me marilyn said watching him from the corner of her eye ive got a deposition this afternoon big case coming up i pity the lawyer youre up against she laughed you dont know whether im a good lawyer or not he clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth oh yes i do how he tapped the bridge of his nose im a good judge of character marilyn elbowed him in the side and he saw some color come into her cheeks ill bet you are she said looking as if she wanted to say more danny resisted the urge to look back toward avalon as she made a controlled degree turn are you all right she asked in a concerned voice sure im fine you look worried to me i dont think ive ever seen you worry before this is why youre a good lawyer danny thought little bit of a headache thats all if you say so but if you need any helpdont hesitate to call me he tried to laugh this off but the more he thought about the situation the more worried he became the cessna headed southwest toward the mississippi river where it curved between angola prison and desalle island marilyn do you know anything about family law she sighed i thought it was something like that yes i know a lot i used to handle nothing but divorces until i got enough oilbusiness work to keep me going danny rubbed his forehead for a while hed talked to a couple of lawyers already but neither had seemed to grasp the special nature of michaels educational problems praying that marilyn was different he said i need to ask you about a custody issue she looked him in the eye and nodded more serious then hed ever seen her its complicated he said she smiled encouragingly thats why you need a professional fire away major laurel was nearly mad with fright the merlins magic program had been hammering steadily at her hotmail account for the best part of an hour and sooner or later the mindless digital battering ram would break through it was fast and efficient a bruteforce strategy that guaranteed success given sufficient time laurel didnt know enough about probability theory to guess how long it might take for the program to hit on her passwordsurely longer than the fifteen or twenty minutes until grant and beth got homebut what was to stop warren from keeping her and the children prisoner all night he could run merlins magic until the contents of her secret files finally poured into his lap even if it took until morning shortly after warren installed the program laurel had heard what she thought was the faint sound of an airplane engine far to the east she was unable to get up and look however because warren had retaped her ankles and calves probably so he could focus on the password program without worrying about her she was almost afraid to hope that the sound had come from dannys plane and yet she did who else could help her the fact that she had not answered his last two text messages might have worried him enough to overfly the house but what more could he do you have to help yourself said a voice in her head dont wait to be saved so she hadnt after a few minutes thought she had hit on one possible method of escaping the duct tape when warren wasnt looking she had reversed her engagement ringa radiantcut twocarat diamond that he had bought three years ago to replace the sliver of a stone that had graced the ring when he proposedand tested its ability to saw through duct tape where the tape was stretched tight the raised edges of the diamond worked reasonably well the problem was warren who had a clear line of sight to her after complaining that the wet duct tape was itching badly which was true she began scratching often whenever warren seemed entranced by the computer screen she would saw at the vertical rip shed made in the tape binding her lower legs she worried that the diamond might pop out of its setting if she sawed too hardwhite gold was a soft metalbut she was bracing the stone with her thumb as she cut and besides she saw no alternative a few minutes ago warren had typed on the sonys keyboard for nearly a minute at first this frightened her but when she realized he had not broken into her account she decided he must be writing or answering an email shed used this time to work harder at the duct tape yet even if she managed to free her legs her wrists would remain bound it would be difficult if not impossible to retrieve the vase and hit warren over the head with it if her hands were bound together and even if she succeeded at that there remained the problems of trying to get her keys reach her car and drive away warren wasnt going to lie peacefully on the floor while she did all that she was pretending to scratch her ankles when he got up from the ottoman and stared at her like a man trying to hypnotize someone why did you run to the safe room he asked because i thought i would be safe there duh is that the only reason what other reason could there be he pointed his right forefinger at her then wagged it right and left like some cranky middleschool teacher lets find out he shoved the gun into his waistband then walked out of the great room and into the kitchen laurel bent nearly double on the couch and sawed frantically at the tape a few seconds later warren walked out of the kitchen with a knife and came straight to the sofa kneeling beside her he cut through the tape around her calves then the strips binding her ankles she was terrified that he would notice her saw marks but he was in too much of a hurry he pulled her to her feet and marched her toward the foyer who are you talking to online she asked why do you think im talking to someone youve been typing and reading something i figured it was email or ims and you said before that someone told you to search for the letter they just told you to look in the safe room didnt they arent you the little detective i told you there was something else in the house somebodys screwing with your head warren bigtime well see when we find out what it is wont we i was right laurel thought anxiously what the hell are we about to find just dont let it be something i cant explain he opened the closet that concealed the steel door of the safe room and told laurel to turn her back to the door after she did he punched his new code into the childprotection key pad which opened the steel door unless the master lock had been set from the inside as warren stepped into the metal room a spark of excitement flashed through her if she could get inside the safe room and somehow shove him out then she could slam the door and lock it with him outside the kids would still be in danger but there was a secure phone in the safe room and she could use it to call diane rivers and stop her from bringing the kids home laurel took a furtive step backward instinctively realizing that this was the way to get into the safe room warren would be nervous that she was trying to break for the front door as if on cue he said thats far enough you come stand here in the doorway she shuffled forward like a reluctant prisoner the air in the safe room was musty and stank of mildew warren began removing the canned goods stored on the shelves grabbing shrinkwrapped packs of bushs baked beans and stacking them on the floor next came the bottled water laurel was ready to risk her life to get warren out of there but he outweighed her by sixty pounds minimum and that sixty pounds was almost all muscle to complicate matters her wrists were still taped together and warren was almost flush against the shelves on the back wall how could she get behind him and shove him out the door she found her chance less than a foot away where the reinforced wall met the steel door a sharp piece of sheet metal protruded a half inch into the open doorway at shoulder level it looked a lot like an oldfashioned razor blade and she wasted no time testing it as warren cursed and dropped a sixpack of dasani onto the pile behind him she raised her arms and dragged the duct tape along the protruding metal warren paused at the ripping soundwhich sounded like velcro being unhookedbut by the time he turned laurel was holding her wrists together again he knelt before the deep shelves then grunted in surprise laurel picked up a heavy can of beans and drew it back as if to hurl it at his head it seemed safer than moving close enough to hit him but if she missed he might shoot her out of simple reflex warren groaned in frustration he was trying to pull something off the back of the bottom shelf a white cardboard box a bankers box she sprang forward and drove the can down toward the base of his skull aiming for the brain stem with her children in danger there was no point in half measures warren must have heard her approach because he turned his head back and upward just as the can reached the end of its arc instead of knocking him into a vegetative coma the flat of the can crashed into his neck and jaw he fell against the shelves his eyes blank laurel raised the can to deliver another blow but warren toppled sideways out of reach she darted forward meaning to grab the gun from his waistband but the light of awareness flashed in his eyes she froze aware that she had moved within his grasp then whirled and lunged for the door the gun thundered like a cannon in the tiny room dont take another step warren screamed laurel was too close to freedom to obey she kept moving and the pistol exploded again a hole appeared in the foyer wall ahead of her this image somehow penetrated the rush of panic driving her forward she turned and saw warren crawling through the door of the safe room with the pistol in his hand she darted to her right which carried her out of his line of sight and to the front door the door was bolted shut but the key was in the lock she was turning the key when a car horn sounded outside two quick blasts that told her diane rivers had just pulled to the end of the sidewalk with the kids as the bolt clicked open a shadow fell across the door laurel put her hand on the knob open that door and ill kill you warren said ill kill you with grant and beth watching she gripped the brass knob with all her strength willing herself to open the door no way will he shoot me in front of them she told herself hed spend the rest of his life in prison and not one person would ever visit him not even his mother and then ill shoot myself warren said quietly laurel froze a thousand images from news stories shed seen over the years playing in her mind murdersuicide distraught dad barricades home and executes family stabs wife strangles kids in their beds father crashes plane into motherinlaws house with children aboard she let her hand fall from the knob warren seized her by the neck and dragged her away from the door chapter kyle auster gripped his office telephone with an almost bloodless hand the man on the other end of it was patrick evans executive assistant to the governor and austers line into the medicaid fraud office evans had opened the conversation with the warning no names then explained that he was calling auster from a pay phone at evanss next words austers face went slack with fear i dont know what you said to paul biegler today but hes on his way down there with two other agents to chain your goddamn office shut you are out of business kyle for a while anyway its time to hire a good criminal lawyer butbut was all auster could sputter today biegler said he was coming in the morning evans didnt bother to respond to this evidence of idiocy auster heard traffic zooming by whatever pay phone evans was using he could see his old schoolmate standing by some shady downtown pay phone watching every vagrant like a potential mugger patrick auster said in a halting voice isnt there any way i can head this off im sorry man the ship has sailed andive got to say this our relationship has to end at this point i know we go back a long way but im in a highprofile job youre a liability now i cant risk everything because we played ball together in high school a big truck ground its gears in austers ear he felt as if evans had just walked away from the roulette table leaving him half a million down ive got to go evans said are we clear on that last no calls to the governors office not even from home much less jail fear and indignation rose as one in auster what about all the contributions ive given you guys hell this year alone wake up kyle this is survival get a good lawyer im out of here the phone clicked in austers hand no more traffic sounds nothing but the hum of his air conditioner and the sound of a patients voice in the corridor outside he felt the world collapsing around him crushing him with its density his allotted time as kyle auster noted athens point physician had shrunk to the time it would take paul biegler to cover the one hundred and twentysix miles of road between jackson and athens point with traffic that was about two and a quarter hours but if biegler really pushed it he could do it in ninety minutes christ when did he leave auster fought the urge to race out to his car visit the bank empty his cash accounts and skip town i should have kept my damn mouth shut he pressed the intercom button on his phone and waited for nell to answer yes dr auster she said in a strangely cold voice would you ask vida to come to my office umshes not here doctor what where is she she went to the store the store what store im sure i dont know dr auster auster was flabbergasted vida never left the office during the day maybe shed run out of cigarettes should i send her to you when she gets back doctor ahyes nell thank you austers heart was galloping he scrabbled in his top drawer for another betablocker which he swallowed with the remains of a flat coke from his morning snack then for good measure he stuck an ativan under his tongue what the hell could he do to save himself in ninety minutes call biegler and send him to warrens house to find the planted evidence claim that everything hed done had been to protect his younger partner would biegler buy that probably not there was still too much evidence to be found at the office too many patients to buy off ten days simply hadnt been enough warning he needed vida now he speeddialed her cell phone but it kicked him straight to voice mail either vida was on the phone with someone else or she was purposefully not answering his call at a loss auster started to get up and see one of the patients waiting in his exam rooms then he sat back down took the crystal diaka bottle from his bottom drawer and gulped a heroic slug right from the mouth shell be back soon he gasped thankful for the burn of alcohol in his gullet shell know what to do warren dragged laurel down the hall to the guest room and threw her onto the bed the horn sounded again outside and then the doorbell rang let me answer it she begged i wont try anything i swear to god warren wasnt listening he shoved a chair under the doorknob then began rummaging in the guest room closet which they used to store junk that had no other place what are you doing she cried praying that since the front door was still locked diane would take the kids home to her house but of course she would see both cars in the driveway please dont tape me up again warren i dont want the kids to see that no tape he said walking out of the closet with a threefoot length of plasticcoated cable a bicycle lock no she yelled but it didnt matter he sat astride her chest and looped the cable twice around her neck then cinched it tight and passed it through two slots in the wooden headboard by the time he clicked the lock shut she could hardly move without cutting off her air supply ill be back in a minute he said dont do anything stupid he vanished into the hall laurel heard the front door open then a squeal of joy from beth at unexpectedly finding her father home early the voices dropped to a muffled hum and a moment later laurel heard feet going up the front stairs why struggling to breathe with the bike lock choking her she agonized over her decision at the front door shed read that experts advised women to try everything for freedom in a kidnap situation even to risk being shot rather than be taken captive but this was different when warren said he would kill himself she had known by the timbre of his voice that he would do it he would kill her and himself too for an instant shed wondered if even that would be better than letting the children fall under his power but in the end shed decided that they represented her last hope of bringing him to his senses warren had come unmoored from reality but perhaps grant and beth could coax him back she heard soft footsteps in the playroom upstairs the kids couch groaned under warrens unaccustomed weight in that moment laurel hated danny mcdavitt five weeks ago her life had been a beautiful dream they had each decided to tell their spouse that they wanted a divorce on the same night a thursday that way no matter what happened warren would have to go to work the next day and danny would have flying lessons scheduled they could almost surely find a way to see each other even if warren or starlette had freaked out they parted that thursday afternoon with a feeling of elation that masked the deep anxiety laurel felt at broaching the subject of divorce with warren after eleven months of soulwithering secrecy they were finally stepping into the light danny stuck by his side of the agreement after he put his kids to bed he sat starlette down in the kitchen and told her he didnt love her anymore when she asked if hed met someone danny admitted that he had and told her that he was truly in love for the first time in his life starlette went ballistic not only did she make clear that she had no intention of granting danny a divorce in mississippi you had to have grounds but she also stated that if danny somehow forced her into one his ideas on custodyhim keeping michael for examplewould never become reality she would keep michael first to make danny suffer as she would be suffering and second because she wouldnt let any of her friends think she was capable of relinquishing her autistic son with only minor regret which was the truth danny spent that night in their kitchen trying to find a way out of the cage he had constructed for himself in the shields house things unfolded differently when warren got home from his hospital rounds he was more taciturn than usual and he actually ignored the children for several minutes though they tried desperately to get his attention worried laurel sent them into the backyard and asked him what was wrong warren told her that jimmy woods had died that afternoon jimmy had gone to school with warren from nursery school through the twelfth grade and theyd lived on the same street as boys hed developed diabetes some years ago and had a hard time keeping it under control an hour before warren got home from work that thursday jimmy had gone into a diabetic coma while driving on highway to pick up his son from baseball practice he ramped off a low shoulder went airborne and slammed into a pecan tree warren had been in the hospital when jimmy was carried into the er and the attending had called him to help try to stabilize woods whose neck had largely been crushed jimmy died under warrens hands as blue as a bruise and paralyzed from the neck down warren had never before showed emotion when he lost patients but as he recounted jimmys death he wiped tears from his eyes he had personally broken the news to jimmys wife whod shown up at the er with their son in tow strangely moved laurel walked to warren and hugged him tight but he stiffened and tried to change the subject she held him by force for a moment then went back to the kitchen to finish cooking supper after she put the kids to bed she came downstairs and found warren on the sofa blankly staring at msnbc despite her desire to be with danny she could not find it in her heart to tell warren then that she was leaving him the packed suitcase hidden in her car trunk would have to stay there one more night danny would be upset but they could certainly wait one day she had decided to go take a shower when warren turned to her and said what would you do if i died like that if i was here one day and gone the next out of the blue dont talk like that she replied not wanting him to go any deeper with his morbid musings i think youd be all right financially ive been working on my estate this year thank you for telling me laurel said awkwardly but it would be such a blow to the children i just dont want to think about it warren nodded distantly death is part of life though i see it every day men younger than jimmy die every month in this town children too but its you im thinking about would you be all right would you be able to move on and find a new life dear god laurel closed her eyes almost unable to deceive him a moment longer but that was definitely not the moment to tell him she was leaving warren believed that adultery was a profound betrayal not only of ones spouse but of the entire family the very concept of family and she had never seen him as emotional as he was that night no the breakup conversation would definitely have to wait im going to take a shower she said helplessly wondering why warren had decided to unburden himself on this night of all others he never had before and that was one of the roots of their marital problemsmaybe even the taproot flustered and angry she checked her clone phone in the bathroom and found a text message from danny dont tell him ill explain tomorrow they met the next day in the woods near dannys house she arrived to find danny pacing back and forth in the little glade looking as though he hadnt slept at all she asked if hed told starlette last night then immediately launched into her own explanation of why she hadnt told warren shed expected danny to get angry but instead he looked relieved in a subdued voice he told her hed decided he couldnt divorce starlette after all the reason was as simple as his son hed already talked to a lawyer and the lawyer had confirmed the bleak visitation picture painted by starlette laurel knew that starlette was capable of following through on her threats the irony was that dannys best chance of convincing a judge that he was michaels primary caregiver was laurel herself but her testimony would be useless if she was exposed as his paramour a fact that even a semiprofessional investigation would probably uncover eleven months of dreams had vanished in a span of seconds she had given danny everything or almost everything and shed promised him the rest yet he was rejecting her he had a valid reason yes but it still seemed unfair how could all his promises evaporate in the face of his wifes selfishness laurel had waited thirtyfive years for true love and having found it was she doomed to watch it float away like smoke she felt as though fate were mocking her showing her what was possible and then snatching it away at the last moment and what about the previous night what if she had told warren she was leaving him only to learn that danny had chickened out talk about jumping out of a plane without a parachute when danny tried to hug her she shoved him away if she couldnt have everything shed decided she wanted nothing a creak in the hallway made her tense and the bike lock constricted around her throat then the guest room door opened as slowly as a door in a horror movie warren looked down at her with eyes every bit as wild as those of an ax murderer he had a stack of boxes in his arms and these he dumped right on top of laurel when she flinched to avoid injury the cable lock cut off her airflow i cant breathe sounds like a personal problem warren said sitting on the edge of the bed with apparent disgust let me know how it comes out laurel twisted her neck enough to get some air but the terror generated by her need for oxygen overrode almost everything else she dug her fingers under the cable and held it out just enough to take a long sweet breath i knew i was right warren said for a while you had me doubting the letter too it didnt sound like kyle but you never know what somebodys really like youre a perfect example of that my pussyhound partner turns out to be a closet romantic and my wife a lying whore he clucked his tongue you learn something every day right laurel had no idea why warren was back on the auster kick it must have something to do with the boxes how are the kids she asked what did you tell them mommys having a migraine laurel tried to guess every possible effect of this explanation theyre very worried about you warren said with false concern theyve promised not to make one little peep or to come downstairs if they need something theyll call me from the upstairs extension she nodded thankfully at least they wouldnt see her in this condition or be anywhere near warrens gun he opened one of the boxes and pulled out what looked like an accounting ledger bound in red faux leather at first i figured you were storing these for kyle but thats not it is it laurel shrugged warily i dont even know what that is you never give up do you i can understand why you know whats likely to happen dont you he held out the ledger this is some kind of duplicate set of books for the office only it shows all sorts of payments that never made it onto our tax returns cash payments i guess and there are codes beside certain patients names codes ive never seen before god only knows what they mean god and kyle anyway he gave her a pointed look and you right laurel risked cutting off her air to shake her head youre not just storing this stuff as a favor the reason i know that is because i found these he held up a stack of what looked like stock certificates bound with a tight paper band bearer bonds two hundred thousand dollars worth if im doing my conversion correctly laurel blinked in confusion these are just like cash warren said totally liquid you have them you own them theyre illegal in the us now but these conveniently were issued by a guatemalan company ive never seen those before warren i dont even know what they are he laughed thats odd dont you think theyre hidden in our house and ive never seen them before if you didnt hide them how did they get here the bond fairy santa claus kyle must have hidden them here hes setting you up for something youre right about that and youre helping him laurel knew there was no point but she shook her head anyway warren reached out and closed his hand around her windpipe stop denying it laurel stop lying and maybejust maybeyoull live through this tell me what you want what do you want me to do he pursed his lips i want to know how you feel when you suck kyles cock do you like knowing fifty women have done it before you or that he just pulled it out of vida an hour before he saw you laurel shut her eyes and began to cry this was what happened when you decided to break the rules she hadnt wanted any of this but her acts had made it all happen by reaching for dannys love she had drawn this nightmare around herself she had put her childrens lives at risk god forgive me she thought you like degrading yourself dont you warren said this life we have this perfect lifeyou hate that you need drama dont you you need to feel low it gets you off like that porn in your computer the nasty stuff gets you off it must have something to do with your father the preacher did old tom give you a little private communion after mom went to sleep at night a little wine and romance baptists drink grape juice at communion warren barked a laugh thats in public in private they do it all dont they crying was making her throat swell and that made it still harder to breathe please take this off my neck she gasped i really cant breathe i will take it off he said smiling strangely you know why because youre about to make a phone call who am i going to call kyle of course kyle what do you want me to say warren thought about it for a moment you want an afternoon quickie youre horny you cant go another minute without it laurel couldnt believe his words you were watching your porn but its not enough use your imagination im sure hes fucked you right in our bed and loved every second of it as much because of me as you probably warren left the guest room then quickly returned with two cordless handsets he must have the phones hidden somewhere she thought laurel lay still as he unlocked the cable loosened it a little and then to her horror shut the lock again he had no intention of releasing her from this torture device she watched him dial a number on one of the handsets then hold the phone up to her face he put his head against hers crushing the phone between so that he wouldnt miss a word kyle said with his other hand he stuck his pistol against her ribs when austers cell phone rang he assumed it was vida returning his call to her cell but the lcd said warren shields auster breathed a heavy sigh of relief though he wasnt sure why talking to shields should calm him down maybe because they were both in the same boat even if shields didnt understand how leaky the boat was warren he answered where are you man kyle said a female voice that auster thought might belong to his girlfriend but then he decided against it this woman sounded more mature this is kyle whos this laurel laurel shields what the hell laurel whats going on nothing ive been thinking about you thats all auster sputtered in confusion you have mmhm what about me you know what weve been doing together what weve been doing yes you know ah im a little confused laurel i like your tone but why dont you help me out here i want you to come over and fuck me now the kids have a birthday party and theyre not here now auster was stunned speechless i want you to do me the way you did the last time can you handle that the last time laurelthis is some kind of joke right like candid camera or something punkd or whatever no joke kyle you know me better than that what i know is that ive dropped hints for years and youve kept me at arms length the whole time whats changed there was a long pause during which auster sensed a hand pressed over the mouthpiece on laurels end hed downed several shots of diaka but through the vodkagenerated fog it struck him that since warren had not come in to work today he might be home now he might even be on the phone with laurel though auster couldnt imagine what they might be playing at kyle laurel said plaintively im here what do you think dont you want me to suck you off auster was about to hang up when a new scenario struck him what if warren had been cheating on his wife god knew hed been acting screwy for the past couple of months longer really if he was cheating on laurel and shed found out about it maybe she was out for a little revenge this wasnt the best time for itwith biegler on the way it would be insanitybut hed had his eye on her for a long time laurel shields was a thoroughbred she made his latest girlfriend look like a plow horse despite shannons being ten years younger than laurel and vida roberts like something destined for the glue factory laurel had class and there was nothing better than a woman with class looking in the gutter for revenge ahi cant say i would turn that down what do you have in mind just drive over here pull into the garage and ill be waiting for you bring some viagra with you i need a serious workout the mention of viagra pushed back the fog a little then he thought he heard another voice heavily muffled what about warren babe where is he warrens not at work he never came in today huh i dont know then and i dont care i know what i want auster felt his sluggish blood pumping faster dont worry about warren laurel said he never comes home during the day maybe hes playing golf auster closed his eyes and forced himself to think beyond the moment biegler was driving hell for leather from jackson to shut down the office vida would be getting back any second yes nailing laurel seemed like the ideal escape from all that but what it really amounted to was professional suicide he would have to walk away this time for once in his life he would leave money sitting on the table i sure appreciate the offer he said but i have to pass laurel theres just too much going on and i keep thinking of something my daddy taught me early on whats that dont shit where you eat she gave a feminine snort of contempt youve broken that rule too many times to count yeah i know but warrens my partner maybe ive finally learned something be careful honey youre too sweet to waste it you know he hung up before his darker instincts could betray him warren slammed the phone against the guest room wall laurel cringed but hope was surging through her she had been sexually explicit as warren had instructed but that strategy had backfired as she had known it would the more forward she was the more confused kyle was bound to be her only worry had been that he would ignore the absurdity of her offer and accept it on the outside chance of getting sex from a delusional woman he had certainly lusted after her long enough at one drunken christmas party kyle had confessed that he often thought about laurel while having sex with other women shed shoved him away but what more could she do how could she prove hed said something like that the only upside of this unsavory history was that kyle knew her well enough to know shed never be the pursuer even if she decided she wanted him i told you someone was messing with your head she said softly kyle had no idea what i was talking about do you believe me now youve got some kind of code warren shouted something you say if im around or something you dont say thats it isnt it a kafkaesque dread descended in her soul warrenthe kids please keep your voice down she took a deep breath then spoke with utter sincerity if you dont believe what you heard with your own ears i dont know what i can do the only place ive ever cheated on you is inside your head are these in my head he cried snatching up a bundle of bearer bonds i cant explain those she said with conviction but im not involved with kyle auster in any way ill take a lie detector test if you want warren was staring at the bonds not at her think she said use that big brain of yours who could have told you where to find this stuff except the person who put it there maybe thats how it is he said slowly maybe when kyle dumped you you kept his money for revenge maybe hes trying to get back at you like this thats crazy she cried causing the lock to jerk taut against her throat think of the risks and hed never get his money back maybe its his wife then emailing me i mean shed damn sure have a reason to get back at him you think kyle would tell his wife about hidden money come on i dont know but i guess you do im just guessing for gods sake just like you all i care about are those two children upstairs theyre going to know somethings wrong pretty soon if they dont already warren gave her the same odd smile as before you dont have enough faith in them theyre fine whatever i tell them theyll believe they trust me laurel they know who protects them they know who takes care of them she thought youre right about one thing today theres something bad going on around you but youre wrong about me being part of it look how kyle reacted just then i offered the man a blow job and he said no does that sound like kyle auster to you warren picked up the red ledger he seemed to be trying to stare a hole through it laurel said you need to forget about whos screwing who and ask kyle about this financial stuff before something really bad happens she heard a bump upstairs then another the kids were still up there maybe i will warren said staring at the other phone maybe i will auster was swigging from the diaka bottle again when his office door opened and vida swept in the way his mother used to when hed misbehaved as a boy she shut the door behind her then stood before his desk with a look so harsh that all his glib opening lines fled his brain are you drunk she asked vidawere in trouble bad trouble her expression didnt change you just figured that out sherlock auster studied the bleachblond harpy standing with her arms crossed over her chest and wondered why hed ever gotten involved with her he could hardly bear to look at her anymore much less give her what she wanted after hours worse he sensed that she didnt even want the sex herself it was simply a tool in her campaign to protect herself from a world that had always been less than kind to her whats happened now she asked i got a phone call while you were gone from who biegler again no evans up at the capital and auster blew out a lungful of air he said paul bieglers driving down from jackson to padlock the office now as we speak this shook vida from her pose shock pinned her painted eyelids back for several seconds but then her features went hard again let me guess when you had biegler on the phone you got up on your hind legs and roared like a drunk frat boy you cant keep that ego reined in can you i bet hes ready to put you under the jail auster nodded in despair and i dont see what we can do besides sic him on warren and hope hes content with that vida gaped as though auster had suggested driving into a brick wall at sixty miles per hour listen to me doctor youre as crooked as a barrel of fishhooks but when it comes to actually committing a crime youre about as smart as a barrel of hair the mystery is how you made it through medical school they must have had a lot of lady professors up there thats all i can figure vida damn it kyle blaming shields depended on a lowkey investigation and things falling just right on sanitizing this office of anything and everything that could contradict our version of things losing a lot of records and most of all on our special patients keeping their goddamn mouths shut but were not near ready yet she dug a cigarette out of her back pocket lit it and began puffing furiously i wish you wouldnt do that shut the fuck up kyle im thinking the only way we could dump this thing in shieldss lap now is if he shot himself in the head with the evidence in his house then wed be the only ones left to tell what happened other than the patients theyd be expensive but what about the records shut up im trying to keep your ass out of jail he reached into his bottom drawer for the vodka vida watched him take a slug with obvious contempt then she blew out a long stream of smoke and said i know what youre up to mister youve got some hightoned slut on the side stashed and waiting for you to bug out with her i dont know who she is but i will in about twenty seconds because youre going to tell me auster reached for the bottle again but vida lashed out with her hand and knocked it off his desk the precious fluid gurgled onto the carpet dont sit there gasping like a landed fish tell me who she is vida i wouldnt cheat on you jesus wept whoever she is the slut is out of your life as of this moment in exchange im going to save you the indignity of nightly anal sex in parchman farm where you most definitely would not be the top shannon jensen auster whispered with the sound of a deflating balloon vidas eyes flashed with fury and disbelief the drug rep from jackson he nodded shes only twentythree before auster could reply vida said of course shes only twentythree young enough to buy into your bullshit and throw her life away before its begun god youre a prick that smug little sorority princess prancing up these halls with a corncob up her buttjesus vida was turning pale primal anger was threatening to take over her higher brain functions before she could wind up again auster said im sorry im an idiot shes history just tell me what to do vida flattened both hands on his desk and leaned over the charts lying there ive got half a mind to let biegler clean your clock for you i could turn states evidence send you to parchman for twenty years and walk away rich they give rewards for that kind of evidence now monetary rewards id be getting a massage in cabo while youd be doing research on whether size really does matter or not auster felt dizzy vida dont lose sight of whats i could do that she went on as though he hadnt spoken but im not i dont want nell getting in any kind of trouble how can you prevent that by getting us all out clean her eyes drilled into him like twin xray beams i just need to know two things bub what one that youre done with that sorority slut auster nodded eagerly and make the call kyle what call to shannon who else but bieglers on the way i cant think of a better time make it short and not so sweet auster took out his cell phone and speeddialed shannon jensen she answered with a husky tone mmm i wasnt expecting this im on the road between oxford and tupelo and its lonely auster banished phone sex from his mind shannon i need to tell you something what her alert business voice had come online i have some bad news honey itsits not going to work out like we thought its just too complicated here my marriage i mean i have to end it you and me i mean shannon gasped but he pushed on before she could gather herself you deserve a lot better than me you know that i know youll bounce back like nothing ever happened the girl was screaming now and sobbing but the only word he could make out was why he started to embellish his excuse but vida leaned closer and gave him his cue line youre in love with someone else she whispered auster closed his eyes say it vida commanded im in love with someone else shannon oh my god shannon cried someone besides your wife thats right i dont believe you tell her who vida ordered its vida he said in desolation from up front shes always been the one even when we were together vida whispered auster grimaced but he had no alternative even when we were together i was with her the line was dead he prayed shannon had hung up before she heard the last of it there vida said with supreme satisfaction doesnt that feel better he forced himself to nod i was telling the truth you have always been the one i justyou know me she made it so easy and youre embarrassing yourself vida leaned back and put her hands on her hips like a drill sergeant are you ready to do what you have to do to save us he nodded can you grow a freaking backbone for five minutes absolutely okay i want you to drive over to dr shieldss house and get the stuff you planted there this stunned him what do you mean get it retrieve it take it out of the safe room and drive it to where i tell you but why we need it to disappear forget blaming warren we need everything in that house to disappear the second set of books the coded records everything most of all the bonds biegler may have frozen your business accounts by now maybe even the personals jesus do you understand yes but what if warrens at home he didnt come in today which is pretty strange andoh god what vida asked her eyes narrowed what if warren is working with biegler vida thought about this for a few seconds then dismissed the idea with a shake of her head no hed never admit to the things hes done not even for a big reward his reputation means everything to him he might do it to stay out of jail i dont think hes at risk of going to jail not really even if they threw the book at him he could plead out were the ones who could go to jail but ill tell you theres something weird going on with our warren for five years hes a boy scout then he walks in and says he needs money big money and he starts breaking rules left and right it doesnt add up theres something fishy about that life insurance he got last year too i dont know what but i know warrens not about to start cooperating with the feds he hates the government and in his eyes hes got more to lose than any of us okay auster said calming a little but if hes at home i cant just waltz into his safe room and start carting stuff out hell freak out screw him okay this is life or death kyle if you have to go in with your key grab the stuff and get out you know the code whatever he says or does humor him but get that shit out of there tell him the fbi planted it there or just ignore him shields wont hit you or anything hes not the type not unless you were fucking his wife or something vida froze her eyes boring into austers youre not are you hell no she returned his gaze without the slightest bit of faith if youre not its only because she wouldnt touch you with three sets of gloves on thats what you think you know laurel all right vida chuckled yes i do way too much class for you he was surprised by how deeply this assertion stung what will you be doing while im at warrens vida sat on the edge of his desk and looked at him with a strange light in her eyes burning this office to the ground a bolt of terror went through him what burning you heard me its the only way kyle and weve only got a few minutes to do it biegler and his guys are probably driving ninety miles an hour from jackson which makes it about an eightyfiveminute trip auster felt sick but theyve probably got somebody watching the office too to make sure we dont try to cart the files and computers out of here theyll follow me when i leave he thought aloud she nodded they will if they recognize you how could they not she smiled wait here sixty seconds later vida walked in with some threadbare pants a polyester work shirt and a green john deere cap whered you get those he asked mr chaney hes lying on the xray table in a paper gown i think hes getting a good trade myself and so will he your pants and buttondown together probably cost three hundred bucks she tossed the clothes into austers lap i doubt theyd take these rags at the goodwill a reek of bo rose from his lap they stink lifes rough get changed doc do i take my own car sure you do chunkhead vida dug into her jeans and brought out a jingling key ring mr chaney drives a black chevy pickup itll be in the front lot if were lucky bieglers spy will be watching your jag in the employees lot change clothes damn it auster removed his buttersoft charles tyrwhitt pinpoint and folded it carefully on his desk then he raised the stained work shirt and slid an arm into it ugh he grunted wrinkling his nose is this the only way vida gave him a blue steel stare youd better believe it dont you dare give chaney the keys to my jag forget the jag and forget your cell phone dont use it for anything unless i tell you to thats why i didnt answer your call before austers mind filled with images of his office burning a black column of smoke bringing all the doctors and nurses out of the hospital three blocks away ill tell you one thing buster vida said youre gonna owe me after this for a very long time auster nodded in surrender but he knew vida wouldnt buy it her father had been a pathological liar and she saw all men as reflections of him sometimes he wondered if she was far wrong chapter nell sat at the reception desk and tried to look like a normal person but inside she was a wreck in the last few minutes the office had gone crazy vida was acting like some sort of secret agent and a few minutes ago a strange man had shambled past in the hall coming from the direction of dr austers office then an old man in xray had started yelling that someone had stolen his clothes janel was looking for dr auster and couldnt find him and vida had told nell to hold down the front while she took care of some necessities when nell asked what was going on vida had leaned close and whispered give me five minutes hon then ill tell you what to do that was five minutes longer than nell could stand but shed gritted her teeth and tried to look calm then dr shields called and her legs turned to jelly i need to speak with kyle he said in a stiff voice i dont think hes here dr shields nell said nervously what kind of answer is that either he is or he isnt umthats all i know at this point listen if that son of a bitch is trying to avoid me you tell him i said to get his ass on the phone nell sat blinking in the wake of dr shieldss profanity from warren shields a curse word in the office was like an explosion dr shields she ventured tentatively yes can i tell you something what she lowered her voice to a whisper im the one whos been emailing you silence nell was suddenly sure shed made a mistake but then dr shields said you emailed me to look in my safe room thats right buthow did you know what was in there i didnt i still dont but i knew it was dangerous my sister told me about it i was trying to help you i mean i am trying to you did help me nell look do you know anything about a letter a love letter written in green ink she thought back over all the papers she had seen in the past few days no sir nothing like that there was a long pause whats going on up there today nell blinked away tears being able to talk to dr shields directly was more relief than she could stand things are out of control i think some kind of agents from jackson may be on their way here because of all the stuff dr auster and my sister have been doing you know what im talking about im afraid so i havent been a hundred percent perfect in my life nell said but i never meant to hurt anybody and i know you didnt andi just dont want anything to happen to you you dont deserve that dr shields im going to be fine dont worry about me i dont know youre too trusting and you sure cant trust dr auster not a lick listen if i hang up all of a sudden its because vidas come in ill do whatever i can to help you but youd better not call back here not with those agents coming you just do whatever you think is right you can count on me to back you up dr shields didnt speak for several seconds then he said nell i need to ask you something hurry is kyle having an affair wellyes sir with my sister i know that im talking about with someone else nell wasnt sure she should say more but she didnt want to hold anything back from dr shields it might hurt him in some way i did hear dr auster on the phone with somebody two days ago i think hes planning to run off with somebody new who she sensed a sudden urgency in dr shieldss voice i dont know are you sure dont hold back to spare my feelings this comment confused her why should dr austers affair hurt his feelings i really dont but youd better vidas cheap heels were clacking down the corridor sorry i have to go nell set the phone in its cradle and began typing entries on a blue cross insurance claim patients still calling vida asked walking in with two stuffed walgreens bags what do you think its like a tidal wave without dr shields here you just keep blowing them off honey and it doesnt matter what you tell them say were gone to the nascar races this shop is closing for good nell stared openmouthed at her sister vida gave back her i meant what i said look then began opening the file cabinets against the back wall laurel watched warrens face as he hung up the phone he had looked puzzled while he was talking but now he wore an expression she couldnt begin to read that was nell roberts she asked he didnt answer nell is the one whos been sending you emails apparently shes worried about me laurel had met nell a few times but only in passing a pretty girl in her late twenties she looked as if shed come from a different family than her putative older sister how could nell possibly know anything about me warren seemed to be working something out in his head through vida i guess vidas got a vested interest in protecting her relationship with kyle laurel saw where this was going warren dont try to bend things around to fit your preconceptions look at the facts you obviously didnt even know who was telling you this stuff what if nell has an ulterior motive herself like what maybe shes in love with you thats ridiculous why shes young and single and youre a handsome doctor her boss im not going to listen to that crap nell is the only good person in that whole snake pit she doesnt even belong there she can be a good person and still do notsogood things and anybody can be mistaken about things they see or hear warren raised his eyebrows well shes apparently heard that kyle is planning to run away with someone a new girlfriend she said and that seems to square with the two hundred grand in bonds hidden in our safe room guatemalan bonds huh were you planning to take our children with you laurel suddenly realized that reason would never get her out of this no matter what facts surfaced warren would find a way to fit them into his betrayal scenario listen to me im not going to discuss kyle anymore i havent had sex with him i dont even like him and i cant answer any of your questions i dont know what those bonds are doing here or the ledgers or anything else i know nothing okay kyle is your partner and your problem end of story warren looked at his watch for a long time as though calculating the number of hours hed been awake laurel guessed thirtyfour how rational could anyone be after that kind of sleep deprivation he yawned as if trying to swallow his head with his own mouth stretching his arms back until his shoulders popped do you want to see the kids he asked she looked at him in disbelief youre going to untie me if you promise to behave can i clean up before they see me you worry too much about your looks we go upstairs as is or forget it laurel wasnt sure she should let the kids see her in her present state but somewhere in the back of her brain simmered a fear that she might not survive this encounter okay with a quick turn of the dials warren opened the bike lock one moment she was a chained prisoner the next she was free free to move at least she was still a prisoner shed expected to be led straight upstairs but he took her arm and walked her back to the great room where her laptop sat clicking on the coffee table interposing himself between laurel and the machine he looked down at the screen to check the progress of the passwordcracking program around his back laurel saw the hotmail login page superimposed in miniature over a background page which showed a graybearded wizard staring wisely up from the screen lightning flashed from the staff in his hand but what held laurels attention was the numerical ticker below the wizard it was seven digits long and the last three digits were increasing almost too fast to see like the digital readout of a gas pump filling a bottomless tank above this a line of asterisks filled the password field of the hotmail login page and a red error message read sign in failed the asterisks and letters appeared to be permanent but as laurel stared she realized that they were blinking so rapidly that she almost could not detect it somehow the cracker program had disabled the feature that kicked people off after ten failed attempts she felt as though a ghostly robot were sitting at her computer trying to break into her email account at the speed of light any minute now warren said glancing around at her nervous she turned away lets go see the kids yes lets do that he led her up the front stairs only letting go of her arm when they reached the top laurel heard the tv blaring through the closed door of the kids playroom she tried to steel herself but she knew she would cry when she saw them she had once burst into tears upon seeing them after a fiveday education seminar in dallas she expected warren to warn her in some way but he simply pocketed his gun opened the door and cried hey hey look whos here laurel heard a scuttling sound to her left but saw nothing there her eyes were drawn to the couch where grant lay sprawled on his back watching the bigscreen tv hed changed his royal blue school uniform shirt for a ripped girl skateboard tshirt and his new balances for adios with stripped black laces on the screen before him tony hawk leaped and spun over the lip of a massive halfpipe which grant never tired of begging warren to build in the backyard hey mom grant said moving his eyes but nothing else hows your headache a little better warren said quickly shes not over it yet wheres your sister over here said a small voice tada beth jumped out from behind the closet door laurel had to cover her mouth to hide the pain that pierced her at the sight beth was wearing the snow white costume laurel had bought her during their last trip to disney world not the cheap onepiece costume but the fullblown ensemble of yellow satin and dark blue velvet with bright red ribbons like the ones in the disney classic beths proud smile and flashing eyes made her look impossibly alive and happy like a character who had leaped out of a movie herself how do i look she asked laurel bit her lip and knelt before her daughter did you put this on all by yourself snow white beth curtsied with elaborate ceremony i helped grant said from the couch no you didnt beth cried grant shrugged he just tied my bow beth explained nothing else riiiight grant drawled shut up butt face grant broke up at this stop provoking her warren snapped then he looked down at beth and you stop saying butt face young lady well he is as grant stifled more laughter laurel hugged her daughter as tightly as she dared mama beths small voice in her ear are you okay im fine now baby i just had to see you i dont want your head to hurt hot tears slid down laurels cheeks she bent her neck and wiped her cheeks on beths cape then she pulled away mama youre hands are all sticky and your mascaras running laurel stuck out her bottom lip and blew air over her face hoping to dry the tears its just my headache darling are you guys all right for food and stuff im hungry grant said can we come down and mikeywave something not yet said warren ill bring something up to you in a minute but first we need to talk a frisson of fear went through laurels chest she turned to warren but he wasnt looking at her he took beths hand and led her over to the sofa where grant lay sit up son he said come on get your behind in gear this is a family conference grant groaned loudly but im starving laurel wanted to bolt from the room she saw now that warren had brought her up here not to ease her mind but to torture her more painfully than he ever could downstairs grant and beth sat side by side on the sofa their upturned faces curious but unworried snow white and a skateboard prince a more innocent pair of angels she could not imagine warren pulled two chairs over in front of the couch and sat facing the kids then motioned for her to join him she couldnt move come here laurel he said this wont take long what is it daddy beth asked did christy poop inside the house again no sweetheart this is more serious than that when laurel refused to move warren shrugged as if to say all right then he turned to the children and said your mother has something to tell you guys so pay close attention he turned to laurel expectantly warren she said evenly i need to speak to you outside he smiled in apparent sympathy moms having a hard time finding the right words kids so ill help while you kids have been going to school and while ive been working hard at the hospital mom has been making a new friend grants eyes narrowed really who is it mom laurel stared at her husband silently begging him not to go on but the hatred in his eyes was unveiled now and it was absolute nothing was going to stop him she thought of grabbing the kids and trying to get out of the room but that would only result in a fight with warren which might scar them even more its a man warren said i dont know who it is yet because mom wont tell me but shes been going to a secret place every day and hugging and kissing this man beths eyes were wide they moved from warren to laurel filled with questions laurel wanted to say thats not true sweetheart but it was true she had been doing exactly what warren was accusing her of doing i know it seems hard to understand warren went on but mamas getting tired of us our family is starting to bore her so shes looking for another one one that might make her happier her childrens faces were moving in ways laurel had never seen before she was witnessing the implosion of innocence and she not warren was responsible though warren was the one talking she felt as if she were holding down her children and hitting them in the face again and again and they could not fight back mama beth said her voice scarcely a whisper is that right are you tired of us laurel realized that her hands were shaking and not just her hands her chin was quivering and her legs were turning to water why are you crying mom grant asked worriedly he no longer looked like a smartaleck teenager but the terrified nineyearold he really was dad whats wrong i dont like this game i dont either son but mom hasnt given us any choice shes already made her decision he waved laurel over to the chair beside him come on honey i want you to explain things to grant and beth as best you can they deserve to know the truth theres no way im staying married after this laurel thought and if danny had left his wife five weeks ago like he said he would i would have faced a scene a lot like this one warren wants me to tell them i had an affair all right ill tell them what i would have told them five weeks ago not that im in love with someone else but that i dont love daddy anymore that should be easy enough i dont love daddy anymore but i love them more than i ever have theyll know im telling the truth about that because that is the truth get over here warren snapped have the courage of your convictions damn it im scared beth whimpered through glistening tears she held out her arms for laurel to pick her up but when laurel moved warren stood and blocked her path dad youre scaring us grant said with surprising force youre scaring mom too that cant be helped son mamas done a very bad thing no beth cried she couldnt do something bad mamas good warren looked as though he might be crying himself i know you believe that elizabeth but im afraid its not true thats one of the hard things about growing upfacing the fact that adults arent all good and your mother is capable of doing some very bad things you two get punished when you do bad things dont you grant nodded reluctantly then mom should too we all have to follow the same rules thats you sorry son of a bitch laurel said under her breath you should be ashamed warren turned to her his eyes red i should be ashamed the shame is all yours today my love did you ever think about these children when you were betraying them did you think about them for five seconds while you stop it beth screamed stopitstopitstopitstopit be quiet elizabeth warren snapped aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh beths earsplitting scream made all other communication impossible warren stood over her as if to make her stop but he was faced with the fact that nothing short of violence could do it and that was likely to provoke even more screamsor worse total silence if laurel could have snatched the gun from his pocket at that moment she might have shot him through the heart she had betrayed her duty to her children yes but nothing justified the psychological torture he was putting them through now and for what for revenge the most useless thing in the world warren you have to stop she said while beth recharged her lungs between screams youve made your point have i he asked scowling over his shoulder beth cut loose with another shriek and this time laurel rushed forward and snatched her up off the sofa ive got you darling ive got you she murmured in beths ear everythings all right now daddy was just telling a story were you asked grant hope in his eyes no son im afraid not and soon were all going to know who moms new friend is something in laurel snapped then she turned far to the left winding up then flung out her right arm and backhanded warren with all the force she could summon the slap resounded through the room leaving total shock in its wake while warren rubbed blood from the end of his nose grant gaped in shock mom just hit you dad he said as though trying to get his mind around what his eyes had just seen she knocked the crap out of you its just a game laurel said gently rocking beth in her arms while warren watched her with madness in his eyes what game is that grant asked austin powers laurel replied grabbing the first suitable image she could find amid the clutter of her popculture memory i think beth needs a nap gentlemen she started to carry beth to her bedroom but warrens right hand slid into the pocket that held his pistol think she said softly think about what youre doing you didnt think youre right i should have laurel stood with her mouth open but no sound emerged the doorbell had just rung the echo of its musical ping was still fading someones at the door grant piped up maybe its ups with my new trucks the bell rang again three times in quick succession nobody move warren said in the voice of a tv cop he went to the dormer window and looked down toward the front entrance of the house who is it asked grant probably some guy wanting to pressurewash the house warren muttered theres a beatup pickup parked at the end of the sidewalk wild hope flashed through her at the thought of dannys old ford pickup jesus christ warren said his whole body tensing at the window what laurel asked her heart beating against her sternum warren turned from the window his face pale with fury its kyle auster ever since talking to dr shields nell had been terrified that he would call back and speak to her sister if he repeated some of the things nell had told him vida would flip out and vida angry was not something anybody wanted to deal with at sixteen shed become too much for even their father but dr shields hadnt called back nor had dr auster reappeared vida kept leaving the reception desk and then coming back the lights in the office had blinked a couple times and once theyd gone off completely for a full minute which kicked the computers into emergencypower mode when nell asked what was going on vida had just put her finger to her lips and smiled now vida returned from one of her little excursions and slid her chair right up to nells she smelled of rubbing alcohol whats going on nell asked im nervous as a cat vida smiled and ran her hand through nells hair the way their mother used to do so pretty so dark and fine vi shhh i want you to get your purse and go home sweetie right now nell drew back in surprise go home now vida nodded things are getting out of hand i dont want you around here for the last act nell felt a surge of concern for her sister whats going to happen nothing too bad i told you there were revenue agents watching the office theres more coming to close us down this evening nell blinked in disbelief close us down yep padlock the building nell shook her head like a child hearing that her parents home was about to be repossessed butare you saying its over everything vida smiled again i wouldnt say that you know i always keep a card or two up my sleeve but the easy parts over with you need to get home throw some clothes in an overnight bagnothing too bigthen go down to the bank and take out your money nells anxiety escalated into outright fear all of it youve got most of the liquid part in your brokerage accounts right with ubs yes just like you told me the government may have frozen those accounts but i doubt it they wouldnt want to tip their hand theyd freeze kyle and warrens money first not ours your real moneys in the house in texas anyway and they cant take that from you thats where you should go withdraw about eight thousand in cash and light out in your car tell the girls at the bank youre buying a used car and the seller wants cash if things get dicey here ill call your cell phone if that happens stop in baton rouge and get on a plane to cancún i dont care what it costs just haul tail south of the border you hear me nell nodded but she was close to crying what about dr shields hes going to be fine baby dont you worry about warren kyles on his way over there now to take out the stuff he planted you promise honey i scared the bejesus out of kyle that stuff is probably already in a dumpster somewhere nell wiped away her tears but more followed i tell you though vida said thoughtfully there may be trouble in paradise what do you mean kyle thinks laurel and warren are having marital problems you think maybe you could be part of the reason for that oh my god no nell protested wishing it were true no way warren stood rigid in the foyer his left hand clutching laurels wrist his right hand holding his gun the doorbell rang again for the sixth time kyle had obviously seen the cars in the driveway and did not intend to go away laurel wondered why warren didnt simply answer the door then she saw why there was a scratching sound in the lock and the bolt turned with a decisive snick he backed her against the wall so that they would be behind the door if it opened the lock in the doorknob turned next then the door opened about twelve inches kyle stuck his head through the crack and looked toward the stairs the barrel of warrens gun touched his temple come on in partner warren said softly nice and easy auster stepped inside with his hands up and his eyes wide if he hadnt stuck his head in first laurel might not have recognized him the noted clotheshorse was wearing garments that looked as if theyd been bought at the salvation army store downtown and he stank what the hell are you wearing warren asked this is my new look kyle said but the fear in his voice killed his attempt at levity warren studied him for a few seconds then said its a disguise isnt it auster nodded his face downcast you decided you wanted that quickie after all hell no auster replied slowly lowering his hands thats not why im here i knew that was a joke youve got a key to our house though huh you gave it to me dont you remember i fed your dog when yall went to the bahamas that time warren thought about this you gave that key back well i had a copy made in case i lost the original you know im always losing my keys i didnt want your kids dog to starve because i cant keep up with anything warren looked at laurel hes a compulsive liar did you know that ive seen him lie to patients drug reps other doctors anybodyeven when he doesnt have to its like an addiction or something kyle wasnt listening his full attention was on the pistol warren manwhats with the gun i want truthful answers this helps it hasnt helped so far laurel thought auster looked at him long and hard no offense buddy but have you lost your mind theres no need for this kind of theatrics were all friends here right i lost my mind the day i went to work for you warren said in a somber voice only i didnt know it come on partner what kind of talk is that straight talk auster held up his hands as though he knew where warren was headed look i dont need a boy scout lecture okay im a lost cause anyway i thought you gave up all that dudley doright stuff last year huh laurel had no idea what kyle was talking about but warren certainly seemed to he looked as though austers words had wounded him deeply she glanced up the staircase to make sure the children hadnt come to the rail to listen warren had warned them to stay in the media room but they were so rattled there was no telling what they might do could we move this to another room she asked i dont want the kids hearing this stuff warren grabbed kyles wrist and dragged him down to the great room kyle was three inches taller than warren but warren was in peak physical condition auster had spent the last twenty years going soft they stood between the fireplace and the rochebobois sectional like two boxers who might close at any moment laurel leaned against the sofa back and glanced over it at her computer terrified that the merlins magic program might have cracked her password while they were upstairs the sony was still clicking away but warren seemed to have forgotten it first you push me to bend the rules warren said then to break them then whoa there dr welby said kyle sure i tried to get you more focused on the bottom line but when you told me to back off i did it was you who came to me that last time remember out of the blue i need to make more money kyle thats what you said and do you remember what you said after that warren had turned to stare out the tall windows there were two rows of them one atop the other and through them laurel saw the pale virginal green of early spring in the budding leaves a hundred yards from the house christy trotted toward the line of trees that marked the creeks ravine her orange coat giving her the appearance of a wellfed fox only the darkening sky kept the picture from being perfect it seemed that mrs elfmans augury of rain might be proved accurate after all you said i dont care how you do it kyle continued just dont tell me about it warren scowled at him i didnt mean for you to i know what you meant brother so i doubled your income and you took the money and here we are thats the way it works laurel stared at warren in amazement she couldnt imagine the words kyle had quoted ever coming from her husbands mouth but apparently they had because warren wasnt arguing the point well have to agree to disagree about that warren said but you going behind my back to screw my wife was definitely not what i asked for auster was clearly stunned but he was a quick study when it came to matters sexual and laurel could see him working out the particulars of the current situation her strange telephone comeon the gun all of it you really hate me dont you warren said hate you warren i love you brother youre my hero which is weird since im ten years older than you but youve got to be the most dedicated doctor in this town like a young doc adams on gunsmoke or something you think i hate you warren was studying the maple floor kyle took this moment to risk full eye contact with laurel and the words she read in his face were what the hell is wrong with him it doesnt matter warren said to the floor just tell me what youre doing here what do you think austers eyes kept darting to the gun you didnt show up for work and that was a first we were overrun with patients but i thought id take the first chance to come see how youre doing im sure laurels been taking good care of you i figured shed be at school though warren looked up you figured she was at school when she called and asked you here for a quick fuck i figured shed gone back i mean its after three kyle auster couldnt hide the blood rushing to his cheeks look bro i dont know whats going on over here and i dont want to know you guys are having some marital discord thats cool ive been there everybody has but ive got nothing to do with you guys problems im happy to say warren moved closer to him aiming the gun from his waist im not so sure of that buddy not sure at all why not whats happening at the office kyle nell said there are medicaid agents coming down austers face twisted with exasperation you know the government always interfering they want six sets of paperwork on every patient and they go batshit when you dont give it to them stop lying kyle i know why theyre coming but i have a feeling things are even worse than youve told me what have you been doing besides upcoding nothing man nothing illegal anyway they justthey dont agree with me about the necessity of certain tests on certain patients maybe some procedures too but you know how that is theyre pencil pushers they dont have any sympathy for defensive medicine because nobodys gonna sue their ass if a patient croaks unexpectedly laurel wasnt sure why they were talking about work when warrens primary obsession had been whom she might be sleeping with but it was clear that they were in serious trouble tell me about your girlfriend warren said auster looked perplexed my girlfriend arent you planning to run away with somebody isnt that what you were going to use the bearer bonds for at the mention of bonds kyles mouth hung slack then he gulped and started talking fast so you found that stuff thank god its safe are the ledgers in there too warren nodded slowly good good because that stuffs dangerous man back to your girlfriend auster seemed to have trouble following the change of subject you mean vida no your other girlfriend austers eyes flicked back and forth between warren and the gun you mean shannon shannon yeah the drug rep for hoche the one with the tits and the eyes now warren looked confused youve been seeing shannon jensen uhhuh how old is she twentythree jesus whats the big deal shes legal everybody asks that thats not who im asking about kyle who then come on man we dont have all day here warren tilted his head toward laurel auster held out his hands like a rustler about to be hanged by angry ranchers brother i dont know where you got this idea but you are wrong way wrong what exactly have i got wrong this whole idea is ridiculous laurel wouldnt touch me with a tenfoot pole kyle looked at her with complete confidence would you no i wouldnt i think ive always made that clear auster turned to warren and held up his palms in apology i wont say i never squeezed her ass at the hospital christmas party okay but thats just vodka talking i do that because shes hot and because i know it gets to her and because nothings going to come of it man you dont really think id try to snake your wife thats nothing but trouble for me im gonna lose a productive partner over some tail no way not in my dna warrens eyes flickered with a glow laurel couldnt read that kind of challenge is the cornerstone of your dna kyle but laurel is more than the usual compulsive conquest youve always been jealous of me the way patients talk about me the fact that so many of them request me specifically even the scores i made on my boards you know youll never beat me at those things so what do you do you go after laurel maybe shes my weakness right if you can screw my wife and make her come all will be right with the world thats how your mind works austers face fairly shone with disbelief jesus pal you need to get a life or a psychiatrist i dont even try to compete with guys like you except in income thats where i show my stuff medic for hire thats me i leave the doctors without borders shtick to you guys what are those bonds doing in my house warren asked doggedly something changed in kyle then the boyish facade fell away and a weary man appeared from behind it we needed a storage room thats all a safe one we vida and me it was her idea who was going to search your house you know the medicaid fraud unit i imagine warren said thats why im here today is the day of reckoning partner i came here to remove the threat to get you and your family out of harms way so why dont you let me do what i came to do then you two can continue your little têteàtête laurel surprised herself by speaking what exactly is going on here what have you two been doing at work ask him said warren but you dont have to do you you already know youre playacting just like he is damn it laurel said would you get over it already i dont know anything and im sick of being in the dark what kind of trouble have you geniuses gotten us into warren turned back to auster she has a secret hotmail account and she refuses to give me the password i have a special program working to crack it if your name doesnt pop up as her secret pen pal then you can go rather than calming auster down these words sent him into apoplexy are you shitting me that could take all night the cops could be here in five minutes with handcuffs despite kyles panic warren remained unmoved then youre out of luck unless the program finishes before then kyle turned on laurel give him the fucking password warrens eyes flashed with interest give it to him goddamn it auster screamed this is my life here and mine you bastard and the life of someone i actually love i dont even know the password she said warrens gone paranoid warren was watching auster trying to judge whether he was sincere or not without a word warren walked around to the coffee table picked up dannys letter then came back and held it out to auster if youre bored heres some reading material to pass the time kyle took the letter like someone forced to accept literature from a hare krishna he scanned it quickly then looked from laurel to warren you know i didnt write this crap partner do i all that hokey cantlivewithoutyou stuff are you kidding you of all people should know i couldnt even make that up my love letters read like something out of the penthouse forum maybe they did until you fell for my wife auster was turning purple he had the face of an innocent man being dragged bodily into prison besides warren went on ive recently discovered that my blushing bride might be a fan of the penthouse forum shes a closet porn addict this is insane laurel muttered with sudden defiance kyle shook dannys letter under warrens nose this isnt my handwriting kemo sabe its not even close do you know whose it is how could i its block print it could be anybodys or nobodys i dont know any grown men who write this way i think somebodys messing with you and you dont have time for that right now look around you man youre married to one of the greatest women ever youve got two fine kids get past this high school bullshit and think about what really matters being free to raise your children not stuck in a cell somewhere laurel found herself nodding amazingly when the shit hit the fan it was auster who had his priorities in line whereas warren seemed lost kyle dropped the letter on the floor and stared hard into warrens eyes you want the truth buddy listen up we were going to let you take the fall vida and me thats why the bonds and the ledgers are here but its all happening too fast the only way out for any of us now is to get rid of all the evidence everything asap those ledgers have to go and the bonds have to disappear his pragmatic tone broke through warrens sarcastic front and how do you suggest we manage that warren asked we go down to the creek behind your house and have a little bonfire then ill take the bonds somewhere safe warren laughed as a favor to me right youll take that two hundred thousand off my hands do you want the bonds for yourself is that what this is about i want to know what theyre really doing here kyle spoke as he might to a child i just told you i planted them here last weekwith the ledgersso that youd take the fall for whats been going on at the office thats it end of story when warren didnt respond kyle turned to laurel what the fuck is wrong with this guy he wont take yes for an answer kyle tapped warren on the shoulder you want my secrets i was screwing shannon jensen okay midlife crisis maximus but vida caught me so i ditched her but your wife was nowhere in my plans kyle glanced at laurel then pushed on his voice ragged with fear were standing on the edge of a cliff partner you wouldnt believe the penalties they have now im talking fifty years in prison and millions of dollars in fines tens of millions thats buried so deep youll never get another chance at life weve got to take care of each other now contempt chilled warrens eyes like youve taken care of me all along kyle groaned in frustration buddymost of the time life is every man for himself but sometimes we all have to pull together we have to hang together or well all hang separately right ben franklin said that the circumstances were rather different yeah well the sentiments the same come on bro dont be a sucker but i am thats what ive always been warren pursed his lips his gaze far away laurel tried to read his face but her old systems of spousal interpretation were no longer reliable she had no idea how this new version of warren reasoned he looked from kyle to her like a man trying to judge the lesser of two evils the computer will decide he said finally thats the only thing i can trust if youre not laurels email buddy you can go auster stared at his junior partner for several seconds youre crazy if you think im staying here im not spending my last good years in prison because your wife is poking somebody else youll just have to shoot me he turned and started walking toward the foyer which probably meant the safe room warren raised his pistol and cocked it with a loud click its your choice auster took two more steps then he stopped and looked back his face sagging under the strain laurel saw a wet glint in his eyes youre committing suicide kyle said okay fine but why make me do it with you because were partners warren replied smiling with irony we share everything right chapter nell was standing in line for a teller at the planters bank when a blast of precognition so strong it made her dizzy hit her she didnt know what to call it foreboding esp the heebiejeebies whatever she just knew in her heart that something was dreadfully wrong at the office something about vidas manner had rattled her to the bone but without her quite realizing it it was a delayed reaction like somebody dying in the night from a blow to the head during the day vida was too calm the situation was unraveling yet she was walking around and joking like a jaded undertaker at a funeral nell hurried out to her car drove down the frontage road and crossed highway onto audubon boulevard then she turned into the employee parking lot which was practically deserted except for dr austers jaguar and vidas old pontiac she ran to the back door of the office which was locked and bolted she let herself in with her key then moved quietly into the hall the door to exam room six was partly open she saw stockinged feet sticking off the examining table so there were still patients here but she saw no staff whatever as she passed xray she looked in but sherry wasnt at her counter same in the lab no sign of janel and the lights were off the bloodchemistry machines were still running though a cold chill raced the length of her body and her shoulders jerked as though a static charge had suddenly left her the building seemed alien to her as though she had entered an office that looked like the one where she worked but was not some of the office buildings near the hospital were almost identical but not this one dr austers building had a hipped roof and dormers unlike the modern boxes with flat tar roofs standing in front of the hospital suddenly nell understood the reason for her anxiety the computers were silent she had never been inside the office when the computers were shut off it seemed a different place without their steady reassuring hum the machines gave the building a sense of being alive whereas now the whole place seemed dead the clinic had always smelled of rubbing alcohol but as nell neared the reception area its biting odor became overpowering and there was something else in the air too something even more volatile gasoline she rounded the arch that led to reception and saw vida leaning over an open file drawer vida was pouring something into the drawer right onto the papers it was alcohol nell realized rubbing alcohol from one of the brown push bottles they used in the exam rooms twenty other file drawers stood open to various lengths vi she said softly vida jerked erect and whirled but relaxed when she saw it was only her sister what are you doing nell asked tcb honey in a flash like elvis always said what vida laughed taking care of business in a flash i forget how much younger you are sometimes not that much nell said very afraid and not quite sure why a lifetime baby girl i thought i told you to clear out i had a bad feeling like i get sometimes you know vida looked down at the file drawer and sighed nell scanned the room and what she saw sent her to the edge of panic empty alcohol bottles were all over the room most stood in a row on the floor by her computer but some lay atop the file drawers a red metal gas can stood right beneath vidas desktop if someone lit a match in here they would all die in a giant fireball why are you doing this nell asked no other way vida opened another bottle of alcohol and dumped its contents into a drawer full of patient records were having a fire sale everything must go no exceptions her laughter had a hysterical edge that scared nell is this why you went to the store today mmhm we didnt have enough alcohol but they had loads of it at walgreens i had to sneak it in inside an old dell computer box the medicaid people have somebody watching the back door theyre waiting for their pit bull to get here pit bull vidas humor evaporated you need to go baby now buthow can you light this stuff without killing yourself vidas smile was cagey i go down to the switch box and shut off the main breaker then i come back here and plug the computers and copiers back in one more trip down the hall flip the breaker on and boom gone with the wind how do you know about this kind of stuff i had a boyfriend who did insurance jobs torch jobs you know remember randy nell vaguely remembered a scrawny unshaven cajun of indeterminate age but we dont have time for nothing fancy vida said with regret you do the best you can with what you got nell stepped farther into the room there are still patients in the back vida i saw somebody on the way in just a couple ill take them out with me vida tossed the empty bottle on the floor a heroic rescue will make it look more like an accident as if anything could but we try wheres everybody else i sent them home told them wed had a computer crash and couldnt keep up with billing or insurance they were out of here like a shot and dr auster hes getting that stuff out of warrens house like i promised he would nell felt a warm rush of gratitude viwhy dont we just get out of here youve got money squirreled away i know you do lets both go down to cancún we could rent a condo by the month and just figure out what to do next vida smiled dreamily at this fantasy id love to sweetie but i cant ive put in with kyle and im going to stick by him all the way if we get through clean hell have to stick by me nell closed her eyes nearly overcome with sadness but he wont vi you know he wont as soon as hes sure youve saved him hell find some other girl somebody younger who doesnt know what a jerk he is vidas smile stretched so tight that nell thought it would crack at the corners then it changed to a grimace nell heard a mans voice behind her she turned a blackhaired man wearing a gray suit stood in the hall door he looked like a lawyer or maybe an fbi manwhat they looked like on tv anyway afternoon ladies he said in a deep yankeesounding voice wheres dr auster gone said vida weve been having some trouble with our computers i think he mightve gone to radioshack for some parts the newcomers eyes roamed over the computers and open file drawers he must have seen the alcohol bottles but he didnt mention them ladies id like you to walk slowly toward me and step out of the room i want to talk to you for a few minutes nothing serious please dont make any sudden movements on your way out were all in grave danger at this moment vida looked back at him with an almost playful smile you think just step away from the wall ms roberts and please join me in the hall vida almost preened like a cat being petted in some perverse way nell knew it gratified her sister that they knew her by name are you biegler vida asked thats right the pit bull with a tick up his ass biegler signaled to someone out of sight down the hall i havent heard that one but i wouldnt doubt they say that about me he looked at nell would you step into the hall miss nell felt the mans voice pulling her toward him it was so calm and reasonable he seemed nothing like a pit bull more like a good steady labrador nell moved slowly toward him her eyes imploring vida to follow but vida would not be led nell realized that her sister must have noted long before she did that biegler wasnt holding a gun and that even if he were carrying one he could not use it for fear of setting off the bomb that the fumefilled room had become you want to take me to jail dont you mr biegler vida said in a challenging voice that depends if youll cooperate with us in trying to achieve a just resolution you might be able to avoid punishment altogether vida laughed harshly you mean if i squeal on kyle auster youll give me a getoutofjailfree card biegler sighed and backed deeper into the hall something like that it depends on exactly what your role in all this has been nell saw something change in her sisters eyes then vida murmured run baby girl run nell screamed but vida was already reaching into her pocket she took out her cigarette lighter a blue bic and held up her thumb strong arms seized nell and dragged her toward the door someone charged up brandishing a gun and then a muted roar sucked the air from nells lungs laurel sat crosslegged on the floor behind the couch watching kyle auster warren had forced his senior partner to sit on the hearth with his back against the marble fireplace warren himself was pacing the great room and periodically checking the progress of merlins magic on the laptop thankfully the children had not appeared laurel figured warrens bizarre behavior upstairs had frightened them enough to keep them out of sight until someone else came for them it hurt laurels heart to think of beth terrified but grant would comfort her he happily picked on his sister every day but if anything truly hurt or upset her he immediately went into a protective mode laurel felt a strange kinship with kyle after all they both wanted the same thing short term escape beyond that auster was trying to keep both himself and warren out of jail which made sense to her but warren seemed to be in the grip of some sort of guilt reaction to whatever had been going on at the office he was like a killer who wanted to be caught conversation had dropped to nothing and auster appeared resigned to being stuck where he was yet something told laurel he was only acting twice she had seen him wipe tears from his cheeks warren must have seen this too but when he deigned to look at his partner his face held only disgust laurel tried to stay ready for anything even a futile escape attempt by auster might give her a chance to smash the sony against the floor or even to get the kids out of the house may i say something warren kyle asked in a shaky voice if you must all your life youve done the right thing all your life youve been the golden boy but this past year youve done some things you dont feel good about things you probably never thought youd do laurel watched her husband trying to judge the effect of these words your reasons are your own business kyle went on but right now youre overcome with guilt you think youre about to be exposed ruined youre going to lose the respect of all those patients who think youre albert schweitzer so what do you do try to pull the whole house down around you before that happens you want to show the world that nobodys more disgusted with warren shields than dr shields himself auster laughed ruefully partner i know about selfdisgust and i know about confession i can tell you from experience it doesnt help the soul one bit youll feel better for about five seconds then youll pay for the rest of your life and if you keep doing what youre doing now all those bad things youre dreading will come true patients wont ever look at you the same way again you may even lose your right to practice medicine is that what you want when warren refused to acknowledge him kyle gestured at laurel look at your wife youre browbeating her trying to make her confess that she fooled around with somebody well what if she did whose fault is that you want to feel bad ask yourself that laurels a good woman a beautiful woman and if shes looking somewhere else for love then you havent been taking care of business at home warrens eyes ticked up from the computer but kyle pressed on if she confessed right now and gave you what you think you wantall the dirty detailswhere would you be then fucked thats where nine ways from sunday the two of you would have nowhere to go because youre never going to get over it i know you man warrens eyes smoldered i didnt know youd specialized in psychiatry kyle actually laughed i wouldnt waste my time i already know more about human weakness than most of those cranks ever will i went to school on myself warrens gaze dropped back to the computer i know youre listening to me kyle said stubbornly youre a control freak warren everybody knows it and thats fine most of the time good for business but now things are slipping out of control thats how life is okay its in the nature of things entropy whatever and a guy like me when the water starts rising i go with the flow i let the current carry me and i make the necessary adjustments to keep things in proper trim you on the other hand are like a robot optimized to run within a certain set of parameters when life breaks outside those parameters youre lost your programming no longer suits the environment youre like a submarine stranded in the middle of an interstate and partner there is a bigass tractortrailer headed straight for you im trying to drag you out of the way but you just wont let me youre staying where you are because you dont know how to move whats your point warren said in a monotone just let me do what i need to do and youll have the rest of your life to find out who laurels been kissing behind the barn if thats what you really want but if you go to jail shell be screwing anybody she feels like anytime she wants to because youre not going to be there to service her ill take that chance auster was about to speak again when the telephone rang warren made no move to answer so the machine in the kitchen picked up laurels greeting played and then a panicked womans voice reverberated through the house please pick up dr shields please this is nell from the office everythings gone crazy everything blew up vidas hurt bad she might die hello hello are you there everybody into the kitchen warren shouted bounding for the answering machine he looked back to make sure laurel and kyle were following then stabbed a button on the machine putting it into speakerphone mode nell this is dr shields thank god nell sobbed and then a car horn sounded in the kitchen where are you warren asked a pay phone im scared to go to my apartment i didnt know what to do calm down nell and tell me exactly what happened suddenly everything tumbled out of her in a frantic rush vida tried to burn the patient records at the office the computers too she lit everything off with me and agent biegler in the room with her everything just exploded gas alcohol they almost didnt get the fire out the whole building could have gone up kyle had gone pale he leaned over to warrens ear and whispered ask her if the records were destroyed warren angrily shoved him away wheres vida now nell the icu at st raphaels i havent seen her since the explosion i called the hospital and a nurse told me theyre going to fly her to the burn center in greenville if they can get her stable what should i do dr shields while nell talked laurel had been studying warrens pocket the one that held his gun the butt had sunk completely out of sight but she wondered whether she might be able to get it out with a quick grab should she call kyles attention to it kyle was stronger but then his hand was bigger he might not be able to get it into the pocket before warren flattened him she considered grabbing a pot from a cabinet and trying to hit warren over the head but something stopped her maybe it was nells story which was obviously affecting him deeply or maybe it was her memory of the attack with the can of beans which hadnt worked out so well you mentioned an agent biegler warren said he didnt try to arrest you when the fire blew up something hit him one of his men said i was arrested but they didnt have handcuffs or anything i dont really get it because i was closer to the explosion biegler was trying to save me but nell sobbed once then went on something knocked him down and then this other guy came charging in but he was trying to take care of his boss there was so much smokeand blood i tried to get vi up but she was knocked out andshes burned really bad thirddegree for sure oh god slow down nell take your time when i saw that vida couldnt move i crawled into the hall for some air then i just kept crawling and suddenly i was outside when i realized i was by myself i started running the fire engines were coming then i shouldnt have left vi but i was so scared dr shields its all right anybody would have done the same where are you now not far from the office should i turn myself in or what auster shook his head violently do you think you can get downtown warren asked i think i can get a ride maybe okay go to my lawyers office on bank street don billings is his name tell him i sent you to him and he can call me to verify tell him i said id pay all your bills kyle was gaping now what should i tell him nell asked what should i say and not say once youre with billings hes your attorney dont waste time trying to protect kyle or me youre the important one youve got your whole life in front of you kyle looked as if he were about to stroke out but he was obviously afraid to speak on a line that might be tapped i wouldnt lift a finger to help dr auster nell said that cheating bastard screwed my sister over so badi hate him i know what you mean warren said looking back at his partner dont worry kyles going to get what he deserves before this is over don billings nell repeated her voice shaky bank street thats right everythings going to be all right nell thank you so much dr shields i knew youd help me goodbye nell be careful warren hung up and confronted auster who was backing toward the foyer did you tell vida to burn our records hell no you know vida she spearheaded every scam i ever tried up there she told me this afternoon that the records had to disappear but thats all man shes the one who told me to come over here and get the bonds and ledgers she even put these damn rags on me lets talk about vida and nell for a minute we dont have a minute kyle cried his face blotched red you heard nell they arrested her you can bet your ass they have warrants out for you and me bieglers liable to pull up here any second now that you answered that phone if he does so be it what i dont care if i go to jail so long as i go knowing the truth the truth about what warren turned on his heel and walked back down to the great room laurel knew he was going to check the sony again she said a silent prayer that the program hadnt cracked her password then grabbed kyles stinking shirt and pulled him close he changed the code for the safe room but it doesnt matter the bonds and ledgers are on the guest room bed go auster was already moving but he looked over his shoulder and whispered what about you ive got to get my kids out as laurel started for the stairs she saw a blur in the corner of her left eye that might be warren moving she sprinted up to the landing but paused when warren screamed put that box down kyle cant do it partner auster replied let me pass laurel peered over the rail of the landing kyle stood in the hall below just within her sight while warren waited at the intersection of the hall and the foyer blocking his exit they were separated by less than ten feet with warrens pistol pointed at the box covering austers belly move aside warren kyle said with surprising force im not your problem put the bonds down warren repeated right now laurel wanted to continue up the stairs but if one step creaked warren would hear her she waited without breathing terrified that kyle would try to bluster his way past warren to the door after about five seconds kyle sighed then bent and set the box on the floor at least laurel got away he said stunned warren looked around in panic then up the staircase as laurels eyes met his she sensed movement just beyond him incredibly kyle now held a gun in his hand a small nickelplated automatic laurel stared in amazement as he aimed at warrens chest silently urging him to pull the trigger then she heard herself scream a warning warren watch out warren ducked left as kyle fired the sound like a solitary firecracker a red flower bloomed high on warrens shoulder and then his gun boomed twice in reply auster dropped like a sack laurel stood frozen above this surreal tableau until a drumroll sounded overhead grant and beth suddenly appeared above her looking down from the secondfloor rail mom what happened grant cried in alarm are you okay beths face was nearly bloodless her eyes round and white im scared mama she whimpered come get me a groan of agony rose from below laurel looked down and saw kyle lying facedown on the floor a pool of blood soaking his lower back he was trying to crawl but only his upper body was moving warren was looking up at laurel and the kids his right hand gripping his left shoulder mama come get me beth wailed mama pleeease warren nodded permission go ill take care of kyle laurel raced up the stairs and swept beth into her arms without even slowing come on she hissed at grant move where are we going grant asked running after her your room they reached the upstairs hall how come we have to get out of here how your tree grants eyes widened but you told me never to climb on that anymore today you get to she darted into grants room and crossed to his righthand window outside the roof sloped steeply down to a gnarled mass of oak branches already thick with spring leaves there was a tree house in the oak and from its platform a zipline ran forty meters into the backyard where it terminated over a sand pit a few weeks ago grant had learned that he could sneak out of his window slide down the roof and climb down to his tree house using the high branches of the oak laurel had forbidden this dangerous activity but that was before her husband went nuts the only question now was could a sixyearold girl do what a nineyearold boy could laurel was betting she could with her mothers help she knelt and looked beth in the eyes grants going first okay then you and me mama i cant beth said in a shaky voice its way too high lets use the stairs we cant honey bun daddy might see us whats wrong with dad grant asked why is he acting psycho daddys sick honey he doesnt know what hes doing right now we need to get away from him just for a little while ready grant pumped his fist spiderman time laurel flipped a latch and raised the window to her horror their home security system chimed in response warren must have set the chime only moments ago because it hadnt rung when kyle opened the front door hurry she urged go grant climbed quickly though the window and started down the slope of the roof using both his hands and feet then laurel crawled through keeping one hand on beth who was crying in terror come on baby she said reaching back into the bedroom were going to be fine she was pulling beth up to the sill when warrens feet came pounding along the hall laurel snatched beth through the opening banging the childs head on the window frame beth shrieked in pain but laurel didnt stop moving she set her daughter firmly on her lap meaning to skid down the steep shingled slope on her behind then warren snatched her hair and tried to drag her back through the window laurel screamed for him to let go but he only pulled harder a chunk of hair ripped out by the roots shed lose every strand on her head to get beth out of danger beth squirmed around on laurels lap probably to get better purchase on her mothers chest laurel had thrown back one hand to jerk warrens hand free but she needed that hand to hold beth fast youre going to make her fall laurel screamed let go warrens other hand caught laurel just under the chin and began hauling her into the open window she couldnt even draw breath if she didnt stop fighting she might black out and drop beth with tears of frustration in her eyes she went limp as she waited for warren to let go she prayed that grant had made his escape and not waited for his mother and sister grant warren shouted get your tail back up here boy the oak limbs shook as though a huge raccoon were moving in the tree below then grants feet hit the floor of the tree house with a bang im talking to you son you do not want to make your father angry the hand loosened slightly at her throat pass her up to me warren ordered come on laurel did as he lifted beth through the window laurel saw a saucersize bloodstain above his left collarbone the bullet clipped my trapezius warren said noticing her gaze its nothing as if you care she turned away fighting a mad impulse to scramble down the roof to the safety of the oak tree then a whir like the worlds biggest fishing reel sounded from below laurel looked to her right and saw grant sailing away from the house like a commando in a pow rescue movie he was kicking his feet to make the wheel mechanism speed along the zipline she felt like cheering out loud warren cursed in fury and something dark moved behind her leaning back she saw his gun come up and steady in his hand as if to fire at grants receding form she knocked the gun aside and scrabbled onto her knees facing warren in the window like an angry mother wildcat she was spitting mad her skin as hot and itchy as if electricity were crackling along it point that gun at him again she snarled and ill claw your eyeballs out i swear to god i will grant hit the sand clean and started sprinting without even a hitch in his rhythm compared to doing a off a halfpipe it was nothing he looked over his shoulder as he ran and saw his father silhouetted in the window of his bedroom staring silently after him while his mother waved from the roof to keep running the sight scared him more than anything had in a long time he ran toward the creek first because it was downhill but then he cut left and started making for the elfmans house as he did christy broke out of the trees below and raced to catch him elated to have someone to run with the corgi circled grant as he ran smiling as she always did all he could think was that he needed to get to a telephone he wasnt sure whom to call and he had no idea what to tell mrs elfman my dads sick my mom needs help he swerved around some azaleas and kept pumping toward the elfmans he could see mrs elfman herself standing in her backyard by the pool wearing a big flowery dress it looked like shed already seen him a second later her yardman appeared beside her grant liked george a lot better than mrs elfman he was glad george was there grant figured he must look pretty scared because a second later george started running toward him and even mrs elfman started walking fast in his direction he was scared too he wasnt sure what was wrong with his father but he knew his mom was terrified hed never seen her face so white or her hands shaking and hed sure never seen her wallop his dad in the face but what scared grant most of all was what hed seen in the tv room upstairs it was hidden in his dads pocket but the outline was plain as day grants throat had been tight ever since he realized what that outline meant and when he heard the shots later theyd come as no surprise whoa there little man george called dropping to his knees so that grant would be eye to eye with him what you running from so fast grant was breathing so hard that he couldnt talk by the time he found his voice mrs elfman was coming up she took his hand and looked down at him with all the kindness in the world whats wrong grant shields you have to tell us if were going to help you did some little boy blow his finger off i heard firecrackers over there grant shook his head trying not to cry its my dad he panted my dads sick sick how asked george did he grab his arm or his chest is he awake grant pointed at his own temple hes sick up here he doesnt know what hes doing hes got a gun and i think he shot somebody my mom tried to get us out but only i got away dear lord in heaven mrs elfman exclaimed you poor child run call the sheriff george double quick tell him to bring every man hes got chapter danny mcdavitt was sitting on the elevated deck at the athens point airport drinking a lukewarm schaefer and listening to marilyn stone give him an informal legal assessment of his custody situation no alcohol was sold on the premises but a mechanic friend had come up with a cold sixpack for danny he and marilyn had been talking for over an hour but he was in no hurry to get home the only other thing on his mind was what might be happening with laurel but hed checked his cell phone a dozen times and shed sent no text messages bottom line said marilyn starlette can get physical custody of michael and she can probably limit you to minimum visitation every other weekend it all depends on the judge but she will not be able to institutionalize michael if youre willing to take him on no judge is going to warehouse a specialneeds kid when theres a parent ready and willing to take on that responsibility danny nodded every other weekends not good enough michael needs oneonone attention all the time marilyn was obviously sympathetic what about his teacher laurel shields would make one hell of a witness for us if shed get up and tell the truth about starlette danny sipped his beer but said nothing he was trying not to think about laurel after marilyn landed the cessna he had broken down and sent laurel a third text message this one an almost panicked plea to alert him as soon as the encounter with warren was over but she still had not answered whats the problem there marilyn asked you dont think laurel would do it she probably would ill have to talk to her about it you do that every day counts danny he forced a smile i sure appreciate you taking this time oh i expect a free lesson in return ill make it two ones enough hows starlette acting now you dont want to know bitch city running up my credit cards like the germans are about to roll into paris sop for a woman who thinks her husbands about to dump her you need to get out while you can take your chances danny was about to reply when his legitimate cell phone rang he checked the lcd and saw that the call was from the sheriffs department excuse me i need to take this marilyn turned up her schaefer and drank it off with an unladylike gurgle danny mcdavitt he said major mcdavitt this is dispatch ive been told that the sheriff needs the aerial unit to pick him up at lake st john you know where that is i do lake st john was a popular recreation spot forty miles up the river when are we talking about carol now sir now whats going on radio silence on this one danny no specifics on cell phones either youre the pilot on the board jims in las vegas with his wife for his anniversary how soon can you get to the airport im at the airport now good i called mr markle already they should be getting the aerial unit ready now the unit danny almost laughed but something in her voice stopped him this is a real emergency yes sir whats the sheriff doing at lake st john fishing ill give you his gps coordinates once youre airborne danny didnt want to spend his afternoon searching the river for some lost fisherman when laurel might need him but there were only two chopper pilots and if jim redmond was out of town then danny had no way out of the duty roger that he said in a tone of surrender call me back in ten minutes with the coordinates whats the emergency asked marilyn our illustrious sheriff wants a chopper ride back from lake st john hes tired of fishing are you serious nah said danny getting to his feet its probably somebody lost on the water unless one of the sheriffs campaign contributors sprained an ankle wakeboarding marilyn laughed that sounds like the billy ray ellis i remember from high school youre not that old i know she winked i was a ninthgrader when billy ray was a senior he was the cats meow back then big football star all the girls after him of course it was mostly white boys then different game youd better believe it i think its safe to say billy was elected sheriff on his high school rep and his status in the baptist church marilyn said in an arch tone politics the same everywhere hes okay actually ive known a lot worse in ranking uniforms the lawyer nodded thoughtfully we should do this more i agree if youd hire me we could dannys smile faded im thinking about it by the time danny reached the hangar the mechanics had rolled out the sheriffs department helicopter and prepped her for flight she was a bell b eight years old but still in good shape white with blue and gold stripes and a big gold star painted on the fuselage the machines hed flown in the air force were five times this size and infinitely more sophisticated but the bell handled well in the air a kite compared to the massive predators he once flew a pave low iv could carry twentyfour fully equipped commandos into battle the bell had two seats up front and room for one passenger and a stretcher in back not much else how goes it danny boy called dick burleigh the silverhaired chief mechanic ready to crank and bank burleigh had served as crew chief on a huey with the first air cav in vietnam after surviving the ia drang and a shau valleys hed moved to baton rouge and serviced news choppers for thirty years at sixtysomething burleigh decided to retire to athens point where he started filling in at the airport for kicks pretty soon he was running the maintenance department for danny he was a godsend you tell me dick he said hows she running hot as a preachers daughter danny laughed and shook hands with burleigh then nodded to a blond kid in coveralls trailing behind him lets forget about those beers huh guys burleigh smiled long as youre okay to fly major danny gave the old crew chief a salute my inviolable rule is dont drink and fly however one night in the caribbean i had to go up and chase down a bolivian drug boat with half a bottle of tequila in me long story but we knocked down ninety keys of marching powder that night you get to keep any of it asked the kid his eyes twinkling danny chuckled nah but there were reports of confiscated reefer weighing in a little light after some of those takedowns mps never got to the bottom of it either you take her easy major said burleigh his smile gone winds getting up and you got thunderheads blowing in from the northwest thats the way im headed too maybe the sheriff ought to drive back to town he could make it in the time it takes you to fly both ways no danny thought billy ray likes the chopper too much for that im just an old rotorhead chief i live to serve have a good one the mechanic winked and opened the bells door danny climbed into the right seat fastened his harness cinched it tight and hit the starter then he put on his headset and ran the preflight checklist he didnt miss having to put on his helmet nightvision goggles body armor or any of the other gear required to fly the pave low compared to his military flying this was like barnstorming in the s when the main rotor system hit rpm danny felt the chopper reach neutral buoyancy he pulled up on the collective which put the bell into a low hover after trimming the ship with his left foot pedal he lightly touched the cyclic and tilted the rotor disk forward a few moments later the bird gained translational lift and launched herself into the sky at that moment dannys cell phone vibrated he applied friction to the collective and let go long enough to grab the phone from his pocket assuming that laurel had finally texted him back to his surprise he found himself holding his legitimate phone instead the bell drifted a little as he flipped it open the new message was from the sheriffs department dispatcher there were only four words in the text box code blackthird degree dannys ass puckered as he stared at the coded message code black meant a hostage situation third degree meant loss of life with visions of columbine and virginia tech in his head he twisted the throttle pushed the chopper to knots and stormed toward the thunderheads rolling down from the northwest kyle auster was dead laurel saw his body lying on the hall floor when she followed warren down the stairs with beth in her arms she buried her daughters face between her breasts then looked over the rail kyle lay faceup with his eyes open as still as a human body could be his absurd shirt was hiked up to his nipples warren must have done that while working on him how strange she thought to shoot a man and then immediately try to save him despite warrens two shots she saw only one wound at the midline above austers navel but below his heart dark blood covered his pale belly matting the hair that so many gullible women had lain against in adultery did you call she asked from the landing warren had already reached the ground floor no point he died before you came upstairs no but he was slipping away fast i think the bullet hit his spine he couldnt move his legs it must have clipped his descending aorta as well because he seemed to be bleeding out internally what a shot you are she said bitterly warren was looking down at the body he shot first you saw it such a waste i canti guess i cant really believe it mommy i cant breathe beth said laurel turned her daughters head but kept her facing away from the rail beth hadnt spoken since the events on the roof she only sucked her thumb and lay glassyeyed against laurels chest cover him up with something laurel said you do it let me have beth youre not touching this child warren looked up his jaw set hard dont think anything has changed kyle is dead because of a choice he made every choice has consequences yours included who the hell do you think you are god get over yourself you just shot a man this insanity is over come downstairs into the kitchen laurel shielded beths eyes and walked down to the foyer then followed warren to the kitchen beth was a lot heavier than shed been only a year ago laurels back and shoulders were already aching while warren stared out the kitchen window she took a glass down from the cabinet what are you doing he asked still looking out over the front lawn getting her some water shes tired out no actually shes not shes traumatized by what you did upstairs probably scarred permanently what is wrong with you give her a teaspoon of benadryl is that your professional advice drug our daughter to sleep warren rolled his eyes this will be a lot less traumatic for her if she sleeps through it laurels stomach tightened what will dont worry about it she can sleep in the safe room laurel felt as though she were having a conversation with a robot warren you just killed your business partner your office almost burned to the ground your employee tried to kill a federal agent dont you realize the police will be here any minute thats why she needs to be in the safe room laurel whispered youre not putting our daughter into that room alone shed be terrified shed also be safe bullets cant penetrate an inch of steel plate a bolt of alarm shot through laurel despite her fatigue do you seriously intend to hold us hostage inside a ring of armed men at last warrens face betrayed some emotion this is our house laurel my house my land i expect the police to respect our rights and leave us alone to deal with our own family problems she closed her eyes trying to blot out his face long enough to think but it was impossible the enormity of what had happened finally sank into her soul and the floodgates opened as she cried she experienced an epiphany that revealed the road to freedom the password to that road was a lie but unlike the lies of omission she had been telling for the past year she was going to have to sell this story at least kyle wont have died for nothing she thought in death he was going to do her a service he could never have done in life she carried beth to the builtin banquette in the corner of the kitchen beth tried to cling to her but laurel set her firmly on the seat and rubbed her forehead for half a minute warren she said straightening up and putting her hands on her hips i cant let you put beth at risk like this im going to tell you what you want to know but first ive got to know that youll bring this insanity to an end i dont care what you do to me but youve got to let beth leave the house hearing resolve in her voice he looked away from the window and focused on her do you really think beth is in danger from me youre the one who put our children at risk if you tell me the truth the real truth you might be surprised by how things turn out laurel tried to read his meaning but it was impossible send beth outside first as a sign of good faith then ill tell you he smiled sadly i cant do that you havent proved yourself worthy of trust shes in no danger he took a step toward laurel tell me she realized then that he wasnt holding the gun was it still in one of his pockets im waiting he said she pictured the awful scene upstairs when he had told the kids she was having an affair that was sufficient to bring more tears to her eyes it was kyle okay she said softly i saw him for almost a year warrens eyes narrowed and he moved closer close enough to hit her kyle you were having an affair with kyle she nodded i didnt love him but i wanted to hurt you i knew that would hurt you more than anything else if i cheapened myself like that warren moved closer close enough to kiss you made love with him no i fucked him warren flinched she expected a blow any second and you knew about the other women about vida the nurses laurel nodded that was part of it i think did kyle love you she was about to say no but then she thought of dannys letter he thought he did kyle was crazy hed never had anyone like me before he said he would give up all the others if i would run away with him but i didnt want that i just wanted to make you realize what you were doing to me how you were ignoring me warren tilted his head to the right like a scientist studying an animal in the midst of some curious act youre lying he said at length you dont know the truth when you hear it if kyle was the one who wrote that letter you would have let him shoot me but you didnt you warned me of course i did i didnt love kyle i love you besides youre the father of my children warren shook his head youre lying now kyle could have smashed your laptop while i ran to answer the kitchen phone but he didnt he didnt care about that hotmail account at all i could have done the same thing no i was watching you and you did try once kyle never did he even screamed at you to tell me the password he didnt care about your computer because he knew it was no threat to him she searched her mind for some rational argument but there was none youre still trying to protect someone warren said his voice low and dangerous who is it he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her violently tell me who he is daddy stop it beth screeched youre hurting mama moms fine warren said stopping his assault but not taking his eyes from laurels face if you were really having an affair with kyle you can answer one simple question for me her stomach rolled over kyle had a unique feature below the waist what was it she lowered her voice im not going to discuss another mans genitals with you in front of our daughter lets go to the great room then laurel closed her eyes as though disgusted but she was thinking desperately you dont know warren whispered because youve never seen kylespackage but she had seen it once a couple of years ago at a halloween party that lasted into the wee hours a few drunken guests had peeled off their costumes and leaped into their hosts heated pool naturally one of them was kyle hed been standing behind a plastic cubicle that served as a changing room out of warrens line of sight but well within laurels after stripping off his pants hed turned toward her long enough for her to take in his full nudity then hed burst into the open and dived into the steaming water laurel had a clear memory of the event but no matter how hard she focused she saw nothing but a normal middleaged penis of average size times up warren said you lose theres nothing different about him warrens smile was triumphant kyle had hypospadias do you know what that is laurel had heard the word but she couldnt recall what condition it described his urethra opens on the underside of his penis rather than at the tip its fairly common one in three hundred live births and if youd been sleeping with him you would definitely know about it she looked away you can go check his corpse if youre curious no then i repeat tell me who youre trying to protect if you dont the kitchen phone rang loudly warren let go of her glanced at the caller id then walked to the kitchen window and awaaay we go its started now laurel stood on tiptoe over the hedges in front of the window she saw a sheriffs department cruiser parked at the end of their driveway one man inside warren pressed the speakerphone button then came back to the window this is dr shields whos this this is deputy ray breen doctor afternoon ray warren said in a cheerful voice what can i do for you well doc i just drove out to check on some things is that right what things would those be well your wife and daughter for one we heard yall might be having some trouble out this way laurel closed her eyes as breens deep drawl echoed through the house this was why she hadnt called in the beginning no trouble warren said nothing serious anyway there was a long pause then ray breen said well im afraid your boy says different hes over to the neighbors house scared half out of his wits he says maybe you shot somebody warren laughed loudly no no kyle auster and i were cleaning a pistol and it accidentally discharged put a hole in the floor but other than that no harm done this time the pause was longer im glad to hear it doc but id feel a whole lot better if i could just say hey to everybody for a second one at a time if you please warrens tense face gave the lie to his nonchalant voice maybe deputy breen wasnt so dumb after all warren took the phone off speaker picked up the receiver covered the mouthpiece with his palm and whispered to laurel tell him youre fine everythings fine i wont if you dontif you say somethings wrong in here or that i shot kyleyou can bet your life theyll come busting in here with guns blazing and i cant be responsible for what happens after that she wondered if this was true so far shed seen only one car outside but there had to be more and the local cops shed met seemed more likely to use guns than diplomacy to resolve a standoff she nodded once and warren held the phone up to her face deputy breen yes maam can your husband hear me at that moment warren pressed his ear to the receiver no are you all right today yes are you in any danger danger we heard there might have been some gunplay in the house just an accident its all right now and your daughter is she all right oh yes could i talk to her of course warren knelt in front of beth and said say hello to the man beth hes a nice man hello beth said reverting to her usual telephone ritual whats your name shes busy ray warren said standing erect with the phone he listened for a few seconds then said kyles busy right now too uhhuh i understand that look our practice is being audited by the irs right now and were having a pretty tense day going over our books kyle is deep into them with the calculator right now but as soon as hes done ill have him call you laurel couldnt believe what she was hearing in all the time she had known warren she had hardly ever heard him lie now he was spinning out bullshit with the facility of kyle auster as he continued to evade breens questions she thought about what the deputy had said grant had obviously reached a neighbors house probably the elfmans he would be terrified but bonnie elfman would take good care of him listen ray warren said his tone growing testy the thing is im waiting for something in here were running a computer program and were waiting for a certain result once i have that well all come out and visit with you guys for the rest of the evening if you want but this is business ray its important you know what i meanof course you do all right as soon as i have what i need in here were all coming out kyle too absolutely good talking to you too warren hung up jerked the curtains over the kitchen window and turned to laurel with manic energy get some sheets out of the laundry room to cover kyle ill stay with beth laurel started to argue but then she remembered that her clone phone was sitting on the shelf in the laundry room warren was letting her go alone because he knew she wouldnt leave beth inside the house with him ill be right back she said touching beths arm she walked into the pantry which led to the laundry room the door to the garage is bolted warren called in case she had a lapse of maternal judgment she reached up and slid her razr off the detergent shelf her heart leaped when she saw new messages on its lcd screen flipping open the phone she bent over the laundry basket and made rummaging noises among some folded sheets the first message read im not going anywhere ill b close by if u need me i love u so much hope and relief suffused her heart that she felt giddy the second message read saw both cars home what should i do whats the holdup warren called laurel picked up two folded sheets as she read the third message text me the instant u r out of there crazy with worry me too she whispered sliding the phone into her back pocket she carried the sheets out to the kitchen and set them on the granite countertop what now im going to move kyle out of the hall warren said softly youre coming with me i think im going to give beth that benadryl after all laurel murmured if were lucky itll cause shortterm memory loss he frowned and picked up the sheets i need some food we all do ill cook something laurel offered breakfast would be easiest he nodded she looked at beth lying on the banquette would you like an egg with a hat on it beth actually sat up at this suggestion and grits and biscuits and grape jelly tell you what warren said to laurel you do the work with the sheets leave beth with me im going to shut all the blinds then start the food laurel hesitated then nodded in agreement she took the sheets and went down the hall with dannys messages running through her mind she hadnt thought to check the time stamps but he obviously hadnt followed her advice to leave town running simply wasnt in him so where was he now he must have driven by the house at least once she thought or else that was his plane i heard before he knows im here with warren and that combined with me not showing up in the clearing started him worrying but what can he do danny sometimes flew the sheriffs department helicopter and so was fairly tight with the sheriff if hed heard the report of a shooting out here laurel was sure he would find a way to get himself into the loop once that happened it would only be a matter of time before someone came to save her and beth danny would have a tricky job trying to explain his concerns without betraying their affair but she felt sure he could do it she looked down at kyles body his eyes were still open but the opaque irises held no life the dead face already looked more like a wax figure of kyle than the man himself pity rose in her but she knew that her duty was to the living not the dead she thought of texting danny that kyle had been shot but warren might be watching from the end of the hall unfolding one of the sheets she laid it gently over kyles corpse then with considerable effort rolled the body over then she stood and dragged it to the guest room door with the sheet under him kyle slid fairly easily on the polished hardwood getting him over the threshold was harder but she turned away from him grabbed his ankles under her arms as though hitching a cart to a mule and in three great heaves dragged him onto the carpet and clear of the door with the walls of the guest room around her an almost irresistible compulsion to call danny took hold of her as she reached out to close the door warren appeared there with beth in his arms good enough he said keeping beths head turned away we miss you she swallowed hard then followed warren back to the kitchen danny knows i need help she told herself he knows everything he needs to know ive got to keep the phone secret no matter what it might make the difference between life and death you take over warren said pointing at the iron skillet heating on the stove an egg carton and a can of pillsbury biscuits lay beside it im going to check the computer the computer as it had been from the beginning her laptop remained the greatest danger to her at any moment the merlins magic program could give warren access to hundreds of messages from danny love letters embedded digital photos all the stuff shed been insane ever to put on her hard drive all the things someone in love cant live without no worries she said brightly beth and i have got it under control warren seemed about to take beth with him to the great room but then he walked away alone all the doors are bolted he reminded her and i took out the keys thanks for that information laurel replied in a tone that said stop upsetting our daughter dont open the blinds he added and tap the skillet with a fork while im down there just go already he vanished into the great room she clanked the skillet a couple of times then lifted beth onto the counter beside the viking cooktop laurel felt almost drunk with adrenaline a new plan had come to her and she had no time for second thoughts there was risk yes but she was almost certain that she and beth would survive it she cracked four eggs open and dumped them into the skillet with her right hand while holding beths hand with her left daddys not right in the head now punkin she whispered can you tell that beth nodded with wide eyes and whispered daddy lied to that policeman on the phone yes he did i need you to do one thing for me darling one easy thing and then we can go outside where grant and the nice policemen are will you do that for me beth nodded again do you remember where my laptop is down on the coffee table uhhuh where daddy is after daddy comes back up here i want you to take your glass of water down to the great room like youre going to play then i want you to unplug the computer and dump your water into my keyboard beth opened her mouth in shock what pour it right into the keys where the letters are but be sure you unplug it first and dont touch the computer with your hands afterward thats important just dump the water into the keyboard from high above it far away no touching beth blinked several times processing laurels request i can do that but wont daddy be mad hes going to be mad at me not you but thats what we have to do to make all this stop okay beth smiled okay unplug the computer first and dont touch it with your hands i know electricity right laurel smiled with satisfaction then retrieved beths glass from the table by the banquette she knew from experience that it would take a couple of seconds for the water to penetrate the sonys keyboard and unplugging the computer from the wall socket would step it down to battery power rather than the volts coming from the mains the danger of lethal voltage arcing back to beth was almost nonexistent but the probability of frying the computer itself was high as warren came back to the kitchen laurel said any luck with your computer program its coming along he said without looking at her a sevenspace password has seventyeight billion possible combinations even more really depending on how many characters you choose from how interesting he looked at her oddly stay cool she told herself dont get cocky hes going to go ballistic in about two minutes where are you going he asked beth who had been spinning in circles like a ballerina on warrens side of the island but now was walking toward the hall nowhere she said breathlessly im tired of sitting around well we have to sit around awhile longer laurel saw that beth didnt have the water glass in her hand but it was nowhere in sight either she had stashed it somewhere like a good little conspirator probably on the floor laurel needed warren to move to her side of the island she rotated the burner control beneath the eggs to high then turned toward the sink and began loudly washing the bowl shed used to hold the broken eggshells hey warren said hey youre burning them what youre burning the eggs she spun from the sink and let her anger show is your butt nailed to that stool he got up and stalked around the island laurel went back to rinsing the bowl she was turning off the water when a cracking sound came from the great room followed by a screech what the warren looked around anxiously elizabeth he scanned every corner of the kitchen and den then ran for the great room laurel scrambled around the island and went after him where are you warren shouted what are you doing laurel heard a primal scream of fury just before she reached the great room the acrid stink of burned plastic filled her nostrils beth was cowering by the arm of the sofa the empty water glass still in her hand her eyes on to her enraged father warren stood over the silent vaio staring down with mute incomprehension on his face when he looked down at beth she bolted toward laurel tossing the glass aside as she ran she leaped into her mothers arms and laurel backed slowly toward the arch behind her elizabeth warren snapped did your mother tell you to do that no beth shouted stunning laurel i hate that computer its making you crazy warren glared at his daughter like a sea captain staring down a mutinous member of his crew of course i told her to do it laurel said with a calm she did not feel it had to be done im sure you can hire a lawyer to get those emails from the company and thats probably what you should do but this nightmare has to end it has ended im not playing this game anymore he opened his mouth but did not reply then he squeezed his hands into fists which he pressed hard against his temples laurel was starting to believe that she had actually won when he closed the space between them in four quick bounds and backhanded her to the floor beth screamed as they fell chapter deputy carl sims turned right off of highway and drove through the wroughtiron gate into avalon a subdivision he had only seen through the windows of his patrol cruiser carl had grown up in sandy bottom an allblack neighborhood in the river lowlands of lusahatcha county well outside the city limits the only whites who spent any time in sandy bottom were the wellcheckers who operated the oil wells owned by the white businessmen in athens point when carl was a boy pumping units had operated right in peoples yards but few of the residents ever saw a dime of the money that oil generated even if they managed to save enough to buy the land their houses stood on they werent going to get mineral rights with it not in sandy bottom carl drove past several sixthousandsquarefoot houses set deep in the trees then turned onto lyonesse drive and stopped at a makeshift roadblock deputy willie jones had parked his cruiser so that it blocked most of lyonesse and a sawhorse with orange tape on it blocked the rest willie was twentysix four years older than carl but he always treated carl as if they were the same age he walked up to carls jeep cherokee and grinned broadly whats up my brother you off duty huh was not anymore this be some shit dont it willie said with nervous excitement dr shields all barricaded in his house and shit dont make no sense to me carl nodded soberly warren shields had been treating both his mother and father for the past six years and they spoke of him almost reverently or they had until carls mother had her stroke which was what had brought carl back to athens point rather than to atlanta where his girlfriend lived now only carls father could praise dr shields in intelligible words dr shields had spent several hours with carl and his father over the past year advising them on how best to care for eugenia sims and carl had instinctively liked the man shields treated his father with the respect due an older man and he treated carl just as he would anybody else no better or worse carl liked that shields reminded him of doctors hed known in the service truly colorblind and focused on their work you dont think theyll tell you to shoot dr shields do you willie asked his smile suddenly gone i mean not without trying to talk him out first carl shook his head lets hope not willie gave an exaggerated nod is the sheriff here carl asked willie shook his head he fishing over in louisiana they sent major danny up to get him in the helicopter bad luck carl thought whos in charge now willie curled his lips and shook his head you know who they done called out the tru aint they old cowboy ray hisself him and his little brother are up there unloading all their swat shit looks like the fbi at waco or something the tactical response unit was athens points version of a swat team it comprised fifteen officers recruited from both the municipal police and the sheriffs department about half had military experience most in the national guard carl was one of the few who had served in iraq he was the teams designated sniper hey willie crackled joness radio any sign of carl yet willie rolled his eyes at the heavy redneck accent coming from his radio deputy sims just pulled up sir well send him back here were setting up the position and i want to get his input on interlocking angles of fire jesus said carl uhhuh willie agreed has anybody even talked to dr shields yet willie shrugged then his radio crackled again weve set up the command post in the shieldses front yard under a stand of trees tell carl to get his ass up here rickytick you heard the man said willie carl exhaled long and slow trying to prepare himself for the blast of testosterone he would encounter a few hundred yards up the street i hope the sheriff gets here soon willie said you and me both brother carl took his foot off the brake and idled up lyonesse nearly two months since the tru was last called out in that case theyd received a report of a man barricaded in his downtown house with his family what the tru found when it arrived on the scene was quite different a local engineer lying in his bathtub with a homemade bomb in his lap and his family safe outside the tru didnt have a trained hostage negotiator so anybody might wind up talking to the subject depending on circumstances in the engineers case the sheriff had spent two hours talking to him through the bathroom window shielded by the wall a flak jacket and a bulletproof helmet sheriff ellis had less than two years on the job and his last lawenforcement experience had been as an mp in germany twenty years before he was a godfearing man who had a good rapport with people but it hadnt been enough the engineer blew himself up while the sheriff prayed for his immortal soul repainting the bathroom with what had been his insides a millisecond before sheriff ellis was wounded by ricocheting shrapnel that turned out to be a chunk of jawbone carl had watched all this through his x unertl scope from a deer stand hed mounted in a tree in a neighbors yard hed wanted to destroy the bombs works with a bullet but since the device was clutched in the engineers lap he couldnt do it without killing the man the hand holding the detonator was concealed behind the castiron side of the tub so that option was out the only other way to stop the bomb from exploding would have been to fire a round through the engineers brain stem shortcircuiting his nervous system but the rules for bombers were different in mississippi than theyd been in iraqat least when the only people they threatened were themselves carl put the incident out of his mind as he rolled up lyonesse because thinking about it only led him to the incident before that onethe one that had caused friction between him and the sheriff he didnt need to cloud his mind with that right now ahead five cruisers sat parked on the street before a big colonial set fifty meters back from the road mixed among them were civilian vehicles that belonged to the offduty tru men whod been called up carl knew that his tactical commander was anxious but he obeyed the speed limit and slowed for the speed bumps he wanted to give the sheriff every opportunity to arrive before ray breen did something illadvised law enforcement in athens point was a curious thing the police department had jurisdiction over the city and by tradition the sheriffs department took the outlying county but technically the sheriff had jurisdiction over the city as well before both departments had been percent white but gradually the police department came to more closely resemble the city itself which was percent black the county as a whole had a similar percentage but geographically blacks tended to congregate in the city while the outlying county was mostly white this had somehow resulted in an unbroken line of white sheriffs carl figured it was the shape of the voting districts he would have preferred working for the black police chief but the pay and benefits were better in the sheriffs department so hed opted to work in the county most of his fellow tru deputies were white country boys of a type carl knew well the majority were ten to fifteen years older than he and some were over fifty in a town with high unemployment men didnt give up jobs with benefits unless they were pushed outusually after an election but despite the age and background of the men there was an attitude of benign tolerance toward black officers in the unit prejudice still existed but it was an amorphous thing difficult to point at and impossible to prove except in a few cases even the hardcore southernrock nascar types accepted that civil rights reforms were here to stay and they tried to make the best of it beyond this carl was a special case his military record as a sniper gave him an almost magical immunity to prejudice in his experience white country boys were fairly primitive in their social habits creatures of dominance and submission like the hunting dogs hed raised as a boy physical prowess meant a lot the ability to withstand pain meant more but nothing ranked higher in their estimation than combat experience if a man had shed blood in the mud and held his nerve under fire then it didnt make a damn bit of difference what color he wasnot to most of them anyway as a sniper with a nearlegendary number of confirmed kills carl occupied rarefied air in the redneck firmament the fact that he was black had put some of those good old boys in the curious position of almost fawning over a guy they might have tried to kick the shit out of if hed wandered into their neighborhood at night carl parked his cherokee behind the rearmost cruiser and got his rain slicker out of the cargo compartment he decided to leave his rifle case locked in the vehicle the slower things moved the more time there would be for hormones to stabilize and adrenaline to be flushed away he saw the mobile command post over the roofs of the cruisers the camouflagepainted camper trailer had been towed under a small stand of trees and braced with cinder blocks the steady rumble of a generator echoed over the flat ground which meant lights in the trailer if not airconditioning carl reminded himself that he was only a deputy not the ranking member of an autonomous sniperscout unit as he had been in iraq his job when he stepped into the trailer would be to take orders not give them and any advice he offered was likely to be rejected unless it reinforced what his superiors had already decided his biggest worry right now was the breen brothers one of whom was the commander of the tactical response unit subject only to sheriff ellis in a situation like this one the breen brothers looked to have been cut from the same piece of wood they had farmers tans cracked skin and slit eyes that betrayed so much meanness it made people take a step back even when they were out of uniform both were lean and gaunt the younger one trace so much so that carl wondered if hed suffered some nutritional disease like rickets as a child but maybe trace just stayed so pissed off all the time that his anger had begun to consume him ray the elder of the pair was bulkier and had a more open face than his brother despite his cowboy mustache hed served in the army during the lean years after vietnam as an mp like sheriff ellis he was also a weekend warrior like ellis but though rays unit had been called up for bosnia he hadnt seen action there either hed worked as a welder for a while but got fired because he kept getting into fights only when he hired on with the sheriffs department had he found his calling he wore the uniform like a suit of armor and carl could tell that the power of the job was what got ray breen out of bed every morning ray reveled in the hightech equipment of his tactical response unit over the past few years he had somehow scrounged together an arsenal that could adequately supply an urban swat unit the tru had automatic weapons flashbang grenades shaped charges advanced commo gear and nightvision devices in his off hours ray read tom clancy dale brown and larry bond or played rainbow six splinter cell on his sons xbox if carl chanced to meet ray breen in walmart or at a high school football game the commander would squint and give a slight nod as though to say were part of an elite team these civilians know were always on the lookout for trouble ray had pulled carl aside dozens of times to talk shop asking detailed questions about the capabilities of various sniper rifles scopes and nightvision systems but inevitably after all the hardware questions had been answered breen would circle down to the question hed really wanted to ask whats it like to blow some unsuspecting ragheads shit away from a thousand yards carl always answered the same way i tried not to think about that side of it sir it was a job and i focused on the mechanics of it guys like ray breen never grasped the true nature of sniping it was as much about concealment as it was about shooting carl had once spent two days constructing a hide in baghdad then another waiting motionless with his scout to take a single shot that a twelveyearold kid could have made in his backyard in sandy bottom but he didnt blame the tru commander the homeboys hed played ball with at athens point high had asked the same question after they got a couple of beers in them all human beings carl had learned were fascinated with death only those who knew death intimately as he did understood its essential mystery carls eyes tracked a thin form slinking out of the cp trailer trace breen in the vernacular of carls father trace was a skunk lying was mothers milk to him he had no military experience and carl assumed hed ridden his brothers coattails onto the tru as nominal communications officer from scuttlebutt around the department carl had gathered that trace had worked a dozen different jobs before becoming a deputy none of them productive hed been a roustabout at construction sites where materials tended to disappear at night hed sold stereos out of the back of a van most of those stolen too hed worked as a hunting guide poaching alligators at night hed also run dogfights and pursued various other flybynight enterprises that went nowhere even now trace had some kind of cell phone scam going selling disposable phones out of his car carl figured a truckload of the things must have been hijacked over in texas or somewhere hey red cloud trace had caught sight of carl ray wants you in the cp like yesterday you better doubletime it soldier carl let the nickname roll off him he didnt like anyone outside the marine corps using it the local guys only got wind of red cloud after discovering an article about marine snipers in baghdad on the cnn internet archives carl raised his left hand to acknowledge the remark then headed for the command post unlike the other white deputies trace breen made no effort to conceal his dislike of africanamericans if carl passed him alone in a corridor trace would look pointedly at the ceiling or chuckle softly as though amused at the idea of a black man in a deputys uniform if they met in public trace either pretended carl didnt exist or snickered in the ear of whatever trashy blonde happened to be hanging off his arm lately carl had heard rumors that trace might be dabbling in the drug businessspecifically crystal metha trade hed apparently worked at as a teenager carl had already decided that if he picked up concrete information about this activity he would follow wherever it led the sheriff might not want to bust his own deputies but carl figured if he made the arrest billy ray ellis would have no choice but to follow through carl stopped before the trailer door and looked up at the shields house if what the dispatcher had told him was true his mothers softspoken physician was barricaded behind the idyllic facade of that house and he might already have killed someone if shields had done that carl might well be asked to take the man out and soon before darkness fell probably he scanned the northern sky hoping to see danny mcdavitts chopper zooming out of the dark clouds gathering there but he saw nothing the trailer door opened suddenly and carl stood facetoface with ray breen breen wore a dark brown cowboy hat pulled low over his mustached face but it was the flak jacket that startled carl body armor was sop for hostage situations but still carl realized then that deep down he had not quite accepted that dr shields had taken anyone hostage wheres your weapon deputy breen asked in my jeep ray frowned it aint gonna do us any good there is it come on carl we dont have a lot of daylight left eighty minutes carl said less if those clouds come over which it looks like they will breen gave a tight grin and slapped his shoulder i knew you were already thinking get your gear son this is big carl didnt move could i ask you something sir the grin vanished breen sensed resistance and he didnt like it go ahead has anyone talked to dr shields yet yeah me his wife and daughter are in there and probably his partner dr auster i spoke to the wife and kid but i think austers dead why shields wouldnt let me talk to him we know there were shots fired but the kid who got out isnt positive who fired them he thought he saw a man lying on his back in the hall but he was on the secondfloor landing and didnt get a good look carl wondered if this was the best intel they were going to get we think theyre in the main downstairs room now breen went on what they call the great room i talked to the architect and hes bringing a set of plans out here theres big windows facing the backyard but theyre those fancy ones with the blinds built into them between two panes of glass they pretty much wipe out all visibility carl nodded surprised to find himself grateful for this obstacle that aint all breen said there was a fire at dr shieldss office about an hour ago we dont have many details but right now its possible that shields set that fire himself a nurse at the hospital also told me there are some state or federal agents in the er there might be some kind of investigation going on that we dont know about something to do with dr shields carl said nothing none of this made sense to him but then he had few facts to work with for the time being hed have to leave the situation in the lessthanmasterful hands of ray breen and pray that the sheriff got here quick even that prospect made him feel only slightly better the sheriff had been a petroleum land man for much of his life the only thing that might stop sheriff ellis from doing the same thing ray breen would do was fear of a negative reaction from the voters in the next election what gave carl the most comfort was knowing that danny mcdavitt would be sitting beside the sheriff during any negotiations that might happen in the next few minutes get your rifle carl ray said the sheriffs still thirty minutes out the wheels could come off this thing any second yes sir carl said starting back toward his jeep he kept looking northward as he walked more rain was coming he would have known that with a blindfold on carl was a country boy too he could smell rain ten miles away danny crossed the mississippi river just east of lake concordia and dropped out of the rain clouds at five hundred feet this leg of the mississippi was dotted with oxbow lakes and lake st john lay just ahead he flew around the eastern rim of the cshaped lake his eyes tracking the welltrimmed lots that bordered the eastern shore as he neared the midpoint of the sevenmile horseshoe he saw a cluster of brightly colored pavilion tents beside a large cypress lake house a group of men had gathered in a muddy cotton field across the road and they began waving him down when they caught sight of the helicopter danny descended rapidly toward the group then flared at the last moment and touched down softly in the newly planted field a big man wearing a brown uniform and clutching a stetson to his head ran beneath the spinning rotor blades and opened the door on the bells left side billy ray ellis was a big man still muscular at fiftythree with burly forearms covered in black hair despite his limited law enforcement experience he was so popular in the county that hed beaten the incumbent sheriff by twenty percentage points ellis heaved his bulk into the seat beside danny yanked the door shut pulled on the second headset and started talking as he fastened his harness get this baby back in the air danny push her hard as shell go we got a bad situation waiting for us danny pulled pitch and applied power with the collective then nudged the cyclic the bell tilted forward and bit into the sky whats happened the message i got said code black is it a school shooting or something ellis shook his big head do you know dr shields warren shields danny felt as though the bottom had fallen out of the chopper yeah he managed to choke out i taught him to fly last year thats right i forgot well apparently dr shields has barricaded himself inside his residence and hes holding his wife and daughter hostage danny closed his eyes fighting vertigo after several moments of composing himself he opened them again picked out a landmark on the ground and said how do you know that shieldss nineyearold son managed to escape the house and get to a neighbors place jumped off the roof or something its the daughter whos still in the house the boy thinks his daddy shot somebody we dont know who that was yet but it could be shieldss partner kyle auster thats unbelievable breathed danny trying to mask his panic i agree there was also some kind of fire at their medical office a little while ago details are sketchy but some people were hurt bad it may be that shields set the fire i dont know if the mans lost his mind or what i always liked him myself whos on the scene now ray breens assembling the tru as they arrive shit good good ray talked to the wife and little girl on the phone relief flooded through danny like a narcotic but shields wouldnt put dr auster on sounds fishy dont it danny nodded and pushed the engine to its limit as soon as the sheriff got distracted he would take out his clone phone and see whether laurel had managed to send him any messages shields sure has a pretty wife ellis said thoughtfully you know her she teaches my son oh said the sheriff his voice suddenly grave thats right ellis was a deacon in the baptist church and he tended to assume the manner of a pastor when discussing anything he saw as a sad circumstance an autistic son obviously qualified in his book have you heard any rumors of marital problems he asked changing the subject anything like that danny stared stonefaced through the windshield nothing but then i never hear anything like that me either but in my experience when this kind of thing happens theres marriage trouble at the bottom of it does shields have a hot temper no the opposite in fact the departmental radio suddenly crackled to life in dannys headset sheriff this is ray at the command post i got a fella down here claiming to be a government agent and hes causing me all kind of problems ellis picked up the mike and keyed it angrily what kind of government agent an fbi man or what one id says hes a special investigator for the attorney general and another says hes with the state medicaid office names paul biegler says hes down here investigatin dr shields and dr auster for some sort of fraud the sheriff knit his heavy brows in puzzlement is he standing right there ray no sir i got him waitin outside the trailer he claims he was in that fire over at dr austers office claims one of the employees tried to blow the place up hes got bandages on his face and he says he was wounded by shrapnel or something hes got two other boys with him and hes trying to take over the damn scene what repeat that i said biegler says hes got federal warrants for dr shields and dr auster and that makes this a federal case he says if we dont give him tactical command hes going to call the fbi down from jackson to take over danny saw the sheriffs knuckles go white bullshit hes going take over our scene you keep that son of a bitch on ice until i get there you hear yes sir a big tenfour on that how far out are we danny danny scanned the river for landmarks then checked his airspeed twenty minutes tops tell him im almost there now ray and put a man on him let me know if he makes any calls to jackson you got it sheriff out ellis turned to danny what in the sam hill is going on sounds like our good doctors have got themselves into serious trouble it wouldnt surprise me to learn that kyle auster was up to no good but dr shields i just cant see that one me either danny agreed hes a straight arrow i got to think about this you remember what happened with that engineer on milburn street blew hisself all over me without so much as a byyourleave and he was alone in the house if dr shields really has his wife and daughter in there and if hes really shot his partner i might have to send the tru in there hard danny closed his eyes in silent prayer most of elliss deputies had only moderate training and their practical law enforcement experience was limited worse the tru was commanded by a deputy with juvenile delusions of heroism the possibility that those men might make an assault into laurels house with grenades and automatic weapons nauseated him with fear he could not allow that to happen when sheriff ellis settled back in his seat with his thoughts danny let go of the collective and pulled his cell phone out of his pants pocket no new messages nevertheless he flipped open the phone and began keying a message with his left hand the first he sent read on my way there wi sheriff u or bth hurt auster alive if yes condition he started to put the phone away then sent an immediate followup no one knows we have this link tell me all u safely can how w armed he intend imminent harm as danny slid the phone beneath his left leg for easy access sheriff ellis spoke again must be pretty important messages to slow us down for danny gritted his teeth were not going any slower this is like taking your hand off the wheel in a car but leaving your foot on the gas i increased friction on the collective so it stays in place elliss eyes were still on the cell phone problems with taking care of my boy danny lied my wife didnt come home to let the babysitter go on time you cant just call her we dont talk so much these days ellis grunted thats a shame marriage aint easy but you got to stick with it thanks a million dr phil you dont go to church do you dan oh boy not much sheriff not for a while now im not much for group worship i get my quiet time in the woods and in the air i hear you brother but its not the same you know you ought to come see us at first baptist i think youd be surprised not if this is any indication i may give it a try at least talk to reverend cyrus about your marital problems danny cleared his throat and spoke as diffidently as he could sheriff could i offer a little input on the hostage situation absolutely this is one of those situations where theres ten tragic things that could happen and only one good thing youre right sheriff i would think long and hard before i considered sending ray breen and his boys into that house even the people who do that kind of thing for a livingim talking about delta and the sealstheyre hesitant to go into a situation with innocent friendlies in a confined space im not saying anything against ray but if you turn insufficiently trained men loose in a house with automatic weapons god only knows wholl wind up dead the wife the little girl some of our own guys maybe id sure hate to see that and i know you would too ellis was nodding as though in agreement you said a mouthful there a standoffs a tricky thing on the other hand ive got a responsibility to that wife and little girl not to mention this community how would it look if we just stood by while dr shields executed his wife his daughter and his partner that wouldnt say much for my department would it danny tried to hide his true feelings ellis was already as focused on how the drama would play out before the voters as he was on the safety of the people inside the house no youre in a tough position thats a fact and i wouldnt presume to tell you what to do but ellis prompted if it comes down to having to take dr shields out id have carl sims do the shooting from long range you mean yes sir ive seen that boy shoot and hes as good as the snipers in the secret service he could take out shields with zero collateral damage even if the doctor was holding his little girl in his arms he could said the sheriff but will he thats whats on my mind danny cringed inside six months ago sheriff ellis had given carl sims authorization to shoot a young black man who had taken a hostage while robbing a local bank in elliss mind he had given a clear order to kill effective as soon as sims had a clean shot but carl interpreted the order differently and blasted the robbers gun hand into pulp instead danny heard that the sheriff had nearly had a stroke over this and only the media praise hed gotten afterward for his restraint had saved carl simss job instead of getting a pink slip carl got a medal one that probably didnt mean much after the hatful hed received from the marine corps its all fucking politics danny thought even the lifeordeath calls he wanted to beg ellis to at least consult with the fbi in jackson but he knew the sheriff would reflexively reject this idea why because the fbi could have a swat team at the shields house in three hours even if they had to come by road if they used a chopper they could be fully deployed in two and unlike the sheriffs department the bureau had strict rules of engagement for hostage situations written in the wake of waco and ruby ridge they would only assault the shields house as a last resort after all other means of resolution had been exhausted billy ray ellis wanted no such constraints on his decisionmaking short of a written order from the governor he would not hand over tactical command of the scene to a federal agency not in his county some men might see a federal assumption of authority as the ultimate out an ideal way to cover their ass but exfootball stars didnt think that way danny kept his mouth shut figuring he could accomplish more from inside the tent than out of it are you pedal to the metal danny ellis asked tersely were at the vne now sir the what danny pointed at a small gauge in front of the sheriff velocity never exceeded she cant do another knot without burning up the engine okay then just keep her at the redline as the sheriff glanced out at the everdarkening clouds danny checked his phone for text messages there were none carl sims slowly worked his way back to the front of the shields property naturally moving from tree to tree assessing the coverandconcealment potential of each position snipers liked open spaces about as much as deer and rabbits did they would do almost anything to avoid them twelve minutes after hed started he returned to the stand of trees that half hid the trailer serving as the trus tactical command post he needed to take a leak the most sheltered spot was a narrow space between the trees and the rear of the trailer he set his rifle buttfirst on the ground and leaned it against a pine then unzipped his fly and began to urinate against the next tree hed developed this habit as a boy and refined it in iraq pissing against a tree or a wall could be almost silent if you did it right this practice had probably saved his life once in baghdad he was halffinished when he heard voices on the air he quickly zeroed in on the source as a small screened window in the back of the trailer after zipping up he moved toward the opening and peered through it from an off angle ray and trace breen sat hunched over a formica table smoking cigarettes and talking in low voices a pack of camels and a caliber pistol lay between them on a topographic map of the area the smoke was so thick in the trailer that a steady draft of it was being forced through the window beside carls face he had to struggle not to cough hell i wish hed pop off a round in there said ray something shit if he dont were liable to be here all night listening to the sheriff holler through a bullhorn trace nodded and blew out a long stream of blue smoke yep i tell you what else worries me our sharpshooter trace snickered at the word you know what im talking about ray said damn straight that nigger might of killed a bunch of towelheads over in iraq but i dont think hes got the stomach for shootin americans ray was nodding you saw what happened at the bank sheriff told him to take the perp out and what did he do blowed the motherfuckers hand off instead what if he missed a hands a hell of a lot smaller than a head moves a lot more too ray observed that coon can shoot ill give him that but what he cant seem to do is follow orders which is strange in a marine awful strange carl was tempted to shove the barrel of his remington through the window screen and scare the piss out of both breen brothers but he didnt he had been quiet before but now he stood with the snipers stillness a motionless state he equated with absolute zero that condition of coldness in which not even electrons spin around their respective nuclei carl could remain in that state for many hours and had more times than he could remember his respiration and heartbeat slowed until it seemed an age between each an age during which he had almost infinite leisure to pull his trigger without being disturbed by the movement of breath or blood you want to know something trace said something you dont know if you aint told me yet maybe i dont need to know cause lord knows you cant keep a secret i kept this one ray chuckled and took a drag on his cigarette how long you kep it twenty years ray coughed up smoke if this has anything to do with my wife im gonna kill your ass im telling you that right now trace shook his head its about that cocky sumbitch up in the house the doctor shields yep what do you know about him traces eyes smoldered with secret knowledge plenty remember when he kilt that boy in his parents house jimmy birdlow course i do we were just talking about it outside trace nodded well i was there ray sat up at the table what sure was this was back when i was gettin high a lot and jimmy was always gettin high he wanted some dex to stay awake and we didnt have no money we just happened to be over in that neighborhood and the shieldses house was the closest one that didnt have no lights on jimmy figured hed just slip in and grab a tv something he could trade for the pills but the old man must have been awake cause next thing i know im staring in from the back patio at jimmy and mr shields screaming at each other jimmy was trying to explain but the old man wouldnt give him a chance he started yelling how he was going to call the police and the next thing i know jimmy pulls out a gun ray was staring at his younger brother with wide eyes carl blinked slowly then leaned forward so as not to miss a word jimmy wouldna shot him trace asserted he just didnt want the man to call the law why didnt he just run then ray asked he tried to but shieldss daddy tripped him up then he got between jimmy and the door then the mama come in there too wearing her damn housecoat when did shields show up hell i didnt even know he was there till he shot jimmy in the back sumbitch didnt give jimmy no warning or nothing ray leaned back in his chair and silently regarded his brother bastard trace muttered blew jimmys heart out the front of his chest ray shook his head you said jimmy was holding a gun on his daddy he wouldna shot him you think shields knew that jimmy broke in their goddamn house id of shot him too youre lucky he didnt shoot your ass through the window trace shook his head bitterly i tell you one thing if i had a gun that night id of killed that motherfucker dead boy if a bird had your brains hed fly backwards i cant believe you didnt wind up in parchman before your twentyfirst birthday i aint stupid and ill tell you something else i hope that sumbitch tries something up in that fancy house i hope the sheriff sends us in there cause i will blow his shit away no lie for what he done to jimmy jesus trace you need to calm down you said the same exact thing a minute ago ray sucked thoughtfully on his cigarette i dont like him trace insisted people act like hes a damn saint or something you ever see him out at the baseball field sumbitch thinks the rules dont apply to him or his kid neither i forgot said ray shieldss team beat your boys like a drum last spring didnt they cheated us is what they done ray stubbed out his cigarette and stood as best he could in the lowceilinged trailer nobodys called on the radio lets get out there and see if we cant make something happen before billy ray gets here damn straight what about that government man beagle fuck him billy ray aint gonna give him the time of day trace pushed himself up off the table leaving his cigarette burning in the ashtray damn straight like a lizard clinging to the window screen carl watched the two deputies leave the trailer he wasnt sure what if anything to do about what hed heard sheriff ellis wasnt going to change the makeup of the tactical response unit in the middle of a crisis and trace breens presence at a shooting twenty years ago couldnt be corroborated by anyone therefore his motive for revenge could not be proved as for the racist remarks about carl that was just the reality that underlay the veneer of courtesy he encountered every day the president of the united states couldnt change that much less the sheriff of lusahatcha county but ray breen was right about one thing marine sniper carl sims did not intend to kill another living soul unless it was to save a life in clear and present danger he shouldered his remington and walked soundlessly around the trailer to join his fellow deputies chapter danny just beat the storm clouds to athens point he flew low over the city angling along the hills then cutting eastward once hed passed the old sawmill his nerves were jangling but at least he knew laurel was alive five minutes ago trace breen had tried to patch dr shields through to sheriff ellis on the radio the connection had been poor but danny had heard laurels voice when the sheriff asked shields for confirmation that she was all right laurel told ellis that beth was asleep but she fell silent when he asked her about dr auster after shields took back the phone ellis had informed him that he was flying next to the doctors old flight instructor shields asked danny how he was doing and danny said fine the whole conversation had the feel of a family phone call like talking to relatives on vacation in a foreign country the connection died soon after that and when trace called shields back the doctor didnt answer i want you to stay close to me when we land ellis said as they dropped toward the earth im thinking this chopper might make a good diversion if we have to go in hard danny nodded trying to swallow with a mouth devoid of saliva thats the neighborhood isnt it ellis said pointing down to some patches of open grass in the forest below thats it shieldss land is in a bend of larrieus creek danny picked out the serpentine creek and followed it eastward soon he saw the slate blue roof of the shields house nestled in a curve of trees that grew along the waterway damn said ellis theres at least fifty meters of open ground on all sides of that place except that back corner danny pointed through the windshield a broken line of trees marched up from the creeks ravine to the southwest corner of the house that must be where the son got out ellis said they could see the cruisers gathered in front of the house and a roadblock at the entrance of lyonesse drive someone had even put up a red flag as a wind indicator danny noticed on a pole standing in the clear space behind the departments camper trailer theres the command post said ellis set her down danny twenty seconds the sheriff unhooked his harness as danny pulled back on the cyclic and flared in then ellis opened the door and jumped to the ground like macarthur going ashore in the philippines remember stay close he called over his shoulder danny checked his phone for new messages finding none he climbed out and secured the main rotor to the tail boom with the tiedown kit there was liable to be some real wind before he flew out of this place again when he was satisfied he walked over to the command post where a small knot of men had gathered around the sheriff three of them wore dark business suits and one seemed to be getting in the sheriffs face pretty good the aggressive strangers hair was cropped short and it had receded on both sides of his scalp leaving a sharp v of aggression in the middle of his forehead he looked about fortyfive but the flesh of his face was tight with no sagging around the jaws the kind of guy who woke up at am every day to run four miles as soon as danny was close enough to hear he realized that the man in the suit was the agent ray breen had been complaining about paul biegler states rights versus federal authority the sheriff was saying somehow it always seems to come down to that with you people i guess you want to refight the civil war right here agent biegler yankee sumbitch someone muttered i was born in arkansas biegler snapped cutting his eyes at trace breen well i dont have time to debate constitutional issues with you ellis said ive got a crisis to resolve how asked biegler you dont have any intelligence ellis drew himself to his full height you people may think were all dumb down here but we information biegler snapped you dont have any information about your subject intel sheriff ring a bell for a moment ellis was speechless so biegler charged on ive spoken to kyle austers office manager at the hospital shes in critical condition thirddegree burns over forty percent of her body she told me that she and auster were behind the fraud theyve been having an affair for years shields went along with some of it for the past few months but thats all if shields is the good guy in all this said the sheriff then why did he shoot auster maybe auster provoked him or maybe this office managers really been screwing dr shields suggested ellis and shes trying to do whatever she can to protect him biegler shook his head vida roberts has worked in medicine for twenty years sheriff she knew she wasnt going to make it when she talked to me thats a deathbed confession admissible in court elliss face was getting redder by the second so what are you saying we should just pack up and go home let these two fine fellows work things out on their own of course not im saying that if austers still alive youve got two different subjects in there two different psychologies and you dont know whos really controlling things i think austers dead sheriff ellis said with conviction i just talked to dr shields i heard his voice when he said auster couldnt come to the phone youd better be sure ellis gave the agent a patronizing smile well i sure thank you for your brilliant insights sheriff listen now id appreciate it if youd carry your ass about four hundred yards that way ellis gestured back toward the highway with a sweep of his big forearm down past my perimeter i dont want to see you back up here unless youve got something that will give me a tactical advantage in this standoff are we clear bieglers eyes went flat as a sharks and he spoke in a low voice i can federalize this scene sheriff i will bring the fbi down here from jackson this things gonna be over with before you get anybody down here biegler sighed if you think that you dont know much about hostage situations i reckon well see wont we ellis if you fuck this up youll answer to the attorney general and im not talking about the one in mississippi go suck an egg sheriff ellis walked away from the trailer and signaled danny to join him biegler stared after them for a few moments then turned and marched off toward the roadblock trace breen barked a laugh that sumbitch is shakin like a dog shittin a peach pit you sure told his ass ray agreed ellis rounded on his deputies his dark eyes blazing you tru boys have been spending a boatload of my budget on training and equipment well you got till exactly dark to prove youre worth it understood the smiles vanished yessir ray snapped out lets get to it boys danny had to stretch out his legs to stay up with ellis as the sheriff strode down the border of the shieldses front yard where are we headed danny asked neighbors house frank elfmans they got dr shieldss boy over there i think we ought to hear him out ourselves before we shoot anybody dont you danny felt the coiled spring in his chest loosen just a little absolutely laurel lay on her side on the great room sofa her arms and legs once again bound tightly with duct tape warren had taped her ankles first so she had risked slipping the razr from her pocket and sliding it beneath her before he taped her wrists the forty seconds it had taken him to do that were the tensest shed experienced since the ordeal began beth lay sound asleep on the red leather sofa in the study thanks to a sedative dose of benadryl calculated by her father warren himself was sitting at his study desk his large flatpanel computer monitor hid his face from laurel and she was thankful because it allowed her ready access to her cell phone the rochebobois sofa was a modern piece with spare lines and minimal padding on the arms there wasnt much of a crease in which to hide the razr but she had stuffed the phone as deeply as she could into the crack between the arm and the seat leaving only a thin line of exposed metal danny had sent two messages since shed checked the phone in the laundry room the first telling her he was on the way with the sheriff the second asking several questions about the situation inside the house shed sent back a message that read ka dead by w selfdefense me amp b all right now tied up tho more come be patient dannys question as to whether warren intended harm was harder to answer warren had hit her twice after beth shorted out the laptop and hard but he hadnt shot her what he had done was download another copy of merlins magic into his study computer so that he could try to break into her hotmail account online she wasnt too worried about that since she didnt save email messages online there might be one or two of dannys last emails in her online mailbox but she didnt think so even if there were the passwordcracking program had to start again from scratch she was more worried about the safe room after taping laurel up warren had carried his fathers old deer rifle and some plastic trash bags into the safe room his shotgun was presently leaning against his desk in the study hed been quite open about what he was doing announcing that the trash bags could serve as temporary toilets there was already enough food and water in the safe room to last for days if not weeks and the gun was selfexplanatory but he had not tried to move laurel or beth in there she had a feeling that warren saw the safe room as his last resort a final redoubt in the event of a police assault rather than a place to commit some terrible crime his primary goal still seemed to be the discovery of her lovers identity through cracking the hotmail account she wanted to tell danny about the guns and the safe room but if she did what would happen would she trigger an immediate rescue attempt were there people outside capable of bringing off a rescue without loss of life she thought about the hostage rescues shed read about or seen on the news in most cases it seemed at least some hostages died before the hostage taker was killed before the hostage taker was killed she craned her neck and looked at the top of warrens head just visible over his monitor rather than hatred she felt pity for him she had the sense of looking at a mental patient a man who had been perfectly normal one day and woke up schizophrenic the next warrens mind had locked itself into the track of marital infidelity and he could not disengage it did he deserve to die for that could she send out words that might doom him in the next few minutes dannys assertion that no one outside knew of their phone link gave her pause was he simply trying to keep their love affair secret or did he not trust the sheriff completely for that matter was the sheriff even in charge out there nell roberts had mentioned federal agents on the phone what if the fbi was outside would danny trust them she needed to know more before deciding what further message to send out warren she called would you come over here please why i need to ask you something more than a minute passed before his chair squeaked and he rose to walk into the great room time means nothing to him she thought hes receding from the world the house phone had rung a half dozen times yet he hadnt answered since hed let her talk to sheriff ellis she forced away the memory of dannys voice during those few precious seconds she couldnt focus when she let that sound loose in her head as warren came toward her she recalled how boyish and wild hed looked this morning after staying up all night searching for something nell roberts had warned him about the irony was exquisitely tragic nell had tried to save warren from kyle and vida and by so doing had led warren to dannys letter which might ultimately cause his death warren stopped three feet from her and sat on the ottoman hed used earlier he looked as though hed aged fifteen years since this morning i want to ask you something laurel said softly weve been married for twelve years and in all that time you never raised a hand to me youve been calm rational even kind most of the time and now in the span of a few hours youve become a totally different person can you help me understand that you never betrayed me before i dont think thats it i really dont if id told you a week ago that you were going to beat me and tie me up you wouldnt have believed it not even because of adultery or anything else and in front of our sixyearold child you couldnt even have imagined that he blinked but said nothing im worried about your mental health warren im serious the faintest of smiles touched the corners of his mouth your worries no longer worry me this set her back and our childrens worries theyll know someday who really cared about them what does that mean laurel struggled against her bonds in frustration youre talking like a delphic oracle you keep telling me ive broken a trust all right what if i have from what kyle said youve done the same thing with your patients or with yourself maybe both i dont know because you wont tell me but he was talking about prison warren whatever you did must have been pretty bad i dont understand it but then i dont have to because i can forgive you whatever youve done i know youre a good man deep down so why cant you forgive me its different completely different how stealing is a lesser sin than adultery you dont know what youre talking about you dont know what ive done or why i want to and i want to know what youve done are you going to tell me she bit her bottom lip she had certainly thought about confessing if she admitted her affair with danny warren would believe her she knew after the initial shock had passed anyway because every word she spoke would ring with the conviction of truth the question was how warren would react once hed accepted that truth if her lover had in fact been kyle or someone else of that caliber warren would probably scream and yell in disgust then kick her out of the house and divorce her but danny mcdavitt was a different thing altogether for warren the essential nature of masculine honor was sacrifice and he respected danny more than almost any man hed ever met he admired dannys war record of course that was a given but he also saw danny as a dedicated family man when he and danny coached the girls in soccer last year little michael had come along for most practices and all of the games many times laurel had caught warren staring as danny patiently tried to engage his son in activities with the other kids and what shed seen etched into her husbands face at those times was a combination of pity and admiration once warren had actually climbed into the car after practice and said danny mcdavitts a better man than i am if grant had been born like that it might have killed me this happened months before laurel and danny started seeing each other but laurel sometimes wondered if warrens admiration for danny had formed some perverse part of her attraction to him no confession she decided if warren were to find out now that im in love with dannyand that danny loves mehed selfdestruct a colder woman she thought might reveal the truth to try to drive her husband to suicide but laurel couldnt consider it first because she didnt want her children to lose their father second because warren might decide to make his wife and children precede him into death a lot of fathers had done so in the past all you had to do was watch the news to know that and last of course there was the selfish consideration danny might be in love with her but he was unwilling to give up custody of michael to marry her even if warren died tonight it would bring her no closer to a future with danny we both need to talk about the bad things weve done she said but not right now right now we need to find a way out of this trap weve made for ourselves we need to make sure our children are safe warren actually looked as if he was considering it what about kyle what about him he tried to kill you you acted in selfdefense ill testify to that warren looked toward the study i just want you to know one thing everything ive done this past year was for the children and for you even the bad things warren how can that be please help me understand i cant you know how i am some things i just cant talk about the phone rang again but he ignored it dont you think you should answer theyre probably getting pretty antsy out there he nodded they are i can see them on my computer laurel was thunderstruck she had entirely forgotten about the security cameras theyd installed when the house was built shed never used them but warren had the cameras connected to his computer via wireless connection and he was obviously monitoring them now no wonder he was so calm sitting there while the phone rang endlessly hed know the assault was coming in plenty of time to retreat to the safe room she needed to text danny about the cameras right away i dont think they know i can see them warren said or theyd be concealing themselves better the cameras are pretty hard to see laurel observed remembering how well the architect had hidden them in the molding outside you insisted on that remember yeah great so youre not going to answer the phone anymore ray breens an idiot sheriff ellis isnt much better you need to talk to somebody so they dont come charging in here and hurt beth warren nodded slowly then after a few moments he said danny laurels heart thudded what i wouldnt mind talking to danny he was in the chopper with ellis remember yes dannys a family man all the way and his wife is a littledifficult the major would understand what im going through laurel wanted to smash warrens face here in the heart of hell she was being compared to starlette mcdavitt one of the women she despised most in the world ask for danny then she said you son of a bitch like a man suddenly remembering hed left something on the stove warren got up and walked back to his computer laurel rolled to face the sofa back then slid her razr from its niche and began working the keypad with her thumb bonnie elfman had led danny and sheriff ellis to a tv room at the back of her house where they found grant shields sitting on a wicker sofa with deputy sandra souther pretending to watch tv ellis had questioned the boy gently enough and he got a recap of what ray breen had already relayed to him a nineyearolds perspective on a violent family argument and possible murder now the sheriff was trying to tease out details how many shots did you hear son he asked one or maybe two grant closed his eyes like a psychic trying to guess what card someone was holding three i think ellis glanced at danny how many guns does your dad own the boys eyes opened umthree what kind are they hes got one of every kind a shotgun and a deer gun and a pistol the sheriff smiled youre a smart boy arent you i dont know what about you do you have a or anything no sir dad says im not old enough i am though i believe you are as ellis slid his chair closer to the boy dannys cell phone vibrated against his thigh he took it out and read the new text message with an accelerating pulse w mentaly unstable handgun amp shotgun close rifle n safe room stocked for days intent uncertain but w not n hurry trancelike bth asleep amp close him ps b careful he can c u secuty cams danny replied understood take care i love you knowing as he did that the contents of these secret messages were almost certain to be read by the sheriff one day grant said ellis have you ever seen your daddy as upset as he got today the boys eyes started to glisten no sir close even grant shook his head he was like a different person or something ellis nodded then glanced up at danny you want to ask anything danny squatted in front of the boy that he had once believed would become his stepson grant had his fathers face and sandy blond hair but his eyes were laurels is there anything else you want to tell us grant anything at all grant shook his head but then without warning two rivers of tears washed down his cheeks please dont let them hurt my daddy mr danny he didnt mean any harm hes sick thats all hes not thinking right thats what my mama told me danny took hold of the boys hands and squeezed dont you worry son were going to make sure everybody gets out of there safe and sound grant wiped his face and nodded okay danny started to get up then added your moms a strong lady shes going to do whatever she has to do to get back to you grant looked unsure i dont know she acts that way but sometimes i see her crying when she doesnt know im looking danny nodded as though this were part of his everyday experience all grownups cry sometimes ive seen some of the toughest soldiers in the world cry that doesnt mean anything bad do you cry mr danny he felt his throat tighten sometimes i do grant you just wait here and try to think about something else youll be back with your mom before you know it and my dad grant said firmly danny nodded again wed better get moving sheriff ellis said brusquely weve got that ops meeting to get to danny squeezed grants hand once more then stood sandra said ellis why dont you find this boy a soda pop or something he said he didnt want anything all boys want a soda pop danny forced himself to walk out of the room thinking that on a night like this grant might be luckier to be like michael just for a while slow down missy theres a bunch of cars up there nell roberts was barely holding herself together shed felt some relief after talking to dr shields but it hadnt lasted long shed called her second cousin missy darden to pick her up and run her downtown to dr shieldss lawyers office but the office had turned out to be closed nell got the lawyers home number from information but when she called it she got an answering machine after convincing missy to drive her out to the mans house shed worked up her nerve to knock on the door but no one answered throughout this odyssey missy had questioned nell endlessly but nell remained evasive unsure how her cousin would react to the news of vidas injuries theres some kind of roadblock up there missy said pointing to dr shieldss street you want me to stop here or what no keep going but slow what the heck is going on nell why are they guarding dr shieldss street i dont know its something to do with that lawyer isnt it nell scanned the lawns and grassy lots beyond the lines of cars parked along cornwall avalons main street knots of people were gathered along the curb many of whom she recognized most wouldnt know her anywhere but in the window of dr shieldss office but some would a white deputy standing in the road ahead was turning cars back toward the highway a young black deputy stood at the roadblock talking to a couple of men in polo shirts she was pretty sure hed been to the office for his departmental physical what do i do missy asked easing her mustang forward come on im going to get out you go on back to work no way its too late for that anyway nell had her hand on the door handle when she saw agent paul biegler less than fifty feet away he was standing behind a black sedan talking to his two assistants he had a pressure bandage on his right cheek uhoh nell said sliding low in her seat get out of here why whats wrong just back up and park somewhere okay okay calm down nell shut her eyes and tried not to freak out shed known something bad was happening out here dr shields had pretended different on the phone but she knew his voice too well to buy that he was trying to protect her rather than himself god only knew what kind of trouble dr auster had caused out here missy i need your help will you come with me her cousin shrugged why not maybe ill finally find out what all the fuss is about chapter five men and four cowboy hats were jammed into the mobile command post around danny sheriff ellis tru commander ray breen detective rusty burnette carl sims wearing a black baseball cap and trace breen who was supposedly there to facilitate communications each passing minute had made it clearer that the tiny trailer had been designed to accommodate only half their number with comfort on the positive side the architects plans for the shields house had finally arrived and now lay spread across a formica dinette table half the size of the blueprints themselves one page showed the landscape contractors plan and on this carl had marked the surveillance and sniping positions now occupied by tru officers sheriff ellis stood like a bent tree over the table and ray breen leaned against the door to keep out unwanted visitors during the time it had taken to gather everyone in the trailer danny had formed a pretty clear picture of how each man felt about the situation the breen brothers believed kyle auster was dead and were ready to assault the house with flashbang grenades immediately detective burnette favored delaying the assault until they had more information about where everyone was inside the house only carl sims kept close counsel all right sheriff ellis said bringing the meeting to order two things what we know and what we dont three hostages in the house said ray breen one probably dead already the subject is armed and dangerous which his own son told us and were losing light fast quicker because of this storm coming up thank you ray said the sheriff what dont we know we dont know if dr austers alive or dead drawled detective burnette we dont know what part of the house theyre in which its a damn big house by the way we also dont know exactly how the subjects armed though hes wellarmed for sure and most of all we dont know why hes done any of this he claims hes gonna come out when he gets done with this computer program he talked about told ray hed come out quiet and peaceful burnette glanced over his shoulder at the door right ray thats what he said dont make no sense to me though whats a guy doing messing with a computer when hes already shot somebody and his own boys running from him we dont know burnette said doggedly thats my point considering what i heard that government fellow yelling about im thinking our two doctors might be up there destroying evidence while we sit out here jawin youve got a point there ellis said i hadnt thought about that danny watched the faces his gut aching with guilt he could answer several of the most important unknowns but he had no intention of doing so not yet if he revealed his secret link to laurel the consequences were impossible to predict but he doubted that many of them would be positive ellis looked at carl whats the shooting situation not good i dont know where they are yet obviously im thinking they might be in that great room three reasons the blinds are shut theres a phone in there and the blueprints show a hardwired internet connection in that room but the blinds and curtains are drawn all over the house and hes got cordless phones and wifi in there danny couldnt believe hed forgotten to ask laurel what room they were in at this point he wasnt about to wait he took out his cell phone and keyed in the message trace breen watched with suspicion but didnt challenge him you all heard agent biegler said sheriff ellis we need to end this thing before we get the fbi crawling up our backsides amen said ray how are we going to pinpoint them in the house burnette asked directional mikes should tell us which room theyre in said ray exact positions going to be tougher if the supervisors wouldve coughed up for the flir unit we been begging for wed be sitting pretty flir couldnt see through those blinds danny interjected he had extensive experience with the miraculous technology known as forwardlooking infrared radarhed had a stateoftheart unit on his pave lowbut while flir could detect humans in absolute darkness and sometimes through glass and water it couldnt see through an opaque solid what about our little privateeye video camera ellis asked referring to a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube often slipped by detectives beneath doors to film couples in flagrante delicto on the blink ray groused thats what you get when you buy cheap the mikesll be enough all we need is to know which room hes in well come in from six different points at once and so fast he wont know whats hit him danny made a soft cluck of disapproval with his tongue what is it major asked the sheriff you have a better idea when i first moved back to town i saw a story about a rich guy whod lost a grandkid in a fire if i remember right he was going to donate a couple of thermal imaging cameras to the fire department to let firemen see through smoke i dont know how good they are but i dont think theyve been delivered yet ray said and the ones they have now are real low quality call chief hornby and make sure trace ordered the sheriff the younger breen hurried outside with a cell phone to his ear danny tried desperately to think of another way to locate shields within the house he didnt want to reveal his link with laurel simply to answer the question of position ray breen said we could slip up to the windows and have a look you can probably see around the edges of those blinds they looked pretty flush through my scope carl told him shields would see you coming said danny ray looked skeptical how you figure that through his cameras cameras cried a chorus of voices danny tried to look nonchalant sure i assumed youd seen them theyre hidden by ornamental woodwork but you can see the lenses if you look close ray pushed up to the blueprints and started riffling through them well ill be damned there they are shields has probably been watching us ever since we got here burnette said no probably about it said carl ill bet hes got those cameras networked to his computer with a laptop and a rifle he could move from window to window and pick us off without breaking a sweat he could have shot us before now reasoned burnette but he hasnt shot anybody we havent moved in yet said sheriff ellis studying danny youve got sharp eyes dont you major i pay attention what else have you noticed nobodys saying anything about the safe room the what that house has a safe room in it a panic room whatever you want to call it a steel box with a reinforced door stocked with food and water i know that aint on the blueprints ray said in a suspicious tone maybe they added it later burnette suggested how do you know about that room danny asked the sheriff because i made love to shieldss wife in it once dr shields told me about it when i was teaching him to fly i think they did add it near the end of construction that goddamn architect ray grumbled useless sheriff ellis was rubbing his chin his eyes seemingly fixed on some distant tragedy if shields drags his family into a room like that were screwed blued and tattooed he could execute em one by one and we couldnt do nothing but stand outside and listen the trailer door banged into detective burnettes back and trace breen squeezed inside panting with excitement chief hornby says they got those new thermal cameras last week two of em theyre still in the boxes but jerry johnsons been reading the manuals and can they see through glass ellis cut in or window blinds the chief thinks they can he said the two of em together cost more than a used fire engine sheriff ellis pumped his fist like a weary gambler catching a break at last get them over here trace jerry johnson with them tell the chief if theyre not in a car and on the way in two minutes im sending danny in the chopper trace nodded and went back outside okay said the sheriff lets say weve pinpointed shields and his family in the great room and negotiations fail how do we proceed blow out the windows and go in with flashbangs said ray dr shields will be bleeding from the ears and blind as a bat he wont be able to pull a trigger even if he wants to then im not so sure about that carl said quietly i know the tests say people cant pull a trigger after a flashbang goes off but i know guys whove done it shit ray scoffed marines maybe not some civilian doctor im just telling you it can be done dont assume that he cant do it thats why were gonna take him down in that first second doubletap him and its all over danny closed his eyes the prospect of ray breen and his men firing automatic weapons in a room with laurel and her daughter in it was unthinkable especially in the chaos that would follow the detonation of grenades designed to shock terrorists senseless but this was standard operating procedure once negotiations had failed it wouldnt be enough to oppose ray breens plan based solely on fear of collateral damage hed have to come up with a better one himself the house is pretty exposed detective burnette observed how are we gonna get close when hes got those security cameras spray paint ray answered with a grin theres a line of trees running up to the back corner of the house where the kid got out ill take two guys up that way with some black spray paint no more cameras what if you spook him asked burnette he might panic and start shooting weve got to kill those cameras rusty what if we cut the electricity to the whole house danny sensed an opening shields told you he was waiting for his computer to tell him something if hes fixated on that and we cut the power we might really push him over the edge sheriff ellis nodded in agreement a laptop would have battery power for a while burnette pointed out we dont know hes using a laptop danny said he looked over at carl do those blinds go all the way to the top of the great room windows carl shook his head not quite theres some open glass right at the topa little arched panebut thats like fifteen feet up and no trees tall enough to get the right shooting angle could you use the chopper as a shooting platform i could get you a perfect angle on those high windows the snipers dark face seemed to darken even more with skepticism helos are too unstable for precision shooting plus thats doublepaned glass i wouldnt want to guarantee my shot from a moving platform understood said danny but ive seen it done i had a delta sniper shoot prone from the belly of my ship he didnt like doing it but he hit his targets carl looked around at the faces of the other men ill give it a try but add in the deflection of the glass and thats a tricky shot if my targets alone okay but if theres a hostage close she could get hurt ray was watching them incredulously what do you two experts think dr shields is gonna be doing while carls hanging up there trying to shoot him hes gonna blow your asses out of the sky thats what he could shoot down that helicopter with a deer rifle this was true danny knew i dont think hell be expecting a shot from the chopper if i turn on the searchlight hell think were trying to get a look at him and if carl misses the first shot then you guys would bust in like you want to sheriff ellis was the kind of man who talked to help himself think if carl saw shields holding a gun in his hands especially in a threatening manner we could definitely justify taking him out what if we go in and we dont see a weapon asked ray fire to disable said ellis dont you train for that ray shook his head doubletap two to the body one to the head makes you good and dead jesus what happened to surgical strikes thats just not practical in closequarters combat said carl things happen too fast once you go in there may be a weapon you cant see body armor you cant see once things go that far you have to shoot to kill ellis nodded im glad to hear that from you carl ray seems a tad eager today danny noted with some relief that the closer they got to the moment of truth the less cavalier the sheriff was about ordering an assault a soft but persistent buzz drew several pairs of eyes to danny with hot blood flowing into his cheeks he held up a hand in apology then he took out his cell phone and after making sure no one else could read the screen read the newest text message me lying on sofa n grt room w n study atdesk bth lying on study sofa here was the very information that the tru was using every available resource to try to discover the best thermal imagers in the world couldnt give this kind of detail danny considered telling the sheriff that hed simply tried to text laurel shields whose cell number he might reasonably have since she was michaels teacher and had gotten lucky but sooner or later they would discover that the cell phone laurel was using was not registered to her but to a friend of dannys no he decided ive got to keep this ace up my sleeve until the last possible moment i thought we wasnt supposed to be talking to nobody on the outside trace said from behind danny whos he talking to sheriff ellis said major mcdavitt has a family emergency so how bout you shut up and focus on your job trace ducked his narrow head yessir thinking of laurels message danny moved closer to the blueprints and said i was actually in this house a couple of times back when i coached soccer with dr shields really said the sheriff yep and if i remember right shields has a computer sitting on the desk in his study which is right off the great room he pointed right there if shields was telling the truth about working at his computer he might be sitting at that desk to do it and if im not mistaken the study windows are just like the ones in the great room carl nodded they are danny looked at the sheriff and let his voice take on its pilots authority i think i see a surer way to end this thing it was your idea to start with sheriff ellis stood a little straighter if the thermal imagers pinpoint shields in that studyor in the great roomi should take the chopper up as a diversion just like you suggested on the way here the sheriff nodded to confirm that this had in fact been his idea we put carl on the ground with his rifle scoped on those windows and the thermal imager beside him when i turn on my searchlight shields will come to those windows like a moth to a candle when he does ray can blow the windows out with plastiqueall the back windows shields will be silhouetted like a duck in a shooting gallery and thats when carl takes his shot the sheriffs eyes narrowed carl only theres your surgical strike one shot one kill no collateral damage ray breen was winding up to argue but ellis silenced him with an upraised hand the sheriffs eyes bored into those of his sniper will you make that shot carl carl looked back steadily no problem sir theres a pecan tree fortythree meters from the back windows i ranged it with my laser i can set up behind that the doctor wont even know im there i didnt ask if you could make the shot ellis growled i asked if you would the snipers face tightened as he realized exactly what was being questioned understood sir ill make the shot no wounding nothing like that carl nodded once his jaw set firm sheriff ellis didnt look convinced but he finally turned away and gazed at the semicircle of faces pressed close around him all right listen up i like major mcdavitts thinking on this but my first plan is to talk dr shields out of there ray breen snorted but he tried to make it sound involuntary i know shields has stopped answering the phone but that doesnt mean he wont answer the next time we call if he wont answer ill go to the bullhorn butat the rate were losing light our options are going to shrink mighty quick storms coming up fast burnette noted and maybe the fbi too ray intoned ellis grimaced ray set up your directional mikes theyre being set up now good the second those thermal imagers get here i want em up and running i want to know where every person in that house is and hear every word theyre saying once ive got that intel ill make my tactical decision ellis dug into his pocket for somethingchewing tobacco danny figuredbut came up empty anybody else got anything to say nobody did except danny who throughout the meeting had been haunted by an image so vivid that it might be a premonition ray breen charging into the great room with an mp submachine gun on full autoand one solitary slug finding its way into laurels heart id like to say something danny said quietly what im about to tell you is only what ive heard delta force and seal commanders tell their men before an assault dont ask me what assaults because i cant tell you the room went silent as a prayer vigil just as hed intended he looked ray breen in the eyes this is no training exercise and its damn sure no movie set if you men assault that house youre as much a threat to the hostagesand to each otheras you are to dr shields you have no way of knowing how mrs shields or her daughter will react to your intrusion the little girl might bolt for her father the instant those windows go down youve got to know what youre going to do in that event before you go in what would you do ray asked the sheriff depends if hes holding his gun on the little girl i guess thats no time for guessing danny said you think hed hold a gun on his own daughter asked burnette who the fuck knows ray snapped hes the nutjob taking people hostage sheriff ellis looked down at the blueprints his eyes clouded with doubt if dr shields is holding his little girl when the windows go down carl is the only man authorized to shoot half of dannys fear left him in a single sigh jesus cried ray a million things could screw up carls shot we need to be able to do whatevers required to get the job done a sniper aint no better than we are up close trace argued carl looked at the younger breen with barely disguised contempt you want to put a thousand dollars behind that mouth any day boy youd have to borrow it to pay me shut up bellowed the sheriff my order stands all this is hypothetical right now anyway everything could change in five minutes danny anything else only this i never knew a real hero who wanted to be one weve got one objective the safety of those people inside keep your minds on that and maybe well end this night without killing anybody which is exactly what we want ellis concluded a soft beeping sounded in the trailer shit fire trace exclaimed his eyes on the comm rack thats him who asked the sheriff him dr shields his house anyway answer it snapped ellis trace picked up the phone and after trying to swallow his bobbing adams apple said hello deputy breen speaking everyone watched his rodents face bunch in concentration no thats my brother is that who you want to talk tookay wait a minute please sheriff ellis stepped forward expecting to be handed the phone but trace put his hand over the mouthpiece and shook his head hes asking for danny sheriff ellis looked nonplussed danny um major mcdavitt is what he said aint that danny the sheriff turned and looked back at danny danny shrugged unable to guess what shields wanted with him unless hed somehow forced laurel to confess their involvement that is major do you want to talk to dr shields sheriff ellis asked stiffly wed better think it through before i try that danny looked at trace tell him youre going to find me and ill call him back trace was about to do this when ellis said ask if hell talk to me instead trace followed his orders then hung up looking embarrassed he said danny or nobody sheriff then he hung up ellis rubbed his strong chin okayeverybody get into position stay on the secure radio net but keep the chatter down the trailer emptied fast soon only trace breen remained with danny and the sheriff where are you supposed to be ellis asked trace right here this is my post well clear out for a minute trace looked happy to oblige after hed gone ellis gave danny a penetrating look what do you make of this development i dont know what to make of it are you and shields pretty tight not at all we coached ball together like i said and i taught him to fly but hes not the kind of guy who makes friends easy theres always a distance there ellis nodded thats my feeling too so what does he want with you i dont get it danny shrugged again do you want me to talk to him somebody needs to or the next thing thats gonna happen is him getting shot id hate to see that happen but id hate to see an assault even more youve made your point ellis spat in the little sink against the wall then grabbed a pot of coffee off the counter after sniffing it he poured some into a styrofoam cup take a short break danny i need to think for a minute theres something were not seeing here seems like it danny said wondering if ellis was smarter than he was given credit for being i need to pray about this is what i need to do ill leave you alone then dont stray far i may call you any second danny nodded ill be right outside grant shields was sitting on the sofa in the elfmans tv room trying and failing to focus on the first harry potter movie which mrs elfman claimed her grandkids loved best of all of them grant had seen all the harry movies so many times that he could recite the lines with the characters the bad thing was that harry was always thinking about his dead parents the lady deputy sitting beside grant didnt seem to notice but he could feel himself clenching his fists and bouncing his feet up and down he had no idea what was happening at home all he knew was that something very bad could happen and soon the way his dad had been acting worried him but not nearly so much as all the cops and guns hed seen outside hows our little man doing mrs elfman asked poking her head into the room for the fifteenth time hes doing fine said deputy souther mrs elfman walked in and set a big orange bowl beside grant it was filled with tortilla chips and bright green paste guacamole she announced i know you love it because your mom told me so grant nodded and mumbled thanks but he didnt want any guacamole he did like it most of the time but only his moms mrs elfmans tasted funny too much lemon or something you call me if you need anything else young man she said grant nodded and kept his eyes on the tv so mrs elfman wouldnt see how worried he was after she left the room the lady deputy said shes kind of pushy huh surprised grant nodded and stole a glance at his babysitter her first name was sandra she was younger than his mom but not by much she seemed nice too and not fake nice as he looked back at the movie he felt her warm hand cover his i know youre scared she said but its going to be all right theyre going to get everybody out of there safe your mom and your sister and your dad too grants eyes burned then filled with tears deputy sandra sounded like she believed what she said but he wasnt sure not at all and right then he decided that he couldnt just sit there while whatever happened happened he had to see it for himself there might even be something he could do to help since hed turned nine his mom had been relying on him more and more for physical things he was almost as strong as she was and he could already outrun her i need to go to the bathroom he said holding his belly as if he had a stomachache ill ask mrs elfman where it is sandra said starting to get up thats okay i already know grant got up and walked out of the room his mind already racing through the elfmans backyard and down to the creek where no policeman would be able to see him sandra stood and followed him to the hall door where she could watch him go into the bathroom she smiled the way his mom did when he was sick and grant sensed that she might be able to read his mind a little the way his mom could sometimes that was okay mrs elfmans bathroom had a window deputy willie jones was tired of manning the roadblock gawkers just kept coming more and more every few minutes they came on foot and in cars the neighbors on foot the townspeople in cars willie didnt know how the rumor spread so fast probably cell phones turning back the cars was no trouble but the foot traffic was another matter fifty people were standing along cornwall street most in little groups of five or six some had tried to walk up lyonesse but willie had nipped that in the bud they had some nerve though several men had tried to question him but hed kept as quiet as one of those guards outside buckingham palace the things they said though half the people out here believed that dr shields had already murdered his whole family and some thought hed taken his neighbors hostage from what willie had gathered though not much had happened since hed arrived hed been keeping a close eye on agent biegler as ray breen had instructed biegler and the two men with him had spent most of their time huddled around the trunk of a black ford crown victoria parked a little way up from the roadblock then a couple of minutes ago theyd climbed into the ford and driven off toward town which suited willie fine he was thinking of calling ray breen and asking to be relieved when a young white woman with dark hair walked quickly up to the roadblock another white woman about her age was trying and failing to keep up with her willie started to hold up his hands but something in her eyes stopped him she looked like the witnesses hed spoken to after bad highway accidents pale and shaken with eyes like a wounded deers can i help you miss the woman looked nervously over her shoulder i hope so i need to see the sheriff the sheriffs kind of busy right now i know but i think hell want to talk to me whys that i was at the fire today at dr shieldss office this got willies attention are you a patient of his or something no i work for dr shields i met you when you came for your physical it was my sister who almost got killed in that explosion ive been trying to talk to you for a while but that agent bieglers been watching the roadblock he just drove off so i came right up can we hurry if he sees me hell arrest me for sure willie thought about calling ray for an okay but then he realized he could kill two birds with one stone hey louis he shouted waving to one of the deputies who were turning back the rubbernecks in cars get over here and man the barricade as soon as louis started toward him willie took the woman by the arm and led her to his cruiser danny found carl sims sitting on a camp stool beneath a pavilion tent someone had set up outside the command trailer the sniper was putting a light coat of oil on the long gray barrel of his rifle a remington with a custom stock the air out here felt twenty degrees cooler than the musty air in the trailer rains almost here carl said got to maintain your equipment amen danny agreed glancing at the chopper sitting in the open space beyond the trailer he thanked his stars yet again for dick burleighs vietnam experience as carl wiped down the gun his dark corded arms rippled he looked like a teenager preparing for a deer hunt in the dawn light danny had seen hundreds of boys like him over the years seemingly too young for the jobs they were asked to do but maybe the only ones resilient enough to do them and survive you been in the shit aint you major said carl overseas i mean ive been in a few places i wouldnt want to go back to carl smiled his teeth bright in the false dusk i know what you mean danny reached into an igloo on the ground and pulled out a can of dr pepper something on your mind carl sims held the rifle at a right angle to his body and looked down the length of the barrel checking something danny couldnt even begin to guess at that guy at the bank carl said the one whose hand i shot the one the sheriffs hung up on yeah i recognized him from grade school soon as i saw him in my scope i thought it might be something like that carl lowered the rifle and began working at it again wasnt just that though he looked around to make sure they were alone then spoke in a softer voice i killed a lot of people in iraq major more than the twentyseven they credited me with danny waited for whatever was coming i knew why i was killing those people you know most of em anyhow but this stuff herei dont know in a few minutes im going to have my mamas doctor in my crosshairs and it just dont feel right i know carl looked confused but inside the traileryou were talking like you want me to shoot the man danny sighed heavily im not in command here carl if it were up to me the fbi would be running this scene and you and me would be waiting for word somewhere dry but thats not going to happen not with these boys the sniper nodded dejectedly i heard that theres exactly two professional soldiers here tonight danny said with quiet conviction and theyre both under this tent if the sheriff reaches the point of ordering an explosive entry you are the best hope that mrs shields and her daughter have of surviving this night you alone do you understand carl stopped wiping the gun youre saying i should knock down the doctor before ray and them screw things up danny moved closer to the sniper then squatted so that their eyes were level you want my opinion if were within two minutes of an assault and you have a clean shottake it carls eyes widened without waiting for authorization sheriff ellis thinks youre slow on the trigger right the sniper nodded resentfully prove him wrong the trailer door popped open behind them danny looked around and saw sheriff ellis walking toward them danny ellis said i think you need to talk to dr shields were losing our light if we have to go in i dont want to wait till dark to do it danny took a swig of dr pepper and held it in his mouth till it burned if he was going to talk to warren shields he needed to be awake and alert sheriff someone called sheriff ellis i got somebody you need to talk to danny swallowed and turned willie jones was hurrying up with a pretty young woman beside him as they drew closer danny saw terror in the womans face whos this asked the sheriff nell roberts willie said she works for dr shields she was at the fire today shes been trying to avoid that biegler dude he tried to arrest her earlier today ellis motioned nell under the pavilion tent what are you doing out here miss i didnt know where else to go im worried about dr shields worried about dr shields sheriff ellis gave danny a look that said what did i tell you are you and dr shields personally involved miss nells cheeks reddened no he wouldnt do anything like that and i wouldnt either hes not like dr auster what do you mean by that thats what i came out here to tell you dr auster is a liara liar and a crook hes gotten dr shields in trouble but its not dr shieldss fault dr shields is a good man ask anybody i dont know whats going on out here but i can promise you kyle auster is behind it sheriff ellis took a long breath then slowly expelled it so if i told you that dr shields is holding his family hostage in his house and he maybe killed dr auster what would you say nell shook her head as though this were an impossibility id say dr auster asked for it somehow he probably tried to kill dr shields danny recalled laurels text message ka dead by w selfdefense nell roberts apparently knew her bosses well the sheriff turned to danny what are we going to do with this young lady i dont want biegler to get ahold of her why dont you put willie with her and keep her close to the trailer if im going to talk to shields i may want to ask her some questions psychological stuff ellis nodded you heard the major willie youre miss robertss babysitter from now on stay right outside the trailer yes sir willie said with a grin you ready danny ellis asked this may be our only chance to end this thing without casualties ready oh shit said carl sheriff danny and ellis turned together flanked by two subordinates paul biegler was marching toward the pavilion and he was marching like a man in charge he brought the rain with him before he reached the edge of the tent a staccato rattle of heavy drops sounded on the nylon overhead i dont need this said ellis bad omen for sure carl muttered a note of superstition in his voice biegler stopped outside the pavilion and stood in the rain like a visiting captain awaiting permission to come aboard a ship sheriff ellis offered the opposite of hospitality i thought i told you not to come back here unless you had information that would improve our tactical situation biegler nodded thats exactly why im here mind if we get out of the rain as ellis took a slow step back danny sensed a subtle shift in the balance of power at the scene from the moment biegler and his men stepped under the protection of the tent everything changed what have you got the sheriff asked we dont have much time for talk warren shields is dying biegler said elliss mouth went slack say what hes got an inoperable brain tumor lord have mercy carl breathed how do you know that ellis asked he turned to nell roberts did you know that nell shook her head clearly in shock i knew something was wrong though hes been acting different for a while now oh my godoh no bieglers voice gained authority as he spoke shields was diagnosed eleven months ago at the office of a neurologist at the stanford medical school one month later he applied for a life insurance policy in the amount of two million dollars he was approved how asked danny the neurologist at stanford recorded shieldss office visit and tests as something else the two of them went to medical school together roommates jesus said danny realizing that he and laurel had begun their affair at about the same time her husband was diagnosed how did you find this out ellis asked biegler drew himself to his full height unlike some people i cultivate contacts outside my own agency ive had everybody i know running dr shields through national computer databases when the neurologists name came up i called him it didnt take much pressure to get the truth out of him how could dr shields keep something like that secret asked carl hes essentially treating himself biegler explained with steroids mostly every three weeks or so he flies out to stanford under cover of going to a bicycle race ellis shook his head in disbelief are you saying his wife doesnt even know nobody knows nobody but shields and his neurologist the guy said shields has only one mission in life now providing for his wife and kids before he dies nothing else matters to him in the silence that followed this remark nell roberts began to sob but the sound was mostly covered by the rain well hell said sheriff ellis thats a shocker and no mistake but im not sure how it changes anything bieglers eyes went wide in wonder are you kidding it changes everything the trailer door banged open again and this time trace breen jumped out shielding his eyes with his hand its him again sheriff dr shields hes still asking for major mcdavitt biegler gave danny a long look why is he asking for you lets go find out said the sheriff chapter danny sat at the formicatopped table in the command trailer waiting to speak to warren shields the odors of sweat and mildew had mingled into an unpleasant soup in the cramped space to dannys surprise sheriff ellis had allowed paul biegler to follow them into the trailer he stood two steps behind danny his posture tense trace breen was present to work the comm gear and his brother stood by the door with carl sims at his shoulder danny figured ellis would kick carl out when he saw him but the sheriffs attention was on weightier matters put those on said trace pointing at a headset on the table danny picked up the headset which was connected to a small gray box that read hello direct on the top wires ran from this to a rack of audio gear against the trailer wall a portable dat recorder and three small speakers sat atop the rack if those speakers are going to be on danny said turn them way down i want shields to think its just him and me on the phone sheriff ellis nodded to trace who made an adjustment in the rack danny tried to remember all he knew about warren shields danny had thought he was under stress from the effort of hiding his cell phone link to laurel but hearing that shields was suffering from terminal cancer had blasted his perception of the past year to smithereens every assessment he had ever made of his and laurels relationship had been missing a critical factor moreover it seemed impossible that laurel would not notice an illness that serious had she known about the cancer and kept it from him if so she wasnt the person hed thought she was what have i done to that poor man he thought what have i done to that family when danny first began falling in love with laurel he had struggled hard against his feelings laurel had done the same or so it had seemed even after they lost that battle guilt had shadowed their relationship for a while but eventually it faded in the growing certainty that they were meant to be together for the rest of their lives now that old guilt had broken up through the dark soil at the bottom of dannys heart where hed buried it like some poisoned flower after a heavy rain danny prompted sheriff ellis you still with us i need a pen and paper to make notes i dont think we got any here trace said in a command post here said a deep even voice bodies moved behind danny and then carl handed him a small notebook hed been holding along with a waterproof pencil logbook carl explained all snipers carry them thanks sergeant danny said using simss former military rank instead of deputy carl melted into the back wall again danny picked up the headset thinking that if warren knew he was laurels lover this would be the shortest hostage negotiation in history he made eye contact with the sheriff and agent biegler in turn anybody has any suggestions tell me now when i start talking im going to face the wall so im not distracted im not a trained negotiator ill be flying by the seat of my pants you dont want me doing this im happy to step aside but once i start please stay out of it no secondguessing on the fly sheriff ellis nodded but biegler stepped forward and looked down at danny dont mention his illness if you can help it for some reason this man trusts you you want to keep him on an even keel and get him out of there peacefully stay away from anything that aggravates the emotional component what am i supposed to talk about the weather you wont know that until shields starts talking but keep him cool and dont offer him anything without getting something in return no food no medicine absolutely no reduction in criminal charges only i can grant that through the attorney general anything shields requests gives us leverage and we have to gain a concession for it danny had a feeling that biegler had flown up to quantico for a weekend course in hostage negotiation i dont think hes concerned with criminal charges agent biegler and i dont think we have anything he wants unless he wants me but ill keep your advice in mind i need to know if auster is dead or alive biegler added hes dead as a hammer danny thought understood just get the little girl out of there sheriff ellis said we dont want her in the line of fire if we have to assault the house i think ive got the gist danny said lets get to it dialing now said trace danny put on the headset and waited after three rings he heard a click then warren shields sounding not at all like himself said dr shields warren danny said feeling more than a little awkward this is danny mcdavitt finally shields said with obvious relief its good to hear your voice major yours too danny wasnt sure how to begin so he just went with his gut doc weve got a lot of confusion out here today you want to tell me whats going on shields sighed heavily laurel betrayed me danny shes been having an affair with somebody worse than thatshes in love with him he doesnt know its me danny realized elation almost lifted him out of his chair that doesnt sound like your wife to me how do you know i found a letter from the guy god he must have found a handwritten letter if hed gotten into her email account hed know everything danny had always signed his handwritten letters me just in case someone saw them thats what all this is about he asked an affair afraid so pretty pathetic huh not really thats a big blow finding out a person isnt who you thought they were that the world isnt the way you thought it was you got it major thats exactly it youre living your life under certain assumptions and then you find out theyre all wrong you thought you were walking on firm ground but youre really walking through a swamp of shit danny wrote depressedwronged man in carls logbook hed known plenty of guys who got dear john letters while serving overseas a few had shown their letters to danny in the hope that he could read something between the lines that they couldnt hed never found a way to lessen the pain for any of them you must be pretty angry danny said i know i would be the thing is though i dont get what youre trying to do in there youre talking about a manandwife kind of problem but youve got a lot of trouble stirred up out here a lot of firepower can you help me out on your thinking its simple really shields said as if it really might be is it absolutely i just need to know who the guy is dannys gut clenched the guy shes having an affair with yep thats it in a nutshell and laurel wont tell you nope shes protecting the guy i mean the asshole dumped herits right there in the letterbut shes still protecting him do you believe that danny had forgotten to turn toward the wall he did so now and tried to block out all the eyes staring at the back of his head maybe she figures it could only make things worse since its over you know how could things be worse than they are now danny realized that both their voices had the cavernous sound created by cheap speakerphones he wondered if laurel was hearing his voice as he spoke maybe she figures that if you have a face to put to your negative thoughts its going to hurt a lot worse which could be true you know no way its not having a face thats so bad if i knew who the guy was id probably laugh id probably think hes a total loser maybe he is danny thought wretchedly i thought for a while that it was kyle my partner but it wasnt as danny wrote past tense in the logbook he realized that someone had turned up the speakers in the trailer i hear an echo warren said suspiciously who else is listening to this danny gestured angrily for trace to turn down the speakers nobody theyve got me on some kind of headset sheriff ellis wanted to eavesdrop but i told him i wouldnt talk to you unless it was just the two of us good man good old danny someone grabbed the pencil out of his hand and wrote auster in carls logbook it was biegler danny snatched the pencil back and waved him away he knew auster was dead but he had to play out the charade to protect his link with laurel about your partner he said i should tell you that youve got a lot of people worried about him out here warren laughed softly thats kind of hard to believe i wouldnt kid you doc the folks out here would feel a whole lot better if dr auster would come to the phone and say a few words just a quick hello would be enough i told ray breen shields said with obvious irritation kyles busy going over our tax documents theres a medicaid investigator in town trying to put us in jail is that right danny glanced back at biegler im surprised hes not out there with ellis i havent seen him just a whole bunch of deputies and cops city cops outside the city limits theyre part of the local swat team youve caused quite a commotion out here my friend i guess it would look major can you tell me anything about vida roberts we heard she was hurt in a fire at our office danny wrote concerned about futureat least for others used we people scrambled to read what hed written shes in the icu thats all i know i can check on her if you like please one more thing danny said your daughter beth right how would you feel about sending her out here to me just while you and laurel get this thing worked out beths fine danny shes in no danger i hope nobody out there thinks id hurt my own child no no not under normal circumstances that is but grant was pretty rattled when he came out of there earlier grant didnt understand what i was trying to tell him he doesnt like having to grow up hed love to stay a kid forever but no one can do that can they danny thats a fact i knew youd understand danny grimaced then plunged ahead well i do and i dont warren whats that shields asked his voice cracking with what sounded like fatigue i said i dont really understand what youre doing ive only known you a couple of years but one thing i do know is that youre a man of honor shields didnt reply for a while then he said thank you major that means a lot coming from you im glad but warren the things youve done todayscaring your kids putting their lives at risk holding your wife prisonerthose are not honorable things danny felt someone yank his shoulder he turned and saw biegler shaking his head and mouthing stop danny put out a hand and shoved him backward biegler looked ready to attack him but sheriff ellis wrapped a bearlike forearm around the government agents chest and held him back danny kept waiting for shields to reply but the doctor said nothing i can see how you might feel justified danny went on in an angry state of mind i mean but you cant justify those things warren not in my eyes some of the fathers we coached against might do this kind of thing but not you youre too good for this and you know that things as important as your marriage need to be considered in a calm state of mind youve got to put a cold eye on them as my old commanding officer used to say then you can see whats really there whats really happened there was a long staticky silence just as danny thought the connection might have been lost he heard warren say im feeling pretty alone in here major like ive lost my bearings you know danny felt the first glimmer of hope thats why im here buddy im going to help bring you back down to earth warren laughed strangely im not sure theres any way back from where i am now im not even sure how i got here its like theres another directional vector besides north south east and west and im stuck on it does that sound crazy not to a man whos been there himself sometimes life gets out of whack like that i almost flew into the arabian sea one time because my head was all turned around from personal stuff thats hard to believe believe it danny hadnt smoked a cigarette in twenty years but he wanted one now how long has it been since you slept doc a while now how many hours ahhclose to forty danny scrawled hr deficit in the logbook no wonder the guy was on the ragged edge forty hours without sleep would you go out to the airport and fly in the state youre in now of course not good because i sure wouldnt fly with you so heres my question if you wouldnt fly in this state why would you make decisions that could cost you everything you have this time the silence stretched for more than a minute then shields said ive already lost everything danny and now my wifes gone too thats all i was clinging todoing right by her and the kids i feel like ive been in a raging river clinging to a branch on the bank but now that branch has been yanked away theres nothing to hold on to anymore and nothing at the end of the river but black water a bottomless hole ah forget it you dont know what the hell im talking about danny started to say he did but then he remembered bieglers warning hold on doc im having trouble hearing you let me call you right back he smothered the headset mike in his fist and motioned for trace to break the connection which to dannys relief he did almost instantly why the hell did you do that biegler asked danny turned to sheriff ellis i need to talk to him about the health issue his cancer hes already there himself you heard him thats an unacceptable risk said biegler you might send him into an emotional tailspin danny felt the same exasperation hed felt when serving under incompetent officers you think the guy doesnt know he has a brain tumor im saying whats the point of reminding him if hes not focused on it lets not go there hes there now look i know this guy hes a physician and a realist hed rather hear the truth than a load of bullshit thats why he asked for me in the first place biegler looked at the sheriff im with major mcdavitt on this one ellis said dr shields is upset because he cant get a straight answer from his wife lets dont make things worse by lying to him ourselves lets talk straight to the man danny nodded thankfully and picked up the headset you guys had better be right biegler said danny closed the mike in his fist again biegler you remind me of every remf i ever met in a combat zone you want a guaranteed result with zero risk and your ass covered if the shit hits the fan but thats not how it works in the real world so please shut the fuck up and let me work here biegler reddened and started to reply but trace breen preempted him with whats a remf rear echelon motherfucker answered his brother trace grinned damn straight ellis glared at his comm officer then motioned for him to call dr shields back laurel lay motionless on the great room sofa listening to christy scratch at the pet door warren had installed during the winter now that it was spring the young corgi spent her days running the creek bed only returning in the evenings for food surprised to find her little door latched the hungry dog scratched relentlessly at it wondering why she was being shut out of her family abode warren seemed not to hear christy he had put danny on the speakerphone so that he could keep working at his computer which probably meant monitoring the merlins magic program in its digital war against her hotmail account it was surreal listening to dannys voice floating out of the study she felt that if she could only saw the duct tape from her legs and wrists she could run right out the back door and into dannys arms but of course she couldnt first shed have to pick up bethwho still lay supine in benadrylinduced sleepand then trust warren not to shoot as she fled something she wasnt nearly so confident about as shed once been the pessimism he had revealed to danny had stunned her yes the situation was bad but warren was talking like a man resigned to death not to jail or legal fines the phone rang again and warren pressed the speaker button danny can you hear me now five by five doc five by five warren repeated with longing in his voice i wish we were flying over the river right now lets go buddy ive got the chopper waiting outside you always said you wanted to try it warren laughed softly theyd never let us go now oh i dont know ive got some pull with the sheriff dont bullshit me danny i saw them spraypaint my cameras laurels stomach tightened had they spraypainted the cameras in preparation for an attack i wont lie to you danny said you know that i think its time we get down to cases what do you say im listening the thing is these boys out here have got a manual for situations like this thats what they go by and they dont make exceptions theyre trying to be professional thats all you can understand that sure so we dont have time for small talk i want you to know something warren i know you had a tough blow about a year ago tougher than this thing with your wife laurel raised her head from the couch what are you talking about warren asked warily im talking about your cancer laurels face grew hot and her heart beat hard against her sternum cancer what was danny talking about i understand why you kept that secret danny continued god knows a mans health is his own business but i think maybe this particular illness is affecting your judgment a little warrens reply was almost a whisper but laurel could just make out his words i dont know what youre talking about come on you asked me not to bullshit you do me the same courtesy okay there was a long silence and then warren said who found out about it laurel heaved herself up into a sitting position warrens face was concealed behind his monitor but she stayed erect hoping to get a glimpse of his eyes the last fragments of disbelief were falling away the evil sleeping in the shadows of her failing marriage had suddenly slithered into the light she felt as if shed been walking past a decaying house every day averting her gaze though she knew something dark and hungry lay within does it matter who found out danny asked listen i may be sick but my judgment is fine the things in my brain stem not my cerebral cortex not yet anyway brain stem laurel thought cerebral cortex he has a brain tumor in a dizzying rush of memories she saw the womanish fat around warrens usually trim hips the strange hump at the back of his necksteroids youre the medical expert danny said but look at what youre doing here these arent the actions of the warren shields i coached soccer with or the steady thoughtful physician i taught to fly are you sure every man can be pushed too far you know every man has a breaking point eventually you have to push back are you talking about laurel again of course i dont think shes your main problem warren i think this other thing is magnifying that into more than it is laurels memory had revved into overdrive all the bike races warren had traveled to and returned from without trophies his failure to call home and check in unusual shortness with the children surprising moments of maudlin sentimentality ill tell you about this other thing as you call it warren said i think about it a lot danny i think about all my patients whove died older people most of them but not all looking back i try to remember if the young ones were marked somehow whether they might have done something to bring their fates down on themselves but they didnt danny one day god or fate just said i will not let you be happy i will not give you children i will not let you breathe another day i will take away your ability to move warren no listen this is important ive tried to believe all my life to have faith that there was justice in life some larger plan or meaning but i cant do it anymore ive watched some of the best people i ever met get crippled or taken before they reached thirty forty whatever babies too ive watched babies die of leukemia ive watched infants die from infections bleeding from their eyes and ears terrible birth defectsi look for a reason a pattern anything that might justify all that but nothing does nothing does until i got sick myself i played the same game of denial that all doctors do but danny my cancer ripped the scales from my eyes i go to these funerals and listen to smug preachers telling grieving people that god has a plan well thats a lie all my life ive followed the rules ive toed the line given to the less fortunate followed the commandmentsand it hasnt mattered one bit and dont tell me about job okay if you tell me god is testing me by killing methats like saying we had to destroy a village in order to save it its a cruel joke that we play on ourselves and dont tell me its all made right in the afterlife because you know what the agony of one infant dying senselessly mocks all the golden trumpets of heaven i dont want to sit at the right hand of a god who can torture children or even one who sits by and allows them to be tortured free will my ass i made no choice to die at thirtyseven this ones on gods account major we look for meaning where there is none because were too afraid to accept randomness well ive accepted it embraced it even and once you do that the world just doesnt look the same anymore laurel felt herself coming unmoored from reality she had never heard warren speak more than three sentences about god outside of church to hear him launch into a tirade on the absurdity of faith disoriented her but it was what lay behind his words that had driven her into shock an unalterable fact that would change her future almost as profoundly as warrensterminal brain cancer i hear you buddy danny said at length ive heard that same opinion expressed vividly in war zones but the thing is even if youre right it doesnt mean the choices you make dont have consequences in fact if thats how you see the world you have to be even more careful about what you do because no divine power is going to balance the scales in the end you know you have to do it yourself or do what you can anyway laurel could see the edge of warrens face behind his monitor he was nodding thats exactly what im doing now danny balancing the scales how do you figure that you think im going to leave my kids to be raised by her raising children is a sacred charge i cant trust her to do that any longer fear and shame began eating through laurels shock well what other option do you have danny asked thats what im thinking about well why dont you tell me what youre thinking another long silence i dont think youd understand you still look at things the old way laurel had never heard a voice so bereft of hope warrens whole life for the past year had been an exhausting roundtheclock performance carried out for her and the children an imitation of health i might surprise you there buddy danny said you want to talk about randomness ive seen a lot of men on the south side of twenty die for no reason at all shot or mortared out of a clear blue sky sometimes by their own side ive heard them screaming in the back of my chopper with no hope of getting to a field hospital in time and they dont scream to god doc they dont scream to daddy either they scream to mama because they know mama loved them more than anyone else ever could more than even god if there is one you hear me warren i dont care how much you love grant and bethwhen the shit hits the fan its mama theyll cry for and the shit has hit the fan okay daddys going to die and the last thing you want to do is leave those kids at the mercy of somebody besides their mother i dont care how angry you are brother i dont care what she did to you and they dont either i know you dont like hearing this this is tough love buddy this is the stuff that makes a battlefield seem like a safe place i hear you warren said quietly i do but it just doesnt register i cant explain it to you well try nobodys going anywhere just yet laurel saw warren sag back in his chair but she still couldnt see his eyes she wondered if danny was lying if armed policemen were preparing to burst into the house she tried to stay ready for it her first move would be toward beth though she doubted she could reach her with taped ankles i had a dog when i was a kid warren said did i ever tell you that i dont believe you did laurel faintly remembered warren telling her hed owned a dog as a boy but he hadnt gone into detail in fact hed only revealed this on the day he agreed to buy christy for the kids hed never spoken of it before or since he was just a mutt warren said i found him out in the woods a neighborhood kid was pouring drain cleaner on him i took him home and washed him off named him sam we went everywhere together he was mymy best friend i was going to say my dad didnt like sam but he put up with him anyway a couple of years later we got a bad rain the neighborhood drainage ditch ran right behind our house an open ditch you know about five feet deep in a bad rain it became a torrent five feet of water rushing through there like a locomotive just past our house it turned into a massive whirlpool because all that water was being forced into a twelveinch pipe that ran underground to the creek that particular day the wind blew a yellow ball sam always chased into that water and he went after it he got the ball but by that time the current had him he couldnt get back to the bank i went to jump in after him but my dad ran off the patio and grabbed me held me back i would have drowned but i didnt care when youre eight you dont worry about stuff like that laurel was scarcely breathing sam fought for maybe a minute after he got to the whirlpool and then it sucked him down i was crying and praying he could hold his breath till he shot out the other end of the pipe but it was a couple of hundred yards at least maybe three hundred i found him just before dark down in the creek drowned ive thought about him a lot banging through that long black pipe trying to fight struggling to breathebut the pipe was just too long he never had a chance thats how i feel now danny a year ago the current pulled me into the ditch ive fought like hell to stay afloat but im just about out of gas and when i found that letter this morning it justi finally got sucked into the pipe i cant breathei cant see and i sure as hell cant get back to where i started all i can do is wait to shoot out the other end of the pipe warrens chair creaked as he leaned backward and you know how that story ends laurel tasted salt in her mouth her face was covered with tears how could she have been married to a man for twelve years and not heard that story how could she be the kind of wife that a man would not want to confide his worst nightmare to youre in a bad place danny said i can hear that all im going to say to you is this you need to look at this marriage situation as if you werent sick if you werent sick and there was another man in your wifes life what would you do youd be angry sure but in the end i think youd have to let her go and be the best father you could be show her what a bad mistake shed made by leaving you but you show a woman that by being what you already area man of honor not a pissedoff redneck who cant keep his shit in one sock laurel wondered if danny had gone too far i think it just comes down to this warren said other peoples problems look simple but when its your own problem its complicated im glad you talked to me danny but in the end im the one who has to decide how to end this thing the finality in his voice summoned a new kind of fear from laurels soul dont go yet danny said quickly his voice betraying stress for the first time you said a while ago that you were waiting for something something on your computer are you still waiting i am laurel caused me some problems there but ive got another computer working on it what is it youre waiting for the name danny the name the guy who was screwing my wife still is for all i know laurel wondered if danny was alone or if other men were watching him right now shes got that on a computer in there the guys name im pretty sure she does dont worry about it ill let you guys know once i have it how long is that likely to take no way to know its a probability thing could be ten minutes could take ten hours danny cleared his throat i dont think we have that kind of time warren not anything like why not the sheriff getting antsy out there i told you about the manual remember these guys have a list of steps out here they cross one off then go to the next one warren thought about this i see welli wouldnt advise anybody to trespass in this house the yards all right but a mans home is his castle even the law says that and as far as i can tell nobodys got cause to come into this house uninvited uniformed or not i wouldnt take kindly to that major not at all i hear you doc ill relay that to the sheriff you do that maybe well talk again warrens hand reached out from behind the computer and switched off the speakerphone in the silence that followed christys scratching paws became the dominant sound in the house it made laurel think of warrens drowning dog shouldnt you let christy in she called i know shes starving by now warren didnt answer for a while then he said are you hoping theyll shoot me when i bend down to unlock the pet door laurel closed her eyes and wondered how two human beings who had shared a bed for so long could grow so far apart chapter danny ripped off the headset and shoved his chair away from the table what was all that stuff about god ray breen asked from the door did you hear that shit sounds like hes gone atheist or something sheriff ellis shook his head dr shields is questioning his faith thats all death is the most difficult test of the spirit ray ive seen many a devout man question god in the face of cancer especially when it hits children no the truth is i feel for the man well im happy to hear it biegler said sarcastically but none of that brings us any closer to a resolution i suppose you noted that we heard nothing whatsoever from kyle auster ellis nodded i think dr austers dead danny dead well said ray what are we waiting for then shields aint gonna let his little girl out of there and he sure as hell aint gonna let his wife out i dont think we got any choice but to go in and get them we need to know whats going on inside that house said the sheriff randys got the directional mikes on the windows trace said but hes getting a lot of noise no clear voices he texted me while major danny was talking he thinks shields is in the study the wife and kid arent saying anything nothing audible no how the thermalimage gadgets got here but they aint set up yet audios enough for what we need ray said lets get a location on shields and go sheriff ellis still looked reluctant to give the order what else are we gonna do ray said impatiently the mans in hell already you heard him the mans scared to death carl said softly thats what i heard everyone turned and looked at the sniper we need to focus on mrs shields and her daughter said danny trying to plumb his own motives even as he spoke god knows dr shields is in a bad place but he poses a serious threat to his family an imminent threat if you ask me theres no telling what hell do if that computer finally tells him who his wifes been seeing hell kill her said ray you tell a guy that crazy whos been doing his wife hes gonna off em both or the one he can get to anyway no question about it damn straight trace said from the comm rack i would maybe said sheriff ellis i want the signal from those directional mikes routed in here i got it now said trace well turn it on ellis snapped the worms are eating us up in here i swear agent biegler said we need to be ready to go at a seconds notice sheriff is the rest of your team in position we said the sheriff whats this we stuff you aint got a dog in this hunt biegler im part of this operation whether you like it or not my men are in position ray said the charges are already set on the windows sonny weldons on the switch good said ellis whats the chance of flying glass hurting the hostages danny asked ray shrugged theres a thin bead of explosive around each of those big panes were going to cut the glass basically it should drop pretty much straight down with really bad luck somebody could get hit by small shards but i dont think so shards moving at feet per second danny thought making a mental note to text laurel to stay far from the windows prior to the assault and to lie on top of beth if possible with this thought came the realization that the men in the room were not watching sheriff ellis expectantly but him even ellis seemed to be waiting for danny to give some lastminute guidance danny figured they must have bought into the plan hed outlined earlier whether theyd voiced their agreement or not lets put one thermal imager in front of the house and one in back danny said make sure the one in back is at carls position the operator will serve as his spotter carls used to working that way make sure the fireman whos read the manual is operating the unit by carl hell have some idea what hes looking at danny peered between sweatsoaked uniforms to the snipers face sound okay to you carl best we can do probably i had a thermal rifle scope in the corps when i needed it but this ought to be good enough for general target acquisition lets pray it is after carl has a positive lock on shieldsand i mean positiveill take the chopper up hover over the backyard and hit the searchlight thatll bring shields to the windows danny looked at ray then you blow them out and carl takes his shot danny looked at the sheriff worried that hed usurped the mans authority but ellis only nodded in agreement in this kind of situation the natural hierarchy asserted itself trace breen held up his hand for silence listen i got a mike signal ready its noisy but just be patient your earsll sort out the words after a minute or so wait a second said ray i think its time our shooter got into position deputy sims said the sheriff get to your sniping position danny was surprised that ellis had let carl stay so long but when he thought about it some more he understood carl sims was death in the command trailer death was contained but once they put carl behind that tree in the backyardwith clearance to shootwarren shields was a dead man this certainty roiled dannys gut in a way few things ever had and only one thing weighed against the essential wrongness of it shieldss cancer hes dead anyway danny told himself carl hesitated at the door looking back to danny for a final unspoken authorization danny closed his eyes then gave the slightest of nods knowing that his gesture carried the weight of a roman emperors thumb in the arena while carl slipped silently out to his position laurel struggled like a mangy dog to scratch beneath the duct tape binding her ankles her soul might be in free fall but her body could still drive her mad red welts had risen where the tape chafed her skin and she had already scratched two of them bloody as soon as she got momentary relief her mind went back to warren in the past ten minutes she had seen deeper into her husbands heart than she had during her entire marriage the despair hed revealed to danny had shattered her so completely that hope seemed only a quaint dream dimly recalled from childhood guilt suffused every cell of her being and yet to dwell on it now was pointless she had to act warren she said could i speak with you for a minute what about came the disembodied voice from behind the computer monitor my tumor not only that talk would you please come over here i can hear you fine from here this was going to be much harder without eye contact i think you know what im going to ask you why didnt you tell me about your diagnosis when you first got it there was no point no point it would only have made things worse why do you think that he sighed and leaned back in his chair ive seen it again and again in my practice people get cancer and everything in their lives changes sometimes its not so bada thyroid cancer testicular some lymphomas things that are caught early and dealt with but if you get one of the big ones the deadly ones people never look at you the same way again its almost a tribal reaction or an evolutionary one people avoid you youre tainted by death even if the surgeons swear they got it all people think any day now it could come back hes a goner i dont think thats necessarily true anymore his face moved out from behind the monitor the frankness in it chilled her you have a lot of experience with cancer patients i realize you see more than i laurel i might as well have pancreatic cancer okay the worst thing is people start treating you like youre dead long before you die if youre a salesman you make customers uncomfortable your boss smiles to your face but hes already looking for somebody to replace you people say they support you but its bullshit remember that actor who played spenser for hire on tv robert urich he got synovial sarcoma about ten years ago he went public and told the world he was going to beat it what did the network do canceled his series he lived five more years if youre a doctor its worse you scare the hell out of patients nobody wants to be reminded of his mortality they look at a guy like me midthirties perfect physical shapedying of cancer patients dont want to see that they dont want to believe it can happen i dont blame them i didnt want to believe it either but i did finally and i didnt intend to be treated like a dead man for my last few months of life ill be dead soon enough she tried to imagine herself in his situation knowing he would soon lose everything even his children but warren was right there was simply no way she could i can understand you keeping it from your patients even from kyle but why didnt you tell me at least just me you know i would have kept it secret i could have helped you with everything getting to the treatmentsanything you needed his head disappeared again i thought about it but what could you do besides feel sorry for me and worry about the future i wasnt going to endure the former and i intended to spend every minute i had left on earth making sure you never had to do the latter you see whats the point laurel felt like knotting a piece of cord and whipping herself until she bled warren got up and came around the desk he stopped in the squaredoff arch between the great room and the study she rarely saw him unshaven and the dark growth of beard gave him a desperate aura he looked like a distant cousin of himself someone she had met once long ago and then forgotten marriages go through hell when one partner is dying he said people leave each other during illnesses like this they get divorced they have sexual problems and not in the way youd think sometimes the sick partner wants sex but the other person just cant stomach it they cant be intimate with this deathlike figure that used to be the person they lusted after we all have strong feelings of repulsion against death and illness i didnt want you thinking about any of that until you absolutely had to he squeezed his fingers into fists and i meant to keep that day from coming too how his gaze was unblinking think about it she felt lost she hadnt yet learned the rules of logic for the world where death was both inexorable and imminent i dont know you asked me why i got the gun her stomach turned over oh god warren you wouldnt you think i want my sons last memory of his father to be a hairless skeleton shitting himself in the bed a shell of a man who cant talk or remember anything or even feed himself no thank you dont talk like that please why not you want to pretend it wouldnt end that way i cant believe youve been dealing with this alone everybody deals with this alone sometimes there are just people around thats all nobody can really help you i think youre wrong she insisted hoping her faith wasnt absurdly naive you have to be willing to let someone help you an expression of boyish shyness came over his features wellim not that way i know but maybe its time to change just a little i cant i have to deal with this myself is that what youre doing now look at me warren this is crazy no its not i simply didnt foresee your betrayal i should have i see that now but i was preoccupied isnt it funny ive been spending my last months on earth trying to provide for someone who stopped loving me a long time ago thats not true his eyes found hers again and they were devoid of all illusion isnt it ive always loved you warren i just wanted you to really let me in to let me love you and you couldnt i dont think its your fault its justi think your father wanted to make you tough and he did such a good job that you cant be soft you cant be vulnerable at all and when you armor yourself like that theres no way love can get in or out right she nodded sadly and now she hung her head searching for words to explain what she felt i dont know now we need to pull together to try to beat this thing somehow he laughed as though amazed you cant quit can you you cant stop pretending that the world is different than it is where theres life theres hope corny maybe but i believe that and youre a fighter god knows he drew his hand across his throat like a knife no one beats this laurel it would take a miracle and there are people on earth a lot more deserving of miracles than i am what end would it serve anyway youre in love with someone else she stared back unable to lie anymore i dont know i feel like the whole world has been pulled inside out i didnt know how things really were so now that you know im dying you love me again what could she say to that warren cocked his head as though listening to some faint sound beyond her hearing its too late i understand that now for a while some options remain open but then they close if you dont act while a door is open it can shut forever thats how life is if you have a dream when youre young youd better act on it then or the chance will be gone youll never run a worldrecord sprint at thirtyfive you dont become a rock star or a pro baseball player at fortyfive were not talking about childhood dreams she cried suddenly angry were talking about a marriage two beautiful children thats right were talking about family trust remember even as she watched him with hope in her heart his face hardened into a mask of merciless judgment you cant step back into that sacred circle after youve left it to fornicate with another man he raised his arm and pointed at her like some puritan judge you carried his seed into this house the house that i built to protect you and our children you carried that man into this house inside your body and you reveled in it didnt you no warren stepped closer to the sofa his hand delving into his pocket dont lie were through with lies admit what you did i didnt do that you made him wear a condom i didnt cheat on you liar another step closer you make me sick she glanced past him at beths sleeping form searching for the strength to keep lying it could only be a mercy now i never betrayed you warren ive had a hundred chances but i never did he raised his hand high as if to strike her liar whore she shut her eyes and waited for the blow get up i cant my feet are taped together get up damn you get your mama whats the matter beths tiny voice stopped warrens roar the way a toddler running into the street stops a truck she was standing in the arch between the study and the great room her little arms folded protectively across her chest wildeyed warren whirled and glared down at her and she began to whimper laurel tried to get up but he reached back and shoved her down again then he screamed like a man going mad hes going to kill her said danny quickly checking the instruments on the helicopters panel we cant wait any longer christ sheriff ellis cried from the lefthand seat take us up i cant yet danny waited in near panic urging the rotors to full rotational speed the light was gone now thanks to the storm clouds for all practical purposes night had fallen black seven this is black leader said ellis calling ray breen were going airborne in a matter of seconds a soon as were in a hover over the backyard major mcdavitt will hit the spotlight and ill give the command to go the command will be go repeated three times a nogo order will be abort but dont expect to hear that acknowledge black seven tenfour black diamond are you in position in position carl sims replied im aiming at the target indicated as most likely by the thermal imager are you ready and willing to fire yes sir ill acquire the target as the windows go down and fire on your command no hesitation in that voice danny thought death was hovering over the shields house youre cleared to fire on dr shields as of this moment the sheriff said as soon as the windows go down take the soonest available shot understood said carl it better be everyone else acknowledge by turns that youre in position the radio started clicking black one copy that in position two in position three in position black four in position on it went up to fifteen the bells rotors were churning now pulling the craft away from the earth danny pulled pitch with the collective and put her into a hover then pushed the cyclic and applied power the chopper rose into the darkness over avalon danny swung away from the house knowing that the noise of the engines would already have drawn warrens attention do a pedal turn hover over the backyard and hit the searchlight shields will think the sheriff is trying to see into the great room through those arched windows above the blinds hell probably open one of the blinds a little and peer out trying to get a fix on the chopper two seconds later hell die with that thought came a hint of new awareness but danny didnt have time to dwell on it he was making his turn then crossing over the house to the backyard at seventy feet he imagined he could see carl sims scoping the glowing windows waiting for the brightly colored blob on an lcd beside him to become a living man in that moment warren shields would cease being carls parents doctor and instead become a warm target consisting of center mass with a head and four limbs attached carls bullet would arrive like a freight train compressed into a quarterinchwide spear of copperjacketed lead go lower shouted sheriff ellis hit the spotlight danny switched on the thirtymillioncandlepower searchlight mounted beneath the choppers nose and aimed it at the second story of the shields house keeping it away from the lower windows to be sure it didnt interfere with the thermal imagers he nudged the cyclic until they were hovering over the center of the backyard just forty feet off the ground hed already sent a text message warning laurel to keep away from the windows he only prayed shed been able to read it in time black team said sheriff ellis prepare to go on my order danny could see the strain ellis was under in the set of his jaw and the flexed muscles of his big forearms he reminded danny of a firsttime skydiver preparing to jump black leader this is black diamond cried carl weve got a problem repeat a problem at my position this is black leader whats happening ive got a kid on the roof of the house ellis glanced at danny his eyes unbelieving youve got what say again a kid on the roof a childon the back roof of the house south side danny peered down at the roof wondering whether laurel could have gotten beth up there while warren was talking to him he saw no child though no movement of any kind is it the little girl sheriff ellis asked negative said carl male child maybe ten years old hes trying to get into the house through a dormer window its grant said danny sighting the little shape at last he aimed the searchlight just to the right of the dormer see him there he goes an agile figure vanished into the house with simian speed then pulled the window shut after him damn it bellowed the sheriff where the hell is sandra souther doesnt matter said danny holding his hover what do we do now ray breens voice crackled from the radio lets hit shields before the kid can get downstairs right now sheriff elliss lips parted but no words emerged danny wasnt sure what the best course was but he knew one thing you didnt learn how to handle this kind of situation on a football field ellis was far out of his league whats happening on the thermal camera ellis asked we lost the kid but my target is steady carl answered target may even be a little closer to the study window cant tell for sure lets do it barked ray this is our chance elliss head bowed in the ghostly glow of the cockpit lights hes praying danny realized oh jesus hold it shouted carl targets moving laterally now toward the kitchen elliss head snapped up and he squinted uncertainly at the house abort danny said softly as though danny were speaking through his mouth sheriff ellis cried abort abort this is black leader abort come on billy ray pleaded ray abort ellis repeated his voice firm everybody stay in position trace can you route the directional mike signal to the chopper i think so ive lost my target said carl hes off the thermal i think hes in the kitchen this is black six with the thermal cam in front of the house said a new voice i have a faint reading in the kitchen area thats shields said ellis ray breens pumpedup voice distorted the headset speakers forget carl lets do it the oldfashioned way danny felt a rush of panic but ellis only shook his head and said stand down ray land by the command post major are you sure ray pressed goddamn it ellis yelled i gave you an order do not repeat not blow those windows acknowledge two clicks sounded in the headsets ray breen couldnt bring himself to speak so angry was he over the aborted assault danny swung the bell around the house toward the stand of trees that sheltered the trailer as he flared for the landing he saw the sheriffs hands shaking in his lap sensing that he was being watched ellis quickly rubbed his palms together as though for warmth danny hadnt judged the man a coward for his nerves he knew that the minute he took his own hands off the controls they would be shaking too chapter danny crashed through the door of the command trailer on sheriff elliss heels trace breens head whipped up from his comm gear a dip of skoal bulging his bottom lip ellis walked to within a foot of him and demanded to know what was happening in the house trace shrugged like a crackhead being asked for directions do you hear the boy ellis asked grant shields trace shook his head any violence danny asked i dont know the last thing i heard after dr shields screamed so crazy was the little girl crying and asking for chocolate milk chocolate milk ellis echoed uhhuh theyre in the kitchen now the mikes dont pick up much there cause its deeper in the house chocolate milk the sheriff repeated grabbing some paper towels to wipe the sweat and rain from his face christ what about the thermal camera trace keyed a walkietalkie black six this is base what do you see on the thermal i saw three figures turn into two i think maybe the mother picked up the girl theyre real faint now deeper in any sign of a fourth figure ellis asked you see anybody else i picked up a reading after carl lost the boy on the back side just a little green glow but its in and out fades almost as soon as i see it where at trace asked before danny could prompt him kind of central i guess almost like its between floors stairs maybe danny looked at sheriff ellis the boy might not have let his parents know hes inside he might be looking for a way to help his mother ill bet thats why he went back this is a chinese fire drill ellis said theyre in there drinking chocolate milk and two minutes ago we were about to blow the mans head off he tossed the crumpled paper towels onto the blueprints on the table should we just pack up and get the hell out of here let these folks solve their own problems danny was about to say maybe when paul biegler stepped through the door and said you should flush your badge down the toilet if thats your plan you didnt have any idea what this job was about when you stood for election did you ellis sniffed and regarded the medicaid investigator with unconcealed disdain i thought it was about catching criminals and protecting the community not getting between husbands and wives in domestic disputes warren shields is a criminal biegler asserted he may not be in kyle austers class but he has committed multiple felonies would it ease your conscience if hed hit an old lady over the head and grabbed her purse instead of committing fraud get out of my command post ellis said mildly before i knock you out of it biegler stepped fearlessly up to the sheriff you should have blown the windows and taken him out while you had the chance now youve got three hostages instead of two ellis stared back silently but danny saw a vein bulging in his neck what do you say major biegler asked danny his voice edged with mockery i say its time to get the fbi in here past time old billy ray here just proved he hasnt got the sand for this job the sheriff hit biegler so fast that danny didnt see his fist cross the space between them and so hard that the government agent dropped where he stood and lay motionless on the floor i warned him ellis said get him out of here trace trace breen jumped up from the radio and dragged biegler out of the trailer by his heels gulping in awe all the way lock the door when you come back ellis ordered after trace had locked the door the sheriff said rayll be coming in any second soon as he calms down tell your brother to guard the door and keep biegler out i dont want to see that son of a bitch again tonight biegler or ray trace asked biegler trace nodded and went back to his radio sheriff ellis led danny to a corner and spoke softly i hate to admit it but im about out of ideas do we just wait or what danny shook his head grant shieldss sudden reappearance had given him a chance he had thought lost moments ago sometimes the best thing is to do nothing but this isnt one of those times if things arent getting better theyre getting worse you know ellis nodded agreed ive got one idea and i want you to seriously consider it im listening i want to go into the house physically go in and talk to shields facetoface ellis stared back in disbelief unarmed you mean if i go in with a gun hes liable to shoot me as elliss eyes searched his danny realized that the sheriff wasnt the middlingdumb country boy that people like marilyn stone thought he was i get the feeling im missing something ellis said first off shields asks to talk to younot me not his lawyer not his pastoryou then he talks to you like you are his pastor and now you want to walk unarmed into a house where a disturbed man whos probably already murdered one person is holding his family at gunpoint have i got that right danny had tried not to think too much about the risks of his plan but ellis wasnt going to let him off that easy he hadnt known himself how he felt until a split second before ray breen was going to blow the windowsbefore the millimeter bullet in carls rifle would have blasted warren shieldss laboring heart into mush after carl sighted the boy on the roof and sheriff ellis turned to danny for guidance danny could easily have said go rather than abort if he had shields would be dead now and laurel would be a widow a single woman free to spend her life with whomever she chose danny wanted laurel more than hed wanted any woman in his life but when the power had been given him to possess hertwice now he realizedhed been unable to take her the first time because he wouldnt give up his son to have her this time because he couldnt live the rest of his life with a decent mans blood on his hands but something deeper than this had stopped him something he still couldnt quite pin down he was trying to unravel the feeling when five sharp bangs rattled the trailer door open up damn it roared a muted voice its me ray trace got up but the sheriff waved him back to his seat talk to me danny ellis urged times short danny raised his hand to his mouth as though he were about to throw up the dark epiphany that had begun as he hovered over the backyard had finally revealed itself to him shields wants us to kill him elliss eyes went wide what you meanlike suicide by cop exactly because of the cancer i dont know yes and no deep down hes a john wayne type no matter how bad shields may want to kill himself he sees suicide as a cowards way out i dont think dying of cancer scares him the pain of it i mean its the indignity hes too proud for that elliss eyes seemed focused on something beyond danny i can relate to that my daddy died of lung cancer and i watched every minute of it thats no way to go ray breens next bovine bellow shook the aluminum skin of the trailer im soaking wet goddamn it let me in in a minute ellis roared back then his jaw muscles clenched and he stroked his incipient jowls tell me why i should let you go in that house what hope have you got shields trusts me i might be able to get close enough to get the gun away from him ellis snorted if thats your plan forget it thats begging to get killed ask any cop danny almost felt emboldened to confide in the sheriff about laurel the man had a grasp of the complexities of life but how far would a baptist deacon bend the rules what is it ellis asked its cometojesus time danny danny almost spoke up but in the end he decided that revealing the truth meant giving up the only edge he had in the situationand might result in his being barred from the scene i cant put it into words he said lamely but shields respects me if i can look him in the eye mantoman i might be able to make him see reason and if you cant maybe i can get his wife and kids out youre willing to die for that chance an outside chance he wont kill me why not danny thought about it he doesnt believe he has the right ellis clucked his tongue three times then turned to trace breen who was watching them warily have you heard anything just mumbles and static theyre too far from the windows you want to try moving the mikes around try anything that might work ellis turned back to danny with sudden purpose i cant let you do it dr shields may not be responsible for his actions i dont just mean hes distraught that brain tumor may have unhinged the man he could kill you no matter what you believe danny shrugged ive been in tough spots before that was different that was for your country this is just as important not in my view ellis looked at his watch then gave danny a long slow look not unless you know something i dont no sir you know what i know then forget it you stay with me trace let your brother in trace got up and went to the door and tell me the second you hear anything on the mikes you want me to tell carl to move around front in case he can get a shot there leave carl where he is ray almost knocked his brother down as he stormed into the trailer water cascading off the brim of his stetson his eyes burned with outrage before he could vent his anger ellis said ray get your best men up to the front door and the pantry door in the garage were gonna go in the oldfashioned way soon as you place your people i want those hostages out of there breen stared back the light of satisfaction growing in his eyes and shields if he poses any threat whatever to your men or to his family take him out dannys pulse began to hammer in his throat he raised his hand to his neck as if to somehow slow the racing blood ray looked from the sheriff to him yall still planning to use the chopper as a diversion i cant think of a better one said ellis move out ray breen went out leaving a trail of muddy boot prints behind him i want to monitor the directional mikes from the chopper ellis said i want em loud and clear trace make it happen you got it sheriff and keep a thermal cam on the kitchen windows ellis walked to the door without even looking at danny lets go major well listen from the ground but i want the rotors spinning ellis disappeared through the door as danny moved to follow him trace grinned with such malice that danny stopped what is it deputy the feral eyes glinted in the dim light that fuckers dead now shields yep that pleases you damn straight why trace picked up a red paper cocacola cup and spat a brown stream of tobacco juice into it chickens coming home to roost thats why what do you mean by that the yellowish skin above traces chin worked around the plug of snuff in his bottom lip what do you care sounds like youve got a personal problem with dr shields what if i do from what i seen tonight i dont think im the only one the deputys eyes flashed with glee danny almost crossed the little room and grabbed his scrawny neck but that would only bring questions hed have to lie to answer instead he wrapped a sheriffs department poncho around his shoulders and walked out into the rain carl sims had been staring so hard at the readout of the thermalimaging camera that his eyeballs felt paralyzed even for a sniper accustomed to searching terrain through a rifle scope this was torture the lcd monitor displayed a full spectrum of colors as it read the heat differentials in front of its supersensitive sensor system the coolest areas appeared blue warmer objects looked green while the hottest targets transitioned from yellow to orange and finally to bright red the human beings moving behind the window blinds were faint amorphous blobs of constantly changing color and intensity amoebas that pulsed merged separated and then vanished altogether only to reappear in some other place the rain didnt help matters the camera had already gone on the blink a couple of times clearly it did not like moisture but the airconditioning inside the house did with the air cooled to below seventy degrees the thermal camera could detect just enough contrast to reveal the human beings moving within that aireven with the window blinds interposed between the sensor and its targets carl had never been in such a bad shooting situation hed thought he had seen it all in iraq but he was wrong he had shot through high winds blasting sand rain automotive glass and even through the water of a swimming pool he knew exactly how a bullet would behave in each of those situations hed shot during the day and hed shot at night hed shot prone sitting standing and from a moving vehicle hed killed nine men from distances greater than a thousand yards but never had he sat a stones throw from a welllighted house with his vision totally obscured by window blinds trying to locate his target on a camera before he could even put his eye to his rifle scope in iraq if he needed thermalimaging capability hed simply switched to a thermalimaging rifle scope which gave him the equivalent of xray vision zeroed to put a bullet wherever he wanted it but thisthis was a snipers nightmare he didnt want the pulsing blobs to return to his side of the house if they did according to the sheriffs new orders carl would have to give the order to blow the windows himself which meant that he would be guessing which blob was dr shields after the windows dropped it would take at least a full second to acquire his target in the unertl scope and pull the trigger that was if he was right about which blob was dr shields if he was wrong it might take two or three seconds to acquire the shooting was nothing in this case target acquisition was everything this situation was tailormade for a commando assault not a sniper shot delta the seals force recon the fbis hostage rescue teamany of those units would have had the shields family out of there hours ago and without a single casualty but none of those units was here tonight tonight it was ray breens weekend warriors carl had trained with the guys out there in the black body armor and though they might look like commandos they werent most had the reaction times of an average bowling team not the olympiccaliber reflexes of a delta force operator yet any minuteonce major mcdavitts helicopter lifted into the air againthey were going to crash into that house with guns blazing the majors earlier words played relentlessly in carls head theres exactly two professional soldiers here tonight and theyre both under this tent if the sheriff reaches the point of ordering an explosive entry you are the best hope that mrs shields and her daughter have of surviving this crisis you alone carl closed his eyes and prayed the major could find a way to persuade dr shields to surrender peacefully failing that he supposed he should pray that the red blobs would return to his side of the house any other outcome was likely to mean disaster laurel stood on the sink side of the kitchen island exactly opposite warren and beth as warren had instructed her to do when he cut the duct tape from her wrists and legs beth sat on a barstool with both hands wrapped around a mug of borden chocolate milk that warren had heated in the microwave no one had said much since beth calmed down a feat accomplished by prodigious lying on laurels part more fluff about mommy and daddy playing a grownups game warrens discussions with danny seemed to have drained him or perhaps sleep deprivation was finally taking its toll laurel couldnt remember going forty hours without sleep herself except perhaps during final exams in college and probably not even then warren had done it often as an intern but that had been years ago his nerves were stripped bare the slightest sound made him jump and he spoke in quick snappish phrases she had decided to focus on beth and to avoid provoking him at any cost earlier when dannys helicopter had cranked up and hovered over the backyard laurel had felt sure that rescue was imminent yet this belief had not brought her joy even before shed received dannys text message warning her to stay away from the windows shed become certain that the price of freedom would be warrens life as warren strode toward one of the great room windows to check out the hovering helicopter laurel had steeled herself for the sight of her husbands head being blown apart like jfks in the zapruder film her own personal technicolor nightmare one that would haunt her till the day she died in the end though nothing had happened it was as though they had edged up to the brink of disaster then pulled back beth slid off her stool and walked over to the table where shed eaten breakfast thirteen hours before to laurel the memory of that meal was like a glimpse of some other universe one far removed from the absurd one that contained them now warren tracked beth with his eyes as though about to stop her but he didnt laurel watched her daughter pick up one of grants miniature skateboardstech decks they were calledand start rolling the twoinchlong board across the glass table with beth diverted laurel looked across the island at warren and stared until he had no choice but to make eye contact im sorry for everything ive done she said and for everything i havent done i want to make things better tell me what i can do he stared back at her like a man who has forgotten how to speak his bloodshot eyes roamed her face perhaps searching for some clue to what had brought them to this pass as he worked his jaw and swallowed with obvious effort she realized that he was severely dehydrated he hadnt used the bathroom for hours nor had he drunk anything the left corner of his mouth was red she thought she saw the budding vesicles of a fever blister which he only got when he was under extreme stress let me get you some water she offered and some ibuprofen maybe he didnt respond at first then he rubbed his mouth and said ice water as she turned toward the sink beth cried christy dad its christy the corgi had disappeared earlier probably terrified by the thunder of dannys helicopter but now she was back scratching at the doggy door like a starving beggar can i let her in daddy not now honey please beth pleaded please please please please as laurel filled a tumbler with water from the tap warren surprised her by saying all right she probably needs food laurel heard beth unlatch the pet door then christys claws scratching the planks of the hardwood floor shes got something in her mouth beth said its a bag daddy i wonder whats in it dont touch that warren snapped its dirty laurel turned from the sink as though moving underwater certain even before she saw it that christy had retrieved the walgreens bag from behind the hedge survival instinct drove her toward the dog but it was already too late to bury this evidence ill throw that away she said but by then warren was taking the bag from christys mouth as he opened the bag an urge to bolt from the house almost overcame laurel but she forced herself to stay put warren looked into the bag and his eyes narrowed in puzzlement christy must have knocked over the tall container he said i didnt know she could do that laurel felt like a cartoon character staring helplessly upward as a thousandpound weight hurtled down from a cliff top she was every bit as stupid as the coyote wash your hands beth warren said then he walked to the trash compactor opened it with his foot and tossed the walgreens bag inside use the pantry sink aww theyre clean beth stroked christys orange back as the dog ate noisily from her dish go beth jumped up and vanished into the pantry laurel stood motionless before the island recalling an afternoon in college when a bolt of lightning had blasted apart a tree just forty feet away from her on a golf course the very air had seemed to ignite around her and shed stood in the ozonetinged aftermath like an airraid survivor too dazed even to be thankful for her life my water warren said she looked down at the tumbler in her hand oh she handed him the glass her hand shaking i guess ill get my own ice he said going to the freezer im sorry as he shoved the glass into the automatic ice dispenser laurel realized that the dog rather than almost delivering her destruction might have delivered her salvation instead her plan would be risky but she saw no safe way out of this trap warren i have something to tell you he took a thoughtful sip from his glass what is it i wanted to tell you this morning but you were so upset about the auditor thats what i thought anywaythat i decided to wait but now that i know aboutshe lowered her voiceyour illnessyou need to know this it just might change how you feel about everything he set his glass on the table and folded his arms across his chest what are you talking about laurel suddenly sensed that she was making a mistake but what other gambit did she have im pregnant she said simply i just found out this morning he blinked once slowly like a lizard in the sun other than that he gave no sign of having heard her did you hear what i said weve only had sex twice in the last month she prayed that danny wasnt hearing this it only takes once you know it only took once with grant warren looked down at her belly but of course she wasnt showing if anything she looked thinner than she had a month ago more lies he said she somehow managed a confident smile open the trash compactor look inside that bag christy brought in he stared at her awhile longer then he opened the compactor and fished out the walgreens bag out came the tampon carton keep going she said he looked into the empty bag then opened the tampon box he stared for several seconds then drew out the ept box and his expression changed from irritation to a kind of wonder pulling the used test strip out of its little baggie he studied it for a while then looked up at her with suspicion when did you take this test i told you this morning why did you hide it because you hadnt even come to bed the night before and you were obviously upset i decided to wait until youd resolved the audit warren stared at her like a parent listening to a lying toddler if youre pregnant the babys not mine he seemed so utterly convinced of this fact that laurels smile faded why not because i cant father a child anymore there was a roaring in her ears like the birth of an avalanche youwhy not because of the drugs im taking massive doses of steroids plus some experimental compounds kenneth doan prescribed for me he got me into a genentech trial id be surprised if i have even one viable sperm left you must have she said quickly theres no other explanation of course there is all clean beth announced bounding into the kitchen with her wet hands held high she patted christy on the back earning a warning growl then climbed onto a chair and started rolling a tech deck across the table lets continue this later laurel said wringing her hands please warren eyes looked even more reptilian than they had before beth honey what she twirled the little skateboard in a circle mommys got a surprise for us beth looked up from the board her eyes on laurel what is it mommy youre going to get a new brother or sister soon warren said beths mouth and eyes opened wide a baby sister maybe warren said we dont know yet i want a baby sister no more boys warren set the walgreens bag gently on the counter do you have any more surprises mom its your baby she whispered theres no other option but virgin birth and im no virgin thats for sure wheres grant beth asked i want to tell grant were getting a baby sister grants spending the night with gram warren said his eyes never leaving laurels face gram was laurels mother she lived thirtyfive miles up the river in vidalia louisiana i want to stay with gram too no fair hush elizabeth warren said well see about that later does gram know about my baby sister quiet beths head snapped down and she went back to twirling the skateboard warren stepped close enough to laurel to kiss her if this baby was mine you would have told me as soon as you heard i was sick after i got off the phone with danny whos sick beth asked is daddy sick quiet baby warren said in a silky voice please dont do this laurel implored you were trying to give me hope before you would have told me about it then if it was true she answered with quiet urgency trying not to communicate her growing panic to beth i wasnt sure if it would make things better or worse i was afraid youd feel you were missing that much more a man lives to pass on his genes you know that he lifted his hand and tenderly brushed a strand of hair from her eyes she shuddered theres only one reason you would have kept this secret from me youre wrong he picked up the walgreens bag and slapped her with it beth screamed dad stop it shouted a voice from the hallway everyone froze as grant stepped from the hallway into the kitchen stop yelling at mom she hasnt done anything warren looked his son from head to toe and laurel saw pride in his eyes theres my son he said its written all over him it was true grant had warrens muscular body and regular facial features but it was her eyes that looked out of his face warren took three steps toward grant and held out his right hand i knew youd come back son you had the wrong idea before grant drew back but then warren raised his hand and grant slapped it in some kind of highfive ritual theres guys outside with guns grant said lots of them and some of them are mean we have to get ready yes we do warren said calmly were all here now just as it should be i want you kids to go into the safe room laurel shivered at the name are you and mom coming grant asked in a minute yes ill wait until you go then mind me son grant looked back at his father with a combination of disappointment and defiance im not a little kid anymore dad i want to help i can do stuff now grownup stuff warren looked appraisingly at his son then knelt and beckoned him closer when grant came forward warren spoke softly into his ear grant nodded several times then hurried past laurel into the pantry wheres he going laurel asked warren smiled dont worry about it chapter danny was so stunned by the revelation of laurels pregnancy that he could hardly think he and sheriff ellis sat shoulder to shoulder in the helicopter headsets on with the rotors already whirling at full rotational speed i dont think we can wait until carl gets a clear shot the sheriff said his worried face illuminated by the cockpit lights i know you want to but i cant risk shields barricading his family in that panic room he could cut their throats and laugh at us while he was doing it he hasnt done that yet danny pointed out no but hes coming apart in there i didnt like the sound of his voice ive got that jim jones koolaid feeling danny wanted to argue but his mind kept jumping back to the fact that laurel had lied to him about sleeping with her husband this morning shed told him flat out that she hadnt but she had shields doesnt believe her about that pregnancy either ellis added i think that pushed him over the edge he elbowed danny you think shields is the father of that baby jim jones danny thought twenty seconds behind the conversation koolaid i dont know might be the guy who wrote the letter shields is a doctor so he must know what hes talking about he says he couldnt have got her pregnant awin five minutes it wont matter anyway danny closed his eyes trying to work his way to the heart of what had really been going on in his life fuck this ellis said abandoning his deacons rectitude take us up danny danny pulled pitch and the bell leaped into the night sky in seconds he was looking down at the glowing yellow windows of the shields home in miniature an aerial shot of the perfect suburban home a steven spielberg movie this is black leader ellis said tru will carry out explosive entry on my command acknowledge by turns danny gripped the controls with too much force trying in vain to bleed off his anxiety black one in position two in position ellis pointed down toward the front yard i want you to flare out there and hit your light pull him to a window he might come alone and ill blow the doors then danny shook his head as though to clear it you cant send ray in there sheriff youve got to let carl take the shot theres no more time and carls still on the back side of the house move him its too late were going in shields has left us no choice six in position danny descended to feet and flew left turns as he waited for the acknowledgments to come in from this altitude the beating of the rotor blades would sound to someone in the house like a giant robot pounding on the roof maybe that baby is warrens he thought but the sheriff was right shields was a doctor and hed sounded certain about his inability to father a child danny flashed back to the mornings school conference when laurel had started to tell him something then pulled back at the last moment when the next parent showed up at the door this is black six crackled the headset ive got movement on the front thermal cam its real faint but it looks like a large figure moving from the pantry toward the central hall the foyer area whats he doing i dont know its just a green blob sheriff like a ghost keep me posted carl stay ready if shields moves back into the great room we may blow those back windows yet understood im glassing the windows and my spotters on his thermal im ready to fire danny looked down at the house praying for the xray vision promised in the comic books of his youth where was laurel what was warren doing would he really execute her yes answered a voice in his head not to kill her but to murder the child shes carrying its his only chance at revenge against an invisible enemy hell shoot her in the stomach danny thought about the cell phone in his pocket he should already have used it to try to find out what was happening inside but with warren moving around the house what good were texted answers every passing second could change the reality in there maybe its time to call her he thought but would that give the tru the edge they needed or get laurel killed before they could even blow the doors for once in his life danny had no idea what to do grant sat huddled in the pantry with the lights off just as his father had told him to do he had one job pull the big breaker switch if he heard shooting he knew all about the breaker switch because his dad had told him about it when they lost power during hurricane katrina it wasnt hard or anything hed seen twenty different cartoon characters pull the same kind of switch to make the lights go out grant was confused about what was happening with his parents but he was glad to have a job to do and he didnt want to disappoint his father again no matter how crazy it might seem that his dad was acting grant knew there was a reason for it because his dad always did the right thing his mom had told him that plenty of times and now wasnt the time to start doubting it he was only a kid after all as he stared up at the big switch lever his back pressed into a corner someone slid open the pantry window grant jumped because he was startled but after that he stayed absolutely still hed been hunting enough times to know what to do when you didnt want to be seen no movement no sound not even a breath it didnt surprise him that the alarm system didnt chime the same silence had greeted him when he sneaked back through the window upstairs he figured the cops had turned off the system somehow a dark head came through the window and with it the smell of cigarettes then the head vanished and a leg with a boot on the end of it came through four fingers curled under the window frame then the head returned followed by shoulders and the rest of a body grant tensed preparing to spring to his feet and tear out of the pantry but his fathers instructions held him back he could not abandon his post he heard a grunt followed by creaks and stretchy sounds like those his grandmothers knees made when she got up from her easy chair the intruder stood tall in the darkness he was wearing a uniform grant realized just like the one deputy sandra had been wearing grant thanked god there was a shelf above his head or the guy would probably have seen him already when the man took a step forward grants eyes bulged this man had coached the baseball team grant played against in the city championship last year his son was a pitcher on the team a boy who cussed all the time and tried to pick fights after he lost the referees had threatened to throw the coach out of the game for yelling cuss words tracethats what the kids called him coach trace like the natchez trace grant watched coach trace move quietly to the pantry door then open it slowly when light from the kitchen fell across him grant saw a gun in his hand then coach trace vanished a fist closed around grants heart he gritted his teeth and tried to figure out what to do his dad had told him to stay put that he wouldnt be safe roaming around the house hed also said that switching off the lights was an important job a critical job and grant was supposed to wait until he heard shooting to do it coach trace clearly meant to shoot somebodymaybe even his dadbut was that when grant was supposed to switch off the lights he didnt think so because that would be too late he pulled off his shoes walked barefoot to the door and followed coach trace into the kitchen danny was hovering a hundred feet over the front yard when when a panicked voice filled their headsets sheriff this is gene on the front thermal i think somebody may have gone into the house what i had a figure in the shrubs near the pantry window i thought it was dave but then it suddenly faded to half intensity now its gone i think maybe the guy went into the house damn it ellis cursed this is black leader have any of you entered the house no one replied acknowledge proper position by turns ellis demanded come on damn it black one in position two in position three in position the transmissions came in like a military roll call all the way to fifteen without pause sheriff ellis breathed a sigh of relief after the last must have been a mistake for a minute i thought we had a rogue on our hands lets get this show on the road ray breen said ellis motioned for danny to start descending laurel stood motionless in the foyer recalling her attempted escape from the safe room when warren had threatened to kill both her and himself that was the turning point she thought my last chance to get out but it had been no chance at all really because warren would have carried through with his threat she was certain of it now it would have saved the children she thought with a stab of guilt but who could have made that choice surely shed had reason to hope for some other outcome at that point she stared at the door that concealed the entrance to the safe room recalling stories shed read about gas station clerks ordered by robbers to go into a restroom and lie on the floor i wont go in she told herself ill fight here rather than die passively in there maybe grant will help me she turned toward the front door police waited on the other side of it but warren had bolted all the doors and hidden the keys she stepped backward and looked down the hall toward the kitchen which was dark now warren was escorting beth up the hallway the scene looked completely normal father and daughter walking toward the stairs to go up and read a bedtime storyexcept for the pistol hanging from daddys hand somethings different she thought her pulse quickening she looked at her husbands face haggard and swollen only the eyes vital alive with a zealots conviction hes going to kill us she realized this is the end panic of unimaginable power surged through her infusing her with the strength to try anything her hands quivered with energy as though they knew that any moment they might be employed to choke the life out of a stronger enemy my cell phone she thought suddenly should i call danny and tell them to come in shooting warren wont let me do that but i could just open the line something moved behind warren blanking laurels mind of everything but what was in front of her was it only a shadow noit had substance there a darker outline in the darkness of the kitchen she forced her eyes to focus on warrens trying to protect the newcomer in the dark blur behind her husband the shadow floated swiftly up the hallway thin and fluid and somehow more dangerous than warrens gun she felt an instant of guilt for not warning warren but then grants voice shattered the silence coach trace coach trace the shadow whirled toward the piercing scream and warren spun also his gun went up as he turned and laurel saw then that the shadow had made a fatal mistake one that grant must have known it would by spinning toward the sound the stranger had turned his back on warren and by the time he tried to correct his error warren had already fired grownup stuff indeed warrens bullet struck the shadow somewhere vital because she heard the heavy thud of dead weight dropping onto wood a sack of feed hitting a barn floor then grant charged out of the dark and snatched a pistol from the fallen mans hand you got him dad you got him grant leaped into his fathers arms and hugged him tight what the fuck was that sheriff ellis shouted into his headset mike gunshot said danny terrified that warren had just executed laurel sounded like a pistol but what was that the boy screamed we gotta go now ray breen yelled give the order sheriff negative ellis shouted somebody yelled trace trace was that you what are we hearing down there did anybody fire the communications officer didnt respond danny tilted the chopper to get a better view of the house rain still peppered the windshield making it hard to see clearly trace ellis yelled get me dr shields on my radio we cant wait ray shouted we gotta go shut up ray keep this channel clear the radio hummed and crackled and then a womans voice filled dannys headset sheriff weve got a problem whos this sandra souther im in the command trailer wheres trace umi think hes in the house ellis blanched what dr shields just called the phone in here nobody was answering so i came in and picked up dr shields said trace just tried to shoot him in the back and he had to kill him sheriff ellis looked at danny with dawning horror youd better put a rope around ray breen danny said fast ray this is billy ray the sheriff said in a voice danny had never heard from him before i know you heard that brother youre to stand down and let me handle this copy get a grip on yourself for sixty seconds and let me handle it fuck that ray muttered i lead the tru were going in ray ellis balled his right hand into a fist and spoke harshly if you enter that house without authorization youre out of a job i dont give a shit black team prepare to go on my command five seconds ill arrest you for murder ray as god is my witness youll go to death row in parchman and youve put too many men there to want to see it from the inside danny listened in dread for breens go order but it didnt come sandra this is sheriff ellis can you hook me up to dr shields maybe hang on why in gods name would trace do that ellis murmured seemingly lost he had a personal grudge against shields danny said i dont know what it was i just found out myself i should have told you danny touched the sheriffs arm you cant let ray into that house now or later you cant do it hes the tru leader ellis said those boys down there trained under him and im not changing horses in midstream danny looked hopelessly down at the house glowing in the dark hell kill shields no matter what you tell him shields put us all here thats the bottom line if it ends ugly its on his head trace breen didnt start this nightmare warren shields did it all by himself no i helped danny thought with a little handson assistance from the mans wife ive got dr shields for you sheriff sandra said go ahead dr shields this is sheriff ellis can you hear me its faint but i hear you did you just shoot one of my deputies yes sir trace breen snuck in here and tried to shoot me in the back if my son hadnt warned me id be dead now youre a goddamn liar screamed ray keep this channel clear ellis ordered doctor no matter how justified you may feel you just shot a duly appointed officer of the law you have only one option you must surrender im giving you three minutes to walk out of your house with your hands held high in the air you must walk out alone unarmed without any member of your family do you understand shields didnt reply dr shields did you hear me yes the clock starts now i beg you to come out peacefully shields said nothing else hang up sandra ellis said he already broke the connection ellis looked at his watch whoevers on those thermal cams tell me if it looks like theyre going into the panic room the kids may be in there already said a voice but i think the adults are in the kitchen ray breen said i never seen no chickenshit like this in my life billy ray the son of a bitch killed one of our people and you shut up and listen ellis hollered like a quarterback silencing his linemen in a fourthquarter huddle were not waiting three minutes were going in one minute copy danny wasnt sure he had heard right until ray breen said i got you now were ready black six ellis said if shields gets within thirty feet of that panic room were going in keep me posted christ danny thought shields could be in there thinking about giving up and hell still be thinking about it when ray breen blows his head off sheriff elliss strategy was sound giving an unbalanced man a real deadline could easily push him into executing his hostages but danny couldnt shake the feeling that they hadnt done all they could to talk shields out of the house or was that simply his guilt talking was there any hope that shields would surrender the doctor believed hed just defended himself against an intruder trying to murder him he was deep into a siege mentality he was also terminally ill did it even matter to warren when or where he died take us up another hundred feet sheriff ellis ordered danny started ascending wheres laurel now he wondered what will she do when they blow the doors drop to the floor or stand there like a doe in the headlights while bullets spray through the house is there any chance shell try to protect her husband danny didnt think so but even the slightest prospect of this terrified him because he was certain that ray meant to kill shields no matter what thirtyfive seconds ellis said his eyes on his wristwatch stay ready ray everybody key off your watches thirty seconds a silver sheet of rain hit the windshield and danny fell through a black hole straight into afghanistan fortytwo marines were trapped on a mountaintop in the worst storm the companys tajik adviser could remember taliban guerrillas commanded by mujahideen whod fought the russians twenty years earlier were scaling the rock walls like ants to finish off the americans it was only a sideshow to the battle raging at tora bora but to the marines marooned on the mountain it was the end of the world an army black hawk had already been shot down as it hovered to fire a hellfire missile into a cave mouth an air force a had held off the guerrillas for a while but now even the warthog had been grounded when night fell there would be no stopping the taliban they were already too close to the marines for artillery to knock them off the mountain and the spectre gunships in the theater were committed to tora bora at any moment danny expected the marines to call in artillery on their own position as joe adams had famously done on hill in korea anything was better than being captured by afghan tribesmen then a delta force officer volunteered to drop onto the mountain and set up a protective perimeter if a helicopter pilot would try to airlift the trapped marines to safety to do so would mean almost certain death danny didnt want to die he had no illusions about war he was fortythree years old and he hadnt reached that age by volunteering for suicide missions yet hed felt a voice rising up his throat trying to volunteer him why was he trying to live up to the legacy of his father the redfaced crop duster whod fought in the big one he certainly had no faith in his immortality under fire but at bottom he realized it was simpler than all that if someone didnt take a bird up there those marines would die fortytwo husbands fathers and sons fate had placed their lives in dannys hands of the two other pilots there that day one had a son hed never seen and the other always had his eye on the main chance which meant flying milk runs for rock stars not dying in afghanistan so without thinking very much danny had raised his hand and said ill go the most meaningful reward he ever got in the military was the look in the delta operators eyes after he volunteered the look said you are a crazy fuck and youre probably going to die but brother you are one of us danny landed on the mountaintop three times before they got him he wrung performance out of that chopper that the engineers whod designed it would never have believed his pave low took more ak rounds than by any physical law it should have survived and the blasting sand and water stripped off half the paint and all the decals by the end of the second run but eventually the ship gave up the ghost it took an rpg round to kill it dannys doorgunner screamed a warning and danny jinked at the last second but the hissing rocket clipped his tail rotor and the controls went gooey on him he didnt even remember the crash only an absolute certainty that the end had come and that it had come in a chopper as he had always known it would he thought of his father as he fell with his beloved pave low windmilling in the air like pete townshends guitar arm there was a bright flash in his head then the face of a girl hed loved in high school and thennothing only later did he learn that his crew were killed on impact danny was ejected seat and all through a hole the mountain ripped in the cockpit during the ships final spin a piece of shrapnel tore through his left leg and some afghans fired a burst of ak rounds at him connecting once in the same leg and then a miracle occurred inspired by dannys desperate barnstorming the pilot of one of the ac gunships over tora bora threw away his regulation book diverted to the besieged mountain and rained hell and death down on the afghans for ninety minutes straight the delta force operators tied danny to a stretcher they found in the wreckage of his chopper and carried him down the mountain fighting a rearguard action all the way the last six marines came with them a hundred meters from the bottom elements of the first marine division rushed up like a camouflaged tide and swept them back down to safety they gave danny and his dead crew a mackay trophy for that action but the ceremony was hollow for him he never again saw any of the marines hed saved that day he did receive a couple of letters one from a wife in kansas thanking him for saving her husband the jarhead had added a postscript himself at the bottom semper fi buddy youre always welcome here they put in a snapshot of their kid too a freckled girl standing in short rows of corn danny had only read the letter once but he kept it in his top dresser drawer to remind him that sometimes you just had to say fuck it and do the right thing no matter what it cost if you did you never knew what someone else might do to help you or what good might come of it ten seconds sheriff ellis cried his voice pitched high from the stress take us down danny danny loved laurel he hadnt the slightest doubt about that and he hated his wife for using his son as a hostage he had an obligation to michael that nothing could remove but didnt he also have an obligation to laurel what if she was carrying his child god forgive him a healthy child who could speak and listen laurel had given him everything she had to offer and asked nothing in return shed simply trusted that hed do the right thing by her and that he had not done five seconds said sheriff ellis this is black leader were going to hover low and hit the spotlight everybody danny twisted back the throttle and slammed down the collective and the helicopter dropped like king kong off the empire state building shiiiiiiiitttt ellis screamed his face bone white with terror whats happening we lost the engine danny shouted intentionally throwing the ship out of trim brace yourself anything less than a crash might have left ellis capable of issuing orders on the way down so danny had pulled an emergency autorotation virtually killing the engine and causing a controlled crash in which only the energy stored in the stillwhirling rotor blades could spare them from death red emergency lights lit up the instrument panel and the whoopwhoop of the low rpm warning filled the cabin he waited until the last possible instant to flare then yanked up on the collective certain that the primal terror scrambling the sheriffs brain would prevent him from giving the go order the bell bounced hard on the front lawn its rotor tips spinning bare inches from the brick front of the house what just happened ray breen shouted are you guys okay holy christ yelled ellis clutching his chest in terror danny unhooked his harness and scrambled out of the chopper onto wet grass when the sheriff saw this he assumed the ship was about to explode and tried to do the same but danny leaned back inside and yelled give me ten minutes ten minutes alone with him stay on those mikes comprehension dawned in elliss eyes followed by a blaze of anger but danny broke away and sprinted around the chopper to the front door of the house he slammed into it with all his weight and started banging on it like a fugitive at a church door open up its danny warren its me its danny over his shoulder he saw two alien figures in black body armor break cover and charge him theyd closed to within twenty feet when the door fell away and someone yanked him inside chapter warren slammed the door and stared at danny with wild eyes what the hell are you doing trying to save you danny replied panting from his exertions he saw the gun in warrens hand then laurel over his shoulder watching with terror in her eyes through her fear danny saw the glow of gratitude warren looked nothing like the man danny had taught to fly high on his left shoulder his shirt was stiff with clotted blood he had the face of some soldiers danny had seen those who had been asked to do too much or to witness too much and had somehow found themselves still walking the earth after all their friends were dead wheres your kids danny asked trying to orient himself from memory the kitchen and den were a few yards behind laurel the hall to dannys right led to a guest room then to a back door to warrens study behind warren was the great room which opened onto the study and the master suite beths in the safe room laurel answered after her husband refused to i dont know where grant is we need to get grant in the safe room too grants fine where he is said warren no hes not that threeminute deadline was bullshit they were coming to get you when i set down on your front walk warren processed this in silence i want to talk to you but we need to get everybody into the hall first why shields asked they have thermal imaging devices out there they can see through the window blinds but the hall walls will shield us warren slowly shook his head its twenty feet danny shouted pointing to his right shields seemed to reconsider you go first danny had hoped the doctor would lead the way giving him a chance to grab laurel and try for the front door but if hed tried that and failed whatever trust he now enjoyed would be lost he backed slowly down the hall his eyes on warrens gun his left heel slipped on something then caught he looked down and saw a dark tacky stain on the floor blood hed seen whole slicks of it in the belly of his chopper he figured the stuff on his shoe belonged to kyle auster shields wasnt following him he noted and laurel was still stuck behind her husband in the foyer warren if you stay where you are theyll blow down that door and toss in a flashbang grenade the cs already in place warren blinked twice then came toward danny motioning for laurel to follow him he stopped after the hall walls closed around him danny held out his hand and beckoned laurel forward he could tell she wanted to run into his arms but she moved slowly as though warren might decide to shoot her at any moment you two stay on opposite sides of me warren said nervously laurel obeyed like a convict worried about a brutal guard warren kept his gun hand on dannys side as though he expected danny to make a play for the weapon i violated orders to come in here danny said trying to keep his voice under control so i hope youll listen to me theres a boy out there who shot twentyseven people in iraq and thats just what they recorded officially hes got a bullet chambered with your name on it warrens face didnt change at all thats welcome news to you isnt danny said thats what i realized when i was hovering over your house thats how you want to die the doctors right cheek twitched warren laurel said softly is he right im right danny said not taking his eyes from warrens face but youre not going to get that surgical snipers bullet youre going to get ray breen and his weekend commandos blasting in here with grenades and submachine guns and if anybody gets in the way like grant or beth or laurel well thats just too bad do you hear me warren yes is that how a good father checks out the cheek was twitching steadily now you know its not danny pressed how a man dies is his own business but hes got no right to take anyone else with him grant and beth can leave warren said but not her he jabbed his pistol toward laurel she stays till the end the end of what danny thought the end of you or of all of us behind warren laurel put a shaking hand over her eyes for an instant danny wondered if she might smack her husbands head or make a grab for the gun but she was past that point now she was barely functioning lets get those kids out of here danny said mcdavitts a goddamn traitor ray breen shouted over the radio hes telling shields everything we got out here cant you hear that mike signal i cant take any more of this shit sheriff ellis said dannys about to walk out of there with those kids ray keep this channel clear im giving danny the time he asked for carl sims lay on the wet grass behind his pecan tree and listened to the menagerie of voices on the radio net that linked the members of the tactical response unit ray breen was going to need a straitjacket or a horse sedative if he got any madder even if he didnt he was exactly the wrong person to send into a hostage situation carl had figured the sheriff would pull ray off the tru after his brother was shot it just seemed like common sense but this wasnt the marine corps and carl wasnt in command he didnt know why major mcdavitt had risked his life to charge into the house alone but carl was glad he had anything was better than sending ray and his cowboys in there with grenades carl made sure the extra poncho hed brought was keeping the rain off his rifle then went back to studying the lcd on the thermal camera he suspected that the major might have gone in to move dr shields back into his line of fire if so carl didnt plan on disappointing him any doubt about shooting the doctor had vanished it was simple arithmetic now one death was better than five the kids doc danny said again wheres grant warren was staring at danny with a strange new intensity what are you really doing here a shiver of fear raced along dannys shoulders warrens hollow eyes seemed suddenly to hold the very knowledge that danny would have given anything to keep from him had he somehow sensed the truth had physical proximity triggered some primitive sensory apparatus that could detect sexual chemistry between people do you always have to be the hero warren asked im no hero i just care what happens to this family i dont want to see your pictures on the front of tomorrows citizen over a story about a terrible tragedy and i dont want to listen to every asshole in town saying it just goes to show doesnt it you never can tell warrens mouth smiled but his eyes remained disconnected from the movement so lets get those kids out of here huh the dead smile vanished the baby im carrying is yours warren laurel said averting her eyes from danny i know it thats the one ray of hope in all the darkness youve been living with this past year danny searched her face but he saw no sign that she was lying maybe shields had fathered the child i told you warren said it cant be mine you said it was unlikely not impossible shields looked at the floor then at his gun laurel was playing a dangerous game is it possible she asked softly just possible maybe he whispered but if it isi dont even know if you could keep it my cells are so screwed up now from the chemicals and hormones the risk of birth defects would be so high i dont care laurel averred so firmly that danny believed her if youre dying then we have to risk it youre going to live to see this baby born danny didnt know whether she was speaking from the heart but her eyes flashed with conviction and her words rang with truth warrens face was glistening maybe hes finally breaking down danny thought maybe the hope of something positive before his death was enough to lift shields out of the hell he had lived in so long danny prayed that sheriff ellis was hearing this conversationand holding ray breen on a tight leash warren wiped his eyes then looked back at his wife i want you to get a blood test will you do that she nodded but danny saw that the idea had scared her a dna test danny asked thinking that this alone was proof that shields saw them both alive in the future no that takes too long mark randall can come in here and draw some blood and they can have it typed at the hospital lab in thirty minutes danny felt dizzy you mean now why not randall lives practically around the corner on sagramore street warrenwe dont have that kind of time why not because the guys outside are about to blow this house apart you want them to sit around while you perform some kind of inhouse paternity test i dont see why thats asking too much it could resolve everything how far along is she danny asked how could they even get a needle to the fetus without i dont know ultrasound or something laurel spoke with a feminine power that made both men turn if you truly loved me it wouldnt matter whose child im carrying warren gaped at her danny wondered why the hell shed said that did she have a death wish asking a man to accept another mans child from the woman he was married tothat was definitely outside the envelope wasnt it you dont know what love is warren said i see that now on the contrary laurel replied its you who has no idea what love is danny was trying to think of a way to get her off this tack when a disembodied voice said merlin has broken the password its magic danny nearly jumped out of his skin thinking someone else from the tru had slipped into the house when no gunfire erupted he figured grant was playing a video game on one of the home computers but when he saw laurels face he knew he was wrong she was terrified a triumphant blast of trumpets echoed through the house then the voice repeated merlin has broken the password its magic warrens face was shining as though all his fatigue had suddenly melted away everybody into the study he cried waving his pistol he herded danny toward the back door to his study danny had little choice but to walk ahead as he did some of warrens words during their earlier negotiation came back to him ive got another computer working on it what is it youre waiting for the name danny what name the guy who was screwing my wife or still is for all i know danny stopped in the study door his heart banging in his chest my name is about to pop up on his computer screen warren if we go in here one or all of us is going to die theyll see us on the thermal cam and theyll fire this time at least ill die knowing the truth warren pushed past him with laurel in tow she brushed against danny as warren yanked her down the single step and the scent of her pierced him to the core you wont live to read the screen danny yelled youre free to go major but not laurel everything thats happened today was leading to this moment danny couldnt abandon her he stepped down into the study but he made sure that the men outside knew where he was if youre set on committing suicide all right but im not giving up on you maybe they wont fire if im in here with you seeing that danny meant to stay warren gestured for him to stand on the far side of the desk opposite the aeron chair that faced the computer screen then warren stood laurel to the right of his chairbetween himself and the study windowsand sat before his computer his wife was now a human shield one that had probably merged their two figures into one on the thermal camera outside shieldss ultimate goal might be suicide but he meant to live long enough to discover whod been screwing his wife merlin has broken the password the computer announced yet again its magic warren laughed like a gleeful twelveyearold playing a video game as he began clicking his mouse danny flicked his eyes back and forth working out the geometry of the room he had to get carl a shot fast if warren pulled dannys name out of laurels hotmail account he was a dead man shields had already shot a deputy and his medical partner how hard would it be to shoot the guy whod impregnated his wife warren had set his pistol in his lap so that hed have both hands free to work the computer laurel stood two feet to his right with the desk separating her from danny her eyes locked onto his willing him to do something anything to stop her husband from opening her email messages whats warren looking at now he wondered a list of old email from me danny never signed his name to casual emailsnotes about where and when to meet like that but the longer onesthose describing his feelings for laurelhed always signed and being a woman laurel had probably chosen to save exactly those for posterity what do you see danny asked trying to stall shields shook his head in wonder im reading a message telling my wife to meet her lover at the usual place strange isnt it that one wont be signed danny thought but the next one might and im waiting to find out who the father of my wifes child is this is a real redletter day wouldnt you say warren clicked the mouse again probably moving to the next email laurels face twitched with fear five more seconds could kill us both danny realized screw the risk carl has to shoot warren youve got to stop this youve given laurel the third degree all day long they could blow you away right now right where you sit you make an easy target because youre sitting warrens hand flicked out like a striking snake and grabbed laurels right wrist a split second later he was on his feet jerking her hand out of her pants pocket its her phone danny realized hes seen her phone danny started around the desk but warrens gun snapped up its black eye staring a hole in dannys chest third degree echoed sheriff ellis sitting in the command trailer with sandra souther third degree jesus dannys telling us to shoot hes telling us to kill shields ellis grabbed a walkietalkie off the table this is black leader were going to blow the windows on carls order repeat black diamond has tactical command carl the second you have a shot take it understood im looking at the thermal image but theres no separation either the wife or major mcdavitt is in the line of fire danny said shields is sitting down if you cant see him on the thermal blow the windows and take your chances will do be cool everybodyill say when scoping now damn it billy ray cursed ray breen let my men take this bastard out this is exactly what we train for negative said the sheriff carl has the call acknowledge ray ray clicked his radio twice warren held his wifes motorola razr high like a trophy the silver flipphone had obviously been open while in her pocket and danny was sickeningly sure that this razr was her clone phone the one she used exclusively to talk to him warren lowered the phone and looked hungrily at its screen youve had your hand in your pocket all day even when you were taped up that was one too many times laurel was wavering on her feet danny wished she would faint and give carl a clear shot lets see who youre trying to call warren said working at the tiny keys or were you texting somebody as laurels eyes found dannys warrens thumb stopped working at the keypad he looked up at his wife and a shudder went through him then he stuck the barrel of his gun into laurels belly i knew that wasnt my baby warren danny said softly buddy shields laughed strangely then tossed the cell phone to danny danny caught it and looked down at the screen which displayed a message beneath sent messages on it were five words written in the pseudoshorthand of cell phone messaging u haf kil hm you have to kill him danny said as though reading the message aloud but he was speaking to carl sims i guess theres only one thing left to learn warren said who fathered the bastard in her belly keeping his pistol pressed firmly against laurels stomach he reached down with his left hand moved his computer mouse and clicked a button warren dont laurel begged in a voice close to breaking dont look but he did he stared at the screen like a man witnessing his own death no goddamn itit cant be danny expected the gun to swing toward him but instead warren clicked frantically at the mouse its not here doesnt he fucking sign anything he swept the monitor off the desk with a crash its over warren danny said with relief you cant find out what you want to know not tonight put down the gun man shields stared at danny as though reality had finally sunk in after hours of insanity he was no closer to learning the truth than he had been at the beginning a glimmer of real hope sparked in dannys heart then his cell phone began to chirp warrens eyes dropped to dannys pants as danny cursed himself for forgetting to silence his phone warren seized laurels neck in the crook of his elbow and dragged her around the desk with his gun jammed into her stomach when he reached the point where danny stood between him and the windows he threw laurel to the floor put up your hands he said aiming at dannys chest i dont want to kill you major but i need to know what the sheriffs telling you danny put up his hands warren patted dannys pockets with his left hand when he found the cell phone in the back pocket he shoved his pistol hard beneath dannys sternum and fished out the phone with his other hand then he backed away taking care to keep danny between him and the windows and flipped open the phone warren didnt yet understand what had happened with the phones but he would in seconds danny prepared to dive onto laurel which would clear carls line of fire and shield her from warrens revenge danny warren said softly look at me danny knew he should dive but now that it had come to this he found himself unable to do it he had betrayed this man and he couldnt consign him to the grave without accepting responsibility for what hed done warrens gaze cut through him like the eye of god to the darkest reaches of his soul danny sensed no judgment in the gaze though only grief a profound sadness that a man shields had believed to be noble had turned out to be merely even terribly human it was you he asked all along it was you danny nodded once warren flinched as though danny had shoved a needle into his heart why can you tell me that danny saw no point in speaking anything but the truth i love her shields seemed to take this explanation with equanimity he looked down at laurel who watched him fearfully from the floor it struck danny then that there were four of them in the room the woman two men and the unborn child who might belong to either man perhaps the same realization struck shields whatever emotion came to him he could not endure it he screamed something unintelligible then swung the pistol at dannys head danny leaped out of its path lost his balance and rolled onto the floor hed planned to cover laurel with his body but she was too far away now he clapped his hands over his ears and tucked into a fetal position facing away from the windows you coward shields screamed youre supposed to be a hero look at him laureltheres your fucking hero danny closed his eyes and prayed for death to take the right man carl stared at the thermal imager like a snake watching a transfixed bird every atom of his instinct told him that the only red blob still standing represented warren shields a moment ago it had been twice its current size blow the windows he said into his headset he put his right eye to the unertl scope closed it against the coming flash and squeezed two pounds of pressure out of the rifles threepound trigger the dim rectangles of the study windows flashed white in his left eye and bright yellow light spilled across the lawn carl glassed the study with robotic efficiency searching for dr shields there the doctor stood alone aiming a pistol at something below the windowsill you couldnt ask for more justification to fire as carl applied the last pound of pressure laurel shields lurched into his sight picture and seized her husbands gun hand carl longed to revoke his shot but his motor cortex had already sent the signal to his trigger finger shields and his wife both flew backward dear sweet jesus no please no searing flashes lit up the interior of the shields house then detonations like impacting mortar rounds rolled across the lawn carl jumped to his feet and started running even with his hands over his ears danny heard the shattering concussions of the grenades when he felt confident there would be no more he scrambled over to laurel who lay motionless on her back her eyes closed laurel can you hear me are you hit she didnt respond blood was seeping through her top shed been hit in at least four places the wounds widely dispersed how was that possible hed heard only one rifle shot after the windows went down glass he thought shards of window glass a man screamed to dannys left danny turned and saw warren on his back gasping for air and waving his pistol as though having a seizure his shirt too was peppered with blood danny got to his feet and stamped on warrens wrist pinning his gun to the floor he was about to reach down for the weapon when someone screamed get on the floor get down danny turned and saw what appeared to be a creature from outer space clad from head to foot in black ballistic nylon and kevlar body armor it had enormous insectlike goggles covering its eyes ray breen get out of the way breen shouted brandishing a submachine gun or ill drop you where you stand danny held up both hands he cant fire im standing on his arm im going to take his weapon get out of the way major keeping his left hand aloft danny bent and tugged the gun from shieldss unresisting hand then tossed it away into the great room two more figures in black appeared behind breen but the tru commander didnt lower his weapon instead he moved to his right angling for a clear shot at shields not knowing what else to do danny dropped to his knees and shielded the doctor with his own body somebody stop him he shouted realizing as he did that ray breen was the senior officer in the room get sheriff ellis get off that bastard ray yelled this thing aint gonna end but one way breens gun was an mp danny saw capable of firing eight hundred rounds per minute on automatic if he pulled that trigger both danny and shields would die go ahead warren rasped from beneath danny shoot breen moved closer trying to fire around danny put the gun down ray danny turned and saw the long gray barrel of carl simss remington jutting through a shattered study window carl held the rifle almost casually at waist level but no one in the room doubted that a bullet fired from it would strike its intended target he killed my brother ray shouted in a voice beyond reason i dont want to shoot you carl said softly but i will breen studied the snipers face then turned back to shields and aimed his mp past danny right at the doctors head carl didnt raise his rifle an inch but when he spoke something was in his voice that had not been there before disdain danny thought youre always asking me how many men i killed over in iraq the truth is i dont know but i know this ive killed better men than you the gun in ray breens hand quivered under the stress of the war raging inside him after several seconds that held eternity within them he lowered the weapon to his side as danny crawled toward laurel ray lunged forward and drove his boot into shieldss rib cage with a crack then every light in the house went out chapter two seconds after the room went black something knocked dannys legs from under him his tailbone cracked against the floor but he forgot the pain when a cold pistol barrel invaded the soft flesh between his jawbone and windpipe he tried to jerk his head back but a strong hand grabbed his hair and shoved the gun deeper into his neck get up hissed a voice in his ear on your feet or ill pull the trigger danny obeyed shouts of anger and confusion reverberated through the darkness but the whispering gunman dragged danny across the room with total assurance danny stumbled on something but his captor held him erect nightvision goggles he wondered his shoulder brushed a doorjamb as tactical lights arced through the room and then he passed into cooler air move to the right a knee drove into his back hurry danny saw light ahead he thought of crying out but the gunman read his mind make a sound ill blow your brains all over the hall it was warren danny realized of course it was who else could it be but where were they going why didnt shields just pull the trigger and be done with it toward the light warren urged running him up the hall now where are we going youve got a date with destiny you lying piece of shit grant knew hed waited too long to pull the circuit breaker but how could his dad expect him to wait in the pantry while everything was happening somewhere else hed waited as long as he could stand it and thenjust after hed sneaked out to find his fatherthe whole back of the house had blown up by the time he got back to the pantry men were yelling and screaming all over the house but grant still did what his dad had told him to do and sent blue sparks flying from beneath his hands now he was running through the dark making for his fathers study in the great room he collided with something hardsomething that shouldnt have been there two strong hands seized his upper arms and a face like something out of a video game appeared before him a blackgoggled grasshoppers face lit by the beam of a spotlight shining through the great room windows get that kid out of here someone shouted grant was hauled off his feet carried out through the garage and set down in the driveway it was still raining the shouts of panicked grownups ricocheted through the night the masked figure looked down at him for a moment then raced back inside the house desperate to learn what had happened to his parents grant ran around to the front yard the last place hed heard mr dannys chopper the big helicopter straddled the front sidewalk like a futuristic bird that had somehow landed in the present by mistake its rotors were still spinning grant moved toward it but kept close to the shrubbery so that no other deputies would see him as he neared the chopper he froze his father and mr danny were crossing the open space between the front door and the helicopter dad grant shouted mr danny wait for me wait up when he reached the two men grant realized that his father hadnt heard him he grabbed his dads arm then jerked back as an almost unrecognizable face whipped around and glared at him grant exclaimed his father as though hed never expected to see his son again get out of here grant said mr danny run no way i want to come with you guys you cant said his father you have to stay here son im coming grant insisted im not staying here by myself his father looked down at him with an expression grant had never seen on his face before it made grant want to cry then his father yanked open the chopper door and said get in the back son hurry harness yourself in grant scrambled into the helicopter a machine that hummed and shook as if it were more alive than he was mr danny and his father climbed into the front seats and then mr danny did something and the whining overhead got louder grant could feel the rotor blades trying to pull the ship off the ground his father turned around to say something but then the front door of the house opened and two of the blacksuited men ran out both were waving guns but grant knew they wouldnt run beneath the spinning blades one of the men leveled his gun and aimed at the front of the helicopter in the next instant mr danny shouted something and the ship leaped into the air as grant tumbled out of his seat he saw treetops sweep past the window and then the moon shining high and white through a break in the clouds he only wished his mom were there to see it danny had flown in crazy conditions before but never with a gun jammed into his gut the pistol wasnt the same one shields had aimed at laurel this one was a nickelplated automatic trace breens gun he wondered or maybe kyle austers if he had one shields kept the pistol where his son couldnt see it but the range was still pointblank close enough for the burning powder to set dannys shirt on fire as the bullet ripped through his abdomen from side to side the chopper hurtled eastward at fifteen hundred feet the house already far behind danny wondered what kind of response sheriff ellis was mounting to this new development hed started calling over the radio only seconds after they lifted off but shields had shut off everything but the interphone circuit where are we going danny asked as casually as he could havana upriver warren said tersely thirty miles vidalia louisiana take us up to two thousand feet danny turned north and started ascending vidalia was a town of five thousand mostly workingclass people who lived on the floodplain across the river from the great bluff at natchez why vidalia warren tilted his head backward were dropping grant off at laurels mothers house i see so this trips just for you and me warren didnt answer danny had a lot of experience flying at night but almost always with the aid of nightvision goggles and in a much more powerful chopper flying the bell through mountains of storm clouds was a completely different thing he wasnt afraid but he was concentrating hard enough that the gun against his side kept surprising him bluewhite flashes of lightning illuminated the towering cloudscape and he could hear grants cries of awe despite the fact that the boy wasnt wearing a headset danny couldnt see much on the nearlightless land below but the rivers and lakes he used as landmarks gleamed like black mirrors as the chopper raced over them the buffalo river lake mary the homochitto river and then the mississippi curving east toward natchez did i hear you say were going to grams grant yelled moving forward and setting his chin on the tight seam between dannys and warrens shoulders warren concealed the gun beneath his bloody shirttail and slid the headset off of his right ear thats right son wheres mom home danny kept his face expressionless is she okay shes fine those men werent there for her youll see her soon get back into a seat and fasten your harness what about you your shoulders bleeding bad im fine warren said touching his shirt which was now matted against his wounded shoulder wow grant cried they had crossed over the bluff at natchez and the land fell precipitously away two hundred feet below the old city the lights on a long string of barges winked up at them cool the boy said they have two bridges here get into a harness son okay okay grants head vanished you dont know laurels okay danny said softly you didnt even check warren grimaced shut up what asked grant what are yall saying up there nothing son look for landmarks down there can you see the riverboat casinos while grant searched the broad black river warren said laurels mother lives just off carter street the main drag right behind the levee maybe you know that already no danny started descending after he passed over the two great bridges spanning the river there was only one brightly lit road in vidalia the highway leading westward across louisiana the section that ran through the town was called carter street danny found it easily and soon he made out the grassy hump of the levee running at right angles to the highway thats it said warren pointing down at a small house with an older lincoln continental parked on the street in front of it where do you want me to land streets fine theres no traffic the neighbors began opening their doors and windows as the chopper dipped under two hundred feet by the time it landed in the middle of their street a crowd had gathered in the rain thinking they were witnessing either a crash or an invasion i see gram grant shouted shes standing on the porch jump out and run to her son grants head reappeared above the junction of shoulders what about you warren seemed unable to find his voice danny leaned forward and saw tears in the doctors eyes major danny and i have to help the police do something shields croaked but mom will be here soon are you sure whats wrong dad warren covered his eyes with his left hand but his right still gripped the gun danny wondered if shields would really shoot him in front of the boy on balance danny figured he would ive just got a headache shields said i stayed awake too long you need to go son you take care of your mother all right grant stared at his father in confusion till you get back you mean thats right go on now were late already grant turned to danny his eyes dark with foreboding mr danny do what your father told you itll be all right go warren snapped grant seemed on the verge of tears dannys heart went out to the boy but then grant fell back on his loyalty to the man he trusted above all others he nodded to his father and said dont worry ill take care of mom then he climbed out of the chopper and ran toward a small grayhaired woman standing on the porch of the little house with the lincoln out front im sorry warren said almost inaudibly you owe that boy every second you have on this earth danny said i know you hate my guts but you need to stop this suicide trip and get your family back together people in the crowd were venturing toward the helicopter shields stabbed the gun into dannys side get us airborne where are we going heaven how does that sound i dont believe in it and neither do you shieldss eyes shone with something like madness valhalla then isnt that where heroes go when they die only if they die in battle an ironic chuckle well then thats where were going danny didnt know if it was better to die on the ground or in the air but one thing he did know in the air he had a chance to live because he would have control of the aircraft a passenger bent on both homicide and suicide complicated matters but that was better than the bullet he would get for refusing to take off he pulled up on the collective touched the cyclic and lifted the bell over the streetlights swinging gracefully back toward the bridges there was no real advantage in flying over natchez but something was pulling him to the mississippi side of the river why dont we call the sheriff and check on laurel danny suggested warren lifted the shiny pistol and pressed its barrel against dannys left temple why dont you shut up and fly tell me where just keep us over the river how high two thousand feets fine danny spiraled upward in a slow climb wondering how long the gun would stay at his head it didnt leave him much maneuvering room hed already begun forming the rudiments of a plan if he could roll the chopper and pull enough gs he might be able to open shieldss harness and dump him out before the doctor shot him but he couldnt do that with a gun to his head are you afraid to die major shields had asked the question in a philosophical tone danny shrugged to tell you the truth i should have died long before now you didnt answer my question i dont want to die the gun barrel entered the shell of dannys left ear but are you afraid to die danny thought about it he felt a lot of things at this moment but the least of his emotions was fear ill tell you what i think it isnt dying thats hard its living shieldss jaws flexed angrily what are you trying to say are you saying im a coward no im saying life aint a bowl of fucking cherries im saying you owe that little boy whatever time you can give him no matter what shape youre in i think hes tough enough to watch you die it might not be pretty but hell get over it a hell of a lot easier than hell get over this shit shieldss jaw was working so hard it looked as if he were trying to grind his teeth away youve got all the answers dont you or so my wife seems to think i dont have any answers danny snapped tired of shieldss paranoia im just trying to get by same as the next man all im saying is its living that takes courage in my experience the hero who charges the machinegun nest is sometimes the guy who didnt have anything to go home to to me the real hero is the guy who goes home to face whatever life hands him no matter how tough it might be thats easy for you to say youre a lucky son of a bitch and life handed you my wife danny put the bell into a hover above the river far below through sheets of rain twinkling headlights moved steadily between louisiana and mississippi ive caught the short end a few times youve been dealt a tough hand ill grant you but ive seen guys get a lot worse with no time to set things right or even say goodbye to the people they loved in muddy holes on piles of sand burned alive in a fucking humvee its like you said back at the house it doesnt make any sense you want an answer warren youve got two kids who love you two healthy kids who need everything you can give them and wholl give you everything they have in return that means more than you know take it from me shields lowered the gun back to dannys waist i killed a cop tonight he said in a guiltridden voice well id say he asked for it he was a mean bastard who would have caught it one way or another down the road theyd still jail me for it or execute me shields began to laugh strangely if only i could live all the years it would take them to execute me after sentencing me to death id take that deal all right danny wondered if he had any chance of getting back to the ground alive as they hovered in the dark he noticed that several cars had stopped along the northern span of the bridge then he saw red lights flashing at the mississippi end whose baby is laurel carrying warren asked with sudden intensity danny turned to him in the cramped cockpit their faces were as close as lovers i dont know christ cant anybody just tell me the truth i truly dont know but it doesnt matter anyway shields closed his eyes do you really think shes dead for the first time danny sensed as opportunity to save himself but despite shieldss closed eyes the gun still pressed into his left hip if they had been flying without the doorsas danny sometimes didor if shields had neglected to fasten his harness a highg maneuver might have set the stage for danny to dump his hijacker out of the chopper but that was useless speculation danny looked back at the flashing red lights they were static now at the center of the bridge i dont know all i do know is laurel was right if you really love her it doesnt matter who the father is shieldss eyes popped open how can you say that danny shrugged age maybe youll get there eventually no i wont it was so easy to forget the man was dying danny wondered if shields forgot it himself sometimes for the first second or two after he woke up in the mornings maybe danny had a paraplegic friend whod experienced that he said there was nothing worse than the crushing weight of remembering that he was paralyzed and couldnt get out of bed i think love means giving up something danny said maybe the thing that means the most to you pride maybe thats what she was talking about thats what they want us to do you know only then do they truly believe you love them some of the anger had drained out of shieldss eyes you really love her dont you danny didnt answer hed already confessed once and he saw no reason to do it again when repetition might buy him a bullet shields raised the gun to dannys temple again say it major i love her danny admitted suddenly aware that all his worldweary talk about death was bullshit hed found a woman he wanted to spend every day of his life with and he had two kids of his own who needed him desperatelymaybe even three the thought that those children might come in harms way without their father there to protect themthat scared the hell out of him it also gave him the resolve he needed to kill warren shields if he could you want to kill me dont you shields said danny shook his head but his heart wasnt in it warren leaned against the leftside door on his side and lazily aimed the gun at dannys belly i wanted to love her he said looking puzzled i justi guess i knew her too well you didnt know her at all warren raised the gun until its muzzle touched dannys cheek if you lived through this night what would you do best i could would you take care of them them laurel my kids sensing a route to life danny nodded a quarter mile behind and below the doctor more red lights spun and flashed on the bridge its not fair shields muttered it never is danny said amazed that the man could have practiced medicine for years and not learned this lesson until his own diagnosis shields had actually believed himself immune to the vagaries of fate danny knew a lot of pilots like that the house always wins doc its just a question of when the way i see it youre alive now today let tomorrow take care of itself your family needs you lets take this machine back to athens point and find out about your wife theyve sent up another chopper shields said pointing with his arm across dannys chest danny turned scanning the night sky for lights there was only one other chopper in the county a jetranger that belonged to a private businessman danny didnt think they could find a pilot to fly it in this weather but this was an extraordinary emergency as he searched the sky the bell rose unexpectedlymaybe an updraft off the bluff he thought then he turned to ask shields what the hell he was talking about and saw that he was alone in the helicopter danny hung suspended in the darkness above the river as alone and alive as hed ever been shields was probably still alive too tumbling down through space the nickelplated pistol lay on the empty seat unnecessary now hes hit by now danny thought looking at the altimeter they were high enough that shields would have reached terminal velocity prior to impact danny had heard grisly stories from a vietnamera cia pilot comparative descriptions of what happened when a prisoner was thrown from a chopper and landed in water as opposed to smacking dirt or concrete or was ripped to shreds in treetops strung through the canopy like red and pink ribbons shields was dead no doubt about it danny pushed down the collective and dropped toward the river searching for the body the two bridges threw off ambient light but not enough to help him sight shields he didnt really want to see the corpse but laurel was certain to ask not to mention the sheriff in that moment danny realized that he believed laurel was still alive in spite of her wounds and unconsciousness he started to switch on the searchlight but then he noticed people lining the rail of the bridge above him there was no way anybody had seen shields leap from the chopper but if danny started searching the water with a light it wouldnt be hard to figure out what had happened god how laurel would suffer if that story got out her kids too grant shields would go through life dreading questions about his father what happened to your real dad uh he died how killed himself wow dude im sorry danny didnt want the boy to suffer through that conversation again and again and with a little luckhe might not have to danny executed a quick pedal turn then swept upriver jinking from side to side like a pilot under duress but steadily cheating toward the louisiana bank the inside of a river bend is the shallow side since it doesnt bear the full pressure of the current trying to cut its way into the land danny headed into a patch of darkness along the inner shore not far from a seafood restaurant a place where he knew there was a sandbar when he saw the pale line where the water met the sand he picked up the shiny automatic and fired two shots through the windshield then he rolled back the throttle shut off the fuel and pulled his second autorotation of the night he wouldnt have done it if the chopper wasnt insuredlusahatcha county couldnt afford to replace an aircraftbut it was had there been no chance of witnesses he might have done things differentlyjettisoned the doors for one thing sop for ditchingbut with towns on both sides of the river and the levee close someone might well witness the crash and the aircraft might be recovered he needed all the witness statements and physical evidence to bear out a scenario in which two men had fought until the end that would be the story for the sheriff anyway laurels children could be told something more palatable at least until they were old enough to understand as the bell fell toward the shallows danny took his feet off the pedals and let the ship spin beneath her rotors as she might if her pilot had been ripped away from the controls after four or five rotations he felt like puking but he steadied the craft just in time to flare before impact as the dark water rushed up to meet him he made sure he was less than twenty feet from shore then dropped the bell into the river helicopters always roll when they fall into water the rule is to not fight the roll but assist it but danny never got the chance when the first rotor hit the water the ship was slammed onto its side as though by the hand of god river water poured through the smashed plexiglas and the bell began to sink danny knew he should have taken a big breath before impact but he hadnt thought of it now he fought to escape his harness with barely enough air to keep his brain alight the massive power of the mississippi carried the chopper downstream like a piece of driftwood a millisecond before fear became panic dannys training asserted itself the belt disengaged and he swam through the hole where the door should have been praying he was still close enough to the bank to swim to safety after he surfaced he broke through to the air and into what seemed a ring of flaming islands pools of jp floating on the water by the light of the burning fuel he saw the sandbar kicking hard he fought his way toward the grainy shingle then crawled high enough on the sand to be safe if anything exploded be alive he said to laurel just be alive fifteen minutes later danny was led to the backseat of sheriff elliss cruiser and given a blanket and a hot cup of coffee he stank of kerosene he was lucky that he hadnt caught fire during his swim to shore a dozen cruisers were parked on the crushedoystershell lot of the seafood restaurant some from lusahatcha county some from adams county and others from concordia parish a crowd of officers stared at the burning wreckage floating downriver before long ellis heaved his bearlike form into the front seat he cranked his bulk around laid his forearm on the seat and studied danny his eyes unreadable they told me laurels in surgery danny said ellis cleared his throat mrs shields grabbed her husbands arm at the instant carl fired to save your life apparently carls bullet hit dr shieldss gun mrs shields was struck by shards of glass and fragments of the gun but also by some fragments of carls bullet danny steeled himself for the worst how bad she just got into surgery they stabilized her in the er youre not telling me anything they dont know yet damn it they dont know what all got hit because the wound tracks have to be probed any head wounds no thank god what about her stomach the verdicts still out on the baby according to the er doc you rest and get your head clear youve got a lot of questions to answer danny looked downriver at the burning fuel fading now as it slid southward toward athens point the lights on the bluff across the water seemed to look down in reproach but he didnt care you should have told me about mrs shields ellis said you and her i mean what would you have done if i had probably sent you home exactly ellis grunted well look whats happened this way shieldss kids are alive laurels alive at least for now it could have ended a lot worse trace breen is dead whose fault you figure that is a long and weary sigh seemed to shrink the sheriff dont say that around ray not if you want to live another day danny took a sip of coffee savoring the heat as it migrated down his to his chest ray has no business leading the tactical response unit he hasnt got the temperament for it i agree with you there i want to go to the hospital sheriff ellis grunted again disagreeably this time im not sure thats a good idea you dont want the rumors starting any faster than they have to i dont care about rumors she might st raphaels billy ray come on back to athens point haul ass ive chauffeured you enough times to earn a ride ellis took a deep breath then blew out more air than danny could hold in both lungs dont spill that coffee he closed his door started the cruiser and swung it up over the levee soon they were on louisiana headed north through empty black cotton fields with elliss lights flashing red against the rain the kind of night run huey long had favored in his heyday this was the fastest route back to athens point since highway on the mississippi side ran southward through woodville thirty miles east of the city as the cruiser roared along the deserted highway at ninetyfive miles per hour danny went over the sequence of events prior to the assault when warren had caught laurel sending her final text message u haf kil hm danny didnt understand why shed risked so much to send that message for it had seemed only to state the obvious tell me about those last few seconds in the chopper sheriff ellis said breaking dannys reverie they told me you said you were fighting with shields lost control and crashed in the water by the sandbar thats right and he was ejected through the windshield the door danny amended if shields had gone out through a shattered windshield his body would show severe lacerations his door was knocked off or open i dont know which i heard you said he went through the windshield danny shook his head door but he wasnt wearing his harness so he hit the instrument panel first hes probably broken up pretty bad i was too busy to see much ellis drove without speaking for a while then he said did you see him drown no i was trying to save myself uhhuh what is it danny asked angrily spit it out well jimmy doucets an adams county deputy he was parked on the bridge and he says he saw somebody fall from the chopper before you dropped down low thats bullshit danny said mildly he couldnt see anything from up there it was pitchdark and raining jimmys got good eyes he says he saw something big fall past your lights a buzzard maybe i was a quarter mile north of that bridge and two thousand feet above it thats what i told him ellis looked back over the seat with an inscrutable expression not anger and not outright suspicion either it was almost a sly look come on danny you took him out didnt you what shields got cute with you up there and you killed him how the hell would i kill him he had the gun maybe you took it away from him youll find the body halfway to new orleans maybe but youll find it and you wont find any bullet holes except in his shoulder auster shot him if the gar and the gators dont eat him first ellis said maybe you pitched him out then you could fly a chopper sideways through a keyhole if you wanted to danny felt himself going pale i told you what happened ive got nothing to add ellis smiled course you did better for everybody this way anyhow the helicopters insured so what the hell ill have a brandnew one sitting on the pad in two weeks and i still want you to fly it we just have to get past whatever bullshit inquiry ray breen will try to bring on your head danny sighed i think my flying days are over ellis looked back again his disappointment plain how come danny just shook his head the sheriff faced forward the downward angle of his big head radiating disappointment up ahead the lights of the athens point bridge shone out of the darkness the cantilevered span had been built during the stennis era when mississippi had expected to get a bigger share of the space program than it ultimately did danny still remembered the ferry that the bridge had replaced and how hed stand on the thrumming deck with his father while the green hills receded behind them and the louisiana lowlands slid closer some people believed the bridge had kept athens point alive during the lean s when the oil business crashed now there was talk of a big new bridge at st francisville just thirty miles down the river as danny wondered how that might affect his hometown he suddenly understood why laurel had sent that last text message she wasnt instructing him to kill her husband she was giving him permission shed realized that after the revelation of warrens cancer danny might be too mired in guilt to act without mercy and shed been right he had remained on his feet to confess his guilt when he should have been diving to cover her with his body that mistake might yet cost laurel her life sheriff ellis barely slowed down as he crossed the athens point bridge a minute later they turned into the parking lot of st raphaels hospital as ellis parked under the admissions bay danny leaned forward and squeezed his shoulder you did all right sheriff ill see you around he got out and walked toward the double doors the pressure of elliss gaze on his back then a voice caught up with him i hope shes all right danny danny held up his right hand but kept walking ive got to ask ellis called is that kid yours or what it doesnt matter danny murmured thats the thing he walked into the hospital ready for anything epilogue three weeks later danny stood sweating outside the city courthouse in the only suit he owned may had arrived and it was already eighty degrees before noon he was waiting for marilyn stone his lawyer whose office was around the corner they were due for a meeting at the office of starlettes lawyer starlette herself had left town soon after the rumors about danny and laurel began filtering out of the sheriffs department shed taken the children and flown back to nashville threatening to file for divorce and take everything danny hadhis money and the kids danny had been in a daze since the night of the standoff so he hadnt argued too much hed simply called marilyn stone and asked her advice shed promised to do all in her power to ensure that danny didnt lose custody of michael and also to get him reasonable access to his daughter starlette ultimately chose to file for divorce in mississippi rather than in tennessee where theyd married because mississippi was still a fault state and you could pay a heavy price for adultery danny called a female voice over here he looked down bank street which housed many local attorneys offices marilyn stood on the sidewalk in the bright sunshine looking nothing like the plain jane who showed up at the airport twice a week for flying lessons she wore a navy suit and lipstick and she appeared to have curled her hair danny waved and walked slowly forward he dreaded having to sit across a table from the woman who was willing to institutionalize their son to get revenge on her soontobeexhusband guess what marilyn said her eyes twinkling what starlette caved he stopped what do you mean i mean shes willing to give you custody of michael danny blinked in the sun trying to process this unbelievable statement what do you mean when did this happen she didnt even get on the plane in nashville this morning what marilyn nodded i just found out myself butwhy id like to say it was my great lawyering but the truth is much simpler three weeks as michaels sole caregiver was all it took when starlettes lawyer told her she couldnt institutionalize michael if you were willing to take him she cracked the sudden release of weeks of tension nauseated danny this wont be free marilyn cautioned nobodys that lucky what do you mean youll have to pay a price to get michael a big price danny shrugged whatever starlette wants your interest in your last oil well your entire interest danny rocked on his feet he didnt even want to calculate what twelve feet of pay sand was worth at abarrel oil whatever financial security he had that was it okay he said done marilyn put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed i already said yes for you he laughed ruefully i guess you know me a potential client once told me that hed heard divorce was expensive i said it wasvery expensive when he asked why i quoted another client back to him because its worth it danny was still trying to anchor himself in time and space when do i get michael starlettes loading him on a continental flight in about an hour you can pick him up at the baton rouge airport at six fiftythree pm danny decided right then to rent a plane the distance was short but michael loved to fly with his dad i dont know what to say youve changed my life marilyn and youve saved my sons life come with me she said smiling strangely i have one more thing to do for you she took his hand and led him into her office past the male receptionist then up a flight of stairs to a door at the end of a narrow hall this is my vip dining room i had some food brought in because i figured wed be hungry after our meeting she opened the door laurel was standing behind a table laden with boxes from the indian restaurant a couple of blocks away she was wearing a bright blue skirt and a white linen top and she looked like nothing so much as the lovely teacher who had welcomed michael with a smile two years ago danny had only seen her in black since warrens death and then only from a distance the change almost took his breath away he looked back to thank marilyn but all he saw was a closing door i heard laurel said about michael danny nodded i cant really believe it you see the worst didnt happen no laurels face was still pale and she had lost seven or eight pounds she could ill afford danny saw darkness under the makeup beneath her eyes are the kids in school he asked only a few more days have you made any plans for the summer she looked away i was thinking of getting out of town for a while i cant take all this gossip grant and beth have had a really hard time at school you probably should danny said trying to mask his disappointment i guess youre going to be busy with the divorce i dont know with michael more than that i imagine laurel nodded then gestured at the bags on the table are you hungry i couldnt hold anything down she smiled as if at a fond memory me either i miss you laurel bad ive been worried about you her smile cracked and she put up her hand to cover her eyes he started to go to her but she waved him back its been hard she said i have a lot of guilt about what happened i dont feel too good about it myself she dropped her hand revealing bloodshot eyes i dont know where to go danny do i get in the car and drive to the beach take the kids to disney world theres this huge hole in our lives now and i dont know how to fill it he cleared his throat i have an idea what go down to the travel agency and buy three plane tickets for disney world forget the internet tell everybody you know that youre leaving town pack up the suv where all the neighbors can see you when it gets dark load up the kids and drive out to deerfield road well close the gate and shut out the world theres fifty acres for everybody to get to know each other in i can move out to the cabin by the pond and you guys can take the house well fish cook out let your dog chase the fourwheeler whatever if the kids get bored ill rent a plane and fly us anywhere they want to go even disney world nobody will know where you are or what youre doing and you can have all the time you need to get over things he thought he saw hope in her eyes but he wasnt sure do you think she said faltering would it be all right considering the kids or would it just be selfish he walked around the table but stopped a foot away from her theres something i havent told you i didnt think you were ready to hear it she drew back obviously afraid of learning yet another nightmarish fact about her husbands death do i need to know this you do before warren died he asked me if i would take care of you and the kids she looked back at him in disbelief dont lie to make it easier for me i swear by all thats holy he asked me to take care of you he was a good man in the end he wasnt thinking of himself fresh tears flowed from laurels eyes then she collapsed against his chest and began to sob he stroked her hair and held her gently letting her cry it out what do you think he asked at length about that fake vacation she nodded into his chest when he asked tomorrow she pulled back and looked up at him with guarded hope will you take care of us before he could answer she took his hand and placed it on her abdomen all of us danny felt the heat of her body through the linen memories of all the days he had thought he would die young flooded through him bringing an awareness of years granted that seemed a pure grace given those he had seen stolen from men much younger than he i will he said till theres no life left in me she closed her eyes and leaned on his shoulder that better be a long time from now he squeezed her tight knowing only one thing with certainty that every moment was a gift acknowledgments special thanks to cw john p goodrich usa ret for his assistance in understanding what it means to fly a helicopter in peacetime and in war my heartfelt thanks also to tom johnson a vietnam helicopter pilot and wonderful writer whose book to the limit i recommend to everyone with the highest possible praise thanks also to jane hargrove chuck mayfield jerry iles md betty iles geoff iles david gaude doug wike and curtis moroney as usual i take responsibility for any and all mistakes in the book i would also like to stress that the actions and attitudes of the deputies in this novel are not representative of the deputies or police officers i have known in mississippi the simple fact is that in a thriller someone has to be the bad guy in real life the law enforcement officers i have known have been dedicated and sometimes heroic individuals who serve the public for very little compensation without their constant labor few of us would get any sleep at night i urge everyone to make an effort to see how they might be able to help their local departments to acquire such technology as flir which is mentioned in this novel the greatest beneficiaries will be you and your children about the author greg iles is the author of eleven new york times bestselling novels including true evil turning angel blood memory the footprints of god sleep no more dead sleep the
