the lost american brian freemantle i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine as you like it shakespeare chapter one housework had become important a timefilling ritual and ann moved dutifully through the apartment vacuuming carpets already vacuumed tidying things already tidied and dusting where no dust had had time to collect from the previous day she tried to concentrate upon what she was doing but by now the ritual had become mechanical as well as dutiful like so much else shed expected the uncertainty of course the doubts even for there to have been any other reaction after what had happened and where they were would have been more unsettling than the feelings she now had because it would have been unnatural but it should have gone by now lessened at least not got worse she stopped the vacuum abruptly the movement a physical correction only some things seemed to have got worse to think everything had would be to exaggerate and it would be wrong dangerous to exaggerate certainly not the way to settle and adjust imagining things to be worse than they really were the hostility had definitely gone from the other wives eddie insisted that it had never existed in the first place dismissing the impression as her confused response to the trauma of the divorce and the reaction of her family and the abruptness of the moscow posting but ann knew she wasnt confused they had been hostile shed rationalised the attitude even understood it now shed lived in moscow the western diplomatic community in the soviet capital was an enclosed insular and her strong opinion claustrophobic existence the same faces at the same receptions and parties with the same smalltalk and the same gossip shed been a subject of that gossip maybe she still was because not everyone had come round and was friendly now the woman half her husbands age whod wrecked a happy marriage and if shed done it once she could do it again especially in the unnatural circumstances of where they were and how they lived crammed together in constant contact bloody hypocrites shed seen the flirtations and guessed the affairs and those she hadnt guessed had soon been reported on the gossipmill at least she and eddie had been honest refused to lie and confronted all the consequences the bitterness and the recriminations and the nastiness god the nastiness which was more than any of them were doing ann abandoned the unnecessary dusting sitting in a chair forward on the edge not relaxed arriving at another ritual the increasing daily almost reflection of what that honesty had cost she told eddie and eddie told her that each had expected to happen what had happened but she knew that wasnt true she certainly hadnt anticipated her familys reaction she knew theyd be upset obviously they couldnt be anything else but shed thought they would have come round to accepting the situation by now not gone on behaving like some parody of victorian rectitude practically refusing any longer to acknowledge her existence whenever her mother wrote which was only ever in response to her letters never initiating any correspondence herself there was always the conclusion involving her father daddy sends his regards but ann knew that was a lie and that her father had done nothing of the sort and what father sent his regards for gods sake it wasnt a parody of victorian rectitude it was victorian rectitude and it was hurtful and unnecessary and cruel and was one of the reasons one of the main reasons why she was so miserable she looked across the room at the drinks tray and then at her watch and then at the drinks tray again and decided against it pleased at her control quite a lot of the women started cocktails at four but she hadnt not yet and neither would she ann determined that would be giving in and she didnt give in she hadnt given in to her family nor to the unpleasantness of eddies divorce ann stopped examining the word had eddies divorce been unpleasant of course it had on the surface the tightlipped meetings with the lawyers and the financial arrangements and the division of property the dismantling of years together but there hadnt been from ruth anything like the sort of reaction that had come from her family and from ruth it could have been expected she was after all the abandoned wife saddled with two bewildered sons and an empty house and empty memories wondering where she went wrong which wasnt a question for her because ruth hadnt gone wrong anywhere she hadnt had affairs and she hadnt drank and she hadnt failed and she hadnt when eddie announced hed fallen in love with someone else railed against him or fought him or hated him eddie said hed imagined her behaving like that because that was the sort of woman ruth was but ann didnt believe that either she was surprised another uncertainty and she knew eddie was as well no sneers and no reproaches it was ruth who initiated the letters more often than not always chatty always friendly and always love to ann the discarded wife could send love to the woman who had replaced her and the best her father could manage was regards and that a lie ann thought bitterly she returned to the beginning of the reflection the honesty had cost a lot for them both so had it been worth it another part of the ritual increasing too of course it had been worth it she decided in familiar reassurance she loved eddie as much more as she ever had and she knew he loved her it was just moscow if it been any other posting to any other embassy somewhere where they could have had outside friends and outside interests and driven a hundred miles out into the country on sundays if theyd felt like it then ann was positive everything would have been all right she made another mental pause everything was all right between her and eddie which was all that mattered moscow was important to eddies career vitally so all she had to do was endure it and be as philosophical about it as she could and ignore her bloody stupid family like they were ignoring her and wait until the next posting she supposed langley was a possibility after moscow ann decided shed like that eddie was almost certain to be upgraded as high as g was a possibility because he had a lot of experience and was respected because of it if he got g theyd probably be able to afford something in georgetown the district of washington she liked best but maybe not with the support he paid ruth and the kids if not georgetown alexandria then she liked that almost as much it would be wonderful to be in washington thered be concerts and plays at the kennedy centre and new york was only an hour away on the shuttle so they could see the broadway shows whenever they wanted and drive out into the country whenever they wanted to go and out to restaurants and not have to wait three hours for service and make friends with people they wanted to be friendly with not those forced upon them by some restricted hemmedin environment moscow was an unnatural existence so it automatically followed that she should feel unnatural in it endure it until the next posting she thought again thats all she had to do it was gone five before she took the first drink while she was preparing dinner and she made it last until eddie came home promptly at six which was another ritual she was waiting directly inside the apartment entrance he kissed her and held her tightly and she held him tightly back needing his closeness he did love her and she loved him just endure it she thought ann fixed his drink and made another for herself and said steak that ok at least they were able to eat well with access to the embassy concessions wait until i can teach you how to cook them outside eddie blair was a tall heavy man of casual almost slow movements he spoke slowly too the texas accent pronounced the slowness and the frequent references to cookouts and range riding and the tendency to dress in jeans and sports shirts for the more casual parties conveyed to some the impression of countryboy stolidness which was intentionally misleading blair was one of the most highly regarded foreign service officers within the central intelligence agency already at supervisor rank im looking forward to it said ann honestly how was your day he grimaced average yours average she said liar she thought she said betty harrison called suggesting lunch but i said no why not said blair because i lunched with her yesterday and two days before that and im lunching with her tomorrow thought ann she said i was busy here in the apartment nothing for you in the bag he said all their overseas correspondence arrived in the diplomatic pouch i wasnt expecting anything she said father sends his regards she thought you she said blair reached into his briefcase and took out the letter still sealed from ruth he said unnecessarily lets open it said ann theyd made each other several promises when they married one practically a cliche was no secrets and that extended to the letters between him and ruth blair interpreted it by never opening his first wifes letters at the embassy when they arrived but always waiting until he got home she refilled his glass and decided after a moments hesitation against having a third herself while he opened the letter and read it shes taking the kids to her folks place in maine for thanksgiving he reported there was a few seconds silence and then he said pauls grades arent good teachers apparently disappointed johns either ann wondered if it was because of the breakup and knew he would too it wouldnt have been possible here in moscow of course but elsewhere he would have taught the boys to cookout and ride and hunt and fish and have gone camping with them at weekends and on vacations he missed the boys she knew his guilt the guilt he sought to minimise despite the undertakings about no secrets was as much for abandoning them as it was for abandoning ruth ruths been getting out he said still reading the letter guy called charlie rogers someone she knew at high school friend of the family apparently how do you feel about that she said wishing immediately she hadnt blair frowned up at her pleased for her of course he said what else should i feel nothing she agreed at once he could have made an argument out of it if hed wanted to thank god he hadnt she was still nervous of arguments in their relationship shes sent some pictures said blair he looked at the prints for several moments and ann stared at him alert for any facial reaction there wasnt any here he said offering them to her paul was the older fourteen in two months time john was nine darkhaired like ruth paul had his fathers blondness and would be big too already he had to be almost five feet she guessed theyd posed specially for the photographs to be sent to their father their lips were barely parted in reluctant indications of a smile they were standing against ruths car in the driveway of the rosslyn house if eddie got the headquarters posting he expected hed be very near to them ann realised so he would be able to take them on cookouts and hunting and camping would the boys accept her ruth had or appeared to have done at least despite the strained tightness of the initial confrontations and the immediate aftermath of the divorce thered only been one meeting with the children and theyd treated her then like the enemy she was which she realistically accepted was all she could expect she hoped the attitude would change with time is john wearing braces on his teeth she said passing the pictures back blair stared down and said difficult to tell ruth doesnt say anything about it in the letter he held it out to her for her to read another part of their no secrets agreement ann hesitated appreciating the gesture but reluctant to take it from him it was part of the undertaking between them and he always read her letters from her mother although more out of courtesy to her than for any other reason because they were so bloody stiff and formal but she always felt the embarrassment of prying when it came to ruths correspondence which was probably illogical considering that shed taken the womans husband but it was nevertheless a sensation she always experienced there was of course the other reason to want to read the letters from his first wife could have indicated a jealousy ann was confident she didnt have anything to be jealous about not with ruth it was only to be expected that eddie would still have some feeling for her love even of a kind but not the kind that was any danger to her so there was no reason for jealousy and no reason therefore to do anything that might hint she felt that way like reading her letters later she avoided ive got dinner to fix first as soon as they started to eat ann recognised that the steaks were slightly more overdone than he liked but blair didnt complain sorry she said not wanting him to think she didnt care its fine really he said john ingram has got his posting where she said ingram was blairs counterpart at the british embassy the resident for britains m london said blair lucky john ingram thought ann london was where shed first met blair when hed been attached to the american embassy there liaison attache with the british ill miss them she said lucinda ingram had been one of the few wives to accept her almost from the start a bustling nononsense woman one of the ones who didnt flirt she drank a bit though but never beyond control lucindas going would mean she was losing her closest friend the farewell party is next saturday same faces same smalltalk she thought when did they hear about the move today apparently which was why lucinda hadnt called ann supposed shed only be hearing about it herself tonight i must buy her something a farewell gift said ann that would be nice maybe something from the gold shop on gorky street there wasnt much else she could think of in the way of a gift that was obtainable in moscow johns asked me to look out for their new man who is it someone called brinkman jeremy brinkman wonder if he knows what to expect said ann new arrivals were always lionised a fresh face initially with fresh stories and news from outside their confines john doesnt know him is he pleased to be going lucindas attitude had always been that moscow was a steppingstone assignment for her husband and somewhere like anywhere else that had to be enjoyed by a careerists wife its a promotion so i think so said blair i dont know that he likes the idea of being stuck in london dear god just for the chance thought ann she said will he be hes not sure how longs he been here three years said blair which meant they had a year to go if three years were the norm ann calculated endure it she thought she said thought about where youd like to go next apart from back to langley instead of answering blair said what about you where would you like to go if you were given the choice anywhere so long as it was away from this damned place ann thought she said i dont care where i am just as long as its with you he reached across the table for her hand and she felt out for his i love you said blair i love you very much i love you too said ann very much pietr orlov travelled on a diplomatic passport which meant he was able to bypass the frustrating delays and formalities at sheremetyevo airport it meant too that his incoming luggage and freight was spared any customs examination he stood watching the dourfaced inspector in headbent consultation with the official from the foreign ministry guessing both would be resentful of his ability to bring so much back from america orlov hoped it wasnt too much but he wanted it to look right someone recalled to moscow after two years in new york would surely bring back the maximum he was allowed the check completed the foreign ministry official came back to orlov with the manifest welcome back said the man six months calculated orlov longer if necessary like returning with the maximum allowance everything had to look exactly right if natalia were to be protected and orlov was determined she would be hed loved her once even if he didnt any longer not in the way that a man should love his wife anyway he was going to take every precaution to ensure her safety harriet was as insistent about that as he was dear wonderful harriet a year then if it had to be orlov hoped it wouldnt be as long as that he didnt think he could exist for a year without harriet chapter two jeremy brinkman entered the foreign office from parliament square guessing this the final meeting before the moscow posting would be the waste of time the others had been selfimportant officials in mahogany chambers lecturing about dos and donts and what was expected and what was not expected brinkman knew all about selfimportant officials who disparaged changing governments and considered themselves perhaps rightly the true governors of the country his father who was one had been a good teacher in all things but particularly about what was expected from the son of a permanent under secretary whose father before him had been permanent under secretary and whose father before him had been permanent under secretary and whose family service to the country to the country and to the king and to the queen not some passing political fancy with its cant and hollow propaganda stretched back earlier than that brinkman knew too that he could fulfil the expectation but his way proving that he didnt need to rely upon family connections not unless there wasnt any other way in which case it would have been stupid to ignore the advantage but was able to open his own doors and to achieve his own successes hed proved it by getting to cambridge on a scholarship so that the family money was unnecessary and by getting his rowing blue something else they couldnt use their influence to obtain any more than they could have bought or arranged his double first in history or the passmark for the required foreign office entry examination although his father had hinted that help was available if the mark were borderline still not properly aware of his sons unshakeable intention never to do anything borderline in his entire life but on his own his way which was why brinkman had applied to the intelligence service purposely selecting a division as far away as possible from his fathers sphere of influence but sensibly not so entirely removed from the foreign office to whom mi were responsible that there wasnt a final safety net if he lost his grip on the high trapeze not that he expected to because jeremy brinkman was supremely confident to the point not infrequently of having people misunderstand the attitude as arrogance brinkman knew he wasnt arrogant because he knew everything about himself just determined and properly necessarily confident the selection of the countrys intelligence service had annoyed his father of course sir richard brinkman was of the school who found no difficulty in ignoring britains most recent spy scandals and thought the idea preposterous that a chap would read another chaps mail or that one could doubt the loyalty of anyone who had been to a recognisable handful of good schools and proper universities he accepted the existence of such a department but more from the historical precedent of its formation during the reign of queen elizabeth i than for its practical necessity but certainly didnt consider it something with which the brinkman family with all its traditions should become associated so theyd argued repeatedly not in any gesticulating shouting manner but in the level measured logic of a permanent under secretary at the foreign office intent upon persuading someone with less experience the obvious error of a mistaken judgment sir richard hadnt raised his voice or changed the calm demeanour even when he realised that his son couldnt or wouldnt accept the logical argument but was determined upon a despised branch of the service between them now there existed the sort of unspoken unannounced truce that sometimes develops between equally strong and equally implacable armies who recognise that continued fighting is pointless but that fresh strategies are necessary brinkman smiled at the analogy as he walked along the now familiar hushed corridors moscow had created the strategy for him he was regrouping far away from any intrusion the old man might be able to make brinkmans smiled faded as he arrived at the designated doorway and proved his identity and handed his appointment chit over to the waiting security guard at least he hoped he was far enough away there wasnt any formal introduction because that wasnt the way these sorts of interviews were conducted but brinkman knew the mans name was maxwell and that he was number three on the moscow desk and the person who would after analysis and checking ultimately receive his report maxwell waved him to a chair and offered a round tub of cigarettes which brinkman who didnt smoke refused maxwell took one coughed lighting it and said shouldnt i know filthy habit brinkman smiled politely but said nothing waiting for his superior to lead there was a protocol about everything in the foreign office and brinkman knew every coda of it finished the rounds maxwell had a rough hellomehearties voice if the tie the man was wearing designated a rugby club then brinkman guessed he knew all the barroom songs i think so sir said brinkman it seems a lot of advice is necessary civil servants justifying their existence said maxwell brinkman decided he liked the man he said whats the proper briefing if it were thought necessary to give a lecture you wouldnt have been selected in the first place said maxwell gruffly as it is youve jumped over quite a few heads his fathers influence wondered brinkman at once but that didnt follow if the man were trying to prevent his joining the department unless hed accepted that persuasion was impossible and decided instead to get the best possible posting for his son probing he said id hoped id got it on merit course you have said maxwell how else very early brinkman had learned the advantage of apparent ingenuous honesty he said it doesnt seem to be any secret within the department that my father is attached to the foreign office hasnt made any sort of approach to me said maxwell and brinkman believed the man maxwell went on you got it because of your ability with the language and your passmarks and your general aptitude in all the examinations and tests thank you said brinkman which dont mean a damn on the streets not much anyway deflated maxwell give me common sense compared with a passmark in an examination and id choose common sense every time i understand said brinkman too glibly regretting it as soon as he spoke no you dont said maxwell maintaining his directness theres no way you can not yet but i think you will every assessment and aptitude test youve taken repeats the same characteristic youre fast on your feet cunning was one word used not unkindly and you dont make mistakes not twice brinkman felt the burn of embarrassment at the public examination he wished he could think of some proper response knowing it was insufficient he said ill try maxwell shook his head youve got to do better than that i dont want you making any mistakes not even once classrooms and mockthese and mockthats can never properly equip you for the real thing youre going to a sensitive place the most sensitive place i know youre ambitious thats another finding of the aptitude tests and psychiatrists reports im glad someone without ambition isnt any good to me but use it properly im not expecting noones expecting sensations no krushchevlike denunciations of brezhnev or andropov at secret politburo sessions i want steady practical work i want the analysis to be correct and i want the assessments to accord with the facts as best you can obtain them dont ever take a chance to impress me or anybody else you got that yes sir ive got that said brinkman knowing he had to he didnt intend taking any chances not stupid ones anyway but if one came that wasnt stupid he was going to grab it like a drowning man snatching at passing driftwood and show everyone maxwell and his father and everyone just how good he was ingrams staying over to ease you in thats kind said brinkman he didnt want to be eased in by anyone picking up castoff contacts like secondhand clothes but it wouldnt have been politic to say so hes done a good job there said maxwell he wont be an easy act to follow ill do my best said brinkman modesty like apparent honesty was another thing he practised do more than that said maxwell in his hearty voice brinkman wondered if he took the part of santa claus at the department christmas party this could make or break a career you know i know said brinkman just as he knew it was going to be the former not the latter maxwell stood ending the meeting the man offered his hand and said good luck thank you sir said brinkman modest still luck wasnt going to have anything to do with it the lovemaking was good like it always was because he was more experienced and unselfish knowing how to bring her up and then keep her there so that she had orgasm after orgasm and even then didnt want to stop but kept pulling at him urgently demanding when they finished ann still clung to him wanting his nakedness next to hers after a long time she said eddie what why not you know why not he sighed confronting the familiar demand i dont think its a reason i do dozens of men your age have kids youre only fortyfive for christs sake and youre only twentysix and when im sixty if i get to be sixty youll only be fortyone so what she demanded exasperated if we had a baby now he or she would be eighteen or nineteen when youre sixty and of course youre going to live beyond that ann wanted a baby for all the natural proper reasons but there was another one as well a child would occupy her completely take away the aimlessness of her life in moscow well see he said youre avoiding it i said well see ann detected the note in his voice and accepted it was time to retreat i want a baby eddie she said firing the final salvo i want a baby very much the headquarters of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti is largely a prerevolutionary building an ochrecoloured rococo place dominating the square named after feliks edmundovich dzerzhinsky the founder of the organisation in nikita krushchev unveiled a statue to commemorate the man whose groundwork makes it possible for the soviet politburo to rule the country before the sevenstorey building within the long shadows of the kremlin housed the all russian insurance company during world war ii political and captured german prisoners were conscripted to build a ninestorey extension for the already greatly expanded intelligence service there was an attempt to maintain the architectural style but it failed and the two buildings look as if they have been stuck together by children given different sets of building bricks for christmas behind the haphazard uneven facade is lubyanka the prison which gained terrifying notoriety under the purges of stalin and the murderous zeal of intelligence chiefs like yagoda and beria lubyanka is no longer a prison the unremitting expansion made it necessary for once bloodstained cells to be refurbished into offices and part of that expansion is occupied by the second chief directorate of the kgb there are other directorates and divisions entrusted with the internal control of the soviet union but the second chief directorate has the primary responsibility that responsibility extends to the surveillance of all western embassies and the identification and monitoring of the intelligence activities within those embassies vasili sokol was the director officially designated deputy to the chairman himself aleksai panov sokol was a heavily moustached thickbodied man of great determination and the focus of that determination was to rise one floor to the chairmans pinepanelled office it couldnt be long now despite the doctors warnings about the effect upon his emphysema panov still chainsmoked those stinking tubefiltered cigarettes and the absences when he couldnt even leave his bed were increasing to the point of his replacement becoming an open speculation sokol knew that all he needed was a coup to single him out to the politburo the difficulty was in finding one sokol was a methodical man always early in the office to assimilate the overnight reports segregated in a series of intrays hedged the entire length of his desk one for each province with a separate division for moscow he devoted particular attention to the reports of the grain shortages sokol had succeeded to the position he now occupied because his predecessor failed to anticipate and then quell unrest through food riots and sokol didnt intend suffering the same fate he put the file to one side for more detailed attention later and went to the reports from the capital the foreign ministry internal memorandum was on top of the pile recording the british application for a diplomatic visa in the name of jeremy brinkman sokol noted that it had been granted and that the designation was cultural attache sokol smiled down wearily shaking his head sometimes he wondered why any of them russia included bothered with the ridiculous pretence each side the professionals at least invariably knew what the other was doing who was doing it and what the covers were cultural attache was the favourite so the intelligence replacement for the british was someone named jeremy brinkman sokol routinely marked it for a file to be opened and went back to the grain reports they were the important consideration at the moment a new intelligence resident could wait chapter three farewell parties were usually the best there was a purpose to them a positive reason for going beyond the customary excuse of escaping from one set of four walls to another set of four walls there was the official ceremony for ingram at the embassy on morisa toreza but the bigger gathering was at the mans own apartment in the official diplomatic compound off kutuzovsky prospekt it wasnt limited to the british but included all ingrams friends from the other embassies as well and this was the one ingram assured brinkman he would find the most useful ingram was a small rotund man given to quick fussy movements he wore spectacles which brinkman considered wrongly designed with large round frames which made the man look like an owl an owl in an unfamiliar hurry towards brinkman the attitude was clearly that of mentor to pupil brinkman resented the patronising attitude but gave no indication of doing so brinkman who was taking over the ingram apartment arrived late from his temporary accommodation at the embassy looking proprietorially around the smokefilled noisy rooms and hoping there wouldnt be too much damage or too many stains to get repaired afterwards he knew miserably the smell of smoke would last for days a temporary bar was set up along a wall directly adjacent to the kitchen and ingram stood beside it urging people to take fresh drinks eyeflickering around in happy contentment at being the object of so much attention his wife bustled back and forth from the kitchen ferrying food to a separate table near the window lucinda remembered brinkman from their brief embassy encounter taller than her husband and not so obviously excited as he was by all the fuss short practical hairstyle and flatheeled practical shoes and a practical day dress instead of the cocktail creations all about her brinkman identified lucinda ingram as the sort of woman whom at another time in another place the natives would have instinctively addressed as memsahib it was she who saw brinkman first standing just inside the door she smiled and beckoned through the crush for him to come further in as he started forward he saw her speak to her husband on the way to the kitchen on another food mission and at once ingram looked in his direction come in come in urged ingram thrusting through the crowd to meet him the departing intelligence man cupped brinkmans arm with his hand and propelled him towards the drinks and brinkman wished he hadnt because he didnt like that sort of physical contact brinkman chose scotch frowning as the other man gushed an overly large measure into a tumbler and gave it to him without ice or water brinkman took it but didnt drink quite a crowd he said more to come yet said ingram more to come lucky to have made a lot of friends certainly looks like it briefly the owl settled on a perch important that some of them become your friends too said ingram who for instance said brinkman obediently australians are useful although not for the obvious reason get a lot of playback from canberra on whats happening in peking ingram smiled a man about to impart a secret no reason to consider yourself limited by the boundaries of the country you happen to be in is there none at all agreed brinkman he decided that as irritating as ingram might be he wasnt a fool canada is important too by the same token ottowa was the first to recognise mao way back so theres a lot of playback through here analysis requests on how something or other that appears to be emerging in peking will be viewed in moscow its a worthwhile tennis game to watch with china the subject brinkman thought pingpong would have been a more appropriate metaphor he said anyone else french are pretty good but theyre an awkward bunch of bastards all give and no take judged ingram always a onesided affair dealing with them only if you let it be so thought brinkman sounds typically french he said and theres the ace said ingram brinkman followed ingrams look the object of it was on the far side of the room actually leaning against the wall a tall looselimbed man he wore an opennecked plaid shirt and jeans and appeared to be feeling the heat from the flush of his face the fair hair was already disordered falling forward over his face names blair said ingram from his side eddie blair been the cia resident here for a couple of years hell of a guy brinkman looked back curiously to ingram at the open admiration in what way every way said ingram straight as a die first of all hell help if he can but if it interferes with anything hes doing or he cant because of orders from above then hell say so straight out there isnt a member of the politburo he cant quote chapter and verse about going back as far as their grandfathers and his political judgment is superb like you said a hell of a guy said brinkman it doesnt end there said ingram enjoying the lecture technology is the name of the game thats what the russians want to catch up with us but with america most of all and technically blairs got a mind like a computer he actually understands all of it do you know what the joke is what said brinkman politely that washington doesnt bother to send in the electronic people any more to sweep the embassy and the apartment for bugs because eddie blair knows more about it and can do it better than any of them brinkman looked idly about him there were a hundred places where listening devices could be concealed there always were the jabber of this crowd would nullify anything tonight blairs the man to watch said ingram brinkman wondered if the russians were doing just that ill remember he said why not meet him now why not agreed brinkman before leaving the drinks table he put as much water as possible into his scotch and sipped it still not enough he thought ingram had already opened the introduction by the time brinkman got across the room and the american was smiling towards him invitingly hi said blair welcome to fun city the handshake was strong but not artificially so this usual asked brinkman gesturing back into the room better than usual said blair as ingram his mission completed eased back towards the bar blair added how you settling in not at all at the moment admitted brinkman living out of a suitcase at the embassy and going everywhere with a map in my hand blair smiled at the selfdeprecation as he was supposed to takes time he said actually didnt like the place in the first few months thought id made a mistake in accepting the posting and now said brinkman moscows a good place to be said the american its always got the attention of a lot of important people an ambitious cowboy very rare thought brinkman he said hope i dont fail them blair smiled again at the practised modesty takes time like i said its a difficult place to get the feel of and put a handle on the american paused and then said difficult for the wives too not enough for them to do really wont be a problem for me said brinkman im not married appearing reminded blair looked around the room and said you must meet ann he waved and brinkman turned to see a slim darkhaired woman coming towards them smiling uncertainly shed taken the trouble with her clothes which her husband hadnt the turquoise dress designed to show both the slimness of her waist and the fullness of her breasts she wore no other jewellery but a single strand gold necklace and only a minimum of makeup she was much younger than blair brinkman realised at once as the american made the introductions he put his arm around his wifes shoulders and brinkman wondered if the gesture were one of possession or comfort he isolated the accent as soon as she spoke english he said as roast beef and yorkshire pudding confirmed blair berkhamsted actually said ann brinkman saw she had small even teeth and the apparent habit of catching her lower lip between them like a guilty child frightened of being caught out in some mistake long way from home said brinkman he thought he detected a momentary pause from the woman she said we all are the smile this time was more open than before itll be good to have a new face among us she said why was she being like the rest ann thought angry at herself the answer came at once why not she was like everyone else im looking forward to it said brinkman but not to parties like these where the biggest ambition seemed to be who could get to the bottom of a whisky glass quickest he thought his own glass was sail practically full you must come and eat with us one night said ann itll be good to be able to talk to someone so recently from home id like that accepted brinkman london thought ingram good and ingram eulogised blair until he found his own roads to follow the american was obviously the person to travel with the arrival of the british ambassador making his duty visit was the signal for the presentations which broke up brinkmans contact with the blairs there were short speeches carefully guarded of course praising ingram as a colleague and friend whose companionship would be sadly missed and ingrams blinking grew more rapid with the praise lucinda stood alongside the expression on her face making it quite clear that she considered it all justified the ambassador presented the decanter set with matching glasses and ingram assured those who had contributed towards it that he would always treasure it as a reminder of happy times in moscow which he was going to miss both as a city and as a place where hed made many wonderful friends people whom he and his wife sincerely hoped would remain in contact there was the predictable attempt at a joke which fell flat and the predictable ribald shout from someone in the crowd and brinkman wondered why these sorts of things were always inevitably so embarrassing the presentation broke up like they normally did in the uncertainty of people not knowing what to do brinkman smiled up at the ambassadors approach sorry i havent had time to welcome you properly yet said sir oliver brace people seem to have been doing almost nothing else said brinkman at the embassy gathering there had been the briefest of introductions the formal interview was arranged for the following week son of sir richard brinkman isnt it yes sir said brinkman feeling the stomach sink of dismay harrow together said the ambassador damned fine bat still play cricket not any longer said brinkman it would have been easy enough for his father to find out all he had to do was look at the diplomatic list he supposed there would have been some contact from the manner of braces approach everyone treating you all right demanded the man no problems everyone has been extremely kind said brinkman in a veiled reference to brinkmans true function the ambassador said tricky place to be sometimes moscow i was fully briefed before i left london sir assured brinkman dear god dont let this redfaced man with his clippedspeech mannerism adopt the role of surrogate father thought brinkman any problems you let me know you understand of course sir promised brinkman there had to have been contact the head of chancery was the diplomat with whom intelligence officers customarily dealt specifically to remove the ambassador from any difficulty if things went wrong and that was the person with whom he would continue contact determined brinkman damn his busybody interfering father his duty done the ambassador moved away towards the door and brinkman looked casually about him unsure how easy it would be to make his own escape although it was ingrams party the departing intelligence officer had made it extremely clear brinkman shared in it too for the advantages it might have near where lucindas food had been and which was now a messy destroyed table a space had been cleared for dancing and a few couples were making desultory attempts to follow the music brinkman was undecided whether the excuse was to support each other from the effects of the booze or grope each other furtively there were obvious invitations from two women who caught his eye and smiled hopefully but brinkman chose to misunderstand smiling back but remaining where he was the cigarette smoke thicker now stung his eyes and the longheld drink was warm when he sipped it not needing a drink but just wanting something to do he looked around for blair and his english wife but they appeared to have left because politeness demanded it he asked lucinda ingram to dance and because politeness demanded it she accepted appearing reluctant to follow his lead and pushing him around instead like a busy shopper manoeuvring a trolley through a crowded supermarket there was the formalised conversation about how glad he was to be in moscow and how much she was looking forward to returning to london which she hadnt seen for a long time because before moscow their posting had been beirut and before that lima lucinda promised that the apartment would be properly and thoroughly cleaned after the party and asked if he wanted to retain their maid and brinkman thanked her and said yes he did they were both relieved when the dance finished he walked with her to ingram who stood stifflegged beside the drinks table pink and smiling brinkman decided it wouldnt be long before the owl fell out of the tree thanks for the party and for everything else said brinkman remember what i said encouraged ingram despite the obvious intake he was still very clearvoiced i will stay close to blair and you wont go far wrong insisted the other man as if he feared brinkman hadnt understood their earlier conversation i will promised brinkman emptily i will what do you think asked ann about what blair came from the bathroom wiping the toothpaste residue from his lips our new arrival jeremy brinkman seemed ok betty harrison decided he was gorgeous absolutely gorgeous betty harrisons got hot pants think brinkman will fill them for her seemed a cautious guy judged blair never touched his drink all night and spent a lot of it looking around making assessments professional sod accused ann lightly she added poor betty harrison if youre right i could be wrong admitted blair you rarely are said ann proudly theres always the first time said the texan switching off the light ann lay hopefully in the darkness but she felt him turn away from her goodnight she said goodnight chapter four pietr orlov was fully aware that when it happened there would be far more than the official reaction the public vilification and accusations and possibly a growing fear a relentless physical pursuit there would be bewilderment from those who knew him incredulity that having everything and well knowing he had everything hed abandoned it all incredulity too at the reason for that abandonment theyd have understood just a deepseated difficulty with communist ideology or the greed of bribery but not a woman at the time of his departure from new york orlov had been the soviet ambassador to the united nations but that had been a misleading description belying his function or regard within russia a more correct title would have been ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the union of soviet socialist republics because that was the role he properly performed it was orlov who was summoned back from new york personally to brief the ailing brezhnev on the likely western reaction to the afghanistan incursion and orlov again upon whom andropov ailing also depended for advice in determining the russian propaganda response to the positioning in europe of the american cruise missiles so much reflected orlov entering the kremlin complex and moving wellaccustomed towards the section of the foreign ministry so much and yet so little he wanted more so much more that only he no one else perhaps not even harriet could or would ever understand maybe harriet would come to comprehend it in time orlov hoped to god or whatever the deity was who controlled the destiny of man that it wouldnt have to be as long as a year before he had a chance to start trying to make her understand orlov hesitated at the actual moment of entering the office of yuri sevin conscious although hed been aware of it before but not so intently at the precise act of confrontation that the deputy minister would be one of the minority someone who knew him well and therefore whose first thought would not be instinctively nationalistic but personal one of the ones who would shake his head and find words difficult and when they came be mundane and illfitting like why why how did he do it orlov knew he had been chosen by sevin from the junior party position in tbilisi nurtured up through the local levels and then brought to moscow and protected still every move in the upward programme considered before it was made every posting chosen for a purpose orlov supposed it had to be twenty years twenty years during which sevin had been his constant supporter and advocate finally protecting him in the jugularbiting jungle of moscow while he had been far away and exposed in new york exposed to the one thing sevin had not anticipated and eliminated orlov hoped he could protect natalia to protect sevin would not be so easy impossible in fact sevin came forward arms outstretched in effusive greeting tears already starting down his face an elderly bear of a man with the emotions of a rabbit pietr he said a sob in his voice someone unable to accept the good fortune of seeing again someone he loved pietr orlov allowed the bear hug what else from a man of sevins size and the tearsmeared kisses on either cheek and a further bear hug as if the first had been insufficient and then underwent the arms length examination as though he was being searched for physical flaws and blemishes from his prolonged exposure in the west there is what you would regard as a flaw dear friend thought orlov but not one that is visible to anyone yuri he responded yuri its good to see you sevin led him away from the desk impatient embarrassed almost at the indication of rank or power hardly any existed between them anyway they went instead to a side area where the windows overlooked the senate building and where a low table between the chairs and the couch was already set with vodka and caviar sevin the considerate host had even included a samovar beside the couch orlov stared at it wondering how long it had been since hed seen one pietr said sevin once more how good it is to see you really good and you said orlov there was no doubt or uncertainty about what he intended doing there couldnt be after all the planning but orlov knew that when it was all over and he was happily settled with harriet and the fear had diminished as much as it could ever diminish there would still remain the regret at how hed had to deceive his friends this friend in particular and an even deeper regret that there was no way he could attempt to apologise or explain to attempt it now to take someone he considered his closest dearest friend into his confidence would be suicidal for him and to attempt it later in some guarded hopefully disguised message would be as murderous to sevin so he could do nothing nothing except hope that in some way somehow sevin would come to understand orlov doubted that the man would though how could he how could anyone you return in triumph pietr declared the deputy minister at once absolute triumph thats good to know said orlov the discomfort was like a weight in his stomach you didnt need me to tell you that said sevin gently he knew hed made the right choice in orlov the man was going to fulfil every expectation sometimes its difficult to judge from so far away you never made a misjudgment never praised sevin its an impressive record one thats been rightly and properly recognised as such im flattered said the uncomfortable orlov how much easier it had been to consider and plan what he intended to do in new york and how much more difficult it was to carry it through once hed got back here you will be predicted sevin he paused theatrically pleased with his news and wanting to extract the maximum from it therell need to be formal votes and resolutions of course but theyre just formalities the decisions unanimous youre being elected to the central committee pietr when orlov shocked didnt respond sevin said congratulations my friend youve earned it the central committee the inner sanctum orlov realised the cornucopia of power with the proper internal committee postings except that he didnt want power any more once maybe when sevin first plucked him from the provinces and hinted at what he was finally offering today but not any longer now he wanted freedom freedom and harriet sevin was obviously the sponsor because he was being permitted to be the bearer of good news in ancient rome it was the custom to sacrifice the messenger bearing bad news and this was going to become bad news soon enough orlov said honestly its difficult to express myself the old man smiled pleased with no way of being able to understand orlovs problem it wont stop there pietr youre the chosen one the star being groomed im too old and so are at least six of the others on the politburo ivan serada has been a disaster and everyone recognises it youre only forty which is juvenile by soviet ageing but ive seen to it that youve had more international experience than most of the other contenders put together all you need now is two years three at the outside to be able to show the proper understanding and appreciation of domestic issues and there wont be anyone to stand in your way leader thought orlov in a sudden oblivioustoeverything mental lurch the euphoria leaked away as quickly as it came he didnt want to be leader and he didnt want to be a deputy and he didnt want to be married any longer to natalia and he didnt want to be in moscow all he wanted was harriet he said its an overwhelming prospect everythings overwhelming in fact sevin laughed in genuine amusement at the other mans confusion pouring large measures of vodka for them both he raised his glass and said to you pietr grigorovich orlov people are going to know of you know of you and respect you and fear you youre going to break the mould of stagnating senile leadership in this country bury seradas mistakes and sweep away the blanket of nepotism thats smothering our leadership and our progress ignoring the absurdity of talking of nepotism orlov guessed from the hyperbole that the man had practised and rehearsed the speech like the politician he was people were going to know of him orlov thought sadly but not for the sort of reason sevin imagined sundays were always difficult every other day of the week had its boxes and its compartments regular fixed commitments around which everything properly revolved even saturdays but definitely not sundays sunday was a donothing day without a peg upon which ruth could hang her coat she hated sundays because they were a constant reminder eddie had usually been free on sundays she fell back upon the smithsonian like so many times before but halfway around the science exhibition their boredom and lack of interest became too obvious so she decided to cut her losses and run taking a cab up to the hill to the american cafe paul maybe because he was the elder of the two and saw it as his role led the attack when it came to ordering drinks to go with the hamburgers bloody mary he said dont be ridiculous refused ruth too vehemently and in front of the waitress anyway she could have turned everything aside if shed treated it as a joke with no other choice but to continue she said you know you cant have a bloody mary ridiculous the child reddened under the gaze of the patient amused waitress whod seen it all before shit thought ruth i want a bloody mary insisted paul ruth retreated to the familiar defence of an adult with a recalcitrant child invoking the support of another adult to the waitress she said my son is not yet fourteen hes not allowed alcohol is he no maam said the waitress sodas or shakes tea or coffee assholes said paul both women heard him but pretended not to have done so sodas or shakes tea or coffee recited the waitress again nothing said paul denying himself so as to deny them as well coke said john belatedly he added please but because of the brace it came out as a lisp after the woman had gone away with their order ruth said to paul ok what was all that about nothing he said head bent against the table regretting it now as much as she did you made a fool of yourself said the woman nervously aware just how close shed come to losing control and wanting to reinforce her position to prevent it happening again you made a fool of us all paul said nothing because there was nothing to say im waiting for an apology the elder boy remained silent i said im waiting for an apology sorry said paul voice soft and his lips barely moving and youll apologise to the waitress when she comes back said ruth building upon her advantage i think shes a bitch blurted john coming to the aid of his beleaguered brother ruth turned to the other boy looking bewildered between him and the departing waitress not her said john with childlike irritation at being misunderstood the woman daddys with i think shes a bitch you dont know anything about it said ruth which was a mistake because since the divorce theyd both attempted the role of guardians and she realised as she spoke that she was diminishing their efforts we know everything about it for gods sake came in paul anxious to recover from his previous defeat i know that said ruth striving to maintain a reasonable tone in her voice i know youre affected as much as i am maybe even more so and im sorry john that i said you didnt know anything about it thats not what i meant what then said the younger boy i meant that there are some things that occur between grownup adult people that are difficult for younger people ruth hesitated not wanting to cause further friction grownup and adult though those younger people are that are difficult for young people to understand she trailed to a stop realising how awful the attempt had been like going to bed together you mean said john anxious to prove his worldliness that conceded ruth cautiously but thats not all of it even the important part of it there are lots of other things as well didnt you go to bed with daddy demanded paul determined upon vengeance ruth felt herself blushing that isnt the sort of question you should ask me she said desperately but you know the answer anyway of course i went to bed with daddy then why did he go to bed with her as well i dont know said ruth an admission as much to herself as to the children i really dont know i hate her said john proud at having initiated the discussion dont you hate her no said ruth carefully rehearsed no i dont hate her and i dont hate daddy i dont understand you protested paul exasperated how can you not hate her not easily conceded ruth to herself hate doesnt achieve anything she said what will to get daddy back implored john who had tears brimming in his eyes when she looked at him i dont know darling she said soothingly not yet i dont know will you he said with trusting anxiousness i dont know that either said ruth honestly the returning waitress stopped the conversation and ruth smiled up at her gratefully remembering she said to paul dont you have something to say to this lady there was a moment when ruth thought he would refuse but then he said sorry louder the second time why was it wondered ruth that sorry had been the most familiar word in their vocabulary for so long now the unrest was centred in shemkha which was fortunate because sokol was not sure he could have contained the protest if it had started in the azerbaijan capital of baku it was from the kgb centre in baku of course that the reports came and because he was so alert to the problem sokol responded at once ordering that shemkha should be sealed and moving extra militia from tbilisi in bordering georgia and from rostov and donetsk as well sealing the town was only the first step until he could get there himself on the long flight from moscow on the way from the airport sokol gazed out at the parched fields of the tropical part of the soviet union realising how crop failures of this province had been compounded by the grain failures on the steppes people were slow moving and actually in cases already emaciated he went immediately to shemkha and from the car radio system ordered that the leaders of the revolt should be assembled for his arrival there were four of them a city physician and a factory technician and two farmers the physician whose name was bessmertnik was the reluctant spokesman a bespectacled stutteringly hesitant man sokol heard the complaints out a litany of promised but never realised grain deliveries from the chairman of the city committee and spoilation through transport confusion and delays of food that did arrive he ordered the immediate arrest of the committee chairman and transport authority head and detained bessmertnik and one of the farmers as well the hearing was brief at sokols instructions in every case the charge of antisoviet activity which covered any and every transgression they were found guilty also at sokols instructions and shot within an hour of the verdict the official soviet airline aeroflot is subordinate to kgb orders and sokol used fifteen aircraft from their transport fleet to fly in grain and vegetables the entire operation took only a fortnight and the day after his return to moscow there was a congratulatory memorandum from aleksai panov sokol was grateful for the recognition but knew it wasnt what he wanted for the promotion upon which he was so determined it wasnt a coup chapter five brinkman settled in carefully not because of the repeated advice to do so but because it was obviously the way to proceed cautiously to be cautious about his assessments and be cautious about making friends and be cautious about his new colleagues realising it was the traditional practice something upon which they had budgeted in fact he bought from the departing ingrams their car and their speciallyadapted stereo unit and a few pieces of kitchen equipment he moved in the day after they left moscow the place was cleaned and tidied as lucinda ingram had promised shed even left a vase of flowers as a welcoming gesture in the main room but it was not clean enough for brinkman who made the maid do it all over again while he was there to ensure she performed the task properly the maid was a bulging overflowing woman named kabalin who muttered something under her breath when he told her to clean again and who appeared surprised when brinkman who hadnt heard what she said continued the instructions in his perfect russian intent upon stopping any insubordination even whispered protests from a servant before it began he knew she would spy upon him officially of course that was one of the standard warnings probably steal too which was why it was important to establish the proper relationship from the beginning it wouldnt affect the spying but it might lessen the theft if she realised at once that he wasnt a weak man prepared to tolerate laxity at the embassy brinkman remained polite even humble grateful to people who identified the various departments courteously introducing himself to the head of each joining the various clubs and organisations that existed within the building to relieve the existence of moscow and maybe the most important of all never indicating that because he was an intelligence officer which most of them knew even though they shouldnt have done that he considered himself in any way superior to them or beyond the rules and regulations that they had to obey during the official welcoming interview the ambassador who asked to be remembered to his father repeated the invitation to approach him personally if he encountered any difficulty and as he had done at the ingrams party brinkman thanked the man politely at a subsequent meeting with the head of chancery whose name was wilcox brinkman let the offer be known apologised for the intrusion of his father and assured wilcox quite honestly that he had no intention ever of going over the mans head like letting everyone else know he didnt consider himself different because of the certain dispensations allowed him as a security man it let wilcox know he didnt want any special favours and by being open about it brinkman took out insurance against sir oliver mentioning it to wilcox himself brinkman was as careful making contact with the westerners whom ingram recommended he should seek out wanting always that the approaches should come from them and not from him which would have put him in the role of a supplicant it happened first from the canadians it was a reception marking some commonwealth event and brinkman went to create the opportunity and was picked out of the english contingent by mark harrison within thirty minutes of his arrival his canadian counterpart was a heavy man florid through obvious blood pressure relaxed in his own embassy surroundings the man wore a string tie secured at the throat by a heavy clasp there was the settling in conversation which by now brinkman felt he could recite in his sleep and then the restaurantdelay conversation and then the restriction of travel conversation harrison let the talk then drift into apparent generalities and brinkman allowed the canadian to lead suspecting that the man wasnt dealing in generalities at all they discussed the apparent relaxation under the new soviet regime and harrison asked brinkman whether in his opinion he considered it a genuine desire for friendship with the west or motivated by some inner soviet requirement of which they were unaware the seemingly innocent question sounded the warning bell but brinkman gave no reaction and said untruthfully that the impression within the foreign office prior to his departure from london was that there was some desire from moscow for a relaxation in tension harrisons enquiry whether trade approaches in recent times supported the relaxation theory lit another light but once more brinkman gave no indication replying casually that hed always found it ironical that relationships between east and west had for so long existed on the two apparently contradictory levels opposing rhetoric at conference tables and necessary trade agreements upon which each side was dependent on a quite separate level brinkman discerned harrisons disappointment and wondered if it would be possible to impress maxwell at this early stage before they parted harrison suggested brinkman dining with him and betty not expecting brinkmans response not knowing if it would be necessary to maintain close contact with harrison over whatever it was he was talking about but deciding to take out insurance if it were brinkman seized upon the invitation saying hed be delighted to accept and asking when trapped harrison fixed dinner three nights away and brinkman hoped he would have discovered more by then it was easier in fact than he expected the trade counsellor at the british embassy a man named street was immediately forthcoming to brinkmans approach impressed by brinkmans earlier deferring introduction and anxious to help as much as possible a newcomer with the proper manner there hadnt been any unexpected trade approaches during the preceding six months in fact the only thing that had caught his interest was a request a month earlier about the availability among british owners of bulk carrier ships brinkman was glad he pressed further persuading street to pull the file from records because when they examined it there was a tighter definition the enquiry had been specifically about bulk containers not carriers ingram had been a meticulous keeper of files better in fact than the standard regulations required and from the ship enquiry brinkman knew he only had the preceding month to check hunched in the intelligence records room in the embassy basement it took brinkman less than an hour to find what he thought he was looking for but careful as he was he merely marked it as a possibility and carried on throughout the remaining rcords there had been three more messages from ingram the last two definite confirmation of what earlier had been little more than supposition from intelligent reading of soviet publications wheat production was the perpetual problem of soviet agriculture something that bad weather and inefficiency and succeeding government changes seemed always to conspire to bring hugely below the required norms no admissions were ever made of course but ingram had picked up the indications from reports that had been allowed into izvestia and pravda from the growing areas on the steppes a prelude to the personnel shift within the moscow ministry which ingram had noted and properly connected brinkman decided from his meeting with mark harrison that he was able to make further connections predictably he was cautious in his message to maxwell in london he reminded the controller of ingrams earlier assessments cleverly sharing credit if credit had to be given and said he interpreted an approach to the trade section of the british embassy to be the beginning of a widespread soviet chartering effort to transport wheat from the west indicating that he was in no way politically naive brinkman said that he was well aware that such trade was not unusual in fact that it continued all the time but that he believed from sources within the soviet capital that moscow was spreading its purchasing this time moving away from the traditional suppliers the united states and to a lesser extent argentina his belief was that a substantial agreement was being negotiated with ottawa to make canada a greater trading partner than it was at present taking a chance but not much of a chance brinkman wondered if the canadian agreement didnt indicate a desire in moscow to free itself from any possible trade embargo from the united states if relations between the two countries worsened despite the surface indications of apparent and better friendships he concluded by saying he believed the canadian agreement was not yet fully resolved and that ottawa was concerned about entering a commitment which unquestionably would annoy its neighbour the united states to the south unless there was a positive assurance from the soviet union that transportation facilities existed to move the wheat the congratulatory message arrived from maxwell two days later simply by checking with lloyds of london they had discovered the soviet chartering operation not just of british vessels but of others as well who although foreign were being insured for the transportation through the british market there was a second message from london from ingram it was of congratulation but brinkman knew it was also one of thanks from the man for being generous and mentioning his earlier work and knew satisfied that he had an ally in london where it was always useful to have allies the harrisons dinner party was a small affair the canadian military attache and his wife a couple called bergdoff and an analyst from the economic division a hopefully smiling shy girl named sharon berring who had been invited to balance the numbers brinkman was an accomplished raconteur when the occasion demanded and he decided it did now and monopolised the conversation the anecdotes usually deprecatingly against himself enjoying their enjoyment of his newness in the city always withdrawing when either harrison or bergdoff made a contribution so that his monopoly did not become irritating to the other men he was equally attentive to the three women although towards the end of die evening he devoted more time to betty harrison the politeness deserved in her role as hostess he escorted sharon back to her own apartment and refused her invitation for a final drink by convincingly pleading pressure of work the following day so that she was not hurt by lack of interest and said he hoped like she said she hoped that theyd meet again soon the following day with his note of thanks to betty harrison he sent flowers with smaller bouquets to mrs bergdoff and sharon berring betty harrison telephoned ann by midday fabulous darling gushed the canadian absolutely fabulous there hasnt been anyone like him in moscow since the time i got here flowers queried ann who knew in moscow it was neither cheap nor easy to make such a gesture to all of us mine was bigger of course said betty who had established a social coup at being the first to have brinkman at her table guess hes going to be in demand said ann believe me darling said betty id like to make a demand any time brinkmans invitation to dine with the blairs arrived two days later orlov found everything about the subterfuge difficult but most difficult of all was natalia far worse than he had anticipated and rehearsed for natalia had remained in moscow during his new york posting frequently guiltily he wondered if things would have been different if she hadnt so it was to be expected there would be a strangeness between them and he prolonged it as long as he could but always the need was to avoid suspicion even though he trusted her so finally it had to end she was anxiously eager because she loved him creating another plateau of guilt and then there was another because although he didnt love her and although he loved harriet he found it surprisingly easy embarrassingly shockingly easy to make love to her she made it obvious that it had been good for her it had been good for him too a further reason to despise himself i missed you she said she was still breathing heavily from the lovemaking and there was a catch in her voice i missed you too he said knowing he had to but hating himself for the lie it seemed so easy to decide and to plan in new york necessary if she were to be protected he hoped one day she might come to guess why he was doing it but it wasnt easy now it was degrading and obscene and it wasnt fair to her they made love with the light on because natalia was a sensuous woman who liked it that way orlov looked sideways at her she detected the movement and turned smiling towards him too glad a barrier had been removed and orlov knew she would expect to make love regularly now she was an attractive as well as a sensuous woman beautiful even with red hair which she wore long cascaded ever the pillow and freckles that went with the colouring faint upon a diminutive nose and high refined cheeks she was careless of actually pleasured by nakedness the covering thrust aside because she wanted him to see her firmlimbed her stomach naturally flat not through some drawnbreathed effort her breasts were firm too jutting upright despite their weight and orlov felt a surge of excitement and shifted the bedclothes to cover him wanting to hide the obvious evidence of it was it possible to love two women equally hed avoided the obvious way out running in america where it would have been easy because of the retribution which would quite illogically have been exacted against natalia for having married a traitor wanting to divorce her and distance her from harm wasnt that love of a sort he supposed responsibility he thought seeking another word guilt the most familiar one beautiful he thought again more beautiful than harriet if he were to make a brutal honest comparison had sevin been right had he been brought back by a powerful inner caucus to finish some sort of training to emerge as a contender for the ultimate position youre going to break the mould of stagnating senile leadership in this country overdramatic words certainly but sevin had never been personally overdramatic the man wouldnt have made the promise disclosed the thinking if it hadnt been the truth orlov looked again at natalia and thought how well she would fit and accomplish the role of first lady and he remembered his arrival that day at the ministry when sevin made the announcement and the phrase that throbbed through his head and through his thinking like some ancient church chant so much so much so much stop it orlov thought abruptly he had to stop it he was having doubts about going back to america and there werent any hed gone through all that through all the heartsearching and the uncertainties and the recriminations he was going to divorce natalia to spare her from any possible harm and he was going to make his contact with someone at the us embassy and he was going to go to america to a new life with a woman who consumed him and for whom he was prepared to make any sacrifice i love you said natalia beside him orlov closed his eyes against the surroundings and what was happening and the dishonesty he hated and said i love you very much make love to me again she said make love to me a lot orlov turned towards his wife aware of how easy that was going to be and hating himself for that most of all sokol succeeded in hiding any personal distate at the fug of tobacco smoke that hung in panovs office the kgb chairmans chest bellowed out with his difficulty and he didnt make any gesture of greeting when sokol entered the room how widespread is the problem the older man demanded at once bad conceded sokol aware that panov would know from other sources within the huge organisation azerbaijan is still unsettled its spread to georgia right throughout the ukraine kazakhstan and parts of lithuania too organised asked panov suspiciously i dont think so ive issued orders to restrict travel between the provinces to avoid wordofmouth circulation and spread stories that in every place its isolated to that particular region any obvious leader is arrested of course no more execution instructed panov lighting one cigarette from the butt of that which preceded it was right and proper the first time but i dont think we should continue it i dont want anything in the western press through the dissidents the old man coughed youve got to stop this he began again you realise that dont you damn stupid agricultural policies that threatened everything he wanted thought sokol it will be stopped he promised not knowing how chapter six brinkman was pleased with his initial success but not complacent about it indeed with the proper reflection he was actually prepared to accept an element of luck a very small element he accepted too that improperly created foundations could be washed away in the first rainstorm and he hadnt gone as far as creating proper foundations yet just a minimum impression in london and a minimum impression within his own embassy the first layer then it was essential to build up to withstand gales as well as rain brinkman calculated it precisely practically with stopwatch finesse arranging the lunch with harrison the day he was later to eat with blair so that if there were any later comparisons he didnt after all know just how close the two were he would be shown to have been scrupulously honest brinkman slotted himself into the second place throughout their conversation as he had at the embassy when they were conducting business not socialising referring in almost an aside to their conversation that day and offering the information about the chartering as if he were unaware of its dramatic significance brinkman admired harrisons professional reaction or rather lack of it enjoying the encounter he was dominating from an apparently secondary role it quickly became an exercise in comparative tradecraft harrison pecking until he considered he had enough and then withdrawing into some inconsequential small talk to digest the gathered forage and brinkman setting out the meal hors doeuvre at a time not wanting the man to glut himself and realise how he was being spoonfed the encounter ended with invitations more fulsome than before to further social gatherings and brinkmans vague acceptance still appearing an overawed new arrival grateful for the advice from someone more experienced someone who might indeed would more eagerly next time make an approach and drop the hints confident now of an ingenuous playback brinkman went to the blairs bearing gifts remembering her apparent interest in clothes in contradiction to her husband he had freighted from london editions of vogue and harpers and the harrods catalogue although not quite the current ones which would have shown he was trying and apologised for his presumption when he arrived but explained hed brought them from london and read them and thought perhaps she might be interested blairs gift could wait until later ann thanked him sincerely appreciating the thought and blair the cosseting husband thanked him too while he was pouring the drinks with ann in the kitchen finishing the meal as grateful as his wife for the consideration sharon berring arrived within fifteen minutes and brinkman acknowledged the liaison between the blairs and the harrisons he was midly amused not offended correctly recognising the effort to which they had gone the canadian economist was more relaxed with him the second time actually offering stories of her own some of which were genuinely funny brinkmans newness still enabled him to have anecdotes he hadnt recounted at the harrisons enjoying sharons laughter but he was brought short when he began to talk about university life at cambridge and ann cut across him you were at cambridge brinkman nodded kings he said girton she said matching colleges like playing cards ann became animated at the link even more excited when she realised that despite their different periods at the university they had shared three common tutors the discovery was fortunate because it further enabled brinkman to include blair and sharon in the conversation recalling fresh stories about academics he and ann knew which were amusing despite their being strangers to the american and the canadian brinkman studied ann as they talked aware now of the similarities the appearance at the ingrams farewell party had been misleading the blouse was fuller and the skirt longer and although she had taken it off now during the preparation and the serving shed been wearing a shawl around her shoulders when he first arrived she wore flatheeled pumptype shoes too like everything else about her the appearance he remembered about the undergraduate style that was emerging just about the time he was leaving the university it didnt end with the clothes the walls of the blair apartment were draped with carpets even a shawl in a small alcove and there were miniature icons and miniature samovars and at least three sets that he could see of matroyshka the traditional russian doll one of which lifts from a replica of the other until a whole family is disclosed like a dozen university rooms into which hed been festooned with the adventures of foreign explorations he talked on the words prepared and easy his mind quite able to consider something else hed been passingly aware of the age difference between blair and his wife at the ingram party but closer his attention undivided brinkman considered it again blair was in good shape and his size further diminished any difference between them but there was one brinkman recognised ten years maybe longer the indication wasnt so much in their physical appearance but in blairs attitude towards ann the armaroundtheshoulder protectiveness of which brinkman had been conscious at the first meeting it betrayed the newness of the relationship a period before they had had time to come properly to know each other like couples know each other in the fullness of years so that it was instead a time of proud possession like the icons on the wall and the rings on the fingers were possessions how wondered brinkman had a cowboybooted texan and hed bet a weeks salary a paidup republican become involved with a shawlwearing english girl who hed bet another weeks salary had chanted in crocodile outside the american embassy in grosvenor square in protest against the vietnam war none of his business recognised brinkman his business was an unimpeded unobstructed career not the unnecessary and unimportant intimacies of someone elses affairs unless those affairs affected that career sharon maintained her part of the conversation her genuinely amusing conversation disclosing a considerable ability as a mimic and mostly about people whom the blairs knew among the western community in moscow although they were unknown to him brinkman responded politely deciding she was a pleasant dinner table companion blair was a generous host another bottle of wine opened and available when the previous one was only half empty and brinkman quickly appreciated the way to avoid his glass being constantly topped up was not to make room in the first place by the time the meal ended he thought both sharon and blair were drunk although ann appeared to be in better control sharon unsteadily helped the other woman clear the table while blair poured brandy a brief moment when they were alone maybe we should get together soon by ourselves offered blair id like that said brinkman had ingram openly asked the american to protect him it was unlikely but not unthinkable brinkman hoped not when are you free any time said brinkman generously how could he manoeuvre the conversation to introduce the wheat discovery he wanted to show the intelligence to be his calculation which meant it had to be tonight tomorrow harrison would be bustling between the canadian mission on starokonyushennyr and the united states embassy at chaykovskovo eager to impart it as his revelation what about thursday thursdays fine accepted brinkman you havent been to our embassy yet no the cafeteria is never going to make the guide michelin but occasionally it has its moments sounds fine accepted brinkman seeing the opportunity he said just call if anything comes up of course said blair cant imagine anything will though it all looks pretty quiet at the moment im not so sure lured brinkman why not demanded blair at once the mans head came up and the relaxation seemed to go from throughout the large body and brinkman thought that even if blair were as drunk as he suspected him of being the man had an impressive ability to recover practically before ones eyes brinkman told him not in a chronological disclosure of facts but disjointedly the way he had recounted it earlier to harrison wanting neither man to imagine he had done better than them but rather that he was testing out his impressions and theories blair listened expressionlessly and seemingly sleepyeyed and at the end said laconically interesting certainly worth thinking about brinkman knew that the american was doing more than just thinking about it just as he knew that after he left tonight blair would take advantage of the time difference between moscow and washington and go back to the embassy and send a report which meant ottawa and washington would hear of things within a time frame which for all intents and purposes was simultaneous and that london because of their advance knowledge would be able to offer confirmatory help as soon as the requests came from both capitals and that blair and harrison would be grateful to him which is how brinkman wanted it to be and wouldnt hold back from helping him in the future which was also how brinkman wanted it to be the coffee was good imported and the brandy too but brinkman was conscious of blairs impatience conscious too that the american resident had stopped drinking to make it easy for the man brinkman excused himself refusing anns insistence upon another coffee or another drink agreeing to another meeting soon because there was so much about cambridge they hadnt talked about brinkman escorted sharon home again and once more refused her invitation to a final nightcap risking offence this time by not even pleading pressure of work he thought she was an amusing girl and an intelligent witty companion but he thought she might also become an encumbrance imagining something more than properly existed in a casual onenight stand and brinkman didnt want any sort of encumbrance back at the blairs apartment ann looked bemused at her husbands announcement that he had to return to the embassy what for somethings come up she looked at the telephone and then back to him nobody called something i forgot to do today just remembered while the agreement was no secrets in their personal relationships she accepted because of what he did that his work was sacrosanct it was just that it had never happened this way before how long she said not long he promised just a cable to send hurry back sure she tried to remain awake actually taking another brandy she didnt want and staying up for an hour then she went to bed intending to wait there but it didnt work and she fell asleep so deeply that she wasnt aware of his return or of his easing in beside her he could only make out the vaguest outline in the darkness the jut of her chin and her nose and the bulge of her breasts rising and falling rhythmically in the darkness he loved her so much blair thought so very much everything that had happened was worth it to have ann as his wife he determined just as he determined they would always stay together how heavy asked the embassy doctor bent over her case notes very heavy insisted ann determinedly ive flooded for the last three months he looked up at her theres no indication of any blood pressure need there be she asked she knew the answer because she had already checked not necessarily conceded the doctor if youre going to stop using the pill what are you going to do i dont know she said become pregnant i hope she thought what about a coil i tried it in england lied ann it hurt it was always uncomfortable a diaphragm then ive never used one its your responsibility warned the man youve got to remember to use it all right said ann you sure about the pill said the doctor still doubtful quite sure said ann chapter seven the cafeteria of the american embassy is an annex building at the rear of the main premises on chaykovskovo on the ground floor the walls are festooned with posters of american scenes aerial shots of the grand canyon and mickey mouse at disneyworld and the statue of liberty all reminders of home there were some framed pictures too outdoor scenes again and around some hung forlorn streamers forgotten residue of some celebration like christmas or thanksgiving the menu prices and payment brinkman saw were in dollars another reminder of a faraway home he chose steak knowing it would have been flown in as blair warned it would never have achieved the place a listing in the guide michelin but it wasnt bad either both drank coffee able to abandon the map yet asked blair brinkman frowned momentarily not understanding then remembered his casual remark the night they first met at ingrams party just about he smiled blair had a remarkable memory like moscow i can see its limitations but they dont worry me not yet so yes i like it replied brinkman honestly wanting to match the other mans recall he said i think its a worthwhile place to be professionally always got the attention of a lot of important people blair grinned at the other man awarding him the point that wheat thing came out right said the american giving him another ingram did the groundwork said brinkman the two had been friends and might still be in touch it was unlikely they would discuss something like that even if they were but brinkman decided it didnt hurt to be generous half an assessment isnt any good said blair brinkman began to smile imagining further praise but then stopped suspecting that blair meant something else whats yours he said i think theres more to switching the wheat purchasing to canada than finding alternative supplies thats too simple blair was being objective not critical brinkman decided and he hadnt committed himself too strongly to london he remembered relieved wanting to show analysis in his question brinkman took a chance and said you think the shortage is serious blair nodded and brinkman was further relieved we know it is he said got a playback from langley our spy satellites go over the wheat growing areas its a disaster area famine proportions probed brinkman staying on safe ground practically in some areas the harvest was bad last year so there isnt any stock for them to fall back upon it was repayment time brinkman realised he hadnt expected it so soon deciding it wasnt a naive assumption brinkman said which puts serada on the spot the whole politburo expanded blair but serada most of all i agree hes shown bad leadership from the time of his election there have been the changes within the ministry sure but thats just cosmetic doesnt matter a spit within the politburo where seradas critics are and hes got plenty enough to be purged brinkman tried to avoid any excitement showing and thought hed succeeded difficult to be positive said blair cautiously but it could happen serada came from the agricultural ministry was supposed to know all about it agrarian reforms were the first things he introduced when he got the politburo chairmanship so hes directly responsible said brinkman another safe question he did not want any more of his meal but continued eating to disguise his feelings from the other man right in the firing line agreed blair so were going to see some defensive play brinkman didnt understand and searched desperately for the right question can he manage it he said maybe said blair pushing his plate away maybe not come on for christs sake thought brinkman he wanted it all he said itll have to be something pretty dramatic i think it will be said blair predictable but dramatic but i cant bloody well predict it thought brinkman unable to manage anything better he said could support swing back to serada if he gets it right if he gets it right qualified blair the american hesitated appearing unsure whether or not to continue brinkman sat with the apprehension burning through him hoping it wasnt showing in open perspiration on his face then blair said the canadian deal has got two sides in my opinion its to relieve the shortages here certainly and for insurance if the united states uses its supplies as a weapon seradas gesture has got to be dramatic like i said its got to be dramatic and its got to be convincing to everyone here the politburo and the committees that matter and those poor sonsofbitches who are starving out there in the boondocks so whats the usual move of a dictatorship when theres an internal threat brinkman drank from his coffee cup to give himself time predictable the man said what the hell was predictable create an external one he risked stomach knotted at the fear of getting it wrong exactly said the american and brinkman put the cup down not wanting the shake of his hand to be apparent blair said the soviets are paranoid about war they lost twenty million people fighting hitler and have never forgotten it neither should we forget how it affects their thinking if serada can stir up a war threat then hes home and dry blair was mad thought brinkman up to now everything had been logical and acceptible but now the man was running off into fantasyland and then it came to him and he said so youre guessing geneva right first time congratulated the american i think serada is going publicly to put up a whole bunch of proposals to the disarmament conference proposals he knows damned well will be unacceptable to the united states say something like hes prepared to go there personally to negotiate and sign a treaty and actually invite the president to meet him there well turn it down because well have to and the president will make an announcement saying hes not going serada will be able to tell the politburo and the russian people and anyone else wholl listen to him that he made a genuine gesture for peace but america the warmongers rejected it and then in protest hell break off the geneva conference my guess is that hell actually hope well use wheat as a weapon if we do that he can say its america causing the starvation not his halfassed policies it was good conceded brinkman bloody good a neat intricate jigsaw puzzle with all the bits in place even the awkward ones all the same colour he said its a fascinating scenario its the way im reading it said blair the american gestured for more coffee and brinkman took some too content to let blair run the encounter the ace ingram had called him remembered brinkman he thought it was a pretty good description he said who succeeds if serada goes blair grinned the sixtyfour thousand dollar question as theyve said too many times its russias perennial problem a gang of old guys at the top gushkov is a contender but hes seventytwo chebrakin has got the support of the military which is always a factor but hes seventy didenko is the youngest at fiftynine but hes spent most of his administrative life out in the provinces and hasnt got any international experience at all never even been out of the country id put yuri sevin down as an outsider but my guess is he wouldnt take it his reputation is that of a behindthescenes policymaker anybodys guess then if i were asked to make it id risk a buck on chebrakin but only as a caretaker until didenko gets the experience maybe said blair uncommitted maybe someone weve never heard of ive got a gut feeling that we might see changes that will take us all by surprise blair grinned again and said but thats all it is a gut feeling and gut feelings make bad intelligence if blair were right then he couldnt have been posted to moscow at a better time thought brinkman he realised too that the american had repaid him in full with interest he said would america suspend the wheat sales to get serada back to the conference table not if weve got any sense said blair its a myth that we supply all that much anyway and what we do could easily be replaced as a gesture it would be more to russias propaganda advantage than a serious threat hed include that in the file to london brinkman determined it would show impressive political acumen maybe even get transmitted between london and washington he experienced a warm feeling of contentment and satisfaction he said id like to return the other nights dinner have you and ann over to my place in fact thought brinkman he wanted blair to be a frequent guest at this rate very frequent wed like that accepted the american anns got lots more she wants to talk about with you about england the american paused and said found the bugs yet i havent seriously tried said brinkman who had but found no listening devices against which in london hed been warned to be careful light fittings are a favourite said the american interior of keyholes too when they swept the apartment of our trade attache last time they found one in the flush handle of the john brinkman laughed and said what did they do took it out said blair the soviets know from the maids when theres an official sweep and because its official anything found is removed we dont touch anything we find ourselves indicates we might have something to hide and theyll only put another one in somewhere else if you know where they are you can just avoid them remembering ingrams praise of the other mans electronic ability brinkman said found all yours i think so said blair casually scores up to five so far i play them a lot of country and western dolly partons a favourite i prefer classical said brinkman i guess they do too said blair brinkmans report to maxwell was lengthy and it took a long time to encode so it was late when he got back from the embassy despite the time he spent three hours making a detailed examination of the apartment concentrating upon the spots suggested by blair he found three devices two in light fittings four days later the soviet leader appeared publicly on state television to announce his new disarmament proposals for the geneva conference washington responded not with a rejection but with caution issuing a communique that they would have to be studied in depth before any proper response could be given brinkman got another cable of congratulation from maxwell ruth accepted that the apology in blairs card that there was nothing really worth buying in moscow for pauls birthday was probably true but she still wished hed tried instead of enclosing an impersonal cheque trying for something different she took both boys on one of the cruise trips along the potomac on a boat where it was possible to eat afterwards they went to the biograph in georgetown because a movie was showing she knew paul particularly wanted to see and even though they had the big tubs of popcorn she took them to eat afterwards at the french restaurant on the opposite side of m street id like you to write to your father when we get back to thank him what for demanded paul belligerently your present ruth replied carefully she wouldnt fight not on his birthday twenty lousy bucks stop it paul she said evenly hes your father and he loves you and it made more sense for him to send you the money to buy something you really want instead of him guessing if he hadnt run out on us he wouldnt have had to guess would he said the boy he hasnt run out on you said ruth maintaining her control he divorced me isnt that the same thing asked john no its not she said ive told you he loves you and he does paul took his fathers cheque from his pocket looked at it and said he can go stick it up his ass stop that said ruth her voice rising for the first time i will not have you use language like that in front of me paul tore the cheque in half and then in half again letting the pieces fall into the ashtray between them that was stupid said ruth the boy looked up at her and said sos not having a father sokol was a bachelor with no outside interests and thought passingly that it was fortunate because his absorption with the problems arising from the famine meant he stayed all the time at dzerzhinsky square frequently sleeping on a collapsible cot in his office despite the pressure he refused to delegate to his subordinates wanting awareness of everything at the time it happened not days or weeks later when the advantage might be lost it was almost midnight and his eyes were drooping with tiredness when he came upon the report on the newlyarrived englishman he blinked tightly against the fatigue concentrating upon the accounts from the permanent observers at the embassy and from the guards and workers in the foreigners compound there appeared to be a friendship with the american resident sokol noticed but then the previous man ingram had been a friend so the introduction was obvious he put aside the report there was nothing to indicate that brinkman was doing anything but settling in there was no cause for any special activity against the man chapter eight orlov was born in georgia at the port of poti hed tried prompted by the urgings of his anxious mother and aided by the blurred already fading photographs later to recall his father and said he could because he knew it was important to the woman but truthfully he could not he could remember however the anguish the helpless crying and afterwards for several months the long days and the long nights she spent in her room by herself refusing to emerge and for whole weeks not bothering to eat although it was not until years later that he came to know what leningrad meant beyond the name of a city and realised that the desperate mourning had been for his fathers death during the nazi siege it resulted in orlov being brought up almost entirely by his grandfather a fiercely moustacheod man and to a lesser extent by his grandmother orlov knew now that the bellowed talk and the guffawed laughter and the belly slapping and the drinking corks were never preserved for replacement but always discarded on opening were covers for an inferiority the mans inner fear but as a child he lived in permanent awe of his grandfather thinking him the bravest man who lived certainly thats how orlov considered him after that day on the sea although like the realisation about fear orlov recognised what had happened to have been through stupidity and their survival through luck the old man was a fisherman so he should have known better even though when they sailed there had been no hint of the storm not the smallest cloud in the sky hed taken them too far out for a coastal dory and ignored the clouds when they appeared first a bubbled line on the horizon and then with such frightening quickness churning out over the sky and completely blackening the sun the old man reacted then of course trying to get them back to safety but the wind was already too strong tearing at the full sail he first attempted and threatening to overturn the boat so that he had to trim it practically to the degree of pointlessness hed roared and shouted making his own noise to give him courage over the sound of the storm and made orlov take the tiller while he rowed the effort against the heaving waves as futile as maintaining the sail the old man had shown some seamanship orlov supposed keeping their constantlyswamped head into the wind and despite his age he must have been nearly seventy never flagging throughout the long night baling the water to keep them afloat the storm eased by early morning so that they could put more sail on but when they were actually in sight of the harbour the sea played a trick like the old man should have known the sea often did suddenly trapping them in a confluence of converging currents and eddies and tidal shifts theyd spun helplessly tiller and sails and oars useless caught in a sort of whirlpool that orlov had thought was going to suck them down with them powerless to prevent it which was how he felt now everything was happening too quickly with the unexpected quickness of that childhood storm and he hadnt anticipated any of it and felt himself being sucked deeper and deeper and being powerless to do anything about it hed known his position and the esteem in which he was held if it had been less the danger to natalia would not have been so great but no way not in his talks and discussions with harriet nor in his own private considerations had he anticipated how quickly he would be caught up in affairs and events upon his return to moscow hed actually expected a transitional period a time when he would be spared from the ministry to settle back into the country which was when he had intended as kindly and as painlessly as possible formally separating and divorcing himself from natalia but it hadnt happened that way there had been the need constantly to attend the kremlin practically from the first day and now he felt as trapped as inexorably as he had been that day long ago in the spinning water trapped by the ambition of a trusted and dear friend and trapped in his relationship with natalia from whom he should have been distancing himself and with whom instead he was increasingly resuming the complete and normal married life that had been interrupted by his posting to america that day at sea the spinning had stopped as suddenly as it had begun and the sea flattened into an unnatural calmness enabling them easily to get back to shore now orlov felt himself caught between two different sorts of tempest and couldnt imagine a way that either would blow themselves out there was a meeting with sevin the morning before his election an unnecessary preparation for his appearance before the central committee but an indulgence the old man required and which had to be allowed this is it said sevin enthusiastically this is the beginning at once he corrected himself given to flamboyance in his speech no he said definitely not the beginning the final well deserved end outside the mans office in the open gardens orlov could see people moving tourists mostly he envied them their minimal anxieties of where to eat and where to stay and whether they could afford either he said ive been surprised by the quickness i didnt intend it should be so conceded sevin at once no one imagined how quickly serada would fall not even me and ive been here since stalin serada hasnt fallen yet qualified orlov sevin gave a dismissive shake of his hand a gesture almost of irritation its inevitable everyone knows it even serada himself im not sure im ready said orlov still looking through the window so that his back was to the room how could he stop the spinning dont worry placated his friend from behind it seems rushed at the moment because of the circumstances none of us anticipated how bad the famine would be as i said your election today wont arouse any suspicion itll be as a nonvoting member merely to establish your presence when serada goes as he will it wont be you whos proposed no one will even consider you who said orlov turning back into the room chebrakin disclosed the older man hes got seven of the politburo committed and im one of them the military too well let them all exhaust themselves this time make their promises and threats to give an old man his moment of glory but thats all it will be a moment chebrakin is a diabetic and theres a liver malfunction too just like there was with andropov id estimate a year eighteen months at the outside that will give us all the time in the world to bring you up to full membership and plan the strategy and supposedly a supporter of chebrakin i shall be on the inside able to forestall any opposition before it has time to become established faster and faster thought orlov desperately he actually felt dizzy hoping maybe to deter the man orlov said what if you cant forestall the opposition what if a stronger faction emerges with someone else sevin laughed at the question enjoying being able to prove his manipulation im not your only supporter apparently within the chebrakin camp he said afansasiev and visko have aligned themselves too when we switch to the opposition that gives us the majority didenko only has the backing of two anyway the rest will come with us when they see the way its running it all seems so easy said orlov emptily so prosaically easy sevin shook his head positively it hasnt been and it wont be therell be a fight like there always is but were well prepared he paused smiling ive admired you and your ability from the moment of our first meeting he said do you know what my ambition is what said orlov miserably this is my final effort said sevin in further confession ive spent a lifetime here in government ive survived purges by megalomaniacs and wars by megalomaniacs and ive made or unmade scores of ambitious men who espouse communism and aspire to the crown of the czar but no more this is the last time the old man hesitated at the full revelation i want to live to see it he said i want to be there in the great hall when the announcement is publicly made and you are declared leader of the soviet union pietr orlov i want to be there and know that this country after all the mistakes and the stupidities and the disasters can at last be properly guided at least some way in the right direction why oh why did the man have to equate it in terms of dying or living agonised orlov two hours later sevin by his side as sponsor pietr orlov was elected a nonvoting delegate to the central committee representing the moscow area the letter arrived as ann anticipated exactly three weeks after she despatched her communication to her mother they always arrived like that as some strictly controlled calendar notation which it probably was her mother was that sort of methodical woman someone who filled her diary with birthdays on january and never forgot to cancel the milk ann read the letter intently more from curiosity than in expectation of any personal news or feeling or interest deciding as she did so that the information her mother had given could have come from the briefing sections of newsweek or time or any of the publications they got from the embassy it wasnt a letter at all it was sheets of widelyspaced writing to fill those pages showing nothing else but the performance of a duty a duty as perfunctory as subscribing to a charity to which her mothers conscience dictated or putting the cat out at night so that it wouldnt pee and stain the carpet why did she bother ann asked herself why did she continue with this ridiculous charade of maintaining contact with a family so stupid and so traditional and so hundreds of years behind the times that theyd probably even discussed cutting her out of their will as some sort of disgrace to the family fuck their will she thought fuck their will and fuck them and fuck bothering to write any more as programmed as it always was the last line of the letter was inevitable your father sends his regards it said fuck his regards best or worst of all thought ann chapter nine the evening was an undoubted success genuinely so not because of the effort brinkman put into making it so and he made every effort bringing in everything through the embassy concessions and cooking the beef to perfection and entering triumphantly with the yorkshire pudding and enjoying anns obvious delight and blairs appreciation of the remark at their introductory meeting which was why he had made the effort at all he accepted their praise of his ability as a cook but dismissed it with some deprecating remark that if he hadnt learned he would have starved at university it naturally created a conversation between himself and the woman and able to talk more fully on this occasion they found mutual acquaintances who overlapped at cambridge which provided the subject for a fresh round of chatter blair sat contentedly on the sidelines not understanding the talk of the long vac or the intricacies of punting or the rituals of picnics beside the cam after the meal brinkman served perfect coffee and left the brandy open between them on the table playing the overture from swan lake on the secondhand stereo that led the conversation to the ballet of which brinkman said he was a fanatic which he was and which blair admitted honestly that he found boring and a fresh focus of interest was established between ann and the englishman one of the few good things about living here said ann do you often get to the bolshoi he asked her obvious disappointment with the city registered but brinkman decided against pursuing it not as often as id like eddies not keen as he said lets choose carefully and take him sometime and educate him said brinkman he felt sufficiently comfortable with the american to make such a comment and blair smiled amiably back unoffended ill give it a shot if youll come to ice hockey and let me educate you about that said blair deal agreed brinkman happy with the evening he hoped hed made a point they recognised by not inviting anyone to make up the numbers brinkman led the conversation because he was the host and because he liked telling stories at small gatherings but he remained constantly alert and ready to defer if blair tried to take over the american contributed sufficient for politeness but no more appearing quite content to play a subsidiary role ann laughed at all the jokes and anecdotes the smile almost permanently on her lips they didnt however overstay excusing themselves before midnight nothing was very distant in the diplomatic enclave and as they walked back to their own apartment ann said excitedly i cant remember enjoying myself more for a long time it was fun agreed blair tolerantly betty harrison was right what did the font of all social gossip in moscow decree that he was the best thing to arrive for a long time blair unlocked their apartment door standing back for her to enter hes a clever guy caught by something she imagined in the tone of her husbands voice ann stopped in the passageway and said dont you like him sure i like him why ask that thought maybe you didnt from the way you spoke blair shook his head continuing on into the apartment hes all right wonder why hes not married blair pulled a face at her question how the hell would i know guess he doesnt want to be maybe hes tried and it didnt work perhaps betty harrison knows the answer ann had been waiting for the opportunity and decided they were both sufficiently relaxed tonight or rather he was she was already in bed when he emerged from the bathroom she said i went to see the doctor a few days ago blair stopped the concern immediate what the doctor i went to see him i heard that said blair impatiently whats wrong nothing much i was having heavy periods so i thought i should talk to him about being on the pill blair came and sat on her side of the bed the worry obvious and ann despised herself for the deceit it hasnt caused any problems has it no she said immediately reassuring he just thinks i should come off it thats all sure said the american relieved whatever he said he gave me a very thorough examination blood pressure stuff like that said ann theres really nothing wrong blair got up going around to his own side of the bed what are you going to do he said getting in beside her diaphragm said ann cautiously oh its just a bit more mechanical thats all yes he agreed in the darkness it is isnt it i could always use nothing not bother he was silent for a long time finally he said does it matter very much to you she turned towards him and said yes darling it matters very much i love you and i want to have your baby there was another silence and then blair said well talk about it not now but well talk about it you didnt make babies by talking thought ann but he hadnt said no it was going to work she thought excitedly it was going to work natalia made the move because he hadnt determinedly for several nights no he refused whats wrong nothing coward he thought there was never going to be a simple easy way never the right time so why not now sure of course im sure he knew she was looking at him in the darkness but he didnt turn towards her do you want to talk to me about something natalia invited no said orlov running away chapter ten the response of the american president to the supposed new soviet initiative was an example of consummate diplomacy and consummate diplomacy is impossible without matching consummate intelligence which was blairs intelligence washington delayed replying for two weeks robbing serada of any chance of achieving a surge of international momentum and when that reply came it was the result of an intensive fortnight of work by both state department officials at foggy bottom and us peace negotiators at geneva guided by what blair provided the soviet proposals were displayed point by point and their failings and unacceptability listed against those points and that intelligence the us reply was delivered simultaneously to the soviet embassy on washingtons sixteenth street and to the geneva conference what followed was further impressive politically before serada had an opportunity to make a second television appearance in anticipation of a us rejection the american president made a primetime tv appearance of his own with a european hookup in which the offer was dealt with more generally because some of the unacceptable issues were diplomatically esoteric but from which it was quite clear that america had no alternative other than the stance it was taking and that despite extensive rephrasing a lot of the russian offer was old and already dismissed from the negotiations with the proveable agreement of both sides the politics continued to be impressive nowhere was there the slightest criticism or accusation in the american presidents speech no apparent attempt to gain an advantage from such obvious soviet manoeuvring throughout the us reply the tone was studiously that of a world statesman which had precisely the intended effect of diminishing seradas stature and on it went the news of the soviet container ship chartering was leaked clearly through liaison brinkman recognised in london the lloyds insurance cover was the key at once ottawa confirmed the wheat deal further liaison brinkman guessed under supposed pressure from diplomatic correspondents from the white house the president declared his sympathy not outrage at the russian move in view of the understood grain shortages within the country quoting the publicly announced reshuffling within the agricultural ministry as confirmation of an internal difficulty humanity overrode ideologies and differences and for that reason the united states offered substantially to increase shipments beyond the already contracted and agreed amounts to relieve any suffering the country was experiencing the fact that common humanity overrode ideologies and differences was repeated here in case anyone had missed the point demolishing completely the russian leaders ploy the president said his offer was formally being communicated that day to the russian leadership not only through their sixteenth street residence but also through the us embassy in moscow and that he looked forward to an early and obvious agreement because what other responsibility did a government have than to help the people it was in office to serve in anticipation of that unquestioned acceptance he was allocating special rail transportation from the midwest storage hoppers so that wheat would be available immediately at ports reducing to an absolute minimum any delay in shipments once the formal request came from moscow newsweek carried a cover story calling him humanitys man and public opinion polls showed his popularity to be higher than at any time since directly after the election brinkman realised the central committee elections were important avid when the announcement came isolating orlov among the three newcomers and identifying him certainly as the youngest the luncheons between himself and blair alternating between the safety of their respective embassies became regular weekly affairs and brinkman learned at the older and still more experienced mans knee at first he wondered if the advised and recommended indicators werent too simplistic but he followed them anyway because he didnt know any alternative and he acknowledged the americans expertise in such a closed society absence explained or otherwise was identified by blair as a prime clue which was why brinkman concentrated upon the arrival of a cuban delegation which included raoul castro and in so doing did not rely upon soviet television because of the ease with which the coverage could be controlled but instead actually taking the trouble to go out to the airport for the ceremony which tass the official news agency and pravda had earlier announced serada would be heading serada didnt appear and because his unexplained absence was disguised on the television coverage brinkman was able to get the message to london in advance of the speculative news stories speculation which was heightened by the tv manipulation blair hadnt been at the airport which enabled brinkman the feeling of superior satisfaction when the american called seeking confirmation of the soviet leaders definite absence before committing himself but blair had an exchange to offer unusual and interestingly latenight arrivals and departures of official zil cars from the kremlin another seemingly innocuous indicator but according to blair an important one brinkman messaged london rigidly restricting himself to the facts not offering any opinion and was glad he did because the following day came the brief formal announcement that ivan serada was being hospitalised for tests for an undisclosed indisposition no acting deputy was nominated but at londons request for advice brinkman predicted chebrakin because he calculated the military were important he accompanied the message with as full a profile as possible upon the man and two days later got his confirmation when chebrakin emerged as the host at a government reception for the stillvisiting cubans blairs later admission because that was how close they were now that hed backed the outsider in didenko gave brinkman more satisfaction than the herogram from maxwell brinkman conceded it had been a horserace and no one not them at least had been sufficiently on the inside to back the winner with any certainty but blair the acknowledged pundit had gone for an outsider and brinkman the punter had wagered on the favourite and won luck certainly but everyone needed luck at the races it was for brinkman a period of exhilaration not simply or even predominantly because he appeared to be so consistently right but because he had the impression of being at the centre of developments he was able to anticipate he was a surfer on the highest of high rollers able always perfectly to judge the break and catch it just right and ride it into the shore close enough for the beach of accuracy to stop off without his feet getting wet the ambassador confirmed the reputation he was establishing in london not offended because brinkman had usurped the mans function as the proper political analyst at the monthly gathering the monthly gathering was an innovation of sir oliver brace the attempt at democracy where serf could address lord and be sure that all was well upon the estate it was held at the embassy the only place of convenient size the atmosphere glued with embarrassment brinkmans existing successes made it easier and there had been sufficient offers invoking the friendship of his father anyway to make the encounter easier for him than it might have been for most gather we follow similar paths in thinking offered brace when everyone arrived and the gathering was established giving him a respite from playing party host im sorry sir brinkman had expected the approach before now the demand why the earlier offers had not been acknowledged and responded to get the impression that were interpreting certain developments in the same way that wasnt an impression at all thought brinkman that was the playback from london against his political assessment compared to the ambassadors had brace got it wrong and gone for gushkov or didenko enjoying the taste of the cliche he said these are interesting times if we get them right if we get them right indeed agreed brinkman this was going to be an easier game than it ever was with blair despite their nowconfirmed friendship there was always a reserve from the american a slight holding back just brinkman conceded as he always held slightly back lie he thought his holding back wasnt slight at all imagine some changes soon pressed the embassador how do you see the situation said brinkman turning the question id like to know whether seradas illness is medical or political little doubt about that is there said brinkman continuing the role of questioner without expressing an opinion of his own thats the problem with trying to interpret events in the soviet union said the ambassador philosophically theres always doubt brinkman had already filed the opinion to london knowing he wasnt disclosing anything the ambassador might take for his own brinkman said seradas got to be on his way out and i think chebrakin will be the successor chebrakin pounced the ambassador confirming brinkmans guess that the man had suggested somebody else but like you said reminded brinkman theres always doubt been very impressed the way youve settled in here said brace very impressed indeed an asset to the embassy imagine london thinks so too heard from your father lately not for some time said brinkman give him my regards said the ambassador i will sir said brinkman and thank you for what you said nothing but the truth said the ambassador nothing but the truth and dont forget what ive already told you always willing to help i wont forget assured brinkman he didnt then anticipate how quickly the occasion would arise youve lionised him said betty harrison the canadian tried to make it a mock protest but ann guessed there was an element of feeling in what the woman said betty coveted the role of the grande dame of the diplomatic wives and would imagine it was to her salon that brinkman should pay court we havent she said he and eddie just seem to get on well she felt a bubble of satisfaction at the other womans jealousy what about you said betty archly we both went to cambridge although not at the same time seem to have a few mutual acquaintances though said ann that wasnt what i meant said the other woman ann who understood fully what the canadian had meant laughed dismissively refusing to become gossip fodder i think he is very amusing and great company at a party but he doesnt attract me in the slightest i dont believe you said betty have you seen those hands ann had and wondered idly how brinkman appeared to be able to stay so apparently hardbodied when he didnt take any exercise that she knew of and the boyish way he had of flicking the dark hair back from his forehead but only in the way of noticing things about a friend with whom she was frequently in close contact she hadnt lied to betty the thought of any physical attraction had never arisen in her mind he doesnt seem too interested in getting involved with anyone does he said ann carelessly betty seized the remark able to see several meanings in everything you dont think hes strange do you strange frowned ann not immediately understanding you know strange prompted betty you mean gay said ann at last no of course i dont think hes gay poor man she thought it was like being picked over by a hyena he dropped sharon berring like a hot potato said betty warming to her theme he did not drop her like a hot potato said ann conscious that she was in at the beginning of what betty was rapidly formulating into the weeks top story he just didnt submit to having the choice made for him how do you know demanded betty at once ann sighed mildly irritated by the interrogation i dont know she said i just guessed it seemed obvious betty stared at her friend with her head cocked artificially in obvious disbelief hows eddie she said this was getting ridiculous thought ann openly to lose her temper would be a mistake fine she said was that true ann thought letting her mind slip sideways he was fine physically and she knew sufficient about the government changes to understand that he should be preoccupied but there had been times recently when she felt he had been closing up against her not recently she thought selfannoyed at the conscious vagueness she could date precisely the beginning of her impression from the moment when he agreed they should try for a baby and they werent doing that as often as she had hoped although the work preoccupation could be a reason for his tiredness and certainly not with any success ann knew her attitude was illogical you didnt become pregnant just by wanting to become pregnant but shed expected something to have happened by now maybe she should go back to the embassy doctor to try to discover if there was a problem just fine said betty still allowing the disbelief absolutely and utterly fine said ann controlling herself she was glad now that at the beginning when she was enjoying the other womans jealousy she had not boasted about the tickets she had particularly got to surprise brinkman for the new production at the bolshoi that night in bed she said to blair you know what i think about betty harrison what i think she poisonous i dont think she spreads rumours i think she makes them up what about asked the american whatever takes her fancy said ann i thought you liked her he said mildly i do said ann confusingly but i dont think id trust her she waited hopefully but felt him turn away goodnight he said goodnight chapter eleven very occasionally too occasionally for it to be considered anything more than the most sensational good fortune it was possible to cultivate and maintain a source with some internal knowledge in moscow some intelligence officers forged links with dissidents but it was dangerous apart from closely following their illegal zamizdat because the kgb monitored the activities rigidly and sometimes infiltrated provocateurs so there was always the risk of seizure and some highly publicised diplomatic incident usually expulsion the majority of intelligence came from assessment from closely studying and analysing official announcements and seeing who was and who was not in official photographs or at official receptions frequently making conclusions from details like who was standing in relation to whom at those events sources for those assessments were usually the approved newspapers or the approved television coverage personally able to observe was a bonus which was why brinkman went to the airport for the arrival of the cuban delegation and there he was a long way away only able to establish seradas absence to get anywhere near close proximity to the soviet hierarchy practically ranked with managing to establish an internal source when brinkman realised his opportunity he went after it with the unwavering determination with which he had passed every examination and every interview and every aptitude test to jump over the heads and get the plum moscow posting the care he had taken to establish himself with everyone within the embassy helped and so at last did the offered personal relationship with the ambassador independence had to make way for necessary advantage brinkman decided the visit of the british parliamentary party was planned to be a big one not just the leader of the opposition but the shadow foreign secretary and the shadow trade secretary and three other mps who would form part of the cabinet if they were successful in the next election the defeat in the last had been extremely narrow and the forecast for the next gave them a more than strong chance which was undoubtedly a factor in the russian decision to greet and entertain them at such a high level scheduling two state banquets and a kremlin reception with private talks agreed despite his determination to get what he wanted brinkman went about his bid to be appointed official interpreter as properly as he had always conducted himself within the embassy making the approach first to the head of chancery and actually using the meeting to rehearse his arguments stressing that his official position as cultural attache made him ideally suited for the function and pointing out that his russian was unquestionably equal to if not superior to the majority of other likely choices having started the right way brinkman took the gamble and approached sir oliver brace directly the attitude of proper career diplomats to intelligence personnel in embassies varies and is frequently ambivalent intelligence agents are a necessity like daily bowel movements but not usually things to be acknowledged and certainly not to be allowed into any sort of situation involving ambassadors which might then or later cause problems brinkman was immediately aware of braces face closing as he made the request the older mans experienced professionalism at once coming to the forefront brinkman had anticipated it making frequent references to his father of whose best wishes and gratitude at the friendship being shown in moscow he assured the ambassador and disclosing the mans impending promotion to be permanent head of the foreign office brinkman knew sir oliver saw a concluding career for himself at the foreign office when the moscow posting finished a career his father would be in a position to sanction or not he said he could understand any hesitation brace might have because it would have been ridiculous for him not to have acknowledged it but insisted a personal as well as professional guarantee that nothing would arise which could cause any embarrassment a guarantee the ambassador would know to be sincere from the mans knowledge of the brinkman family brace refused initially to commit himself promising to consider it and brinkman endured the most uncertain week he had known since his arrival in moscow guessing the discussions would not just be confined to the ambassador and head of chancery but extend to london as well he wished the diplomatic cable channels were not separate from his own another precaution against embarrassment he actually considered making a direct approach to his father towards the end of the week when he heard nothing abandoning the idea because he realised the contact would have had to be by telephone which was not secure and therefore impossible and would unquestionably cause the resentment he had so far managed to avoid from everyone he got approval on the monday brinkman set about preparing himself with the care he devoted to everything he had full biographies and information details on the mps with whom he would be working pouched from london and requested and got a lot of additional material he considered lacking from the first shipment he extended the preparation beyond learning about the personalities finding out the purpose of the visit creating a statesmenlike impression in britain in readiness for the next election and the expected outcome communiques of mutual trust and friendship and assurances of close working relationships in the future another voter lure although it wasnt his responsibility brinkman involved himself in every aspect of the tour checking and rechecking their accommodation and travel arrangements and their sightseeing schedules because of his early days groundwork he was able to do so without upsetting anyone else in the embassy in cases there was actually appreciation a twoday visit to leningrad was planned and there was underbooking in both hotels and transport there so his intrusion was correctly seen to have avoided a mistake for which the embassy could have been criticised the importance of the visit for brinkman began from the moment of arrival it was seradas first public appearance since the announcement of his indisposition and brinkman was not more than ten yards away from the man and closer even than that after the party landed and he moved forward to fulfil his supposed function serada didnt look ill he was sallow certainly and as close as he was now brinkman was aware of the mans hand shaking but he thought the cause of both more external than illness there were handshakes and traditional hugs and a short ceremonial walk to inspect the waiting guard of honour seradas welcoming speech was given in a halting hesitant voice the prepared notes appearing very necessary for the man the response from the british opposition leader whose name was birdwood was robust by comparison the man alert to where the british newsmen and television crews were penned the speech verging on pomposity birdwood actually arrived with a workingclass cap but he stopped short of wearing it carrying it obviously in his hand instead the politicians had brought their wives and on the way into the capital with brinkman riding in the same car as birdwood it became obvious they saw his role as more than that of a simple translator brinkman didnt mind combining the functions of babysitter nursemaid and general factotum there was nothing wrong with making himself indispensable to a group of men and their women who might within a couple of years emerge as his countrys leaders insurance was after all what one took out against the unknown because he had immersed himself so fully in everything the arrival at the metropole and the baggage collection and the room allocations went without a hitch brinkman established an immediate advantage from their reliance upon him able to convince occasionally almost bully them into being ready at the times he stipulated at the places he stipulated the kremlin reception the first night was more worthwhile than the airport arrival serada headed the soviet party but only nominally brinkman was sure of it conscious of his incredible opportunity but equally conscious how it could be misused he tried to clear his mind of any preconceptions and was sure he obtained the necessary clarity serada had all the appearance of a castaside man once on the actual receiving line chebrakin practically thrust aside the supposed leader and shortly after that intruded himself again to complete introductions that serada should according to protocol have made brinkman was tight with excitement absorbing everything he concentrated upon serada and searched again for any sign of definite illness and he concentrated upon chebrakin whom he knew from blair positively to have disabilities and studied the mans appearance and behaviour and he concentrated upon the others in the government who had been assembled he was particularly eager to locate and study the younger ones didenko was the easiest to find because he was a full member of the politburo and brinkman recognised him instantly from the frequent photographs didenko was a burly man whose bloodpressured features were heightened by the complete whiteness of his hair he moved about the gathering with the sort of confidence chebrakin was showing according little deference to serada who at times seemed isolated and completely alone there had been three newcomers in the most recent central committee elections and brinkman strained about him wanting to identify them his supposed purpose helped calling upon him to communicate the introductions between the two parties which was how he got the first vladimir isakov nervous on his first public outing at such an elevated level judged brinkman a thin bespectacled man in an illfitting suit and a collar that gaped it was more than thirty minutes after the official greetings had finished and brinkman was feeling the first stirrings of unease before he saw another viktor petrov appeared nervous like isakov keeping himself on the periphery of everything which was how he missed being named to the british group he was a short inconspicuous man anyway better dressed than isakov but not much overawed like the other man at his surroundings where was the third orlov he remembered from his complete preparation brinkman found the man almost at once the identification easier because when the central committee elections had been announced there had existed more pictures of the man who had occupied a united nations posting than of the others orlov was a marked contrast to the other two newcomers he was tall and deeply tanned georgian recalled brinkman and very dark haired impeccably tailored compared to the others even the politburo standing urbanely to one side appearing to be examining everything around him with the sort of interest that brinkman was showing as the englishman watched orlov turned and bent slightly to his left and brinkman mentally ran the projector trying to match the highcheekboned full face to the photograph irritated that it would not immediately come sevin he remembered at last a big man stiffly upright despite his age the cane more for ornamentation than practical use one of the original bolsheviks recalled brinkman a youthful contemporary of the older lenin and trotsky and then stalin and krushchev and a survivor of them all there werent many such men left and then brinkmans memory served him again and he looked with renewed interest at the old man and the young russian in headbent conversation blair named sevin an important policymaker and the important policymaker was huddled with a complete unknown who had just been brought into the inner circle of soviet government blair had something else too we might see changes that will take us all by surprise the encounter he was witnessing from the other side of the room was insufficient by itself despite the strawclutching way they had to operate but it was worth careful note very careful note indeed serada made a speech of platitudes and birdwood made a matching speech of platitudes and then chebrakin appearing almost as if he wanted to harden the speculation made a speech of platitudes and the shadow foreign secretary a broadaccented yorkshireman named moss rounded everything off the same way brinkman devoted his undivided attention to the translation because that was the most immediate job at hand but it was hardly necessary there were a lot of glassemptying toasts and the vodka and the champagne was good and by the time the evening ended moss was straining back from the edge of drunkenness and two of the wives had already fallen over the edge giggling and then laughing uproariously at some secret joke in the car going back to the hotel and one of them stumbling over the pavement edge when they arrived nursemaid now brinkman supervised the key allocation and personally escorted birdwood to his rooms he one side the ambassador the other birdwood offered them a nightcap which they both declined and within fifteen minutes brinkman was back in the ambassadors official car en route to the diplomatic compound god knows how many groups like this ive had to handle throughout the world said brace distantly and ive never gone through one without wondering what the british public reaction would be if they knew how their elected leaders conducted themselves the permanent politicians contempt for the passing amateur thought brinkman it could have been his father talking he said i didnt think they were too bad do you know what those stupid women were laughing at demanded the ambassador no admitted brinkman breaking wind said brace disgustedly one broke wind and the other heard her and they thought it was funny brinkman smiled too at the older mans outrage at least they didnt fall over at the reception you did very well incidently said the ambassador afraid the demands can become a bit irritating at times no problem assured brinkman no problem at all it could have become one if he had allowed it but brinkman met every request and every need from a bath plug where there wasnt one at the metropole to souvenir shopping at gum to simultaneous and superbly accurate transcription of everything that passed between birdwoods party and the russians they met in addition to that first day there were five more separate occasions when he had the opportunity to be within touching distance of almost every one of the russian leaders and remove from his mind any doubt about seradas decline at two orlov was present and briefly brinkman regretted that his translator status did not permit him to try to get the russian involved in some sort of discussion although leningrad took brinkman away from his immediate focus of interest it was still useful because of the restriction of travel imposed upon embassy personnel they toured the shipyards for the visiting englishmen a necessary chore and actually went into some of the repair sheds to which brinkman would never normally have gained access what he saw in the yards and the machine shops enabled a whole separate file to london reporting firsthand about apparent disrepair and backward operating methods in the soviet engineering works which by itself was sufficient to impress maxwell there was no period of brinkmans life when he could remember working so consistently hard or so consistently concentrated intent on catching every crumb that fell from the table and it did not end of course with the conclusion of each days chaperoning after settling the british party he always returned to the embassy to transmit that days file they were always extremely long and always had to be encoded into a secret designated cipher and for over a week brinkman existed on never more than three hours sleep a night returning the final day from the farewells at sheremetyevo wondering greedily if he would ever again be able to get as close for so long to the soviet leaders as he had during the past few days brinkman allowed himself to relax for the first time and was engulfed in a physical ache of fatigue utterly exhausted he realised and worth every moment of it brinkman knew confidently not conceitedly that in months he had achieved more in moscow than most other intelligence officers achieved in years so hed proved himself again hed proved himself to his father and hed proved himself to those in the department who carped about favouritism and prayed he was going to fall flat on his ass but most important of all always the most important of all hed proved himself to himself there wasnt much time for immediate rest the intelligence community in moscow discovered from the first day what he was doing and the approaches began practically before the british aircraft cleared soviet air space the professional attitudes those of some envy and some jealousy but predominantly those of admiration for being clever enough to get himself into such a position he was the most open with blair although he held back from disclosing the apparent friendship between sevin and orlov and comparatively helpful to mark harrison the contact from the canadian coincided with that from the australians and brinkman helped them too he even offered something to the onesided french feeling he could be generous because he had done so well and he never knew when he might need to call favours in there was a personal letter of thanks within weeks from birdwood and brinkman was picked out by name in a letter of gratitude the opposition leader wrote to the ambassador maxwell wrote from london too enclosing the letter in the safety of the diplomatic bag an outstanding success the controller called it brinkman wondered how difficult it was going to be maintaining the standard he set himself the kgb identified brinkman as the interpreter on the first day but because of his distraction in the provinces it was several days before sokol caught up with it he frowned down irritated that the leaders had come under such close scrutiny of an intelligence operator there was nothing now that he could do about it maybe there wouldnt have been at the time apart from staging some accident involving the man physically removing him jeremy brinkman appeared to have progressed beyond the settlingin stage reflected the russian he made a notation to place the man upon the priority watch list ruth drove paul back from the court hollowed by what she heard unspeaking because she didnt trust herself to speak to the boy and not knowing the words anyway he remained silent beside her she couldnt handle this alone she determined taking the car across the memorial bridge she was prepared to do most things indeed shed argued custodial responsibility during the divorce because she considered it was her responsibility but there had to be a cutoff point and this was it paul was eddies son as much as hers so his liability was as great as hers even though he was on the other side of the world they had established the method of communication through langley in the event of any emergency in the overlypolite aftermath of the divorce and ruth had always determined never to use it looking upon it as an admission of failure which perhaps was the reason paul had done what he had so if she failed it was time for eddie to see if he could do better the cia personnel official was courteous and helpful and tried to commiserate by saying it was the most common problem parents had to face in america today which didnt help ruth at all because she wasnt interested in anyone elses problems the official promised to get a message to blair overnight which he did drugs exclaimed ann when blair told her that evening in their moscow apartment marijuana apparently and cocaine said blair there wasnt a complete run down obviously but it seems to have been going on for quite a long time oh darling im sorry said ann im really very sorry yeah said blair distantly and she wondered if he were thinking it might not have happened if he hadnt become involved with her what are you going to do she said theyve been very good he said immediate compassionate leave of course said ann why hadnt she thought of his going back to washington it was the obvious thing for him to do i dont know how long ill be gone it doesnt matter she suddenly remembered the coveted tickets to the bolshoi and realised hed miss the performance it was too inconsequential to mention too inconsequential to think about at a time like this i wish there was something i could do she said blair looked at her gravefaced i was just thinking the same thing he said about myself blair flew on a klm flight which enabled a convenient transfer for the washington flight at amsterdam because of blairs listing on the watch list the kgb knew of his departure within three hours it was the same watch list on which jeremy brinkmans name had been entered chapter twelve blair arrived at dulles airport unshaven and crumpled he didnt enjoy flying and sleep would have been impossible anyway so he was jetlagged his head feeling as if it were stuffed with cotton wool he went mechanically through the process of renting a car blinking to concentrate when he reached the beltway on his way into washington muscovites drove faster than this often dangerously so but here there seemed so many more cars and blair got his first reminder of how long he had been out of the country he guessed there would be many more like the reason for his being summoned home he felt easier when he was able to leave the beltway for the memorial route it took him directly by the cia headquarters openly signposted and he stared in its direction unable to see the familiar building through the screen of trees hed make contact obviously but not yet for the moment the career for which hed made so many sacrifices could be put on the back burner blair halted the slide recognising the search for excuses and irritated at himself for the weakness getting paul sorted out was the only consideration the excuses and the whoandwhatwastoblame recriminations could wait until later and his commitment to the agency would be pretty low on the list anyway he approached washington looking for landmarks the widening thread of the potomac and by the bridge the topsy turvey canoe club building he always expected to fall down but which never did the cathedral beyond proudly grand and far away misted by the heat haze the most familiar markers of all the wedding cake dome of the capitol and the exclamation mark of the washington memorial he took the key bridge exit to get into rosslyn conscious at once of the change it was really the road system the huge roundabout directly in front of the key bridge leading across into georgetown but he got the impression that there where more buildings too there never seemed anything being newly built in moscow ruth was in jeans and a workshirt and without any makeup actually with a smudge of dust against her nose when she answered the door to him frowning when she saw who it was she looked down at herself in instant embarrassment and said i thought youd call from the airport he should have done blair realised sorry he said i forgot wasnt thinking they stood momentarily staring at each other each unsure then she stepped back into the house and said sorry youd better come in blair entered hesitantly stopping in the hallway and there was another moment of uncertainty between them despite the disarrayed hair and dirt on her nose blair thought she was very pretty it wouldnt be right to tell her so hed had two hours to kill at schipol waiting for the washington connection and spent it in the bar he should have looked at the airport shops instead and got her a gift the boys too for christs sake why the hell hadnt he thought of doing so ruth broke the moment by going into the living room and he followed she said im glad youre here at this time though with the boys at school i mean we can talk yes said blair everything was extremely neat and tidy but then ruth had always been neat and tidy ann was always cleaning but blair closed his mind against the comparison that wasnt what he was here for he said unnecessarily polite can i sit down sorry of course she said they each had an eagerness to apologise thought blair and as he did so ruth said on cue sorry what about some coffee it must have been a long flight coffee would be good he accepted as she started to leave the room he said can i help and wished he hadnt as soon as he spoke no she said ill do it alone he looked around the room again there were fresh flowers in two vases one on a low table in the middle of the room and another more elaborate display on a stand near the main window on the mantle was a picture of the two boys that he hadnt seen before it was stiffly posed and he guessed it was a school photograph john was wearing a brace he saw remembering anns remark ruth returned with the coffee prepared on a clothcovered tray in a pot with the cups and the cream you havent started taking sugar yet have you she said pouring no he said she had a good memory then again maybe not they had been married eighteen years sorry i had to do it said ruth apologising still get you back i mean it seemed the only thing to do now the immediate shock of the police interviews and the court appearance was passing she was unsure whether she shouldnt have tried to handle it herself dont be silly said blair at once of course you should have got me back how bad it is she shrugged an indication of helplessness and said i dont know not really hes closed right up after the initial shock frightened i guess what happened prompted blair gently tell me what happened from the beginning ruth hesitated arranging the story in her mind and blair saw that while she was in the kitchen shed cleaned the smudge off her nose she said simply he got caught trying to rob a pharmacy he and three others all from the same class after pills they said later any sort of pills it didnt matter cocaine too if it was there they didnt know if it was carried or not but they were trying to find it intended to set themselves up set themselves up queried blair as dealers in the school jesus said blair ruth was more comfortable now still embarrassed at his finding her in workclothes but better than she had been after getting the house ready shed wanted to shower and change and be prepared absolutely before he arrived she dismissed the obvious tiredness as the effect of the nonstop flight he didnt seem to have changed much not at all in fact had it really been eighteen months since their last meeting it didnt seem that long she went on like i said they were shocked at being arrested by the police she smiled for no reason and said the cop didnt know what he was confronting apparently actually had his gun out and was threatening to shoot and if theyd run he probably would have done said blair sick at the thought anyway said ruth that was when it all came out when they were scared seems they had been doing a lot of stealing stuff from stores that they could sell on to get money forcing coinboxes on newstands they even robbed an old man of his welfare money but paul wasnt involved that time just the others she hesitated and said i suppose we should get some consolation out of that although i dont know if i do all for drugs ruth nodded at the question marijuana she said seems hes been smoking it for a long time now ive gone back through it checked it out with the teachers it is the most likely reason for the poor grades pills too and theres been some cocaine although i dont think a lot what the hell sort of school is this demanded blair needing to be angry at something ruth who had had longer to recover said calmly your average american school no worse and no better than any other the problem is so bad that it runs a drug programme and has a fulltime counsellor hes a nice guy erickson he wants to meet you sure said blair automatically not yet wanting to move on you said pauls been smoking for a long time one of the court orders was urinalysis said the woman he had a high count i had our own doctor check him out too there was some irritation of the nasal membrane because of the cocaine or maybe the crap they cut it with before selling it but not a lot she stopped and then disclosing her abrupt new education she said youve got to do it for years apparently for it to cause real damage then it can actually rot your nose away they were going to set themselves up as dealers persisted the man wanting to understand everything ruth swallowed arriving at the worst part paul told the police hed decided it was dumb to go on as they were that dealing was where the money was paul decided ruth nodded at the demand for qualification he was the leader eddie actually set it up checked out the pharmacy for the busy and slack times ruth stopped lower lip trapped between her teeth trying to stop herself crying of all the resolutions this was the strongest the one shed repeated and repeated to herself not wanting him to know how lost she felt the threat passed although her voice was still unsteady she said hed even planned the getaway checked the times of the trains on the metro and worked it out that they could make a connection and be halfway across washington before the police had time to get there holy shit said blair disgusted whats happened since there was the initial juvenile court appearance and the remand for tests and reports theres a courtappointed counsellor who wants to see you also a man called kemp and erickson from the school like i told you whats paul say about it all nothing said the woman everything ive told you i got from the police didnt you ask him shouted blair immediately regretting it holding up his hands as if he were physically trying to pull back the anger in his voice sorry he said hurriedly im really very sorry ruths face had tightened at the eruption but now it relaxed there was another resolution almost as important as not crying which involved not losing her temper or making any accusations maybe it was a fantasy but it was a nice fantasy to hope that eddies return might involve more than the immediate problem of course i asked him she said not at first not that first night i couldnt bring myself to say anything to him but when i did he wouldnt talk about it just said it was something that had happened not even sorry not even sorry she said christ what a mess said blair he smiled sadly at her im sorry ruth that you had to handle it by yourself i mean apologies after apologies after apologies he thought now i havent not any longer have i she said the gratitude obvious now youre back thanks for coming was it likely i wouldnt i dont know she said it might have been difficult there might have been something important happening there was something important happening in moscow thought blair it pleased him to realise that the leadership uncertainty and the part he was supposed to have analysing it had never occurred to him as a greater priority than returning here at the moment i dont think theres anything more important than this said blair aware of her quick hopeful smile he said dont worry everything is going to work out ok i hope so she said in so many ways she thought allowing herself the continued fantasy blair rubbed his hand over his unshaven face making a scratching sound i need to get cleaned up he said i came straight here from the airport you know where the bathroom is she said you sure thats ok what do you mean i didnt want to make any awkward situations i was thinking of the marriott down by the bridge blair was trying to be considerate but didnt think he was succeeding very well dont lose your temper thought ruth whatever you do dont lose your temper and let him see how upset you are she said wouldnt that be kind of unneccessary you sure it wont be awkward i would have thought it was rather essential considering why you came all the way back she said coming as near as she intended to criticism theres plenty of room you know that thanks he said youve hardly got to thank me eddie thanks anyway he insisted hows ann asked the woman this part rehearsed fine said blair you still friendly with his voice trailed at his inability to remember the name charlie supplied ruth charlie rogers she paused wondering whether to make the point deciding to she said thats what it is friendship oh said blair conscious of the difficulty between them he said youre looking good ruth thanks she said you too apart from this if there can be anything apart from this how have you been keeping he said ok how was thanksgiving with your folks paul played up she said now i probably know why we stayed over a few days and he wouldnt have been able to get anything jesus said blair again exasperated there was only going to be one conversation between them however hard they tried everything is going to work out ok he said another repetition youll see i wish i could be sure said ruth for a moment her control slipped and before she could stop herself she said i wish i could be sure of so many things ann decided that the problem was a personal one she considered that she was only peripherally involved and it was certainly none of brinkmans business friendly though they were and so she said simply that blair had returned to washington for a sudden family reason hope everythings all right he said it was feasible but unlikely brinkman decided it was obviously a recall to langley for something involving the leadership changes but what it would have to be something pretty dramatic to take him all the way back to america he was surprised in passing that they hadnt evolved a better excuse abrupt though the departure had obviously been im sure it will be she said but its meant an upset what ann smiled pleased with her secret i know its your birthday and i got tickets for the new bolshoi production and i planned it as a surprise for the three of us to go what a nice thought said brinkman now eddie wont be able to make it of course she said but theres no point in wasting all the tickets is there none at all agreed brinkman well make a party out of it ann wondered what betty harrisons reaction would be when she found out it would be better if she didnt the rioting that occurred in emba and in poltava and donetsk which by bitter irony had been quickly stopped by rushing the first arrival of the canadian and american wheat to both provinces was published in one of the widest circulating zamizdat in moscow sokol flooded the city rounding up the known dissidents and seizing as many copies as he could but from his informants he knew he didnt get them all and that the stories were around the capital the summons was very quick coming from panov precisely what we didnt want declared the kgb chairman without any preliminaries speculation abroad is irrelevant and inevitable but the politburo declared against the stories circulating internally you knew that sokol knew many things he knew that the conversation was being recorded for panovs defence if any purge began but worst of all sokol knew that if it had reached politburo level then he was failing in the very objective towards which he had set out bringing himself to the notice of the rulers in a favourable light conscious of the recording he said weve quelled the unrest in kazakhstan and ukraine im not interested for the moment in two of the republics im interested in the famine being known and talked about here in moscow and the fact that it is in two separate republics being known as well that was another assurance you gave me that youd contained the spread from one to another all the bestknown dissidents are under detention which the western press which feeds off them will report and because they already know thanks to the american announcement of the famine will interpret correctly as the connection this is emerging into a full scale crisis and i dont mean the crisis of people starving i mean the crisis here within this building the wheat and grain shipments are on stream now i believe i can contain it if you dont said panov in open threat others will chapter thirteen blair showered and shaved and changed but still felt cottonheaded ruth suggested he try to sleep but he decided against it not imagining it would be possible despite the aching tiredness she prepared meatloaf needing something quick and knowing it was one of his favourites anyway and he tried to eat it appreciating her effort but that wasnt easy either because he was full of events and airline food each tried to overcompensate urgently beginning conversations sometimes in competition with each other and stumbling either into conversational culdesacs or just as abrupt stops each urging the other to lead the only positive talk was how they would proceed when the boys came home after ruth confessed she hadnt warned them of their fathers return for fear that paul might run to avoid the confrontation like so much else everything else blair found it difficult to conceive that his son might try to run away from him after the difficult meal blair called each of the counsellors to arrange the required appointments putting himself at their schedule convenience and thanking both for the help and consideration they had already shown still at the telephone he hesitated about calling langley and decided against it instead still with time to occupy and not wanting to crowd ruth by his presence because he was aware of her discomfort he strolled into the bedroom that the boys shared gazing around trying to remember very little seemed the same he supposed it had to be more than two years nearer three since hed been here actually in the house it was bound to have changed everything was neat like the rest of the house and like the rest of the house he guessed that it was ruth not the boys there were a couple of junior pennants against a wall and on another facing it some advertising posters of a pop group hed never heard of near the bed he guessed to be johns because there was a ratty dirtiedbylove fur dog on the pillow guarding whatever secrets were beneath were what appeared from where blair stood to be some perfectly madeup model kits beside pauls bed was a baseball bat and a catchers mitt the mitt seemed new and blair wondered if that was how the boy had spent the twenty dollars hed sent for his birthday on the bureau which divided the two beds there was a picture of them both with ruth smiling in between blairs own photograph was framed on the wall squinting into the sunlight from the open terrace of the continental hotel in saigon his first overseas posting when he was still young and the american involvement in vietnam was comparatively new and no one had realise what sort of war it was going to turn out to be how was this war going to turn out to be he wondered blair turned at the sound behind him ruth had changed like he had it was a severe businesslike suit the sort of suit to wear to interviews or special meetings which he supposed this was and she was carefully made up not overly so but properly as if she had considered that too theyll be home soon said ruth jane collins has the car pool today she lives just opposite yes he said im scared eddie so am i he confessed they walked unspeakingly back into the main room and he said theyll see the car i rented it wont mean anything no i suppose not can i get you anything coffee or a drink or something no thanks there was a silence and then blair said do you really think he might have run rather than face me i dont know not really admitted ruth i just spend my time trying to imagine everything that could happen and then doing things to prevent it poor ruth he thought poor innocent trusting decent ruth whod never deserved anything bad and got shit from every direction the telephone rang and she jumped nervously staring at it as if she were afraid to take the call do you want me to he offered no its all right she darted a look towards blair the moment she answered as if she were embarrassed her replies abruptly curt just yes yes hes here no fine thanks she replaced the receiver and looking away from blair this time said that was charlie hes been very good calls most days wants to do anything he can to help i cant think of anything thats good of him said blair saddened by ruths difficulty did he have one no blair thought honestly he didnt feel any jealousy at ruth seeing another guy how could he that part of it whatever that part of it had ever been was over now she was alert to the sound of the car more accustomed to it than he was saying here they are before he properly heard it she halfrose towards the window then changed her mind and sat down again blair remembered a lot of noise about their entry into the house of slamming doors and dumped satchels and shouts of hello but it wasnt like that this time he heard the door just and then they were at the entrance to the room held in the doorway by his presence no one spoke or moved for what was only seconds but appeared much longer and then johns face opened in an eyeawash smile and he shouted dad youve come home blair was standing waiting as the younger boy began running across the room behind him paul said of course he hasnt stupid and john halted before he reached his father the smile a look of suspicion now you have havent you dad you have come home he implored blair felt the emotion lumped in his stomach and intentionally he didnt look at ruth because he wasnt sure it would remain at just that if he did he said im home for a while john backed away as if he had been physically rejected whats a while mean it means im going to stay here for some time but that then ive got to go back to where my job is to where she is said john utterly hostile now to where my wife is said blair one of the agreements with ruth during the uncomfortable lunch was that whatever happened and whatever was said he wouldnt lose his temper moms your wife said john this wasnt what i came here to talk about said blair its what i want to talk about said the boy dont talk like that to your father intruded ruth her face red is he your husband demanded john you know the answer to that said ruth dont be silly and dont cheek your elders undeterred the smaller boy said if hes not your husband then hes not my father shut up said blair his voice loud shut up and get in here and sit down both of you damn what theyd decided at lunchtime everything was degenerating into a hopeless mess and he had to stop it when neither moved from their position just inside the door he said again still loud i told you to get in here blair tensed knowing that both were considering whether to disobey him and not knowing what to do if they did john was the first to move still attempting defiance in a strutting walk and then paul he didnt strut he slouched forward shoulders hunched both hands in his pockets an attitude of complete lack of interest pauls hair was longer than blair remembered or liked practically lank and almost to his shoulders blair knew the boys shoes would have been cleaned before he left the house that morning because ruth always cleaned their shoes but now they were scuffed and dirty as if hed consciously tried to make them so and his shirt was crumpled half in and half out the waistband of his trousers he looked scruffy and selfneglected john looked better his shoes had been kept cleaner and there wasnt as much disregard about his clothes but it wasnt a very wide margin as blair watched he saw john become aware of how his older brother was walking and try to change the strut in midstride to conform they sat down side by side and blair supposed that a child psychologist would recommend that he thank them for their cooperation he didnt trying to reduce the barriers that had come up ruth said can i get anybody anything root beer a she stopped too quickly just as she tried to recover too quickly by finishing with a soda paul laughed a mocking sound pretty close mom almost said coke didnt you is that funny demanded blair paul came back to him in open insolence sometimes shes funnier blairs hand tingled with the urge to slap the stupid expression off his sons face instead he said when when shes in a police station hearing how you planned big important robberies when shes in court hearing how you show what a great big guy you are ripping off nickel and dime stores when shes in a doctors surgery with a bottle of your piss on the table in front of her hearing how it shows that youre part of the crowd not brave enough to be different passing around butts with everyone elses spit on them in some shitsmelling bathroom is that when shes funny is that when shes a laughaminute full of wisecracks and unable to believe her luck at having a son like you someone she can trust and know she can be proud of this wasnt how hed intended to handle it not that hed had any clear idea how he was going to handle it but the bravado had gone now and they were paying attention to him so it would do well he said paul looked away unable to meet his fathers demand just a crack he said didnt mean anything so tell me what means something insisted blair not letting him get away tell me why my son a son i love despite your not believing it wants to become a thief and a drug dealer i want to know paul tell me pauls head moved with the aimlessness of a cornered animal and his body twitched too nothing he said look at me ordered blair look at me stop shuffling like some idiot and dont say nothing when i want to know why you stole and why you wanted to sell drugs and why you want to take drugs whats it to you said paul trying to recover the insolence blair rubbed one hand against the other to wipe away the urge ok he said extending the gesture to put both hands between them their own physical barrier ok so because of what happened between your mother and me you cant believe that i have any more feelings for you any more feelings for her even so answer me this if id been coming in along the parkway this morning and id seen some perfect stranger someone id never seen in my life before lay themselves down in front of my car what would you have expected me to do john looked sideways at his brother and sniggered and paul sniggered too stopped i guess stopped echoed blair glad the boy hadnt suggested swerving which would which have taken a lot of the point away i would have stopped to have prevented their getting killed dont you think im going to try to do something everything to stop someone whos not a stranger someone i love despite what you think killing himself and not just for yourself for your mother and for a younger brother who admires and respects you so much that he actually tries to walk like you halfway across the room john blushed at being caught out and sniggered again and blair wondered desperately if he were penetrating any of the barriers not trying to kill myself muttered the older boy youve laid down in the road and invited everyone to run over you insisted blair pleased at the way his impromptu analogy was working youre not stupid paul not really what youve done is stupid but youve known that it was havent you known that it is suppose so conceded the boy reluctantly suppose so blair said relentlessly you dont suppose so you know so thered been training courses on interrogation at langley long lectures on when to be soft and when to be hard but never in circumstances like these was he doing it right he wondered maybe said paul blair realised he wanted to open the door not smash it into the kids face switching from hard to soft actually softening his voice he said ok so why everyone else was doing it decided to try it paul was still reluctant biting the words out so if anyone else laid down on the parkway youd do it too to see what it was like beside his brother john gave a small laugh blair hoped the child was laughing with him and not against him just as he hoped the roadway analogy wasnt getting a bit thin course not said paul whats the difference lot of difference feel good when you were stealing and when you were smoking good enough to want to go on doing it until the time when a cop didnt wait to see you were a kid and didnt have a gun and blew you away or was that the next move after youd set yourself up as a dealer get hold of a saturday night special and become a real hotshot blair was aware of ruth turning away unable to face the onslaught didnt think about it what did you think about did you think about your mother and breaking her heart or me who loves you or john who looks up to you blair realised he was risking repetition but he wanted to get more reaction than this out of the kid when did you think of me blurted the boy it had been a long time coming but blair was glad it finally had who are the others paul he said others arrested with you jimmy cohn set out the boy doubtfully david hoover frank snaith billie carter so tell me about jimmy cohn and david hoover and frank snaith and billie carter how many of their parents are divorced david hoovers said paul at once but not jimmy cohn and frank snaith and billie carter no so whats their copout dont understand said the boy who did it wont do paul said blair dont try to use what happened between your mother and me as the excuse and expect me and your mother and every counsellor and social worker to sit wringing their hands and sympathising with what a raw deal you got ok im demanding you to be honest with me so ill be honest with you as far as that honesty need go to be honest you did get a bad shake so did your mother so did john and ive never stopped thinking of you or your mother or john or being aware of what i did and feeling sorry for the way it happened but it did happen theres nothing any of us can do now to turn the clock back life isnt like that a place for second chances not often anyhow and dont try to con me or anyone else by pretending that this was some halfassed attempt to bring your mother and me back together because im not buying that either you didnt think of anyone when you stole and robbed and smoked grass and shoved shit up your nose you just thought about yourself you made yourself a selfpity blanket and wrapped yourself up in it and decided there was no one else in the world more important than paul edward blair maybe he shouldnt have sworn and maybe hed gone on too long but he hoped some of it was getting through ruth managed to look back into the room eddie was being far harsher than she had expected far harsher than she imagined the juvenile officer would want him to be but a lot of it needed saying what had he meant by there not often being an opportunity for second chances would he have talked about their getting back together if he hadnt obviously thought about it she stopped herself guiltily she and eddie were not what they were talking about not directly anyway you havent said much paul encouraged his father nothing to say said the boy thats a kids reply said blair you a kid no said paul no what pressured blair momentarily paul didnt comprehend then he said no sir so when are you going to stop behaving like one when are you going to start thinking of someone other than yourself the boy made another of his animal head swings or was it something like being punchdrunk wondered blair hed hit the kid hard ive been out of the country for a long time said blair expressions change but do you know the expression i remember to describe people like you paul it was punk and before that it was jerk they meant the same really they described people who were smalltime but thought they were bigtime and went around screwing up their own lives and the lives of a lot of people all around them im not going to let you do that to yourself or anyone else were going to talk it through and were going to bring out all the problems imagined or otherwise and were going to solve them imagined or otherwise and youre going to grow up and stop thinking you need special favours and special treatment ruth interceded deciding it had gone on long enough getting the longago offered sodas and blair took the hint and stopped realistically acknowledging that to attempt any sort of family gathering on the first night would be impossible she fed the boys first and put them to bed and blair stood once more at the bedroom door and watched while she kissed them goodnight but didnt try to kiss them himself because he knew paul would resent it and john might be confused and he didnt want either reaction she had steaks and he cooked them outside remembering his promise to ann and afterwards he and ruth sat in the living room where the confrontation had taken place and blair said im not sure i did it right im not either she said she moved quickly to explain what sounded like criticism but wasnt not that i think you said anything wrong i just dont know how it should have been done who the hell does he used to be a bright kid able to express himself said blair disbelievingly he looked at his watch working out the time difference it was too late to call ann now you have to go somewhere no he said its good having you here she risked i agree with everything you said about the divorce and not being an excuse or a reason or anything like that but i could never have spoken to them like that women cant kick ass not this woman anyway we just agreed that were not sure kicking ass was the right way shit she thought disappointed at his response you havent said how long you can stay she said as long as it takes he said it was an exaggeration and hed better call langley tomorrow and see someone to make it possible but he sure as hell wasnt going to run out on them again not until everything was sorted out and call ann too he hoped she was all right brinkman went back over everything examining all the clues and all the indicators and then he arranged a meeting with mark harrison and offered more from his period as interpreter glad hed held something back to bargain with in the hope of getting from the canadian some hint of what he might haved missed or overlooked which had taken blair back to washington and found nothing hed spent too long ahead of the pack with the plaintive cries behind him and decided he didnt like being back there among them with someone else out in front he considered making some social approach to ann before the planned birthday celebrations not that she would have known anything positive of course because that wasnt the way things were done but there might be a hint of a nuance that would be sufficient to show him where to look but he decided against it if she told blair which she undoubtedly would then it would show he was anxious using the friendship in fact better to wait it wasnt long hed make it a good celebration though chapter fourteen blair was still disorientated by the time changes and despite the final headdropping tiredness as he sat with ruth he awoke early while it was dark seven in moscow he calculated his normal time would ann be awake hed have to call her today he had to call a lot of people today blair lay feeling the familiarity of his former home wrapped about him thinking about the previous day and trying to decide whether he had handled it correctly unsure too about some of the things hed said to the boy maybe thousands of kids stayed straight and all right after their parents divorced but could he dismiss it entirely no he thought honestly continuing the honesty blair realised hed tried to take the divorce out of any discussion as much for his own conscience as to get through to paul maybe more so the acceptance discomfited him making him feel guilty he had given the kid a bad shake hed given all of them a bad shake ruth worst of all because they were only kids but shed been able to understand it all hed behaved like a shit and shed behaved like a saint like she was still doing he had to do more determined blair not just now he was doing all he could now but later when this had been settled she deserved it the kids deserved it conscience again sure it was what else could it be but proper conscience this time blair reviewed the day ahead watching the sky gradually lighten outside and listening intently for the sounds of movement elsewhere in the house when they came after a further two hours blair remained where he was the earlier feeling of familiarity giving way to another sensation the awareness that it was no longer his home and that he was a visitor to it and like a polite visitor it was necessary to wait until the people who really lived there got through their established morning routine and cleared bathrooms before he intruded the boys were at the breakfast bar when he emerged ruth cooking the pancakes at the stove she wore a housecoat but her hair was carefully brushed the boys appeared tidier than theyd been the previous day he saw ruth had cleaned their shoes the tightness remained between them all but blair thought it was slightly less strained than yesterday awake for so long he had prepared for the encounter deciding it was important to create some sort of balance even if the effort appeared obvious and not refer constantly to the reason for his being there he asked if there were a team they supported and hesitantly almost unconvincingly they said the orioles and blair said if there were a game that weekend would they like to go out to baltimore and take it in the acceptance was hesitating too john made an effort asking what moscow was like and blair snatched at the opening and said it was very different from america and he had a lot to tell them about it and why didnt they talk about it over dinner john nodded eagerly the excitement at having his father again in the house obvious paul gave no reaction why the hell does he behave all the time like some goddamned dummy thought blair irritably they were waiting lunch pails ready and packed when the car sounded outside ruth kissed them both but blair held back like he had the previous night maybe it would be possible before he finally went back he thought but not now with the importance of that in mind he telephoned langley while ruth was clearing the boys breakfast things and setting places for them he didnt know whether the division chief would already be in but was glad when ray hubble came on to the line it was insecure so the conversation was necessarily general hubble had been the supervisor in rome when blair had been there and theyd worked together at headquarters before blairs london posting so an acquaintanceship at least existed between them hubble said he was sorry to hear blair had a problem and was there anything he could do and blair said that was what he wanted to talk about hubble offered that day but blair said tomorrow he wasnt going to rush the encounters with the counsellors blair had thought about them in the early hours wanting to get the maximum out of the meeting so he telephoned them both and suggeted a combined rather than separate encounter both agreed ericksons office was decided upon ruth had brewed fresh coffee by the time he returned to the kitchen which was all he wanted he told her about the altered arrangements with the counsellors and the reason and asked in afterthought if she wanted to come would it help said the woman at once ive seen them both several times but if it would help of course ill come maybe better by myself the first time he agreed he finished his coffee and said id like to make another call all local calls are free in washington she reminded him imagining he had forgotten this isnt a local call he said oh she said realising she seemed to spend longer than was necessary with her back to him getting more coffee and then she said sure go ahead collect calls are difficult in moscow he said if youll let me know the cost when the bill comes in ill send you a cheque polite visitor he thought again no problem said ruth she looked down at the housecoat as if surprised to find herself wearing it i should get dressed she said blair used the kitchen extension it was a bad connection and he had to shout over the echo on the line wishing it hadnt been necessary each agreed they were fine ann asked how things were and he said he didnt know not yet he didnt know either when he would be getting back she told him she was taking brinkman to the ballet and he agreed it was a good idea i miss you she shouted me too blair yelled back i love you me too he yelled again he supposed ruth who would be able to hear every word would guess but hed tried polite visitor blair promised to call again and ann said she hoped everything would turn out all right she said again that she loved him but blair didnt respond this time he finished the call before ruth came back into the room thanks he said everything all right seems to be it was a bad line so i gathered shall i fix lunch thought we might eat out ruth smiled immediately pleased at the invitation fine anywhere particular you like you choose she said hopefully dominiques used to be good she smiled again glad hed remembered dominiques had been important to them the place where theyd celebrated special occasions like birthdays and wedding anniversaries and news of his promotions and postings it would be nice to have another special occasion to celebrate there dominiques would be lovely blair was early for his appointment with the counsellors at ericksons office ahead of the other official both men were similar and blair wondered if it were the job they dressed uncaringly pants unpressed and creases concertinaed in the bends of their arms ties straying from their collars kemp was taller and wore spectacles but both were overweight stomachs bulging over their belts erickson offered coffee which blair didnt want but which he took anyway thanks for seeing me like this said blair i thought it was best makes our schedules easier said kemp so youre busy said blair to the school counsellor erickson smiled an attempt at reassurance believe me mr blair what youre going through right now isnt unusual for american parents today blair recognised the effort but found the man faintly patronising would kids feel the same way he said its unusual for me i want to get it sorted out thats what we all want said erickson so how do we do it i wish i knew admitted the school official ive got seventy kids im trying to help and id guess that many again i dont know about yet and ive stopped bothering to count the number im responsible for said kemp fuck their problems thought blair all he cared about was his own youre the experts he said holding his irritation if i cant get answers then im looking for advice you live abroad said erickson moscow said blair have you had a chance to talk to paul blair nodded i tried last night tried picked up kemp i couldnt get through to him said blair maybe i did towards the end but im not sure but he wouldnt talk to me say anything i asked him why he did it and he just sat there like a dummy thats usually the way said kemp blair decided the man was definitely annoying him so youre the experts he repeated so you tell me why do they do it i wish i knew that too said kemp theres never one single reason or a way of assembling all the factors into any understandable answer theres peer pressure being shamed into it by someone they admire a bigger guy theres experimentation the way most kids have should have theres boredom theres the availability of the stuff all sorts of stuff its easier to buy dope on a street corner than it is to buy bread supermarkets close dealers are always there so why arent they cleared off the damned streets they are said erickson and the moment literally the moment they go theres two more to take their places blair felt the frustration building up inside him lets talk specifics he tried again lets talk about paul and lets talk about me and lets try to find something we can do ill take your word about it being a modern american problem and ill take your word about all the reasons it can happen but i want to find a way will find a way to stop paul fucking himself up blair hadnt intended to swear but didnt really give a damn whether they were offended or not there wasnt any reason why they should be how did you talk to him last night asked erickson how calmly trying to understand or did you lose your temper blair conceded it was justified after his outburst calmly as far as i was concerned he said i dont think i shouted and i dont think i lost my temper but i let him know how i felt i let him know i thought what he had done was stupid and weak and that i thought hed let everyone down and that i wasnt accepting the fact that my wife and i are divorced to be any excuse that there wasnt an excuse blair paused then he said and i am trying to understand i keep asking questions but no one seems able to provide any answers blair saw the two men exchange looks and realised they considered hed handled it wrongly erickson said you were aggressive no refused blair i was direct and straight like i felt a father should be except perhaps that a father should be at home and not a polite visitor a factor i didnt mention was that sometimes drugtaking is a rebellion against authority said kemp in his lecturing voice rebellions against authority get crushed thats what law and order means said blair impatient at the meaningless cliche growing up becoming an adult he stopped unsure which way his argument was leading him ok he resumed making the mistakes that growing up means thats all right that happens it happens that i can understand accept even if he got drunk id understand it why demanded erickson slightly ahead of the other counsellor blair blinked at the concerted demand kids get drunk it happens he said badly do you know what the worst drug in existence is mr blair said kemp who appeared to regard himself as the spokesman alcohol is the worst drug it kills more people and causes more lost work days and more lost school days and more accidents than marijuana and cocaine and heroin and pills put together whose side are you on said blair letting the exasperation show pauls side said kemp im not on your side and im not on your wifes side and im not on anybody elses side just pauls at last said blair at last someones said something positive we always try to be positive mr blair said erickson ive sat through a hundred meetings like the one im having with you now and let me tell you that your reaction is the reaction of practically everyone you think were inconclusive and you think were weak and you get impatient but try not to show it because you love your kid and think you might in some way affect how well try to help him if you loudmouth us were not interested in making our own points mr blair in expressing our opinions and our attitudes because our opinions and attitudes are middleaged and already formed and at the end of every frustrating day we go home to a home where theres a sixpack in the fridge and if its been a bad particularly frustrating day we might even blow the whole six pack and get drunk and when were drunk we might believe that things arent really as bad as they are which is what taking drugs is all about mr blair not wanting to know how things are not dramatic major worldshattering things but the really important things things that directly affect you and worry you and wake you up in the middle of the night those things not wanting to face up to how bad or how easily solved those things are blair felt the words dump over him like a wave at the very moment of hitting the shore when its like a punch and stronger than any resistance and knocks you over and sends you sprawling on the sand looking a fool theyd had their shots and hed had his and they were still at either end of a hugely wide bridge he said youve seen paul both of you talked to him yes said kemp so whats his problem what wakes him up in the middle of the night and seems insoluble we dont know said erickson because he doesnt know thats the problem because its the problem with so many of the kids not just paul why he sat like a dummy with you last night and when you asked him why he did it said something stupid like he didnt know is that what he said that he didnt know about that agreed blair wanting to air the doubt he said could the divorce the fact that im thousands of miles away and his mothers got to cope by herself could that be it maybe said kemp unhelpfully or maybe his problem is not being able to hack his school work or pimples or how much or how little pubic hair he has or how a girl hed like to show that pubic hair to is more interested in someone elses i didnt smoke dope or snort coke and hold up stores to do either because i couldnt hack my school work or had pimples or was worried about getting laid said blair because that was thirty years ago said erickson didnt you drink a beer occasionally yes thought blair giddy on the carousel determined to achieve something he started my problem and at once stopped pauls problem he began again is that he lives in washington and i live in moscow im here now will be here now to see him through whatever needs to be done but then ill have to go back and i wont be around to follow up what the court decides and whatever you guys try to do i know i should be but i cant be what about visiting asked kemp not just for paul i know theres john as well what are the visitation arrangements whatever whenever said blair my wife and i remain extremely friendly but ive been in moscow for two years and it isnt easy bringing kids there he hesitated and if theres one thing im certain about about my kids its their resentment against my second wife you havent seen the kids for two years said erickson blair took the rebuke knowing now no not now knowing as he had for too long that it was justified eighteen months he said in desperate qualification i came back eighteen months ago to sort some things out for two days and didnt stay at the house he remembered divorce things said kemp refusing him an escape yes said blair trapped thirty years ago when i was a kid too said kemp i think i might have taken a drink maybe two if i hadnt thought i was important enough for my father to bother about for eighteen months at a time how was it asked ruth when blair got to dominiques he was late and she was already in the small side bar nursing a whisky sour blair didnt answer not at once still not through with stripping away the selfprotective attitudes a process which had started at the end of his encounter with the counsellors and continued in the cab on his way to the restaurant good he said selfreflective expanding more forcefully he went on im not sure because nobodys sure about anything but i think it was good and i think ive found a way to help paul now it was ruths turn to hesitate how she said at last ive been wrong ruth said blair intent upon a complete catharsis i abandoned paul john too ive got to work out some way to be their father again their proper father ruth sipped the whisky needing it and wishing it were stronger how she managed i dont know admitted blair still selfenclosed and not fully aware of how intently ruth was waiting find some way of getting them into moscow of liking ann and if that isnt possible then making ann understand there have got to be times i have to spend with my kids ruths drink became really sour curdling in her stomach and coming back into her throat so that she had to swallow against it and she actually coughed to clear the sensation if it helped paul please god cured paul then it was a special occasion more special than any before but not special like shed wanted it to be natalia sat awkwardly before him cowed but slightly bent to one side like a beloved pet whod always obeyed and done every trick suddenly brutally beaten for some misdemeanour it didnt understand why the question came out as a wail i just dont feel anything any more orlov was wet with perspiration forcing himself on feeling like a man trying to wade a swamp without knowing where the safe ground was the mud dragging him down deeper and deeper but why said the woman again you havent given a proper reason apart too long said orlov not the same any more where were the rehearsed sentences and the balanced arguments points carefully anticipated against points everything arranged so there wouldnt be a scene like this it can be the same she pleaded desperately we can learn to love each other again i love you no he said orlov wished the mud were real and he could be engulfed by it please no she fell physically sideways against the edge of the chair once trying to raise her head for another protest but being swept away by tears before the words formed staying huddled there with the sobs shuddering through her this hadnt worked as it should have done thought orlov not at all would the rest the dissident arrests in moscow were reported in the western media as panov predicted and it was linked with the famine in the regions which panov also predicted the practice of rushing the western supplies in their entirety to the areas of worst unrest which sokol organised initially became unworkable because it denied anything to other suffering districts and caused rioting to break out there whenever there was trouble sokol had any obvious leaders immediately arrested and jailed in penal institutions as far away from their homes and regions as possible the internal militia worked always on orders to open fire on any mob violence five people were killed and twenty wounded in rovno in the ukraine and three died in gomel sokol the methodical man evolved a regime working from six in the morning through until midafternoon monitoring the shortages and guaranteeing the transportation of the relief shipments and from then working until near midnight on other material moving through the second chief directorate more alert to fresh undermining danger than the now scarcely thoughtof need for an impressive coup he stared down at the report of blairs return to washington what he thought worriedly did that mean chapter fifteen it was not a sudden idea it had been with ann for some time but she refused to acknowledge it then she realised how ridiculous she was being and determined there was nothing wrong with it jeremy brinkman was a friend just a friend and she was by herself and almost climbing the wall with boredom so what was wrong with seeing a friend shed even discussed it with eddie well that wasnt strictly true shed told eddie about the bolshoi and that hadnt happened yet but there wasnt a lot of difference eddie wouldnt see anything wrong with it how could he there wasnt anything wrong with it she just wanted to talk to someone else before she started talking to herself nothing wrong with that at all nothing that any sensible adult would find betty harrison would probably make it into something rivalling war and peace but sod betty harrison gossiping old cow brinkman who was growing increasingly frustrated because everything had gone quiet but he knew was absolutely convinced that blair was involved in something big was delighted to get anns call despite the previous decision not to he was approaching the point of calling her he told her dinner sounded like a good idea and no he wasnt doing anything and she had no reason to apologise in advance for her cooking and hed be there at seven which he was as the hour struck with a bottle of wine french not russian and a giftwrapped box of floris soaps and bath preparations hed had freighted from london in the pouch to thank her for the bolshoi but decided to invest earlier hopefully ann wasnt in fact a particularly good cook and shed tried too hard which made it worse she hadnt marinated the meat sufficiently and it had obviously been tough before she started and she added the cream to the stroganoff too soon and it was on the point of turning fabulous said brinkman next time show me how to do it dont be silly she said would i lie i dont know she said would you he laughed if i had to but here i dont how often elsewhere all the time he parried she was in a funny mood and he wondered why hows eddie he asked it wasnt too soon it was an obvious question he called me today she said immediately brightening but it wasnt a good line he seems ok how longs he going to be away that was another obvious question hes not sure she said not yet big thought brinkman eddie blair was on to something big wouldnt have thought hed stay away for too long coaxed brinkman the embassy have been very good she said i think he can have as long as he likes what the hell did that mean shed have been given a cover story of course hed already decided that why didnt you go with him he tried ann smiled at him sadly she was using him she decided so he deserved some sort of explanation i dont think it would have been a very good idea for the wife of the second marriage to go back and get involved with the wife of the first do you brinkman knew about the divorce of course theyd made no secret of it during the increasing friendship and hed guessed it anyway because of the obvious age differences it would have made an easy cover for blair to get back to langley he said battlefield eh oh no said ann ruths super brinkman thought that if the circles got much tighter hed disappear up his own ass so why didnt you go back with him he persisted in an effort to make it seem a casual remark he picked up the bottle adding to her wine it just wouldnt have been a good idea she said positively time to lean forward and time to lean back he thought so now it was time to lean back instead he said even if ruths super it cant have been easy important things like wars and history changing events and the revelation of secrets that shouldnt be revealed never have important beginnings when they are looked at and examined impartially later the trigger is invariably inconsequential so inconsequential its difficult sometimes impossible to believe something so insignificant could cause such a reaction brinkman had been pressing certainly but it wasnt a considered question he was filling in actually keeping the talk on the same track while he tried to determine upon another route to take him to the destination he sought christ it hasnt been bloody easy erupted ann and with the floodgates abruptly opened everything poured out she told him about her first meeting with blair in london when he was attached to the grosvenor square embassy and she had been a junior research assistant at the foreign office just six months down from cambridge how shed liked ruth and initially actually been amused at blairs texas mannerisms all john wayne and howdy and how hed been the only friendly face shed known at another reception british this time and without ruth within a month how it had been a boring event she intended to leave early and when he said he was going too it had seemed a good idea to have another drink at a bar he knew just off sloane street which was on her way home anyway how thats all it had been a friendly drink but how hed called her to suggest lunch and shed agreed curious and flattered but positively not interested even though she found him worldly and comfortable to be with funny too hed always been very funny in those days the realisation came as she talked more an internal reverie than a conversation he wasnt funny any more not like he had been then not like the time when hed been telling stories so interesting and so amusing that shed driven herself up rather than go to the bathroom when she should have done and hed suddenly made her laugh so much that she couldnt stop it happening and peed her pants brinkman sat unspeaking and receptive like a fisherman whod put himself in precisely the right spot on the running tide that would bring the fish in trawling with a net so fine that not even a minnow would get through he topped her glass again and ann talked on about the guilt of the affair and the decision to be honest and how ruth had behaved super was a frequent word and how guilt wasnt easy to get used to ever any more than moscow was easy to get used to ever brinkman had known about her irritations because shed hinted at them before and they were the sort of irritations that a lot of western embassy staff had and he hadnt considered them any more important than that frustrated anecdotes of frustrated problems of frustrated people the normal cocktail party conversation at cocktail parties there was always exaggeration no one willing to concede their disappointment was less than anyone elses but as he listened brinkman became aware that what ann was saying wasnt cocktail party or dinner party smalltalk but something causing her genuine unhappiness he let her purge herself trying to see the catch as it went into the net not sure he wasnt wasting his time but conceding that fishing was a timewasting exercise anyway he tried throwing in a lure occasionally but she didnt bite its moscow she said i know its moscow anywhere else wouldnt have been so difficult doesnt eddie like it said brinkman attempting a brighter bait its very important for him here its his career hes very good at what he does so whats he doing now thought brinkman maybe itll be better when he gets back said brinkman more direct than he had so far been she frowned at him confused why should it be tangled in his own line brinkman said i thought maybe he might have gone back to discuss what happens next anns frown stayed i told you its a family thing so you did said brinkman wasnt thinking it would be wonderful though to know there was another posting said ann retreating into the reverie where would you like said brinkman anywhere but here she said suddenly vehement if there were an embassy at the north pole id happily swop it for here momentarily but only just putting aside his personal interest brinkman decided that ann was one very unhappy lady because of their professional contact he supposed he was closer to blair than to his wife and thought blair might have mentioned it at some time because they didnt always talk shop maybe blair didnt know brinkman thought that unlikely he was a perceptive guy its not that bad he said not for a man she said still intense not for you youve got something to do brinkman hadnt thought about it until now but he conceded things couldnt be all that good for her stuck here with nothing to do maybe he was lucky not being married he said you wont be here forever thats what i tell myelf every morning when i wake up and every night before i go to sleep was it moscow he wondered or had she made it moscow transferring the pain of other things and blaming a difficult city what other things hed never been aware of any strain between her and eddie and hed been with them enough times to think he would have noticed if there had been had he got it wrong then had eddie genuinely gone back to washington for something to do with his first wife what was it shed said i dont think it would have been a very good idea for the wife of the second marriage to get involved with the wife of the first do you something like that things like that had happened before but shed said something else ruths super she wouldnt have said that certainly not in her present mood if anything like that was happening the circle was getting tighter and tighter he thought what does eddie say he asked outright hes busy she said it wouldnt be right to bother him you told me said brinkman throwing the inconsistency at her ann looked at him in sudden surprise yes i did didnt i she said she actually blushed and brinkman thought she looked very pretty and very vulnerable im sorry she said that was unforgivable he felt across for her hand and she let him take it youre forgiven he said isnt that what friends are for to have convenient shoulders im not sure that other friends are supposed so openly to cry upon them she said still embarrassed its allowed for special friends thanks for being a special friend she said after the meal which he praised again they left the table and drank brandy sitting in easy chairs they listened to some verdi and he promised to let her have the latest graham greene novel which hed had sent from london and which hed almost finished refusing absolutely to give up he told her to give his regards to eddie when they next spoke and she said she would and then stopped so he failed again but shed opened up to him about a lot of other things brinkman realised maybe he was expecting too much too soon in his impatience there was the bolshoi yet maybe hed get a clue when they went to the bolshoi its been a wonderful evening he said making to go and it was a super meal really you said you lied all the time she remembered happier now the confession was over not to you he said he extended his hand in invitation little finger crooked joining in the game she linked her finger with his in a childlike handshake i promise never to lie to you and if i break it the witches will see that all my teeth fall out she laughed at the nonsense of it and said eddie used to say things like that and wished she hadnt the moment she spoke brinkman disentangled their fingers and said thanks again youre welcome she said he leaned forward to kiss her goodnight and she offered her cheek allowing it he hadnt learned a thing not a thing he wanted to learn and the meal had given him indigestion thought brinkman on his way home through the foreign enclave it had been a wonderful evening decided ann she didnt feel as uptight or miserable or lonely as she had and it had been a comforting shoulder to cry upon jeremy brinkman was very nice she liked him that night they ate as a family together because blair insisted upon it barriers were bullshit and he determined to bulldoze them like youd bulldoze barriers or bullshit he thought hed come close to losing the kids in every meaning of the word losing and he thought hed been lucky if it were possible to imagine luck emerging from what had happened to paul because it had brought him back and made him see what he was doing or not doing it was their barriers that needing bulldozing and his bullshit blair ignored their silences and their resentments insisting they help him prepare the barbecue even though he knew they didnt want to and he didnt need them deputing john to fan the coals into life and paul to put on the hickory chips when the time was ready he hadnt discussed it with ruth but she got a sense of what was happening and joined in as well an actress enjoying the play setting the table outside and bringing blair beer which he drank from the can john found it easier and because the child had tried in the morning asking about moscow it was easier for blair too because it looked initially as if he were fulfilling a promise which was how he started intentionally talking about the revolution and how moscow hadnt been immediately important but st petersburg they didnt know what his job was but he knew theyd be interested in spies because kids were always interested in spies and so he told them about dzerzhinsky and the statue in front of the kgb headquarters he could have lectured about all the others of course but he missed out the dull ones and concentrated upon those involved in the better anecdotes like yagoda who started as a pharmacist and who assassinated using his pharmacists expertise and yezhov who epitomised the terror the like of which they could never imagine and beria who came within an inch maybe less than an inch of seizing power after stalins death he told them about the decay of the romanovs and of a monk called rasputin and how although a lot of people didnt believe it he was sure a woman called anna anderson whod died within the last few years was genuinely princess anastasia who had survived in a way no one knew from the bolshevik massacre at ekaterinburg and he got them blair worked hard physically worked hard so he ached but he got them he said youll like it blair had talked continuously dominating everything presenting a monologue so when he stopped they didnt at first realise it it was john more responsive throughout who reacted first like it he said when you come said blair come started the younger boy and then jerking to a halt remembering the obstruction the final stripping time realised blair it was like exposing himself nakedly and he didnt like the idea but he disliked the idea of losing the kids more i wasnt honest yesterday he admitted i used the word but i wasnt honest blair looked at ruth she was sitting not looking at anyone both hands cupped around a can of beer which she was drinking just like he was without a glass their drug thought blair he said i got near to something when i talked about your mother and i not being together any more what i didnt get to say get to admit was that only your mother whos a very special lady has fully adjusted to it i hadnt havent and you certainly havent but its mostly my fault nearly all my fault you cant accept that i love you because i havent given you any reason for believing me but i do love you now i want to say sorry and show how i feel your very special mother and i agreed when we divorced that we should each spend as much time with you as we could blair stopped looking at paul if you were naked then everyone automatically looked at your private parts so what the hell he went on i accused you last night of copping out because you have youve copped out but so have i more than you ive known understood how you feel about ann and instead of trying to find a solution for that ive used the difficulty of moscow as an excuse he stopped again paul and john were important not his own stupid fucking pride he said i ran away paul i ran away from you and i ran away from john just like you tried to run away from whatever it was you didnt want to confront which was probably the thought of me not wanting you any more which was never the case but which i can understand you thinking ruth hadnt moved and the boys were not looking at him either embarrassed at the admission that superman couldnt really fly he said i can understand why you hate ann blair paused qualifying himself again unhappy at the exaggeration of hatred against someone he loved why you dislike her he resumed i want that am determined that should stop blair slapped the table to maintain their attention ive told you tonight about moscow and i want you to come to see it see it with me and that means meeting ann and understanding what things are like not what youd like them to be instead and learning to accept that i have a new wife who wont intrude into your life but would like to be part of it if youd let her it means us becoming friends again id like to be your best friend the person you come to when youve got a problem instead of running away from it to some street corner and it means that im going to come out of moscow whenever i can with or without ann while youre learning to adjust to the fact that shes now my wife and be with you as often as i can blair stopped all the words used up needing to gulp from the can he didnt couldnt remember how it had sounded but it was the best he could do he said as things are as you know things are not perhaps as youd like them to be let me come back the track record so far isnt particularly impressive and im ashamed of it but let me start being a proper father again the sort of silence developed when there seemed to be sounds when really there werent any hed taken control and now he had to exercise it decided blair well he said john predictably responded first sounds good he said then hurriedly dad there was a further loud silence paul prompted blair the key turned and the dam burst the boy had tried to hold back so when he couldnt any longer the tears burst from him and blair felt forward for pauls hands to have got up to move to comfort him would have been wrong and blair was still measuring everything with a slide rule and paul felt forward for his and blair started to cry too unashamedly wanting to weep if it would help paul which was after all what he was trying to do please dad said the sobbing child please sure soothed blair sure ruth was crying too the reconciliation between eddie and the boys was the excuse not the reason chapter sixteen blair glanced at the statue of nathan hale the american patriot hanged as a spy by the british during the american war of independence in its imposing setting in front of the cia headquarters and then while his id was being checked at the entrance at the inscription in the marble hallway and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free did he know the truth yet he thought so after the soulbaring with the kids it seemed to have helped he realised that it was too early to attach overimportance to omens but the signs were good john had made it very clear the previous night he wanted to be kissed and that mornings breakfast had been like blair remembered actually some noise and the boys talking between themselves and then initiating some kind of conversation with him and ruth blairs thoughts stayed with the woman he believed it was a breakthrough of sorts and would have imagined she would as well yet she seemed strangley subdued he supposed it was understandable shed gone through a lot more than he had maybe knew the apparent signs werent what he thought they were at all the division chiefs office was on the fifth floor high enough at the back for there to be a silver thread of potomac just beyond the tree line if there werent an orioles game at the weekend maybe hed take them out on the river ray hubble strode across the room to meet him confirming the acquaintanceship hand outstretched there were the predictable assurances of how good each other looked and had london really been that long ago and then hubble said sorry to hear about paul seems a common problem from what ive been told since i got back hope everything works out ok ive got to see it has havent i said blair appreciate the understanding everyones shown here no problem said hubble he was a polished man polished cheeks and oiled polished hair and polished shoes the sort of man to gleam in the dark having given the reassurance he immediately contradicted it by saying when do you think youll be able to go back as soon as possible obviously said blair discerning the other mans tone but ive got to make sure everything is settled here theres still the court appearance and i dont know when thats going to be ill have to make sure the kid gets into some remedial programme if the court doesnt order it so i cant make positive dates hubble made an upward movement with his head towards the sixth and seventh floors where the director and the deputies were quartered to indicate that the pressure was not his doing and said you know how they are ill let you know as soon as i know myself said blair just a bitch of a time to be away thats all said hubble everything is popping over there and youve confirmed quite a reputation for yourself from it thats good to know said blair at least his professional life wasnt screwed up he thought in brief selfpity youd better believe it said hubble enthusiastically state were telling the president to behave quite differently over the geneva offer but it was our counsel that prevailed and when everything was examined the soviet thing turned out to be a bunch of bullshit just like you said it was hubble extended his hand one finger crossed over the other thats how the agency and the president are at the moment hugger mugger and the director likes it very much indeed which makes you a pretty important guy around here because although hes a funny bastard in some ways he doesnt deny anyone the credit theyre due getting it as completely right as we did was down to you and hes letting everyone know it blair felt the satisfaction stir through him it seemed that his professional life was anything but screwed up thats pretty decent of him he said but he wants everything to stay that way hubble put out a fingercrossed hand again him and the president which means hes nervous having you off base because its known to be so important of course i had to tell him he said ok but hes pressing to know just how quick you can get back blair was vaguely discomfited at the director personally knowing why hed had to return from moscow would it have any effect upon his career wondered blair the swirl of guilt was immediate of course not and if it did so what the agency could take their job and stuff it up their ass that wasnt true he corrected at once he loved the job couldnt imagine any other and the ability that he seemed to have to do it as soon as possible like i said he reminded his immediate superior how long before serada officially gets dumped asked hubble there might have been hints over the last few days indications from something in pravda or on tass or a clue he could have got from some photograph or the way a proclamation was issued and signed or not signed but he needed to be in moscow like they knew he needed to be in moscow to be able to detect the signals and the signs difficult to say avoided blair aware how bad that sounded blair went on maybe not yet awhile that wasnt much better and it was an overassessment as well he didnt know had no way of knowing whether serada would go tomorrow or next week or next month to indicate that there would be some time was just trying to give them a reassurance and take the pressure off for him to get back he wouldnt be pressured determined blair all right so he liked the job and he liked the praise and he wouldnt stay longer than he had to hed never intended that in the first place but he was damned if hed cut anything short either bitch of a time to be away repeated hubble whod seen the attempted reassurance as the snow job it was im sorry said blair not quite sure what he was apologising for but unable to think of anything else its not just the immediate situation said hubble im not sure i know what you mean frowned blair youve been in moscow two years said hubble a little over agreed blair hubble nodded the minimal correction unnecessary anyway because he had blairs personnel file in the desk drawer on his left and knew everything about the mans career he said normally wed be thinking of some reassignment now three years is the term as you know normally said blair picking out the important word like i said eddie the directors impressed impressed as hell he thinks youve got the handle on moscow for a period that is going to turn out important so he says and the logic is difficult to argue with why put someone else into bat when youre scoring all the home runs if we pull you out as we would normally do after three years it means someone has got to go in there cold and learn the tricks the director thinks and again the logic is difficult to argue with that at a time like this we should stay just as we are ahead of the game you want me to remain in moscow said blair irritated by all the other mans awkward metaphors just that said hubble how long for as long as it takes said hubble expansively then you can go wherever you like in full glory whats that mean said blair it means and the director has personally asked me to make this clear to you that if you agree to stay on then when you finally move you can call the shots you choose what you want and you get it you can have another overseas posting or you can come here to langley and if you come to langley it wont be for the doormans job youll get a division at least what do you say during all his thoughts and discussions with the boys and with everyone else blair had always calculated without consciously counting the months or considering it too definitely that hed be out of moscow according to the normal custom in three years that was why hed been so forceful in the talk of their being together more because if it had proven difficult to get them into moscow or for them to accept ann then he knew it would have only been months not even a year before he was somewhere else that would have been more convenient would it be difficult to get them in if he stayed on he could make it a condition of his agreeing that the agency through the state department made damned sure they could get in whenever he wanted them to and impose another condition too that he be allowed to come out whenever he wanted to be with them what about ann she said she hated moscow but hed always thought that was an exaggeration so she disliked it but so did a lot of people at first two years was hardly at first so maybe she hadnt tried hard enough shed understand when he explained it she knew how important the job was to him and it was a pretty impressive promise anything he wanted afterwards he could let her choose that wouldnt be bad telling her that for her understanding this time she could pick anywhere in the world where they would go next and why should it be such a long time anyway serada could be dumped tomorrow and everything nicely packaged and compartmented before the normal three years were up and then hed be holding the basket with all the promises and it wouldnt have cost him anything except that he was going for whoever succeeded serada to be a caretaker for a younger man and it could be two or three years maybe longer before whoever that younger man was to emerge and become identified he was sure ann would understand well urged hubble uncomfortable with the long silence id like to think about it hedged blair sure conceded hubble but not too long eh a couple of days said blair carelessly just give me a couple of days thatll be good said hubble maintaining the earlier pressure he said you might have a clearer idea then when you can go back as well and eddie what you know what we want and you know how much we want it how much the director wants it but theres no catch if you say no then well understand it wont be held against you later crap thought blair the supposed guarantee had come out exactly as the man had intended a threat so much for friendship he thought maybe that was unfair blair believed the other man that the pressure was coming from the seventh floor so hubble couldnt do much else but watch his own back if the place were as political as this maybe langley wasnt the place to come back to blair braked the thought that reflection indicated he had a choice and he only had a choice if he accepted their offer he said i understand i know a lot of guys whod sacrifice a lot of things to be in the position you are eddie said hubble yes agreed blair i suppose youre right a couple of days eh a couple of days promised blair unhappy now at the selfimposed time limit it was only when he was driving back down the parkway that blair fully realised that if he kept the schedule he had agreed with hubble it would mean making the decision without any opportunity of talking it through properly with ann of talking it through at all really because he didnt think it was something he could discuss with her by telephone which reminded him he should call her again but not yet not today he had too much to think about and decide in the event he didnt call moscow for two days still undecided and having earlier talked to hubble and got a reluctant extension on their time limit arguing pauls impending court appearance as the need for him to delay the line was better than it had been the first time he said he thought things were going better than they were when hed spoken before and that there was a date for the court hearing and because ruth was out taking her turn with the car pool he was able openly to say he loved and missed her ann asked when he was coming back and he said he didnt know and she said she was looking forward to the bolshoi with brinkman which hed momentarily forgotten she was going to do from moscow ann thought how limited her news was nothing bloody well ever happened anyway and from washington blair put down the telephone without mentioning the request to extend his posting in the soviet capital brinkman arrived promptly which he invariably did and insisted upon their drinking the champagne hed brought because it was his birthday so she insisted on giving him the present shed bought an icon she had been assured was a genuine antique hed promised to stage the birthday party when hed telephoned earlier to confirm the arrangements and when she asked where they were going he said to his apartment because he didnt want anything about the evening to be spoiled and therefore didnt want to sit for hours in a russian restaurant waiting for food he could prepare and cook better at home ann was glad the bolshoi was risk enough but she didnt want to extend that risk by going somewhere public afterwards there were a limited number of places that were embassy favourites and there would have been a possibility of their being seen and she didnt want any stupid stories to begin when there was no basis for their existence eddie called she said as they left the apartment when asked brinkman at once attentive day before yesterday how is he fine whens he coming back he still doesnt know what the bloody hell was it thought brinkman in frustrated irritation chapter seventeen the new production was superb ann did not think she had ever heard tchaikovskys music sound so wonderful nor seen dancers appear so weightless and so synchronised during the break there was more champagne and on their way to the bar they passed an exhibition of the history of the imperial school with prints and photographs of legendary figures like marius petipa and enrico cecchetti and of principal dancers like mathilde kschessinka and olga preobrazhenska and anna pavlova and tamara karsavina ann succeeded in identifying them all without having to see the notations and as she talked she became aware she knew more about ballet than brinkman the knowledge excited her because in the cloistered formalised embassy life into which she had been thrust directly after her marriage she found she rarely knew anything more than anyone she showed off on purpose and brinkman let her isolating another indication of her unhappiness by the thrownaway admission as she talked that because of her interest in dancing shed studied the russian art soon after she arrived in moscow to fill the days she chattered on about the summer gardens performances in st petersburg and the origin of the moscow school based on children from the citys orphanages and brinkman recognised he was enjoying himself there was still the ulterior motive in cultivating the friendship with the couple in the first place getting himself next to someone whom ingram designated the best but it had moved on from the initial reason he genuinely liked them now better than he liked the harrisons or anyone else in the western enclave and he liked ann he guessed betty harrison and her intimates might think ann was gauche and he supposed she was which was her charm despite what he now knew to be her inner feelings at being in moscow she had about her a freshness of being genuinely interested and wanting to be involved with everything she did and everyone with whom she came into contact doing it she held his arm as they wandered through the theatre an unthinking gesture for her and brinkman decided he liked the touch not only a freshness but a softness he thought the conclusion surpassed the commencement he stood matching her enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of everyone else clapping as loudly as anyone for the succession of curtain calls that went on and on when the curtain finally came down they left the bolshoi unhurriedly as if reluctant to sever the moment absolutely by leaving the place wasnt that exquisite said ann i actually feel im floating just like the chorus why the chorus he said why not a prima ballerina she giggled pleased with his lightness i could never be the lead only ever the support you can be my prima ballerina wasnt he being gauche now i accept she said she still had her arm in his immediately outside the bolshoi they stopped together not sure what to do and she said lets not go home straight away lets walk ok he said they went without positive direction along sverdlova slowed by the crush of people near the metro entrance but almost inevitably went towards the kremlin ann strained up at the huge illuminated red stars on top of the towers and said ive never been able to understand why theyve done that it is sort of odd agreed brinkman looks like the biggest circus attraction in the whole world sometimes a good description said brinkman want to know something damned right i do thought brinkman he said what tonight i like moscow about time tonight i said insisted ann just tonight they returned in the direction of the theatre near which his car was parked as slowly as they had set off on the outing and brinkman even drove slowly back to the complex brinkman had left wine on ice flat this time because he felt there was a limit to the amount of champagne it was possible to drink particularly before a meal hed arranged cold food fish which was good in the concessionary places and caviar because as he kept reminding her it was his birthday with the caviar he served vodka deeply chilled taking it the russian way down in one she obeyed the instructions and laughed and coughed at the same time protesting that she would get drunk while they ate he tried to guide the conversation to blair but ann appeared reluctant to bring her husband into any conversation insisting instead of talking about the cambridge they had known most of which they had already talked about for ann it was part of the evening still gripped by the beauty of the performance and edging into reverie wanting to find other special memories for brinkman it was a confirmation of something by now he didnt need confirming he didnt think either that ann could help him even inadvertently consummate professional that he was blair wouldnt have allowed ann the mistaken opportunity of letting anything drop there was a small but unexpected feeling the thought that he could now relax and be completely comfortable with her not forever alert for openings he was finding ann very comfortable to be with after the meal they left the table uncleared and brinkman played more tchaikovsky not swan lake because that wouldnt have been right but the sleeping beauty which he thought would compliment anns mood he sat beside her on the couch his arm stretched behind her along its back ann settled into the crook of his arm as unthinkingly as she had earlier held him walking from the theatre this is heavenly she said her voice distant heavenly brinkman put his face into her hair and kissed her very lightly hardly making any contact wake up princess he said she didnt react against his gesture i dont want to she said i want to go on sleeping for a hundred years just like the story says ive got to its a fairy story he said she settled against him more comfortably and said i want to stay in the fairy story he kissed her hair again more positively this time thinking how clean it smelled everything fresh he thought he said thank you for tonight for the icon and for getting the tickets too ive enjoyed it as much as you she said maybe more the side ended there was a slight distortion on the record arm so that it made a loud sound clicking off he said do you want to hear the second half yes she said but i dont want to move itll only take a moment ann had to raise herself for brinkman to move his arm and when he did making to stand they were very close to each other briefly they stayed just inches apart faces unmoving eyes held id better change the record he said yes she said brinkman turned the disc over quickly fumbling so that he almost dropped it glad that his back was to her and that she wouldnt have seen his nervousness he was reluctant when the record dropped to turn back to confront her when he did her expression hadnt changed he went back to the couch holding her eyes and she had to move again slightly to let him sit where he had before the settling back against him wasnt as unthinking as it had earlier been and it wasnt the same either this time her face was nearer his not her hair still a fairy story she said he kissed her high on the cheek this time and she turned her head bringing her lips up there was a birdpeck hesitancy about them each unsure of the other each nervous and ready to pull back from danger but the pecking became more fervent and they stopped being nervous brinkman twisted from how he sat so that she lay back the full length of the couch and he knelt beside her looking down kissing not just her lips now but her face and her neck and her throat where her dress was open he plucked at the buttons trying to open it more and she made a token protest whispering no no several times but he didnt stop and she gave up trying to stop him actually twisting for the bra to become unclasped and then whimpering at the delicious pain when his teeth trapped her nipple he played a long time and then she felt his hands move and she made another token protest as ineffective as the first he tried to make love to her actually on the couch but there wasnt room enough so she rolled off on to him and they made love first on the floor encumbered by clothes and as nervously as they had started kissing it didnt work because of the awkwardness and the nervousness and he got up to go to the bedroom and she said no again and again she did the second time was much better she was an experimental lover more so than he was although he tried to match her not wanting to be shown the more inexperienced he thought anxiously towards the end that he was going to fail her but he managed to hold back just long enough and they came together a mutual explosion ann didnt let him move away from her instead she held him with an almost desperate tightness fingers pressed into his back legs encompassing his what have we done she said after a long silence what the hell have we done i dont know he said she relaxed slightly letting go her hold on him it never happened she said it was all part of the fairy story could they sustain it in the claustrophobia of their lives all right he said feeling he should go further brinkman said im sorry i suppose i should be arent you i dont know i suppose so yes but i dont know not really neither do i said brinkman changing the earlier automatic apology i wish i could sleep for a hundred years with me he said trying to lift her depression it wasnt the end of the world not yet a mistake and an embarrassment but not the end of the world thats something else i dont know said ann i think the answer might be yes blair tried to anticipate everything determined against any oversight he went to see the parents of all the other boys who had been involved with paul and found them as resentful and confused and bewildered as he had felt had felt blair left each meeting growing more and more convinced that hed crossed more bridges with paul than any of the others had with their kids david hoover who was divorced like blair was and had returned like blair had done was convinced that the marriage breakup was the only cause and wouldnt consider any other discussion as well as all the other parents blair saw again the two counsellors knowing that erickson was submitting a report to the court and guessing maybe kemp would as well and wanting them to know all about his talks with the boy both seemed impressed and blair was glad not because of their praise but because they were supposed to be experts more expert than him at least and if they approved then maybe it was some sort of indication that hed got it right he talked things through with ruth at every stage and the day before the court hearing went over it all again insisting that she try to find something hed forgotten while there was still time to put it right she couldnt i know ive said it before but thanks for coming back eddie i dont know what id have done without you i mean what i said about staying as close as possible to the boys said blair i fouled up badly we found out in time said ruth lets hope its in time you were the one who used to reassure me remember she deserved the honesty thought blair that was the new inviolate resolution somethings come up he said come up blair told her about the meeting with hubble not everything about the encounter because he was experienced enough to recognise the sensitivity about disclosing too much of what had happened as a result of his moscow assessments but enough for her to understand why he was being asked to extend but theres one thing he said one paramount overriding thing if i accept then its only going to be when im completely satisfied itll enable the new situation with paul and john are you going to accept she said i havent decided ducked blair invoking the convenient excuse he said im not even going to think about it until after the court case he paused and said what do you think i should do ruth i can only talk as far as the boys are concerned she said and about them i think you should do whatever makes it possible for you to keep your promise i sincerely believe that if we stand any chance of getting paul back in line and preventing john going the same way then the most important thing is not letting them think suspect even that youre not going to come through like youve said but thats where my responsibility ends now eddie anns the person with whom youve got to talk the rest through and then youre the person whos got to make the final decision yes said blair miserably i know the instruction that he should personally address the politburo came from panov and sokol realised at once how the kgb chairman was manoeuvring himself cleverly away from any position of direct responsibility sokols immediate reaction was apprehension but he quickly rationalised the attitude he hadnt caused the food shortages in the first place they and their policies had all hed had to do was to try to clear up and contain the mess so it would be quite wrong to appear apologetic which was clearly panovs response sokol prepared carefully personally visiting every affected area to see the situation for himself well knowing that the politburo would get separate independent reports anyway and satisfying himself that in every region but the ukraine itself the famine was controlled if not solved he prepared his address with equal care writing and rewriting and actually rehearsing it in the privacy of his own apartment his demeanour in front of the soviet rulers was respectful but forceful the inference always there that he was attempting to correct the mistakes of others his treatment of the various leadership attempts at revolt had effectively splintered any organised situation in any province and providing the transportation was maintained at its present level and the foreign imports continued to arrive he believed any further difficulties could be avoided it was an impressive evaluation and sokol knew it as he spoke and the politburo accepted it as such at the end chebrakin thanked him for the depth of detail and said you are to be congratulated comrade sokol sokol was happy at the thought that the kgb chairman would have his informants and hear what had been said sokol knew he had gained more than he had lost by the confrontation chapter eighteen the surroundings of the family court were not the sort that blair expected and he regretted it he guessed the design was based upon long experience and that it worked but he would have preferred more formality and the presiding judge to have been a man not a woman because he thought it would have had a stronger effect upon the boys frightened them because blair felt they needed frightening paul and the others who stood bowedheaded before the bench their hair cut and their pants pressed and their shoes shining muttering that they understood what was happening if they understood it now which they undoubtedly did then they understood it when theyd ripped off stores and mugged an old guy and planned to rob a pharmacy despite the new accord with paul and the hopeful new relationship and all the promises and hopes blair was still realistic enough to accept that his kid knowingly set out to become a criminal and a drug dealer theyd employed counsel to represent them because it was the system but blair knew there wasnt anything the lawyer could really do paul should be taught a lesson frightened against ever doing anything like it again irrespective of new relationships or new anythings that had been privately reached between them the parents sat behind where the children and the counsel were all pressed and barbered and polished too tightly enclosed in angry embarrassment at what they were hearing about their offspring the evidence was not lengthy and the lawyers questions were nothing more than a formality men trying to appear to earn their fees the pharmacist and an assistant spoke of the suspicious behaviour of a group of young boys paul emerging at once as the leader and of an apparent attempt by one section to distract by a feigned bid to steal in the main part of the shop while two others paul one of them again tried to get into the restricted area where the dangerous and controlled drugs were the pharmacist had already called the police and gave evidence of one of the boys thank god not paul this time but david hoover pulling a knife which he dropped in his nervousness the patrolman spoke of being despatched to a robbery by a person or persons unknown of entering prepared to shoot and of the childrens immediate surrender when they realised who he was counsel tried to make something of the surrender but blair wasnt impressed and he didnt think the court was it was from the patrolman that the evidence came of the previous undetected shoplifting which the kids admitted in statements at the station house every child in separate interviews confessed the purpose was to buy drugs their taking of which was confirmed by later medical examination the two drug counsellors kemp and erickson were the two witnesses upon whom the lawyers concentrated most seeking something in mitigation or excuse but blair didnt think much of that either he was impressed however by the main body of their evidence not the questioning and felt privately embarrassed at his impression of them at their first interview both talked of the boys individually attesting unasked their previous good character and apparently genuine remorse now so what have you got to say for yourselves the demand from the woman was sharp unexpected and blair started like the kids in front her name was bateson he remembered from the formalities at the commencement of the hearing she was greyhaired and rosycheeked and motherly and blair definitely regretted it hadnt been a man and i dont want any sorrys or dont knows or nothings she went on i want to know why you did what you did and why i shouldnt send you all away for a long custodial period to protect shopkeepers and old people on the streets maybe hed been wrong thought blair again maybe it was as effective as having a male judge after all she appeared very aware of her authority and there was a humiliation why not they deserved it at being hectored by a woman one of the boys cohn blair thought tried to mumble something but she cut the boy short demanding that he speak up when he did it was to say he was sorry and she said of course you are youre sorry that you got caught and youre in court here today but you wouldnt be sorry if you hadnt been caught would you all youd be worrying about was getting more drugs to sell and to use she hesitated jabbing a finger out you she said you talk to me paul blair saw paul was standing shamefaced like them all he shifted under the demand his shoulders humping and blair thought come on come on for gods sake boy well she persisted made a mistake started paul trying a stupid mistake i know that now and i am sorry and not for being here today not just for being here today im sorry for what i stole and im sorry i tried to rob the pharmacy what about the marijuana and the cocaine said the judge relentlessly how sorry are you about that very said paul why she was very good conceded blair because its wrong dangerous he said you knew that when you were doing it everyone was doing it said paul i knew it was wrong but it didnt seem to hurt anybody not really hurt them i thought the stories about it being dangerous were exaggerated do you still think that dont know said paul blair wished the boy hadnt fallen back upon the cliche at the end but the rest hadnt been bad judge bateson kept on at the other boys forcing reaction from them all and blair decided that even though it didnt have the appearance of the adult court they werent getting off as lightly as he imagined they might and they hadnt been sentenced yet as he thought it she reached it youve been taking drugs she said youve been stealing and mugging to buy those drugs and you planned a robbery to set yourselves up as dealers is that right when there was no response she repeated the question to each child forcing each to admit it the woman said which requires a custodial sentence and stopped again for an unspoken reaction from them this time blair felt ruth stiffen at his side she reached out for his arm and he covered her hand a positive attitude wouldnt form in his mind hed wanted paul frightened into not doing it any of it again and he wanted some sort of daytoday control that he couldnt personally provide but he hadnt actually considered imprisonment although it had been discussed during his second meeting with the counsellors would it be imprisonment at pauls age reformatory then he didnt know if they were officially called that he had a recollection of something cosmetic like corrective farms but thats what they were reformatories would a period in a reformatory mean a permanent record when he tried to get a job and what about his schooling before that there couldnt be the natural progression to high school if he were in a reformatory the questions crowded in and he couldnt answer them the awareness angered him the counsellors could have told him if hed had the commonsense to ask the questions do you know what a custodial sentence is what it would mean demanded the woman again they were forced to reply they were scared blair knew he felt the beginning of pity and then he thought of the old guy whod been robbed of his welfare payments ok so maybe paul hadnt been involved but blair didnt think that mattered he bet the old guy had been pretty scared as well it means going somewhere where youre not free any more lectured the judge free to steal or to frighten other people or sell drugs somewhere where people other kids and other decent people can be protected from you which i think is necessary blair felt ruths hand tighten further along the line of parents he heard the sound of another mother he didnt know who starting to cry and in front of him the shoulders of cohn were beginning to heave too but i want to achieve more than that said judge bateson i want to protect other people and i want to reform you and i want to ensure that you make proper fitting restitution for what youve done so that youll be reminded just what youve done and tried to do not just today but for a long time afterwards i am going to sentence you all to a custodial sentence a period of two years each upon david hoover who pulled a knife during the attempted pharmacy robbery there will be a further term of six months and upon you paul blair who emerged during the evidence i have heard to be the ringleader of that attempt there will also be an additional period of six months beside blair ruth began to shake and he pressed against her hand trying to comfort her but knowing there was no way he could but i am going to suspend it announced the judge which means that you can continue living with your families and going to your schools getting a chance that many would argue you dont deserve for the things youve done but youre not going to get that chance easily you will enter a drug rehabilitation and reeducation programme to which you will be directed by your counsellors another condition is that you will during the period of your sentence enter some voluntary assistance scheme again directed by your counsellors for old people or for disabled or for the less fortunate than yourselves i will have both those conditions devised by your counsellors in such a way that there is absolutely no interference with your school work so dont think im giving you any excuse whatsoever for dropping out ill require your counsellors to monitor your grades and if those grades drop for any reason that isnt entirely satisfactory to either of them then ill have them back to discuss it with me judge bateson paused sipping from the water glass in front of her on the bench and understand one thing she resumed the most important thing if at any time during the period of your sentence you fail to meet any of these conditions or if you involve yourselves again with drugs or get into any sort of trouble whatsoever youll return to this court and whatever custodial sentence remains will be custodial and added to whatever new sentence is imposed upon you a lot had been taken out of his hands blair realised perhaps deservedly so it didnt alter the resolve though his own intentions could be adjusted to coordinate with those of the court it was a harsh and fitting sentence and could be the making and saving of the kid providing paul didnt screw it up the last thought was uppermost in his mind as they emerged from the court and ruth who hadnt properly assimilated all that was said asked him what does it mean that he cant make another mistake said blair not one hubbles greeting at langley was as effusive as before maybe even more so thought blair this time it was hubble seeking concessions hubble politely entered into a discussion about the court hearing but blair sensed the other mans impatience to get to the point of the second meeting his decision over moscow hubble delayed the demand to the absolute point at which he could not be suspected of a lack of interest about blairs personal problems and then reminded you said youd let me know yes agreed blair so whats it to be blair refused his superiors anxiousness he went carefully actually irritatingly through the court sentence and conditions and after that listed his own decisions involving paul he said he wanted further time in washington completely to set everything up with the counsellors and that then if he agreed to stay on he needed an absolute guarantee that he would be allowed out of the russian capital to fit in wherever and as often as the counsellors and paul considered it necessary he also said that although he knew the american state department had no control or pressure they could bring against the soviet immigration authorities he wanted a further absolute guarantee that whenever he needed the boys to visit him in moscow state would make sure there was no hitch in the arrangements coming finally to ann whom circumstances had thrust into the background but whom he didnt consider deserved second place or second consideration he said if he agreed he wouldnt accept a completely unlimited period spending the rest of his operational life in moscow but required an undertaking that someone else would be appointed whom he could introduce and train up thats a bunch of reservations said hubble at once theyre not reservations argued blair theyre reasonable concessions to which i consider im entitled in exchange for what youre asking me to do if we agree youll stay if you agree to every one in every respect ill stay said blair i should discuss this with the director hedged hubble then do so agreed blair i told you i want to stay for a few more days yet to make the final arrangements theres time enough hubble smiled shaking his head i was told to negotiate and try to reach agreement so ive negotiated and weve reached an agreement crap thought blair theyd been prepared to let him have this from the start he wished he could have thought of something else to his advantage every point he said this was the time it had to be set out without any misunderstandings or caveats every point assured hubble guaranteed then ok said blair its a deal ill stay because he owed it to her because he owed her far more blair told ruth of course as soon as he got back to rosslyn yes she said is that all just yes what else is there it wont affect whatever i arranged with paul assured blair thats inviolable sure she said sounding unconvinced they wont renege on me i know they wont renege good you think i made the wrong decision i didnt say that i dont think you have to my only consideration my only worry now is paul as long as pauls all right then nothing else is my business is it i just thought you might have had something else to say about it anns the person whos got to have something more to say about it not me dont you think chapter nineteen they had known of course that it wouldnt be easy theyd even tried to rehearse the problems and the uncertainties in the last few weeks when orlovs recall had been confirmed imagining they already had all the training necessary in avoiding a lot of difficulties because their affair had existed for more than a year and that hadnt been easy either because russians at the united nations even at orlovs rank exist under severe restrictions and surveillance but harriet knew now how illequipped theyd been how illequipped at least shed been she didnt know about pietr which was the problem not knowing naturally theyd considered it with everything else thered been a long conversation about it on one of their last nights when orlov had managed to slip away from the soviet compound and come to the second avenue apartment harriet looked around the apartment now trying to recapture the evening because memories were important the things she lived by theyd eaten in as they did almost always because to go out was dangerous and then theyd made love with the anxiousness of lovers soon to be parted and then hed talked about their not being able to make contact except in the most extreme and dire emergency and told her not to make monsters out of shadows his words she remembered dont make monsters out of shadows christ shed tried hard enough it hadnt been too bad in the early weeks months even thered been an unreality about most things practically a lightheadedness when she wasnt working when she was never lightheaded but she was initially prepared for the parting and the loneliness and the not knowing ironically the stupidity of it the problem of not knowing had started insidiously by knowing harriet johnson was unusual freak had been a friendly jibe at oxford someone with an outstanding talent for languages her russian was impeccable she was actually able to be colloquial and extended to tongues within the country georgian which she spoke always with orlov and estonian she was fluent too in czechoslovakian and hungarian and german again with a mastery of some internal dialects the natural outlet of such ability was interpreting and harriet was outstandingly able at that too within three years of her joining already at senior supervisor grade and as a senior supervising translator reading alert for variations in usage or some new technical term was as essential as talking the languages and so she read whatever she could from the countries she was called upon to interpret predominantly it was russian one of the official languages of the assembly which meant she read not only the yawningly boring handouts and communiques and the officiallyissued booklets but daily izvestia and pravda which was where in greater detail in pravda than in izvestia she read about orlovs promotion that possibility had never entered any of their preparing conversations they had expected his united nations ranking and the unquestionable successes hed achieved there during his posting to be adequately rewarded but never speculated beyond perhaps a deputy role within the foreign ministry but hed been elevated way beyond that harriet who was conscientious read far more than the controlled soviet newspapers the english as well as american publications so shed seen the speculation about serada and the politburo jostling and knew from her own interpretation of soviet politics apart from the long political conversations shed had with orlov that there definitely was a power struggle going on a power struggle into which her beloved adored pietr had unexpectedly been thrust so what difference did it make he loved her she was sure he loved her here in new york but he wasnt in new york any more he was in moscow at the very centre of things and his election could only mean that hed been picked out to go even higher and he was an ambitious man he denied it insisted she was wrong but harriet had never been able to convince herself that if everything worked as they planned it would work the greatest agony later for orlov would not be that he had abandoned his country and abandoned natalia but that he had abandoned his ambitions would it be as easy for him to choose now as hed said it was months ago months ago he hadnt realised the opportunities with which he would be presented or seen natalia harriet believed his argument for going back loved him the more for it but didnt the fact that hed insisted on returning officially to divorce and distance himself from the woman to spare her any retribution mean that he still loved her too felt strongly for her at least strongly enough to consider what he had and might have against what he would be giving up harriet had taken the apartment specifically for its convenience to the united nations building she emerged promptly at ten as she did every morning when she was on day duty turned left and began walking down second avenue another habit a tightlycoiffeured tightlysuited career woman was she prepared to give everything up she asked herself theyd tried to imagine that like theyd tried to imagine the parting but were either of them prepared for an existence as official criminals hiding under assumed names and supposedly guarded by strangers she was decided harriet she knew it wouldnt be anything like they thought because being apart wasnt anything like they thought like she thought at least but she was prepared to go through with it no matter how bad it became harriet turned at fortysecond street but was pietr if only she knew harriet reached the top of the incline able to see the greenglassed skyscraper of the united nations building jutting upwards from the side of the east river what about the plans theyd made to establish contact giggling at the theatricality of everything and not really sure if it would work only in the most extreme and dire emergency she remembered this wasnt an extreme and dire emergency this was harriet johnson not having properly prepared herself and making monsters out of shadows harriet showed her identification at the security check and walked familiarly into the building if only she thought everything wasnt so damned difficult which was precisely the reflection of pietr orlov miles away in moscow natalia appeared resigned to the divorce reluctantly agreeable even and the guilt was lessening but everything else was developing into a nightmare every week every day he was being inexorably drawn deeper and deeper into the inner workings of the government realistically orlov accepted it would make his acceptance easier in the west when he chose the moment but his reputation from the united nations would have been sufficient for that more realistically he recognised what it would mean to yuri sevin when that moment came orlov suspected that it was becoming accepted by others now that sevin regarded the grooming and eventual election of his protege to be his final achievement the triumphant swansong of one of the last of the true bolsheviks and yuri sevin was a true bolshevik reflected orlov another guilt growing the man had embraced and fought for the revolution believing in it and in the true philosophy of marx and trotsky and lenin and then seen lenin and stalin and krushchev and brezhnev and andropov ignore any other sort of philosophy than that practised by the czars the right of the select few to rule orlov knew without conceit that sevin saw him as someone who might after far too long initiate the change he knew it because since his return he and sevin had engaged in enough discussions sweeping debates and arguments deep into many nights just as he knew that sevin a pragmatic realist after so long and so many disappointments didnt expect that change to be anything than simply initiated for others to follow like a major river eventually changes course because of the first chipping erosion of an existing bank already sevins influence had manoeuvred him on to two committees one the prestigious and reputationmaking central planning body and already always there was the preparation the rehearsal and advice the influential members identified the fading ones pointed out the recommended stances to take and the stances to avoid orlov thought he was a puppet and he felt like it he felt that his arms and legs and head were tethered so that he had to jerk and twist when someone else pulled the strings he had to cut those strings soon he had to cut them and escape before everything engulfed him there had been a committee meeting in the morning where he had recited his lines and backed those he should have backed and in the afternoon he tried to concentrate upon a policy paper on the agricultural difficulties that were going to bring serada down orlov knew it was regarded as the most pressing difficulty of the moment and that while whole groups in cases entire committees of agronomists and experts were also trying to evolve fresh approaches his appointment should have gone to someone more senior and more experienced sevin again he thought his contact with the man had become predictable summonses most evenings about which he was ambivalent while it enmeshed him deeper and deeper into things of which he wanted no knowledge it created reasons to delay his return to the tense unnaturalness of life with natalia the call came that evening and orlov made his accustomed way through the corridors to reach the old mans office recognised now by the secretaries and attendants theyd gossip orlov knew had done already sevin greeted him with the selfsatisfied smile of a man in a position to know all that was going on below and around him the decision has been made he announced at once when said orlov this afternoon is there to be an announcement sevin nodded within the week it will be that serada has been replaced to be succeeded by chebrakin orlov frowned what about illhealth no said sevin just that publicly disgraced like krushchev remembered orlov he doesnt deserve anything more said sevin impatiently he brought his hands together in a tiny clapping gesture but serada and his fate arent important not any more whats important is you and the next two or three years yes agreed orlov anguished at the repeated game hows the agricultural policy shaping its going to take a long time avoided orlov this time its got to be right exactly said sevin someone seizing the truth its got to be right and its got to be seen to be right its going to be the first step for you pietr but not in the direction in which i want to walk thought orlov orlov had done nothing about getting another place to live accepting the difficulty that it created between himself and natalia because although the whole purpose of returning was to spare her later he did not want to draw any wrong attention to himself and he feared trying to get separate accommodation might have created some curiosity the guards and attendants and secretaries by whom he was now surrounded had other functions than to make his life easier orlov knew he and natalia had settled into a formal existence an attitude of acquaintances temporarily brought together beneath the same roof but knowing it would only be for a limited period they were considerate to each other in the way of acquaintances neither irritated nor happy at anything the other did but they were very conscious of each other and immediately orlov entered the apartment late after the discussion with sevin which had become a detailed examination of the agricultural options orlov was aware of a difference in natalias demeanour ive been waiting she said waiting to see if you would change your mind i still love you you know no said orlov tightly i havent changed my mind then to go on like this is pointless isnt it we might as well get the divorce yes he said hed imagined a feeling of relief at the agreement instead he felt a deep sadness will you make the arrangements yes said orlov he looked around the apartment youll have this of course thank you it shouldnt be difficult he said accepting it and not understanding why is going to be difficult said the woman chapter twenty the letter from home was as sterile as all the others that had preceded it about as fascinating as a report of a meeting of the mothers union her mothers appointment as the secretary of which was the highlight of the note ann guessed her mother would have written the mothers union report first and put more effort into it her father sent the usual regards what would he have sent if he knew what she had done maybe he wouldnt have been surprised hed called her a whore when he learned of her involvement with blair other words too slut was one she hadnt felt like a whore or a slut then shed felt like someone whod fallen in love with a married man despite trying not to and wanted the understanding she felt she deserved but which they felt unable to provide had she proven herself to be a whore and a slut now yes she answered herself honestly she didnt feel like either any more than she had the first time she felt ashamed and remorseful and she wished it hadnt happened but it had and so she had to face it face what exactly all right shed cheated shed built up too much unhappiness about moscow and about not being pregnant although shed tried and about not knowing how blair really felt about ruth and shed had too much to drink and it had been a beautiful really wonderful evening and shed let go emotions she shouldnt have let go that didnt make her a whore or a slut it made her a stupid woman who should have known better known better about all of it but who hadnt a stupid woman whod made a mistake surely the important thing the adult thing was recognising it for that a mistake and nothing else was it nothing else ann tried to analyse it dispassionately which was ridiculous as passion was what it had all been about because it was important to get it all into the proper perspective what had happened with jeremy hadnt in any way affected her love for eddie the opposite in fact it made her realise just how much she did love him no danger then no reason for making a bitterly regretted mistake into anything more important than it was what about jeremy then of course she didnt love him how could she he was charming and made her laugh like eddie used to make her laugh and was unquestionably more socially able than eddie and if she were to be brutally frank in bed ann jarred to a stop of course she didnt love him she thought again you didnt fall in love after sleeping with someone once there had to be other feelings feelings she had for eddie and certainly not for jeremy christ why couldnt she have stayed inside the fairy tale fairy tales had nice endings with everyone living happily ever after shed shared the fairy tale with the wrong man she recognised coming out of the fantasy how would it have been for eddie in washington it would have drawn he and ruth together because things like that always did but together was what adjusted properly accepting former husband and wife friends in fact or a couple who realised they had made a mistake mistakes after all werent difficult to make that wasnt fair ann recognised she was creating a scenario like those cheap tv soap operas at which shed sneered in england and imagining situations she had no reason to believe to exist to assuage her own feelings she jumped at the sound of the telephone staring at it as if she were frightened and not answering for several moments i was just going to ring off i didnt think you were in ann felt a jump of excitement at brinkmans voice was that what it was she wondered still searching for definitions had she done it for excitement just for a moment to lift herself from the unexciting awfulness of moscow a sluts attitude she thought she said hello how are you ok sure sure what are you doing nothing much nothing at all in fact just sitting thinking what about i would have thought that was obvious sorry said blair stupid question what are you doing this wasnt the right sort of conversation ann thought this was the inconsequential almost intimate talk of two people who didnt recognise theyd made any mistake at all nothing much he said just sitting thinking oh sorry i phoned you ann saw the chance it had happened because theyd allowed things to drift and things that were allowed to drift ended up on the rocks this was the moment to talk about it why not it had happened and they were adults not children and label it for what it was and try as best they could to forget it ever occurred she said no im not sorry you phoned have you eaten im not hungry she said what a hell of a resistance she thought if this were cambridge we could go out for a drink he said remember the wine bar opposite kings very much said ann a million years and a million happenings ago i got a new shipment of books today he said theres an anthony burgess and a couple i havent read by paul scott and updikes latest maybe i could borrow something when youve finished i cant read them all at once were they adults this was kids stuff firstkissandfumble behaviour she thought why not come over she said you sure no she thought she wasnt sure about anything except perhaps that she was out of her mind why not she said she realised he must have been waiting for the invitation because he arrived within fifteen minutes with no indication of any hurried preparation hed made an effort at the pretence bringing a book updike she saw she would have preferred burgess thanks she said thats all right they stood facing each other in the short corridor leading into the living area he went to kiss her but abruptly she turned presenting only her cheek he hesitated and then finished his lips briefly touching her she backed away and turned into the room i started without you she said indicating the glass it was vodka and already her glass was half empty in her sudden need for courage the same he accepted he sat on the couch a couch much like the one in his apartment where it had begun and ann began going positively towards a bordering chair and decided that was ridiculous and so she sat beside him what were the thoughts i dont understand when i telephoned you said youd been sitting thinking and you agreed it was a stupid question sorry of course im sorry arent you i dont think so you havent got so much to be sorry about i dont think i would be even if i had thats stupid too she said its also the most appalling syntax ive ever heard he put his arm along the back of the couch like he had before but this time he didnt let it stay there but played his finger through a coil of her hair dont she said she only pulled away fractionally determinedly she said it was a mistake was it of course it was she said please dont be so difficult im not trying to be difficult well you are it was a mistake and i think we should regard it as such ok he said just that ok what else do you expect me to say that youre sorry i said i didnt think i was maybe it was my bad syntax its not a joke i wasnt joking do you realise what weve done is it a capital offence yes she came back at once in some countries it is only if you get caught and this is russia not the middle east we should recognise it as the mistake it was ann set out again positively recognise it and then try to forget about it now youre being stupid why were not going to be able to forget about it are we were going to have to she insisted put our heads in the sand and wait until it goes away stop treating it as if it werent important he teased her hair again and this time she didnt pull away jokes are forgotten he said youre the one making it important wasnt it to you yes he said it was like wandering in the desert thought ann desperately theyd lost direction and were coming back upon themselves what are we going to do she said pleadingly instead of replying brinkman put his hand further around her head and drew her to him there wasnt the fumbling of the first time they kissed a lot and then brinkman stood pulling her up not wanting the clumsiness of the couch the thought of making love to somebody else in her own bed halted her momentarily at the point of entering the bedroom and then she continued on recognising the hesitation as hypocrisy if she was going to do it did it matter where the betrayal was just as great the lovemaking was better than before because they were more used to each other and brinkman didnt feel as inadequate as he had then brinkman went on longer than he ever had before and when he finally had to stop exhausted he said youre the most incredible woman ive ever known dont you think im a whore what a whore of course i dont think youre a whore what then brinkman thought a long time before replying wanting to get it right i think youre very lonely i think youre very unhappy i think youre looking for something you havent got maybe cant have i think you are very beautiful and i think you are a fantastic lover the remark about wanting something she couldnt have didnt refer to a baby thought ann there was no way he could have known unless eddie had told him and she didnt think that was likely what about you she said i think we should stop trying to follow the principles of freud and analysing everything he said so its a casual fuck no said brinkman it isnt a casual fuck and it isnt romeo and juliet either whats wrong with you thanks she said for being honest at least wasnt that what you were insisting upon oh christ she said hopelessly i dont know what i want the telephone sounded from the other room startling them both ann hesitated and then got up walking naked from the room conscious of his watching her she had to raise her voice and so brinkman knew who it was and because he could hear her side of the conversation he knew too what it was about before she came back into the bedroom it was eddie she said unnecessarily hes coming home whore she thought whore and slut the feeling of relief that orlov had expected finally came when he initiated the divorce from the curt almost dismissive attitude of officials it was obvious that it was not going to be difficult and there was the impression too of at last doing something positive of making the moves hed come back to moscow to make now the divorce was underway promised quickly there were other moves to make his newlyestablished status with so many people in constant attendance was going to make that more difficult than hed anticipated hed need an embassy reception as a cover for the approach so maybe the status had a balancing advantage when he wondered was the next function at the american embassy and how easy would it be for him to attend it didnt matter whatever the difficulties hed overcome them he wished he were able to let harriet know sokol wondered if there would be any personal summons from panov but none came and the deputy guessed that the sick old man had decided to suffer his miscalculation without a meeting between them sokol didnt relax he maintained a constant monitor upon all the arrival shipments and the rail transportation throughout the country to the stricken areas actually installing his own officers in some cases to ensure there was no interruption hed survived sokol decided and impressed those who mattered what he needed now was that damned coup chapter twentyone at the end blair was reluctant to leave washington he thought hed allowed himself sufficient time and decided he hadnt and the day before his departure after hed confirmed his reservation back to moscow he fleetingly considered asking hubble for a further extension but only fleetingly hed got his concessions and he intended to invoke them every one of them if and when it pleased him and there wasnt anything left undone it was just that he enjoyed washington the aftercourt sessions with the counsellors took all day because he couldnt be conveniently reached on the end of a telephone like the others so they had to get everything right first time they arranged hurried interviews for him at the rehabilitation centre and he went there with paul and studied the schedule and blair was impressed still with the counsellors blair saw the school principal to satisfy himself there was no need for the boys school grades to suffer and left convinced they wouldnt there wasnt sufficient time for him to go into what social work the boy would be required to do because that had to be coordinated into the drugs programme and the school curriculum but blair had enough confidence in both erickson and kemp and in their knowing how he felt to leave that to them he was confident no hopeful too that by the time paul got finished with school and finished with the drug programme and finished with whatever social requirements were imposed the kid would be so bushed he wouldnt be able to get into trouble if he wanted to he involved himself with the family to the exclusion of everything else not that there was anything else taking in an orioles game and boating on the potomac and getting to movies and eating at mcdonalds and setting himself up in competition the following night grilling the hamburgers over their own barbecue and being declared the winner ruth passed on the orioles game but did everything else with them he kept the last night to themselves but the night before that he met charlie rogers he thought ruth might want him to and there was no reason why he shouldnt after all rogers worked in the control tower at national blair guessed rogers was about five years younger than he was maybe even younger an openfaced easily smiling man blair liked him there was the understandable uncertainty at first which blair worked hard to get out of the way the smiles and the laughs just a little too anxious rogers served in vietnam although later than blair which gave them something in common rogers talked about the airport but didnt ask what blair did in moscow so blair guessed ruth had told him so what the hell to parade the usual explanation working for the government was so well understood in washington that it was like wearing in the middle of your forehead a sign like the one along the parkway it was as difficult for the boys to relax as it was for rogers but blair insisted they eat with them cooking out again because it was less formal feeling it important that paul and john saw there was no atmosphere after the kids went to bed and ruth was still with them rogers said he hoped blair didnt consider he was presumptuous but with blair away he was willing to do anything and everything he could to help paul blair said he didnt consider it presumptuous but that he very much appreciated the offer he thought hed seen everyone and done everything but if something came up hed remember the offer and certainly take advantage of it when rogers left blair remained discreetly in the main room letting ruth see the man off and when she came back he said he thought charlie was a terrific guy and ruth said she thought so too they all came with him out to dulles which seemed a good idea at the house but about which blair was less certain when they got to the airport he bought them coke in the cocktail bar from which they could see a lot of aircraft and consciously forced the conversation he told paul to keep out of trouble now you hear and paul said he would he told them as soon as he got back hed establish his schedule and liaise with the school principal and the counsellors and the drug programme organisers about a moscow trip and when they went down the concourse to look at some of the shops blair made ruth promise needlessly that shed get in touch with him the moment she didnt think things were going right at the actual moment of departure when the final calls were being made for the flight blair decided hed swept away any barriers between them by the way paul and john clung to him as if they were physically trying to hold him back johns tears wet against his cheek and paul trying hard not to break up too he kissed ruth as well and she held him tighter than blair expected saying thanks again and seeming to have the same difficulty as paul after hed got his drink and refused the earphones for the inflight movie blair put his seat back and considered the visit good he decided better upon analysis than he could have expected hed done everything he could and the court had done everything it could and he was sure the counsellors and everyone else were going to do everything they could and most important of all no not most important equally important hed got to know the kids again a lot achieved but still not all getting ann together with the kids wouldnt be a problem shed always been eager actually criticising him for not doing more before this had blown up it could only be difficult if the kids made it so and he thought hed crossed sufficient bridges on this trip to make that unlikely getting ann to understand the extension in moscow might be more awkward hed have to explain it properly setting out all the advantages and when they called them in he decided hed take a washington posting ann would still have a say like hed decided already but hed make it clear what he wanted to guide her blair slept better on the return trip less preoccupied with uncertainties than on the outward journey they staged again at amsterdam and remembering the omission of his departing flight blair bought ann perfume and a diminutive cross and chain with a written guarantee of carat gold in the duty free shop still with time to spare before the moscow connection he bought her a watch too inexpensive but quite stylish which she could interchange with the one she already had and throw away without any qualms when it went wrong it was late afternoon before blair got into sheremetyevo still feeling tired despite the earlier sleep his usual dislike of flying he decided he called ann from the airport and frowned at her obvious quietness guessing the reason and apologising for being away for so long she said it was all right and she was looking forward to his getting home blair thought she looked beautiful when he entered the apartment she kissed him anxiously and held him tightly and blair thought maybe hed misconstrued the telephone conversation shed gone to the trouble of welcomehome champagne and after they opened it he made a performance of giving her the gifts he expected her to show more enthusiasm than she did but recognised he was apprehensive of making the announcement now that the moment had come and decided against reading too much into small things it could be him not her ann had wondered what her feelings would be at the actual moment of confrontation and realised it was embarrassment deep numbing embarrassment did whores feel embarrassed or was it something they got used to with practice the embarrassment made it difficult to respond properly to the gifts which actually increased the feeling but she tried dabbing on the perfume and twisting to let him put the necklace on her and replacing her existing watch with the new one and assuring him it was lovely she was naturally and sincerely interested so she asked him about paul but there was a personal reason too because she wanted him to talk rather than respond to a lot of questions about what she had been doing it took a long time and she was grateful blair went into every detail and with the newlydecided honesty confessed the awareness of his own failings and how he believed those failings had contributed to what happened when he set out the promises and the resolutions to stay closer to the boys and have them here in moscow she felt out for his hand the reluctance until now her own embarrassment not any hesitation at physical contact and said shed do everything she could to make it work like hed always known she would i went to langley a couple of times he said finally i thought you would talked about a lot of things like what she said suddenly attentive theyve asked me to stay on theyve what the question was asked quietly the voice neutral someone who thought theyd misheard stay on after the normal three years said blair he knew he hadnt done it right and so he hurriedly continued trying to improve enumerating all the concessions and the promises wanting her to see how much to their advantage it would be you mean youve already agreed the outrage was there now the anger rising they wanted a decision on the spot without discussing it with me asking me how i felt that wasnt possible you know that and you know how i feel about this fucking place how i hate and loathe it because you havent given it a chance ive given it two years she shouted two years that have been like a fucking prison sentence whats the matter with you blair hadnt expected her to welcome the decision but he hadnt anticipated this sort of tirade either it was a valid question ann accepted she was angry furious but mixed up in the emotion was her own guilt and embarrassment and feeling of being a whore being able to shout at him as if everything were his fault slightly lessened it all only very slightly what sort of question is that she said in controlled rage you know damned well how i hate it here how ive always hated it how ive been counting off the days and the weeks and the months like a prison sentence and hardly been able to wait until the time was up and we could be released she laughed a jeering sound that was actually the first word that came into my head believe me she said released blair sat silent under the onslaught he had misunderstood hed had some idea of her unhappiness but not that it was as bad as this not the obvious bulgingeyed nostrilflared hatred or had he hadnt he known it all along and chosen to ignore or minimise it wasnt it another cop out like it had been with the boys a refusal to let anything interfere with what he eddie blair ultimately wanted to happen it might not be any longer than three years he said in an attempt at recovery remembering the search for his own reassurances you know the uncertainty that exists here thats why they want me to stay if the leadership is settled wed hold the aces and the kings abandoning the aircraft resolution he said and you get to choose wherever you want well go christ said ann striding without direction around the room i cant believe it i just cant believe it what if everything isnt settled we could be stuck here for years no said blair at once i made that clear its not an open ticket she stopped abruptly in front of him staring down ok she said so how long how long if its not an open ticket not more than another three years promised blair the first figure that came into his head three years echoed ann the outrage flooding back you mean you expect me to stay here for another three fucking years no said blair his own temper finally giving way i dont expect you to stay here for another three fucking years if moscow and your dislike of it ok your hatred of it is the biggest thing in your life then i dont expect you to stay his reaction quietened her at once the thrust striking the rawest and most exposed nerve she felt her face burn red and hoped blair would believe it was her anger youre telling me to get out she demanded no he said and you know im not i love you and i want you to stay its for you to decide whether you love me enough to stay he sat waiting for several moments she stared down at him and then she burst into tears brinkman responsed at once to blairs invitation knowing of course that the american wanted an update on anything that had happened while hed been away and hoping he might get a lead to what blair had been doing from the mans questions because it was blairs invitation the meeting was at the american embassy at their usual table in the cafeteria brinkman felt the briefest spurt of embarrassment at the moment of shaking hands but almost at once it went private life was private life but this was business and quite separate if that made him a cunt if cuckolding blair made him a cunt then ok he was a cunt successful men often were there was the customary shadow boxing the inconsequential smalltalk and then realistic enough to know he wouldnt get anything unless he gave something blair said may be staying here longer than i planned what said brinkman been asked to extend feeling is that the current leadership uncertainty makes this an important place to be bollocks thought brinkman theyd discussed the leadership a dozen times blairs disclosure about extending meant he was on to something but he was bloody sure it wasnt on something as unfocussed as leadership interpretation theyd interpreted that already both of them was the suspicion true did blair have a source buried deep how long for no specified time how would ann react to that he thought suddenly private he thought quickly shutting the door deciding he wouldnt get anything by direct questioning brinkman tried to offer something that had occurred professionally while the man had been away discomfited at once because he knew the gesture was pointless because bugger all had happened chebrakin had appeared publicly ahead of serada at a photographed session of the central committee which confirmed what they already guessed and there had been increasing criticism in pravda of food shortages which was a rare admission but an indication that someone was soon publicly to be blamed for them not much then discerned blair when brinkman finished not really conceded brinkman still not the slightest indication of whats happening beyond chebrakin thats the kicker said blair thats what everybody wants to know and blair did decided brinkman somehow he didnt know how blair had a lead on what the other moves were and thats why hed been recalled to washington but that wouldnt have been enough to be recalled that could have been covered in a normal cable something about the leadership but important enough to go back to washington personally to discuss it but what what in the name of christ was it thanks incidentally for looking after ann while i was away said blair brinkman met the americans gaze across the table i enjoyed doing it he said easily two days later serada was removed from the politburo and the leadership of the soviet union anatoli chebrakin was named as successor chapter twentytwo ann telephoned him at the embassy which she hadnt done before and brinkman was momentarily irritated because it blurred the divisions hed created and then he accepted divisions were an infantile effort on his part somehow to ease his conscience and that there couldnt be any divide ive got to see you she announced thats not going to be easy any more is it do you know whats happened yes said brinkman and we shouldnt be talking on an open line damn an open line ill try to think of something i want to see you now we had the most terrible row people who had terrible rows sometimes said things they didnt mean to say it was still only eleven oclock no chance of eddie coming home to lunch he never does hed phone if he decided to ill come thank you darling there isnt anybody else i can talk to as brinkman drove back to the compound he determined his initial reaction to her call had been the right one now blair was back in moscow it wasnt going to be easy to see ann any more to attempt to was virtual madness did he want to anyway although hed disguised it better brinkman had been as bewildered and confused as ann by what occurred after the bolshoi and made the same resolutions about mistakes and forgetting them so why had it been he who made the first approach afterwards hed told her it wasnt a casual fuck and it wasnt romeo and juliet either so ok what was it a personal involvement hadnt featured in his plans for moscow without thinking positively about it hed imagined affairs pleasant conclusions to pleasant evenings which is how this had started he remembered but he hadnt wanted telephoneatwork seemeatonce situations and not with the wife of a man doing the same job as he was doing at the american embassy so what was he doing driving across moscow for lunchtime assignations it wasnt an assignation he thought in immediate correction and there was a purpose what about the divisions now if blair had inadvertently said something during their argument which was an excuse for what brinkman couldnt decide and brinkman didnt like being unable to decide anything certainly not about himself there was no hesitation any more as soon as she let him into the apartment ann clung to him and kissed him and brinkman held her and kissed her back and realised he was even more undecided when did he tell you she asked we had lunch at the embassy can you believe it professionally yes said brinkman he was trying to be fair as well as guide the conversation but he knew how i felt its a very important time here just now said brinkman steering still that all i bloody well hear i couldnt give a damn about how important situations are here at the moment i came willingly here because i knew how much it mattered to eddies career and ive endured it here for the same reason to be with him ive been virtually cut off by my family and i abandoned all my friends and until now ive tried not to complain too much ann held up her hand a physical correction i let him know clearly enough but i tried not to go on about it like some spoilt brat and all right i know thats how i might sound now to you and to him but at least we could have discussed it didnt i deserve that at least brinkman supposed she did she appeared to have lobotomised herself to what had happened between them while blair was away in her equations about who had let whom down maybe he wasnt the only one to try to create divisions it wouldnt have been easy talking on the telephone from washington would it why not whats all this crap about open lines and secure lines we wouldnt have been talking about anything secret wed have been talking about our future and why was it so important to get a decision there and then why couldnt he have come back here to moscow so we could have talked it through no reason at all conceded brinkman except that wasnt how these things were done he wouldnt be able to make her understand it was time to try to get the conversation back on course again he said how longs the extension she snorted a laugh he says no longer than three years but i dont believe him or that it could be sooner maybe that wed be able to keep to the original schedule if the leadership thing is sorted out when the hell was he going to get a lead he could understand and follow he said so you could be getting upset about nothing will it be chebrakin has been declared the new leader he said she smiled up in sudden hope so it is sorted out what does eddie say he asked directly and hopefully we havent talked about it we havent talked about anything much since he came back she confessed seeing a route to follow brinkman said knowing as he does now how you feel about staying on i would have thought he would have said something if everything had been solved by chebrakins election so would i she agreed come on thought brinkman the exasperation practically constant now he said hasnt he no she said shortly brinkman knew his conjecture in the embassy cafeteria was right but what in the name of god was sufficiently important beyond chebrakin personally to go back to washington and likely to keep blair here longer than his scheduled posting as much as three years longer ann hadnt believed that remembered brinkman maybe longer then it had been worth the risk coming here today wanting more and remembering his earlier thoughts about what happened during arguments brinkman said so it was a bad row terrible she said the worst ever what did he say asked brinkman another direct question ann looked away that if i didnt like it i could leave not only important enough to go back to washington important enough to consider sacrificing his marriage jesus thought brinkman trying for still more he said people say things they dont mean when theyre shouting at each other ann came against him once more and knowing her need he reached out and held her oh darling she said im so unsure of everything so am i thought brinkman so am i until now orlovs deception of the old man had been unavoidable sevin led and orlov had no alternative but to follow today it was going to have to become calculated and deliberate orlov had wanted it otherwise hed tried to think of every other way every alternative avenue but there was none he could attempt without the risk of arousing curiosity he waited for the customary summons and entered sevins suite with the approach carefully prepared there was the progress discussion on the agricultural project and when the conversation began to flag orlov said theres something i think you should know sevin smiled at him waiting natalia and i have decided to divorce announced orlov everything is well advanced actually im sorry to hear that said sevin curtly there was no stigma to divorce within the soviet union but the news unsettled sevin hed wanted pietr orlov perfect in every way and this was a blemish and an unnecessary blemish why couldnt the man have maintained a pretence aware as he was of the future that was planned for him a lot of other people did orlov knew that sevin a widower now had been married for forty years he said i thought you should know in case of any embarrassment orlov had no religion but he knew the book judas he thought sevins mind was way ahead of the immediate discussion people got divorced for a lot of different reasons but often because of some outside liaison but nowhere in the checks that hed made was there a suggestion of orlov being involved in any sort of extramarital activity feeling he had the right sevin asked directly is there anybody else orlov was stifffaced with control double judas he thought he said no not on either side why then persisted sevin prepared orlov said i suppose we were too long apart were strangers to each other there are constant arguments married people argue said sevin youve made it clear to me what you intend how important it is for all appearances to be right i did not consider the relationship between natalia and myself sufficient to maintain that sort of public appearance when the time comes judas hypocrite liar and cheat he thought miserably sevin nodded at the explanation orlov had never done anything to create the slightest suspicion objectively sevin decided it was an honest explanation and it was a completely acceptable politically acceptable explanation at that he said i think you made the right decision divorce is one of the few things in this society that doesnt cause problems i just thought you should know said the relieved orlov discerning the old mans acceptance moving to further deceit orlov said i realise from what ive learned since ive been back how important it is for things properly to be seen to be right by those who matter sevin smiled taking the bait it is astonishing he agreed how puerile things like positioning at conference tables and arrangements of photographs are considered to matter by men who are supposed to be making decisions that can affect the world orlov hesitated before the final move and said who will be attending the reception at the american embassy its important insisted the old man first outing since chebrakins accession chebrakin himself doesnt plan to attend of course didenko is definitely going but then hes a man under pressure anxious to prove himself still a viable figure ive been proposed but i think ill decline zebin will go okulov too therell be others of course orlov hadnt expected the advantage of one of the men about whom there had already been speculation in the west in advance of chebrakins appointment he said therell be a lot of concentration upon didenko there were forecasts that he had a better chance than chebrakin on this occasion sevin grew serious thats a good point he said an extremely good point delicately not wanting the line to break orlov said would it matter like i said reminded sevin the educator positioning at tables and in photographs and at public functions are considered important the old man stopped for a moments further reflection and then he said i think you should go me said orlov as if the proposal startled him the first outing since chebrakins accession repeated sevin it might seem premature but sides will be taken contenders considered or dismissed as unimportant as early as now and pietr yes said orlov dont make it obvious but try to stay as close as possible to didenko lets get the idea established now among the uncommitted on the central committee and actually within the politburo that theres an equality in stature between the two of you what was he doing to this man thought orlov agonised despising himself he said if you think its important yes insisted sevin i think its important sokol accepted objectively that the cause of blairs return to washington could be absolutely innocent but with matching objectivity never regarded anything a known and identified intelligence agent did as absolutely innocent he annotated blairs file for the man to be subjected to surveillance tighter than normally imposed even on someone named on the special watch list chapter twentythree they had not met all together either on any public occasions or privately since blairs return from washington and brinkman was glad the telephone calls from ann always her to him because he could never know when blair would be at home were quite frequent and brinkman knew that ann was glad too neither sure how they would handle the moment when blair was included it had to happen eventually of course for it not to have done after their earlier closeness would have made blair suspicious and brinkman was grateful it was going to be at a reception crowded with people and distraction so that any awkwardness wouldnt be obvious it was an official affair with protocol to be observed which meant brinkman had to arrive earlier than he would have liked he didnt see blair or ann immediately the first face he recognised was that of wilcox the british head of chancery they had a strained conversation about cricket about which wilcox was an acknowledged fanatic and brinkman almost entirely ignorant apart from the basic principles eventually he moved on to the buffet table not hungry but using it to occupy the time brinkman hadnt expected the number of people who were there his attendance was logical because the guest list contained the names of at least eight members of the inner soviet government and if they accepted it would not only be an opportunity of seeing them in close proximity like the visit of the british delegation but also of watching them on parade on the first occasion after chebrakins election he hadnt anticipated the interest would be as great from everyone else he heard a shout and smiled at the approach of the harrisons brinkman had returned their hospitality and accepted it again without the enforced accompaniment of sharon berring and there had also been occasional encounters at official functions like this but it hadnt become a positive friendship stranger accused betty harrison busy said brinkman it was true after a fashion he supposed he and ann had played games about bettys reaction if shed known playing one now he said to the woman whats all the news is there ever any news in moscow if there is you always know about it betty she gave a mew of feigned offence but brinkman knew she was pleased at the acknowledgement i do hear that the wife of a certain someone at the australian embassy is becoming well known to the moscow authorities for her liking of the local brew drinking is australias national sport said brinkman to harrison brinkman said how are things in the wheatfields the canadian grinned things seem to have gone quiet dont they tonight might be interesting said brinkman i sometimes think you people would be better off reading tealeaves in cups said the woman harrison frowned and brinkman was surprised she said it innocuous though it was appearing to realise the offence betty tried to recover smiling over brinkmans shoulder more strangers she said beckoning brinkman turned as the blairs walked up to them because of the level of the reception ambassadorial rank dress was formal and blair was wearing a black tie it was the first time brinkman had seen the american in a dinner suit he thought the man looked ill at ease and he thought ann looked stunning she wore a black evening dress one shoulder bare with a single diamond clip the only jewellery apart from earrings she had her hair up in a chignon a style she hadnt adopted before she smiled at them all appearing quite controlled and said hi hello said brinkman relieved she wasnt finding it difficult he searched for his own feelings and was surprised by them he was jealous he realised he resented the proprietorial way blair cupped his wifes elbow and the mans closeness to her and everyones acceptance that ann belonged to him brinkman stopped the rush of impressions astonished at himself what possible conceivable justifiable right did he have to feel jealous presenting himself with the question brinkman tried to answer it did he love her he didnt know not honestly know any more than he knew if ann loved him it was a word they avoided like they were avoiding actually looking at each other now jealousy wasnt love it was coveting something belonging to someone else did ann belong to blair any more another thing they avoided but he thought he knew the answer blair had offered her the way out although he had no way of telling if the man had been serious and ann hadnt taken it there wasnt a furtive telephone call or a hurried snatched meeting when there wasnt some reference to how much she was going to hate staying on after the scheduled time and there could only be one obvious inference from that ann was talking animatedly to betty harrison using the woman as he tried to use her earlier and blair was discussing something with the canadian as a waiter passed brinkman said to ann can i get you a drink aware the moment he spoke that he was being overly solicitous and that blair was turning towards the man anyway committed brinkman said hurriedly both of you and betty saved the moment by saying always the perfect gentleman brinkman handed glasses to both of them wondering if the flush he felt burning his face were obvious i was just saying to ann that we havent seen nearly enough of each other no we havent agreed brinkman glad to be taken over by the woman things have been a bit disorganised with eddie being away said ann soon thought brinkman betty harrison was going to realise how steadfastly he and ann were looking at her to escape looking at each other hes back now said betty taking over her role as social leader lets make a definite date here now not clear what im doing in the next few weeks said brinkman too quickly he wasnt sure how well he was coming out of this tonight he certainly didnt think he could sustain an enclosed evening with only six or eight people nonsense rejected betty whatever is there to do in moscow well talk on the telephone said brinkman still retreating tomorrow persisted the woman ill fix things up with ann and then well make contact with you she turned brightly to the other men and said im fixing up a party her husband resigned said fine and blair said thatll be swell it was becoming ridiculous and if they didnt do something soon right now it would be seen to be to ann brinkman said there are more people here than i thought there would be the only thing he could think of she looked at him finally the rigid set of her face the only indication of difficulty you havent been before she said there usually are she risked a smile quickly on and off for him what the hell was there to talk about brinkman thought taking the chance that his voice would not carry in the hubbub he said softly you look fabulous ann blushed only slightly and said thank you russians are late said harrison from his right and brinkman positively turned away from ann snatching at the interruption maybe theyre planning to make a big entrance said blair i would have thought they were assured of that anyway said brinkman he had to escape hed stayed with them long enough too long so it wouldnt look out of place to the group generally he said i think ill mingle and moved away as he spoke so there couldnt be any delaying discussion with betty about any damned dinner party he couldnt think of an excuse for not going but hed find one before she called tomorrow hed behaved like an idiot brinkman acknowledged a stumbling firsttimeallowedout idiot thank god there had been so many people jostling and crowding them anything less and someone would certainly have noticed maybe they had betty harrison was an irritating constantly tittletattling nuisance and shed got that way by seeing what went on about her he was less worried about betty harrison than he was about blair the american was the acknowledged leader of the pack and hed achieved the position by seeing what went on around him too risking the presumption brinkman tacked himself on to the edge of the group surrounding the british ambassador and was allowed to get away with it because of sir oliver braces awareness of who his father was brinkman endured wilcox and more cricket and then managed to buffer himself with the trade counsellor who had helped him initiate the wheat success street remembered brinkman with some difficulty the trade official was a vague wisphaired man with a habit of letting his conversation drift away in midsentence as if he suddenly lost conviction in the views he first started to express brinkman smalltalked only halfconcentrating alert for the russian arrival and alert too for any movement that might bring him close again to the blairs hed been close enough for one night there was the briefest dip in the level of sound when the russians arrived as if everyone had stopped talking at the same time to draw breath and brinkman was happy at the positioning of the ambassadors group because it was near the main entrance and gave him the opportunity of studying the russians all together while they were being greeted by the american ambassador and senior officials before they had time to disperse vasili didenko led the acknowledged leader the redfaced forceful appearance brinkman remembered from the british parliamentary visit the man marched rather than walked and from the briefest expressions from some of the people to whom he was introduced he appeared to have a hard handshake like a projector throwing up holiday stills against a screen brinkman ran through his mind the memorised images of all the people who had been pictured and identified during the recent elections he got leonid zebin first a frail uncertainlooking man then okulov whose first name he couldnt remember which annoyed him more assured than zebin looking around him almost with the arrogance matching didenko brinkman knew that yevgeni aistov had been most recently attached to the agricultural ministry so his appearance was clearly to indicate he had survived any purge and should therefore be interpreted as an emerging strongman he had a full file for maxwell in the morning thought brinkman confidently he blinked at the last man in the line immediately recognising him from the same parliamentary trip where hed first seen didenko pietr orlov was as imposing as hed appeared then the impeccable tailoring that brinkman had admired on that occasion obvious again here brinkman strained positively to ensure there were no more in the soviet party and then looked back to orlov who was just coming to the end of the official receiving line maybe a fuller file than he had imagined thought brinkman orlovs identification during the british visit had been important because he was one of the youngest members ever but there had been two others vladimir isakov and viktor petrov remembered brinkman but they werent here so why orlov why with dozens of other more senior figures available had there come to an important foreign embassy reception a man so newly promoted he probably didnt know himself all the names of the people with whom he was now daily sitting at meetings brinkman decided that things were picking up he looked attentively as the russians formed themselves into a group orlov was next to didenko a marked contrast to the redfaced russian beyond brinkman saw blair gazing at the russians too and wondered if the man realised the significance of orlovs presence he recalled telling the american of the attendance of all three newcomers at the english function but unless blair had studied the photographs as intently as he had and then backed the study up by being able personally to see the man then he might miss it doubtful because blair was so good but just a possibility hed always regarded himself in competition with the man but brinkman realised he now regarded the competition as even greater it had always been silly to imagine a separation between his professional and private life was possible anyway brinkman pushed the distracting reflection from his mind concentrating upon what was most important what other meaning could orlovs appearance be than that he was more important than the other two newlyelected members and much more important than some who were there ahead of him brinkman watched eagerly seeking any indication of deference towards orlov from the others in the party and trying to establish if there were any discernable attitude towards the man from didenko there wasnt there were some photographs and brinkman knew miserably that they would provide blair with a comparison and that the american would now find it easy to identify everyone in the group shit he thought bitterly after the photographs didenko remained talking to the us ambassador but the remainder moved away they still stayed in a loosely knit group however all socially ill at ease except for orlov with his recent overseas experience the immaculate russian engaged almost immediately in conversation with the french diplomats irritably brinkman saw that henri baton the french intelligence resident was in the party brinkman maintained a desultory conversation with the sentencelapsing street using the man as a cover trying to encompass all the russians other people had joined the soviet visitors didenko was making his way towards them so brinkman decided to stay where he was orlov continued on apparently towards the canadians didenko joined the people with whom brinkman was standing nodding cursorily to everyone except the ambassador they all politely stopped talking while the russian and sir oliver made their exchanges the conversation between didenko and sir oliver was meaningless cocktail party regulations but brinkman recorded the fact that didenko spoke good enough english not to need an interpreter brinkman had hoped one might have been necessary with his own excellent russian it might have been possible to pick up a tidbit between what was actually said and what was actually translated the stop like the talk was regimented and as didenko went off brinkman moved too remembering his regret at not being able to talk to orlov during the parliamentary visit and wondering if he could make up for it now at once brinkman felt a stab of anxiety he saw far ahead that orlov was in conversation with blair and that the two appeared momentarily alone brinkman thrust as quickly through the crowd as possible not wanting the american to gain any advantage had brinkman not been concentrating so entirely and been in the position he was he would not have seen what happened the two were against a wall at a point where an ornate curtain swept out in a flamboyant drape it created a wedge obscuring them completely on two sides from everyone else in the room orlov had his back to the salon restricting the view from where the main body of the guests were so that the only clear visibility was directly parallel with the wall which was the direction from which brinkman was approaching blairs expression of surprise would have been too brief for anyone but brinkman as close and as intent as he was and intent as he was brinkman saw the exchange the merest brushing of hands brinkman was sure it had been an exchange and with that conviction all the others came tumbling in he knew now what was important enough for blair to be recalled to washington he knew what was important enough for blair to regard his marriage as dispensible he knew why blair had extended and he knew too that the man would go on extending and why ann had better reconcile herself to a lifetime in moscow if she wanted to stay married to the man and he knew who blairs source was there was not the slightest sign of either orlov or blair being disconcerted by brinkmans arrival i dont believe youve met the cultural attache at the british embassy mr jeremy brinkman no said orlov i dont think ive had the pleasure the envy surged through brinkman a physical sensation that actually made him feel weak so that his legs trembled just briefly he wanted orlov and if he couldnt have him then neither would blair youre late challenged ruth ive just left the programme for gods sake dont be truculent with me paul or evasive you leave the programme at five if you dont pick up the fiveten metro theres another at fivetwenty mr erickson allowed for that from the metro station its a seven minute walk eight at the outside youre an hour out he timed the whole journey yes paul he did and it seems a good idea that he bothered doesnt it the boy stubbed his toe into the carpet lower lip between his teeth so ok demanded his mother where were you talking to some guys what guys just guys what guys she repeated just guys insisted paul just as determinedly its not yet a month said ruth not yet a month since you stood in court and heard what would happen if you did it again i havent done anything again so what were you doing just talking thats all just talking honest i cant expect you to be honest any more can i thats up to you no its not up to me its up to you thats been made perfectly clear by everyone its all up to you paul made the groove in the carpet and was worrying it into a wider gap spreading the pile apart stop that shouted ruth and stop being such a stupid little child just talking insisted the boy im going to call mr erickson and mr kemp and the programme director im going to tell them what happened and let them decide what to do give me a break mom thats exactly what i am trying to give you said the woman chapter twentyfour blair left the apartment early the following morning earlier than he ever had careless of ann imagining it some continuation of the coldness which had existed between them since his return from washington careless of everything in his eagerness to get to the securedoored isolation of his office at the embassy he needed such absolute isolation without the slightest distraction or interruption properly to assimilate what had happened at the reception the previous night just five words words he had been convinced at first that he had misheard which must have showed because orlov had repeated them urgently i would like to meet and the paper slipped into his hand the paper he had spread now on his desk and was staring down at willing the neat sterile letters to tell him more kuntsevo fili park june today was june so pietr orlov recently returned plenipotentiary ambassador for the ussr at the united nations recently elected and youngest member of the central governing body wanted to meet him at seven oclock tonight at the last pier for the moscow river boats where the vessels change for the trip further north which was just beyond fili park dare he go there were standard lectures about provocateur entrapment not just for people like him but for all diplomatic staff before any moscow posting but they werent about anything like this the entrapments were crude affairs by kgb groundmen they didnt involve people like pietr orlov it had to be genuine genuine what that was an impossible speculation he could absorb all the available file material that hed already pulled and imagine half a dozen possibilities and still be a million miles from guessing right hed have to go unthinkable of course that he wouldnt once hed considered everything hed have to go to the pier and remain as inconspicuous as possible and let orlov make the running if the man showed then whatever it was he would be involved in the most spectacular moment in his career he should tell langley it was common sense apart from inviolate instructions that he shouldnt try to climb a greasy pole like this without at least trying to establish some form of padding if he fell backwards not that there was much theyd be able to do if it were a setup inconceivable though that might be but he was reluctant to contact washington it was so little and so inconclusive shaking up the bees nest without knowing where the honey was he postponed it poring over the material that existed in the files so little he thought again married no children comparatively rapid rise through the diplomatic channel culminating in the most recent election flat and empty a whos who entry except that a whos who entry gave hobbies and pastimes and what he had in front of him didnt even provide that he had to contact langley about other things from last night blair knew coming back to his uncertainty aistovs appearance after the crop disaster was important the sort of thing he would have considerd very important indeed before orlov he wrote the message and encoded it and then sat where he was instead of taking it to the cipher room this was stupid no matter what the uproar when he shook the nest he had to tell them not to do so for fear of making himself look a fool would be abandoning his expertise as an intelligence officer and he prided that expertise above all else it took him an hour to write and encode and he had the orlov message transmitted first and then sat waiting the response came within a hour which considering the procedural channels at langley was practically at the speed of light he responded patiently that he couldnt amplify because he had included everything in his first message and when they asked for interpretation he said that was impossible glad hed thought it through before the request came langley said a special desk was being established inside the existing hour watch room and that he was to communicate immediately after the meeting if it occurred took place there was the injunction to take all possible care and to avoid anything which might lead to an incident embarrassing to the united states and then as an apparent afterthought hubble personally signed a message wishing him good luck the twoway exchanges meant he missed lunch but blair was too excited to eat anyway he telephoned ann to say he would be late home probably very late and that she wasnt to wait dinner and to go to bed without him shed been in bed that morning when hed left so he asked her how she was and she said ok and how was he and he said ok anxious to get off the telephone ann appeared to sense it and ended the conversation blair realised he would be behaving like an amateur if he didnt carry out a reconnaissance he wasnt an amateur he was an extremely experienced professional who knew entrapments werent set up instantly entrapments required planning and blair was pretty sure that if he made a practice run early he would be professional enough to identify any preparation from the embassy on ulitza chaykovskovo blair walked without haste to the nearest metro wanting to pick up the watchers he emerged from the underground at the sverdlova station only starting to hurry when he was almost across red square and approaching the gigantic gum department store enjoying himself with the thought that he was going to clear his trail actually in view of the kgb headquarters once through the doors he really hurried burying himself in the largest department store in the soviet union and reflecting as he did so that it was an ideal place in which to lose a tail he emerged from one of the sidedoors away from the lenin mausoleum hurrying this time to the ploshchad metro terminal the essential of identifying any surveillance is obviously to identify your pursuers and throughout blair was alert to people close around and when he boarded the train he checked and decided that no one in the immediate carriage had been with him earlier which didnt preclude the following carriage which was the one he would have chosen if he were conducting the surveillance to avoid that he disembarked after two stations remaining where he was on the platform so that any follower would have had to get off with him and remain obviously on the station like he was no one did blair caught the next train to come along disembarked for the necessary change and still necessary further check and emerged comparatively satisfied at kiev station in front of the ferry pier blair allowed himself to be carried aboard by the crush of people not shouldering forward in a way that would have attracted any attention it was full of trippers and blair decided if it were to be a genuine meet then orlov had chosen his protection well intentionally blair set himself on the deck near a bend in the rail which meant he only had two directions in which to look still alert for surveillance as the ferry made its way up river blair gazed up at the thrusting colonnades and obelisks commemorating the battle of borodino as they passed under the borodinskiy bridge and decided it was the most attractive of the river crossing points the buildings were too tall not skyscrapers like he knew them but still tall near the kalininskiy bridge blair turned away from the bridges gazing instead across at the krasnaya presnya park using the movement still to watch everyone around him he employed the long stretch of the river before the twist under the railway bridge to continue the search and by the time they neared his destination blair was sure he was clean he thought the factories along the last section were uniform and depressive but he thought fili park looked attractive just how attractive he wondered would it prove to be for him blair let himself be carried off the ferry as he had boarded it by the pressure of people around detaching himself gradually at the end of the pier and staring around ahead he could see the larger boats taking the trippers further north to the beaches at plyazh this was the junction point people and boats going in both directions a pushing and shoving melee of a place good for an ambush as well as an unobserved meeting blair wandered with apparent aimlessness in reality aware of everything around him it was chaotic but the proper sort of chaos there was no artifice of people put on stage to play their part in a performance in which he was going to become a lead player very slightly he relaxed there were refreshment stalls and snack bars under cover and open air blair chose one in the open where he could see everyone around him hungry at last he ordered sausage and beer eating unhurriedly with time to kill around him russians worked hard in their determination to relax and enjoy not working and blair thought that at this level it was difficult to understand why russians and americans each believed the other wanted to annihilate them ok the fashions and the accents and the amusements were different very different but blair could see a similarity between this and coney island or the pier from which hed taken the kids boating during the trip home he wondered how paul was shaping up under the programme hed averaged a letter a week since he got back and hoped that whatever was going to happen this afternoon would not affect the regularity hed established hed been lectured both by kemp and erickson how essential it was for kids to have stability and for things not suddenly to start and just as suddenly to end blair took another beer just time killing and left the stall with some still to spare before the scheduled seven oclock everything was normal he determined when he got back to kuntsevo he was sure of it where he wondered looking around as well chosen as it was the pierhead was still a big area it was ridiculous his attempting to find orlov blair realised orlov would have to find him near the onward ticket office there was bench and blair sat on it waiting back at langley station staff would be bitching at having their nights screwed up because some halfassed bigshot in moscow imagined he was on to something hot reflected blair he wondered if his waiting and their hurried formation would all be a waste of time no realised blair orlov came enquiringly through the crowd from the justarrived river boat staring first towards the refreshment stalls and then when he looked back seeing the american there was no recognition orlov did not approach at once but moved to his left as if unsure in which direction to continue having left the first stage of his journey a signal or caution wondered blair his concentration was beyond the russian watching for any followers if there were any they were very good because he couldnt isolate any orlov had dressed down from his usual elegance which showed thought but even in the sports jacket and slacks he was noticeable among the other trippers the approach remained casual and blair considered the mans control was good because if the approach were genuine he would be under enormous tension orlov sat finally on the bench not directly beside the american but with space between them the moves had to start from the russian decided blair keeping to training thank you for coming said orlov he spoke looking out towards the river remembering his internal debate at the embassy blair said did you imagine i wouldnt i didnt know i wasnt certain you approached me reminded blair always he had to be extremely careful i want to go back blurted orlov back to america you mean you want to defect mr orlov blair spoke looking out towards the river too hoping he was disguising his reaction as well as the russian had covered his emotions at the moment of approach he hadnt been wrong back at the embassy he thought underestimating in fact this would be doubly the most spectacular moment of his career orlov didnt respond at once appearing unwilling to confirm the word i do not consider myself a traitor to my country he said the soviet union will consider you to be orlov was silent again for several moments and then he said i will be asked to cooperate provide information like you wouldnt believe thought blair he said if you want the united states government to assist you and provide you with protection which will be necessary then they would expect cooperation in return how much demanded orlov now it was blairs turn to hesitate hed never handled a defection before but there were enough records usually in their eagerness to escape defectors fell over themselves to show what a good catch theyd be frequently they boasted an ability to provide information they didnt have he said you cant expect me to know that considerable persisted orlov you are a man of great experience and prestige hedged blair i would imagine my government would be extremely interested in having the benefit of that experience i am not a traitor repeated orlov my country would not consider you one said blair liar he thought defectors were always feted and rewarded and usually looked after but always deep down they were despised as well will it be possible of course assured blair at once more than double spectacular in fact if he got orlov out his own position in moscow would be untenable which meant that he could leave more importantly that ann could leave well in advance of the minimal period they had expected to be here but the coup orlovs defection would mean for langley would ensure that all the promises theyd made him would stand out before they were due and anything they chose he thought when it must be soon said orlov giving the first hint of desperation blair chanced a sideways look and saw that the russian was sweating despite his determination for control he was sweating too blair realised blair said i will have to contact washington of course let them know fully what has happened i will make all the arrangements good said orlov the relief obvious but soon i need to know more mr orlov more why do you want to defect again the word caused the russian difficulty he said it is a personal thing what the hell did that mean thought blair he said im afraid that if were going to work together as closely as will be necessary to get you out of the country there cant be anything personal i dont want her put under any pressure her surely orlov wasnt thinking of abandoning everything for a woman would he for ann hed abandoned his first marriage and two kids he realised but told her she could leave if she didnt like the idea of backing him in moscow except that he hadnt meant it and been terrified she might call his bluff blair looked quickly at the russian again the man was supposed to be married he remembered from the file who he said there is someone in new york said orlov awkwardly shell need to be contacted said blair protected not yet insisted orlov i dont want her alarmed until everything is settled and confirmed could he give such a positive assurance langley were going to go apeshit over something like this and he couldnt predict what promises theyd keep he said is that a condition yes said orlov at once do you have any others asked the american avoiding the commitment the question seemed to surprise orlov just to be got safely out he said in contradiction to what orlov had done and the echelon hed reached blair decided there was almost a naivety about the man the records were full of cases of defectors demanding millions of dollars houses with threecar garages and every car a cadillac well need to know the name of the person in new york said blair she will not be pressured demanded orlov i will let my people know fully how you feel said blair it was the best he could do ill want their assurance before i will consider going any further naive or not he was a pretty good negotiator of course accepted blair i need the name johnson said orlov shortly harriet johnson she is a senior translator at the united nations wanting to move the russian on and knowing the mans needs he said i will contact washington tonight but it will be necessary for us to meet again obviously of course said orlov where blair looked around him and said public places are good but not here again remembering the trip up river he said do you know the krasnaya park of course there is a statue near the central walkway an archer there when it isnt possible now to fix times so well make floating arrangements floating arrangements which is best day or evening day replied orlov at once it had been difficult tonight avoiding the meeting with sevin noon then every friday this week it is only two days away by which time ill have a full reaction from washington everything will be arranged quickly as quickly as possible said blair giving the repeated assurance it would understandably be the mans main preoccupation it isnt easy said orlov no im very frightened everything will be all right promised blair i will be accused of being a traitor wont i blair was unsure what response the man wanted orlov wasnt a fool he thought he said yes you will be labelled a traitor momentarily orlovs head went forward on to his chest he said his voice muffled i wont betray my country i will talk to your people because i know i must give something but i wont betray my country not completely he would thought blair he might set out not intending to have assurances that it wasnt expected but the debriefings would go on and on chipping and prodding until orlov had been picked clean like a skeleton after the vultures had left i understand said blair it wasnt a discussion or even a considerationfor him noon at krasnaya confirmed orlov and let neither of us panic if for any reason its impossible it wont be for me i can assure you but it might be for you if you cant make it then ill be there again the same time the following friday thats what floating arrangement means im not sure i could wait that long said orlov dont take any chances warned blair if you panic everything could be destroyed i wont panic promised orlov its important stressed blair its a strange feeling said orlov frightened like i said i cant imagine how my life is going to change not really i know just how mine is going to change thought blair washingtons reaction was as frantic as blair expected it to be it took a long time to make the exchanges because they used the highest security ciphers and during a lull in transmission blair telephoned ann to tell her not to wait up and she said she wouldnt langley cabled for him to give any undertaking orlov required and to assure the man of their complete and absolute protection halfway through the exchanges the cables started to be signed by the director himself congratulations first then demands for clarification on points blair felt he had already made clear one of the last messages was the demand that he return personally to washington which blair agreed to do but successfully argued against immediate recall to enable him to make the friday meeting with orlov it was late almost four in the morning before blair eased himself as carefully as possible beside ann into a bed that brinkman had vacated five hours before brinkman was awake in another part of the foreign complex ann hadnt known anything he hadnt expected her to but blairs earlierthanever departure and laterthanever return meant something important was happening vitally important hed requested a lot from london without giving any reason because he didnt know any reason and he expected it to arrive during the day in the diplomatic pouch because hed designated it fullest priority but brinkman had no idea of what he was looking for like trying to find the right road in a thick fog he thought brinkman hated the feeling of helplessness the kgb surveillance squad who lost blair before he got to the ploshchad metro knew something of the same discomfort but they were street operators who spent all the time in apparently meaningless pursuits which always produced nothing and their feeling was fleeting just like their uncertainty about what to do to report the loss would create an inquest even a charge and an enquiry and it wasnt worth it among themselves they agreed to be more careful in future and not report this time their failing pravda named orlov as being one of the russians who attended the american embassy reception and because it was the first public occasion since die elections and had been a quiet day for foreign news the new york times carried a small picture from which she was able to identify him unsmiling and upright alongside didenko harriet read both reports several times and then stared at the picture wanting it to tell her something theyd agreed during their innocent grossly incomplete planning that because she was in new york the approach when he made it would have to be to the americans so this had to be it it had to mean that all her doubts and uncertainties had been stupid and that pietr was coming as hed always promised he would harriet felt embarrassed now at not trusting him a contradiction came into her mind the first small cloud that indicates a storm the picture could also mean that he was being groomed for greater promotion he was after all directly next to didenko and that he might be finding the choice difficult no she thought positively it didnt mean that at all it meant he was coming like shed always known he would hurry she whispered aloud please hurry my darling chapter twentyfive wednesday the day they met ran into thursday because of the length of time blair spent linked to langley so there were only twentyfour hours before his scheduled second meeting with orlov but the pressure from washington was unremitting the same questions were asked a dozen different ways and blair gave the same answers recognising the headquarters excitement they offered backup which he refused because of the difficulty of obtaining accreditation and visas and sensibly arguing that the sudden applications might arouse the curiosity they certainly didnt want they said they would maintain the emergency desk in the watch room and although blair couldnt see any purpose he didnt bother to argue against that because it couldnt cause him any personal inconvenience and he accepted it gave them the impression of actively doing something which was what all the repeated cables were really about blair was instructed first by hubble and then by the director to make a booking on the late friday plane and when he pointed out that there was no guarantee that orlov would make the meeting was told it didnt matter and that reservations could always be cancelled blair hated the atmosphere that existed between himself and ann since his return from washington from the earlier trip and the temptation to tell her something anything about how it all might be put right was strong but he resisted it the professionalism subjugating the personal desire but only just he made the reservation and realised he should tell her about that at least but held back from doing so if he told her he was going back to america and then cancelled because orlov didnt or couldnt show then shed be further confused blairs initial precautions to avoid observation which in intelligence circles is called clearing your path had been basic care as instinctive as fastening a safety belt in an airplane now that he knew possibly that he was going to the biggest meeting of his life he employed every iota of tradecraft and expertise the beginning however was still basic the hunted must always become the hunter reversing the roles which meant identifying any pursuit blair began hours before his appointment with pietr orlov wanting all the time available he left the embassy on foot setting out without any apparent hurry along the ulitza chaykovskovo and managed incredibly to locate two foot followers and their backup car a battered lada after only three hundred yards he confirmed it by jumping a bus suddenly actually looking backwards from the platform to see their hurried scramble to get into the vehicle and keep up he timed the disembarkation for a metro trying to cover himself with departing passengers hurrying down the brilliantly lit subway and wondered as he did so why the subways of new york were covered in graffiti and shit and muggers and those of moscow were pristine and dangerfree and then answered his own unthinking question because the answer was the people attempting to follow him he thought he detected attention from a man in an overly large and too distinctive green topcoat and got a further confirmation when the man followed him up on from the marksa metro and then too close and why that obviously noticeable coat on to ulitza gorkovo blair headed for the intourist hotel and its beriozka one day he thought hed discover why the literal translation of soviet hard currency tourist shops was little birch tree he was lucky with the flood of americans easily able to mix the man in the green coat stationed himself near the main door and blair feigned the ritual of selecting something to buy alert for a call to any tourist bus or gathering it came and it was american and he was out of the shop and among the crowd before green coat moved there was a confusion of assembly in the huge foyer and blair hurried on not from the hotel but to a basement washroom hurrying the last few yards because he wanted to detect the sound of footsteps on the hard surface inside the lavatory he hurried to a cubicle but pushed the door closed with a discernible gap and stood upon the pedestal so that his feet and legs would not be visible it was part of the training blair recognised but he felt theatrically absurd there was no obvious pursuit and for the benefit of anyone at the stalls he needlessly flushed the toilet before he left there were four men in the larger room but none of them was wearing a green coat blair marked exactly what they were wearing and ascended to ground level cautiously seeking another obscuring tourist party there werent any obvious ones but the vast foyer was comparatively busy he emerged from a different door from that through which he entered heading back to the marksa underground he isolated one hurrying man and a possible backup car managed to get his ticket way ahead and dodged platforms by jumping a barrier unseen and had the satisfaction of seeing the pursuer feverishly depart on a train upon which the quarry wasnt travelling blair hurried now believing the entrance unguarded he mumbled an explanation for his unused ticket at the kiosk and reemerged on to the highway at the very moment that a vacant taxi was passing he strained behind him looking for any obvious pursuit there wasnt any he still didnt take chances this time he avoided gum going instead and with unknowing irony to the huge department store of tsum which is on the ulitza petrovska and directly behind the bolshoi theatre from which brinkman and ann had gone to begin their affair he moved hurriedly here going from floor to floor in hopefully confusing speed and made the final test on a seat outside the arrangements were made for orlovs convenience and possible cancellation but they applied equally to blair and he obviously decided that if he believed there to be the slightest risk he would abort the meeting he waited for an hour conscious of everyone around him before deciding he was clean which he was blair still arrived early reflecting as he sat waiting on the bench that he hoped it had all been worth it and that something quite understandable hadnt kept orlov from the meeting again his luck held it was just before noon when he saw the russian picking his way along a side pathway towards the statue of the archer there had been another effort to dress unobtrusively this time orlov chose a bench of his own and blair still careful waited fifteen minutes past the appointed hour before moving to join the russian wanting to be completely sure he was alone is everything arranged asked orlov at once in his immediate anxiety i have had a long discussion with washington about everything said blair thinking what an understatement that was i have been told to pass on to you the guaranteed undertaking that you will be welcomed to my country and that we will do everything possible to get you safely there that we can get you safely there it sounded formal as if he were reading from a prepared speech and not quite the sort of assurance hed wanted to give anyway trying to improve it he said i am flying to america tonight to make all the arrangements orlov nodded his head that is good he said so it will be soon when i return i will have everything settled at the american end all that will have to be planned is your actual exit from moscow beside him orlov sighed in audible relief it will be so good when it is all over he said its only just starting for you thought blair momentarily sad for the man he said i wont be in washington long but i cant be definite well maintain this as a method of contact i understand said orlov he looked at the american and said harriet is not to be involved ive made that quite clear said blair would they have stayed away from the woman theyd probably avoid direct contact but he was damned sure shed be under the tightest sort of surveillance like establishing emergency desks it was something active that langley could do i want her to know but not yet said orlov its going to be a very unsettled time warned blair youll have to be careful orlov smiled a resigned expression ive been unsettled for a very long time he said and ive been careful well get you out as soon as possible said blair hed be able to make the evening connection it would be tight but he could make it you might need this said orlov not yet but later its harriets direct extension at the united nations thank you said blair accepting it naive he thought again by now the agency would know more about the girl than she knew herself he wondered what she looked like and thank you said the russian for everything youre doing it is as much for me as it is for you thought blair maybe even more he returned directly from the meeting to the embassy to alert langley that everything had gone as theyd hoped and that he was on his way back telephoning ann from there to say that something had come up and that he was making another trip to america he talked over her surprise emptily promising to explain when he got there what could he tell her thought blair during the drive to the apartment nothing officially he had to worsen the alreadystrained relationship between them use the easy excuse of his family again and make the amends and explanation later ann was redfaced when he entered the apartment the anger obvious youve only just come back she said picking up the telephone conversation i know i didnt expect it said blair but what is it paul again he said something about the sentence or is it ruth demanded the woman openly expressing her fear blair was at his desk turning out from his pockets things he didnt need on the journey he stopped turning to her face creased with puzzlement what i said is it ruth is that why youre hurrying back idiotic though her fears were blair realised he should have taken more care with the story despite his hurry he walked calmly back to her and put both hands on her shoulders looking directly at her that is stupid and you know it he said quietly refusing to let it develop into an argument i told you how things were between ruth and me i told you about the guy shes with and how i liked him and if you look at it sensibly youd realise that if i were going back to try and make up my first marriage to ruth which im definitely not that i wouldnt do it like this with panicked lastminute flights ive never lied to you and ive never cheated on you weve had a row and its gone on for a long time too long but if id thought our problems were as big as you seem to think they are then i would have talked them through with you i didnt run away from anything before when i fell in love with you and i wouldnt run away now her colour deepened and her lip trembled what is it with paul she said i wont know until i get back from her distress it was obvious she still wasnt completely sure it wont be as long this time as it was before he said how can you be sure if you dont know what the problem is he was being careless in his concern for her i just dont think it will be he said he owed her more blair thought just something more he felt out for her shoulders again i know its been difficult for you darling he said more difficult than i thought it was but everything is going to work out ok you see it isnt going to work out as bad as you were frightened it would i dont understand she said her lip had stopped trembling now and the colour was going you wont not yet trust me when just trust me you mean we wont be staying in moscow after all the hope was obvious in her face its vital that i catch a plane and im already late said blair knowing hed let the conversation go on too long already just believe me everything is going to work out fine blair ran to pack using it as an excuse to break away from her conscious of her standing in the door watching him thank god she didnt try to continue the discussion i love you he said brushing her cheek with a kiss on the way to the door i love you too she said brinkman knew he loved ann just as he knew that the embassy jealousy had been love and not covetousness but despite the feeling the readiness now to jump whenever she telephoned he would still have avoided going to the apartment if she hadnt disclosed blairs flight to washington not that he would achieve anything by remaining at the embassy for eight hours hed bent over his desk searching through the material that had been sent at his request from london trying to find a clue and reluctantly coming to the conclusion that no clue existed maxwell had been very thorough conceded brinkman not only had he sent the london file but all the material that had been available from orlovs period in new york it still didnt amount to much maybe a hundred sheets which by now he knew by heart and twenty photographs of orlov at the united nations mostly standard glassinhand reception stuff but some of him in the chamber taking part in debates so hed failed and blair was succeeding even further thought brinkman as he entered the apartment block why the sudden washington recall for the second time in just over a month this wasnt a competition any more he decided he was practically out of the race he was immediately aware of anns reserve as he entered the apartment a holding back when he went to kiss her what is it nothing i know theres something another row not really what then he said he loved me she said distantly he hasnt said that for a long time but he said it tonight as he left oh said brinkman emptily blair was winning in everything he thought ignoring the illogicality of it what happened ann shrugged as if she had difficulty in recalling everything was so rushed she said he called from the embassy to say he had to go back on the night plane threw some things into a bag and dashed off but stopped long enough to say that he loved you dont she said please dont i love you said brinkman it was the first admission the commitment hed held back from giving dont she said again desperately i told you once before we couldnt ignore it said brinkman you werent talking about love then i am now why dont you i dont want to ostriches in the sand he said another reminder im so confused said ann completely confused do you love me demanded brinkman determined she should make the commitment now i dont know do you love me he insisted yes i suppose so what about eddie thats it she said pleadingly i love him too you cant love two people at the same time who says she asked a demand of her own where are the rules that everyone obeys that say you cant love two people youre going to have to make a choice i dont want to she said im frightened should he tell her what hed already concluded that orlov was blairs source and that blair would stay in moscow until hell froze over he wasnt so certain of that not any more there was definitely a link but he wasnt sure hed interpreted it correctly whys eddie gone back so unexpectedly he said it was something to do with paul there wasnt this panic last time no she said heavily i know conscious of the tone brinkman said what do you think it is i told him i thought it was ruth what about ruth he said momentarily not understanding wouldnt the affair with paul have brought them together again there still wouldnt have been this panic thats what he said what did he say not much said ann burst in like i told you emptied his pockets on the desk she gestured over his shoulder packed a case and went off to the airport but he told you he loved you there was a kind of a row ann confessed when i said i thought he was going back to see ruth he said i was stupid and that everything was going to work out that things wouldnt be as bad as i thought they were going to be brinkman tried to curb any reaction and knew he succeeded because ann appeared in some sort of reverie what did he mean by that that things wouldnt be as bad as you thought they were going to be he wouldnt say i even asked if it meant he wouldnt have to stay here in moscow but he wouldnt say brinkman risked looking over his shoulder the desk top was still jumbled which was unusual in an apartment as reasonably kept as this he stood with accustomed familiarity in her home and said do you want a drink not really neither did brinkman but the drinks tray was next to the desk he made the pretence of examining the selection lifting and putting down bottles looking back to see if she were paying any particular attention which she wasnt he poured scotch but put the glass back not on the tray but alongside on the desk jostling what lay there he turned back to her his body screening her from what he was doing spreading what blair had left further so that it would only take one look you sure he said maybe vodka then he turned back glad of the extra few seconds looking not at the drinks but sideways on the desk there were some official government passes the sort they all carried for use within moscow and some small change blair clearly felt he wouldnt need and a single sheet of paper half hidden by a car parking permit brinkman shifted the permit making to pick up his own glass there was only a single printed line unxt brinkman carried the drinks back and said cheers and she smiled back at him a sad expression how long is he going to be away i dont know not as long as last time he said at least thatll make some things easier he said she smiled sad again not tonight darling why not i just dont want to i see dont darling how do you expect me to feel how do you expect me to feel im the one who has to choose eventually did blairs remark mean he was getting out of moscow on time or even quicker if it did it would mean ann would go with him unless she chose ok he said not tonight it would be wrong to push her thank you she said how about tomorrow night well see aware of his wince she said well talk tomorrow well try to make it tomorrow night brinkman went angrily from the apartment his first inclination was to go to his own place but then he changed his mind driving back to the embassy and shutting himself again in his room gazing down at the pictures of orlov he wasnt going to lose he determined wouldnt lose he smiled suddenly looking down at the top photograph it couldnt be as easy as that as simple but why not hed spent hours trying to evolve convoluted scenarios and it could all be childishly ridiculously easy he prefaced the lengthy cable to maxwell with the assurance that he would not be making the request unless he considered what he was asking for to be absolutely essential and absolutely urgent before he encoded it brinkman stared again at the message deciding that the queries looked like some rather complicated crossword puzzle which he supposed was exactly what they were ruth was embarrassed seeking reassurance now so i overreacted then no mrs blair said kemp at once ok so this time it seems that paul was telling the truth the urinalysis is clear and the other boys we finally located said all they did was talk i dont know why he didnt tell you himself who they were three were from the same programme they just hung around outside for a while the point is that he could have been doing something stupid and the most important thing is that he knows now how youd react if he were its taught him a lesson its not going to be easy is it said ruth wearily i never thought it would be mrs blair said the counsellor this time the inadequate surveillance was reported and it arrived on sokols desk within two hours of the notification from sheremetyevo of blairs abrupt and second departure to washington sokol recognised at once he had stumbled across an operation the efforts to which blair went to slip any cover indicated that and so did the return to america sokol further decided that because of the crass incompetence of men specifically assigned to watch the american an instruction which should have alerted them to its importance he was way behind in trying to discover what it was to find out he thought might give him the long soughtafter coup to fail might mean a disaster sufficient to bring him down like the receding famine almost had he summoned the watch squad from the airport for congratulation and a personal briefing on the importance of identifying blairs return and issued arrest and disciplinary hearing orders against the idiots around blairs apartment and the us embassy who had failed mistakes had to stop sokol realised chapter twentysix hubble came personally to the airport to meet him customs clearance was arranged so they bypassed the formalities and were in the limousine within fifteen minutes of blair emerging from the aircraft the division chief waited until they were in the security of the vehicle with the dividing partition raised to separate them from the driver and his escort and said youve done it eddie the jackpot every bell is ringing blair was suffering his customary fatigue and found hubbles enthusiasm difficult he wondered if the man talked like that all the time he said weve got to get him across first were not going to let this one go buddy believe me were not blair did believe him from the reaction so far he looked out at the beltway remembering his initial difficulty last time with all the cars hed have to call ruth when he got the opportunity hed remembered a gift in amsterdam the same sort of perfume hed bought ann hed been undecided about the boys and copied the homeward journey again buying them both watches the heavy calibrated sort that divers were supposed to wear theyd be surprised to have him home again so soon he said whats been set up here everything assured hubble all the details can wait until we get to langley but believe me there isnt anything that hasnt been thought of the man paused and blair waited for the announcement guess whos going to chair this afternoons meeting it was obvious but blair gave the man the moment he wanted who he said the director himself blair thought hubble would have enjoyed the announcement having some sort of band accompaniment jackpot like you said despite it being an official agency car with a recognisable division chief as a passenger they still had to go through the formal security procedures once inside the main building hubble took over the role as guide when they entered the elevator he pressed the button for the seventh floor and blair guessed there had been some arrangement to advise the director of their arrival he was crumpled and stubblechinned again and wished hed had the opportunity to clean up the directors office was a lavish suite personally designed by allen dulles but never occupied by him because he was fired as director by president kennedy after the bay of pigs disaster i hope this isnt a disaster thought blair entering behind his immediate superior rupert perelmen was a tall domeheaded man wearing rimless spectacles and a suit as crumpled as blairs he looked precisely the academic he had been until his appointment as director by a president who decided the agency needed a political scientist as its head the man got up as they entered coming forward with his hand outstretched to greet blair and personally to guide him to a chair when perelmen returned to his own seat he beamed professorially and said well done very well done indeed blair thought it sounded like hed got good marks in an examination which perhaps he had he was aware of the continued sense of overenthusiasm he said its got a long way to go yet sir i know i know said perelmen but im confident weve already made a lot of contingency plans now id like you to run through it for me right from the start theyd already had it in at least four variations thought blair obediently he recounted the events from the time of orlovs approach at the reception to their first meeting and then the previous nights encounter at the ferry head no demands at all intruded hubble only about the woman said blair what about her the director raised his hand reassuringly exactly what he wanted no approach whatsoever shes on a lead of course elaborated hubble roundtheclock watch cover on everything she does she doesnt know how safe she is he doesnt want her to know reminded blair theyre not amateurs said hubble as if imagining criticism would orlov run if he found out asked perelmen i dont know admitted blair at once i dont know why its something hes so adamant about when does he want her involved asked hubble he hasnt made that clear not properly he just talked about when everything is arranged maybe when we actually have him on the move my guess is hes frightened something will happen to her before they get together it wouldnt if she were under our protection said perelmen ill make the point promised blair you imagine he doesnt want to talk to us not completely i dont imagine he said i know lets not worry about that now dismissed perelmen hurriedly lets get him here first everything else will unfold naturally enough poor bastard thought blair he said we havent discussed at all how to get him out itll have to be during some overseas visit to be safe can he fix that hes got the authority said blair i didnt raise it until i had the opportunity to talk to you here wanted to know the countries in which we were best placed europe obviously said perelmen anywhere really although england and germany would be best weve a lot of secure airbases in germany if its got to be anywhere in eastern europe then ok but itll be more difficult too many things can go wrong trying a border crossing like that blair supposed perelmen would have met the traditional opposition within the agency from professionals having an amateur put in control over them he seemed to have adjusted very well he said how much warning would you need weve expanded the emergency desk in the watch room said the director we established a complete contingency unit specifically for orlovs crossing ive already moved twenty men into europe germany like i said thats where were best placed if theres a choice every sort of necessary transportation too well only need hours if we can make it an overseas visit well have days said blair he hesitated and then said what if we cant fix something that will officially get him across the border then its action man stuff said hubble and youll really be earning your salary the favourite would be to try for the finnish border and cross there christ hubble irritated him thought blair action man he said it wont be easy crossing the distance to finland unless we could get aboard an aircraft in some way itll take two days to get there maybe more and at the first hint that orlov had made a run for it theyd try to seal that country like a drum id risk a crossing to come in to get you disclosed perelmen not to moscow of course as far into karelia as we could get that would require a pickup coordinate i couldnt give any guarantee to make on time then wed keep crossing until you did said hubble well ship homing devices and the sort of radios youll need in the diplomatic pouch thats part of the contingency blair hoped there would be some other way he said what about here everythings set assured the director weve got three safe houses two in maryland and one in virginia well use them all of course but he can make his choice tell him that after weve talked things out hell be given a completely new identity social security number bank account stuff like that and a government pension that we can negotiate when he gets here after weve talked things out reflected blair he wondered if it would be as obvious to orlov as it was to him that the promised pension depended upon how much he was prepared to talk things out if they debriefed the russian as extensively as blair guessed orlov would be a whitehaired old guy of pensionable age anyway ill set it out blair promised and a house of course added perelmen in an afterthought how long do you want me to stay theres no scheduled contact for another week even if hes able to make that this is just a preliminary meeting said perelmen chance for me to express my personal thanks tomorrow i want you to go through everything with the leaders of the groups weve established see whether you can think of anything else sure said blair it meant the weekend at least with the kids and ruth and eddie christian name terms realised blair yes sir i was impressed before reminded the director everything said then stands now doubly so did i or did i not say jackpot demanded hubble as they walked along the corridor outside the directors office hubble was the sort of talking doll you actually got for winning a jackpot thought blair it was a race again decided brinkman exultantly and now he knew what the medal was he was going to win it it was still interpretation of course but then everything in moscow was interpretation he gazed down tiredeyed at the second batch of material hed requested from london comparing it with the first he knew he was right whats more he knew how he could prove it it meant expecting maxwell and maybe someone higher bending the rules but when they realised what the prize was he expected them to do so he sent the requests and waited for the predictable query assuring maxwell it was essential he return personally to london anticipating the initial response he kept the name for the second message but had he not already established the sort of reputation he had brinkman doubted permission would have been given going away said ann just a quick trip where london she closed her eyes in envy opening them again she said how long for not more than a few days quick like i said blair had more than a head started so everything was going to have to be quick ill miss you she said will you said brinkman eagerly you know i will itll give you time to think he said about what i want you to make the choice darling i want you to choose between eddie and me im saying i want to marry you no she said yes said brinkman while were both away itll give you time to make up your mind brinkman didnt want to win just part of it he wanted to win it all thats what hed always wanted and always intended to get why didnt you call from moscow said ruth there wasnt time everything was too quick its good to see you again and you the boys will be glad delighted in fact hows paul making out ruth told him about the scare and how shed reacted and blairs reaction was the same as the counsellors which relieved her kemp and the school principal were keeping a close eye on his grades and they hadnt dropped and as part of the programme shed joined a parents group there was a meeting the following night ill come too announced blair she hesitated charlie said hed come with me cant we all go ruth hesitated further wont it look a bit unusual if you dont want me oh no she stopped him maybe ill ask charlie not to bother we should not use him as a stopgap said blair ill talk to him about it she said the greeting from the boys this time was different from the earlier visit john ran at blair and threw himself into his fathers arms and although he didnt run paul allowed himself to be picked up as well blair had to put them down quickly because together they were heavy he gave them their gifts and both children strapped them on their delight obvious is this really what proper divers wear dad asked john all the time assured blair its terrific having you back home said paul its terrific to be home said blair brinkman was on the watch list and the encouraged and congratulated surveillance squad at the airport responded the moment that the englishman was identified boarding the londonbound plane there was a telephone alert upon which sokol now insisted in advance of the report and the photographs sokol studied the dossier comparing photographs of the other passengers against the names and agreeing with the airport assessment that brinkmans departure was not connected with anybody else on the same flight so why should the american intelligence resident whom he regarded as one of the if not the best operators in moscow leave just ahead of the british intelligence resident whom he regarded as a close second in ability coincidence not to be discounted but unlikely decided sokol a joint operation another possibility conceded the kgb deputy certainly it had happened before but rarely and theyd been successful over the last few years actually publicising their infiltration of the british service to sow distrust in any cooperation with america so the conclusion was that there could be not one but two separate operations being run at the same time sokol was a selfconfident man sure of his ability despite which he felt a sink of despair and it took a long time for his normal attitude to predominate and even then it wasnt a complete recovery chapter twentyseven brinkman was disappointed actually worried that maxwell didnt appear to share his convictions the division chiefs office was in the inner quadrangle away from any traffic it was possible to hear the ticking of the antique clock on the mantleshelf and maxwells sighed uncertainty as he looked down at the evidence brinkman placed before him its very circumstantial judged maxwell no disputed brinkman risking the impertinence of coming around to the side of the desk to argue his case orlov has returned within months from the united nations in new york he isolated three of the pictures that had been airfreighted to him in moscow each showing orlov at un receptions at the united states embassy i positively saw orlov make an approach to the cia resident edward blair im quite definite about it blair has made two visits to washington hes there now and this time it was a panicked recall on his desk was this brinkman paused again producing a piece of paper upon which hed written unxt you know from the checks that i asked you to make that extension at the united nations is the direct line to a woman called harriet johnson a britishborn senior translator there was another break while brinkman selected two photographs of harriet that had been sent with the second batch of material harriet johnson he identified unnecessarily dramatic one was a posed fullfaced picture taken for her official accreditation there was another obviously at a un party and a third of her at the point of leaving the skyscraper building brinkman made another selection placing the picures of the girl by herself against two of orlov both at un receptions pietr orlov went on brinkman still dramatic he moved his finger to someone in the immediate background of both prints harriet johnson he said i dont dispute its the woman said maxwell so harriet johnson attended un functions and was photographed with a senior soviet official russian is her predominant language we know that from the files what is the private extension of a senior soviet translator doing on the desk of a cia resident in moscow said brinkman how did you get that brinkman hesitated im a friend he said i went to the apartment the night blair left within an hour or two he left something like that on the desk of his apartment brinkman paused again remembering anns account of the row remembering too the part of it she recalled best he said he laved me brinkman said there was a lot of panic some personal confusion too i think there must have been said maxwell he looked back to the display before him so what is it in your opinion i dont know not definitely conceded brinkman at the moment i think its a defection maxwell frowned up someone of orlovs rank which was why i judged it important enough to come back here personally said brinkman maxwell was moving he guessed very slightly but moving maxwell opened the tub on his desk lighted the cigarette and coughed so what do you want to do about it he asked directly make him come to us instead said brinkman just as direct a smile vaguely patronising touched maxwells mouth just like that he said no not just like that said brinkman irritated at his superior i think i could make it happen how brinkman told him setting out the proposal he had carefully formulated on the flight from moscow intent upon maxwells facial reaction there was none when he finished maxwell who had served at the embassy in washington before his promotion said do you know the american expression dirty pool no said brinkman loosely translated it means shitting on someone from a great height what youre planning is dirty pool im suggesting we get orlov for ourselves i know what youre suggesting said maxwell but why theres liaison between us and washington well get what orlov has to say in time if they get him across its a coup but if they make a mistake its an international incident whats wrong with letting america take the risk chairbound bloody beaurocrat interested only in lunches at the club and whether his pension was indexlinked thought brinkman the departure lecture about taking chances hadnt anything to do with his safety maxwell was only interested in his own back as forcefully as he dared he said we wont get what orlov has to say well get what washington condescends to let us have sanitised and packaged like processed cheese and about as tasteless and i agree in time their time which will be years from now when any usefulness will have long gone why must we wait around all the time cap in hand grateful for american handouts whats wrong with their coming to us for a change instead of answering maxwell persisted what about the risk fuck the man thought brinkman he wouldnt be blocked he said my father says repeatedly that knowing when to take risks in diplomacy intelligent risks is a finer part of the art maxwell stubbed out his cigarette the force with which he did it his only reaction to the threat youd be appallingly exposed he said in new york and in moscow i know the difficulties assured brinkman what if youre wrong about orlov and the girl said maxwell then ill realise that in new york where ill do nothing more harmful than make a fool of myself and any danger in moscow wont exist any more said brinkman the argument prepared be careful said maxwell predictably be very careful indeed brinkman went directly from his meeting with maxwell to the airport with no reason for remaining any longer in london and anxious to close the gap between himself and blair as quickly as possible maxwell would take out insurance brinkman knew he couldnt guess what or how but the bloody man would evolve something to get himself as far back from the spray as possible if anything hit the fan maybe he wouldnt let the threat invoking his father remain as empty as he intended it to be it was a late flight from london but brinkman benefited from the time difference for his arrival in new york wanting to maximise that benefit he refused everything on the flight determined only upon sleeping the necessity of booking into an hotel was an irritating delay but he was still at the united nations building by eight in the evening the assembly was in session so harriet johnson was working split shifts according to the information hed already assembled that meant the woman had another two hours of duty he tried from the public gallery to detect her in the line of translation booths but the glass was smoked and he was too far away anyway he listened to a debate about third world starvation knowing it would not alleviate that starvation in the slightest and reflecting what a useless world forum it was he left the chamber with an hour to spare with more to find than the door through which she would emerge into the corridor there was a lot of movement in the passageway which offered him concealment but made more difficult finding those he guessed would already be in place because of blairs head start he guessed at a man in a fawn seersucker suit but wasnt sure about another in a blue sports jacket brinkman bought newsweek from a bookstand and managed to get a bench near a wall support which furthered his concealment if he were mistaken about the fawn seersucker and the sports jacket if she werent under some sort of protective surveillance then it could mean that he was completely wrong brinkman realised if she were still here at all if it was what he thought it was harriet johnson would already be under wraps the uncertainties irritated him nibbling away at his absolute conviction harriet johnson was the essential key the only key for everything to work out as he wanted it to if they already had her then everything changed to a dirtier pool than even maxwell suspected but they didnt have her harriet johnson emerged from the translation area at ten past ten a crisplysuited crisplymannered woman he recognised immediately from the photographs she paused to speak to an attendant and then set off in the direction of the elevators that would take her from the building not towards the secretariat offices to which he thought she might go first brinkman made no effort to follow at once waiting to see what would happen he was wrong about the fawn seersucker but right about the sports jacket there was also a man in a brown suit and a woman which he should have anticipated but hadnt brinkman allowed them to get expertly in position the man in the brown suit actually preceding harriet to enter the elevator ahead of her and guarantee cover at all times brinkman slotted himself comfortably behind them admiring their professionalism halfway along the corridor brown suit allowed himself to be overtaken and the woman took his place had he not been trained and then positively expecting it brinkman didnt think he would have isolated the surveillance he didnt try for the same elevator knowing they would register faces in such an enclosed area but caught one sufficiently quickly to reach ground level before she went through the revolving doors brinkman followed the followers at an easy pace did she have a car or would she take a taxi neither he saw surprised harriet johnson walked through the waiting vehicles and across the forecourt passing almost directly beneath the statue of a man supposedly beating a sword into a ploughshare presented to the united nations by the soviet union she went to the left to the break with fdr drive where it was easier to cross and brinkman realised further surprised that she intended to walk the four blocks to where she lived harriet johnson must be a very assured woman to walk four blocks in manhattan after ten oclock at night reflected brinkman with that reflection came another he wondered if the attacker would know what hit him if there were an attempt to mug her she wasnt entirely uncaring having crossed the difficult expanse of road right outside the united nations she backtracked to get to second avenue along the broad welllighted fortysecond street brinkman didnt turn immediately right as she did from practice but continued across to the sam goody side of the avenue keeping parallel but about ten yards behind the american surveillance was practically choreographed he thought admiringly they obviously hadnt been sure how she would travel as he hadnt been so there were several vehicles three at least that he identified although they didnt need them for a driven observation the americans still utilised them and cleverly too never keeping their people in the street around harriet for more than one block but chopping and changing with the car occupants they even bothered with the people ahead of him walking parallel like he was harriet johnsons apartment block was on second and fortysixth street a modern obviously new building from across the avenue brinkman watched easily able to see through the expansive clear glass as the woman went in smiled in recognition to the guard collected her mail from the deskman and then disappeared towards what had to be the elevators employing his own tradecraft brinkman went into a bar on the opposite corner the first requirement to get himself off the street with so much other surveillance in operation there was a table strip arranged directly beneath the window looking out over the apartment block and brinkman took his drink there standing with the glass held lightly between both hands gazing out towards it six sixtyseven he knew from the already obtained information it was easy enough to count up but with no way of knowing which way the numbering went from there it was impossible to isolate which of the lighted windows belonged to the woman the cia would have done so by now so why didnt they have her under open protection if not away from the un completely it was obvious from the homeward journey that she didnt have any idea of what had been going on all about her it didnt make sense there were cars lining either side of fortysixth but it was too far away and too dark for him to see how many were occupied there would be several he knew would they have managed to get an apartment within the building it would have been an obvious move if they intended to continue the cover they seemed to be employing now and putting their own people in as desk staff and installing a monitor on her telephone brinkman stopped mentally turning the pages of the manual blair was barely fortyeight hours ahead of him if the panicked return had been the beginning he flicked the pages back for another look the street cover was in place because hed seen it but that took little preparation not enough time to get themselves an apartment or install themselves as desk staff what about the telephone he wondered looking to where the bar booth was at the end by the restrooms it would have been quick but not impossible too uncertain to take the risk though he looked back across the road towards the apartment block hundreds of people lived there he thought hundreds they might try to identify one by one if they considered the operation important enough and if they had the time but they wouldnt have had the time yet the decision made brinkman left the bar and purposefully crossed the road not a stranger to the area but someone approaching his own home he thrust through the doors nodding to the guard but not slowing his momentum until he got to the desk and here he maintained the demeanour of confidence which would have confused anyone watching from outside this the housephone he said to the desk lifting the white receiver yes sir said the man the woman answered on the second ring i need to see you said brinkman without introduction its about pietr there was silence from the other end of the line then she said give me the deskman brinkman handed the guard the receiver the man smiled up putting it almost at once back on to the cradle she says youre to go up the surveillance had been confirmation that he was right decided brinkman going towards the elevators harriet johnsons reaction doubly confirmed it he was drawing level the contingency planning was far more extensive than blair envisaged overnight the director decided to send a special forces group on standby to one of the german bases from which within hours they could get to the finnish border if there had to be an incursion to get orlov out five unmarked cia helicopters large capacity chinooks were also sent on in advance flying with a boeing also unmarked which was planned to be the transport vehicle for orlovs eventual atlantic crossing to the united states however the man got out blair addressed the assembled group leaders selfconsciously standing in front of them like a teacher baton in hand identifying orlov from the hugely enlarged photographs that had been made there was renewed pressure from hubble to provide backup within the soviet union and blair conceded that an effort should be made if the crossover appeared to be taking longer than they expected which would enable the applications to be made for entry permission without attracting any special attention with the number of american diplomats permitted in moscow strictly limited by the russians it meant the director had to persuade the state department to surrender some of their allocation and blair wondered how successful perelmen would be he was away from langley in good time for the parents meeting at the drug programme blair couldnt see that the gathering achieved much practical benefit apart from showing die kids they had support which was he supposed the practical benefit intended and afterwards he gave them a choice and they went for the mexican cafe in the georgetown mall ruth put charlie rogers off and blair wished she hadnt both boys wore their watches and kept looking at them with the pride of new ownership can we really come to moscow dad said john thats a deal when demanded paul forcefully blair remembered the counsellors warning about breaking promises and thought how occupied he was going to be by what was happening in moscow he said well plan around the next long vacation and around pauls programme of course ill fix it with the counsellors the vacation was close not more than a few weeks so much could be changed in a few weeks he thought how often do you think youll be able to get back like this asked ruth i dont know admitted blair it would be wrong to make her any false promises like it would be with the boys will i see a spy in moscow said john who did not know what his father did maybe said blair chapter twentyeight by the time brinkman reached the apartment harriet had realised her stupidity she retained the door on its security chain staring out at him not just his face but how he was dressed as if she wanted to establish a complete image and keeping most of herself hidden behind the door itself what do you want she said i told you its about pietr he said i dont know what youre talking about she said pitifully too late why did you let me up then i misunderstood she said even more pitifully i know harriet said brinkman let me in so we can talk who are you brinkman anticipated the question he took easily from his pocket his accreditation and identification designating him a cultural attache at the british embassy passing it through the narrow gap to her she hesitated and took it reading not just the english but the russian as well she was extremely careful digesting it all she handed it back to him finally her throat working what do you want she repeated not like this said brinkman sure of himself not out here in the corridor there was a further hesitation and she slipped the chain holding the door open further brinkman nodded his thanks and went in it was a comparatively small apartment one main room with a bedroom annex an open kitchen area and beyond a door he presumed led to the bathroom it was on an actual corner of the building so there were windows on two sides but it was not high enough for the view to be truly impressive shed obviously been preparing a meal there was a table near the window halflaid and there were cooking sounds from the kitchen well she said hadnt you better turn off the things on the stove said brinkman weve got a lot to talk about stop being so damned condescending and tell me what it is you have to say she said in a sudden burst of anger as much at herself as at him he was sure absolutely convinced that he was right but at the moment of challenge brinkman momentarily held back just one miscalculation just one variance in the interpretation and he would be doing what he told maxwell in london making a fool of himself trying to allow himself the widest margin possible he said we know all about you and pietr orlov we know what happened here and we know what hes trying to do in moscow and we want to help harriet had been holding herself stiff defensively but suddenly she sagged not at this confrontation but as the tension of the past months went from her she actually put out her hand against a chair back for support from her photographs and from her appearance at the united nations brinkman had thought her quite a tall woman but now she didnt appear to be shed taken off the jacket of the suit she had been wearing just leaving the white blouse ruffled and laced at the neck her face was drained now but brinkman guessed she would never have a lot of colour the whiteness was accentuated by her hair which was deeply black she wore it strained back like ann had the night at the embassy when orlov had made his approach the stove he reminded youd better turn off the stove harriet straightened trying for her earlier forced demeanour appeared to consider what he said and then went to the kitchen as she came back she smiled and said im sorry for behaving like i did we thought we knew what it was going to be like but we didnt i didnt at least these last months have been hell i dont feel like ive been alive at all ive felt outside of myself watching a person called harriet johnson go through the motions of everyday life but not really being part of it brinkman smiled trying for the sympathy itll all be over soon he said he hadnt won yet he hadnt even drawn level but he was narrowing the gap every minute i thought he was going to go to the americans admitted harriet brinkman knew there was no way to disguise it to make it pleasant it had to be brutal and she had to hate him just like orlov would hate him it was something he had already accepted and that they were going to have to adjust to he said he did harriets smile flickered uncertainly like a faulty light and then went out she lowered herself into the chair against which she had earlier leaned for support and said shaking her head im sorry i dont understand pietr did go to the americans last week at an embassy reception i saw the photograph started harriet and then stopped but your documentation is british he finished for her whats happening she said please tell me whats happening pietr has gone to the americans to defect theyll be making plans to bring him across i know theyve withdrawn someone from their embassy in moscow said brinkman but we dont want pietr to go to america we want him to defect to britain harriet looked up at him warily with the beginning of suspicion youre not working with them youre not cooperating with the americans no said brinkman and we dont want pietr to continue doing so or you if any approach is made harriet jerked up more aware now faced flushed get out she said get out of my apartment you tricked your way in here get out brinkman made no attempt to move well match every offer the americans will make he promised you and pietr will be completely protected therell be accommodation and whatever money you want for as long as you want in time youll be set up with new identities new everything why she said unable to sustain the outburst the plea coming back into her voice why ive already told you said brinkman we want pietr no she said shaking her head more determinedly this time no not until ive had a chance to talk it over with pietr i wont do anything until i know what he wants that cant happen said brinkman isnt possible why not she demanded defiantly because if pietr doesnt come to us hes not going anywhere youre never going to see him again what you heard what i said no she said again holding her hands together before her as if she were praying no i dont believe it i dont believe any of this i dont know what you want or what youre doing but its some sort of trick it isnt harriet said brinkman evenly this is the way the only way that youll ever get pietr out of moscow our way she leaned forward determined to concentrate tell me what you mean she said tell me exactly what you mean one of the highest hurdles of them all thought brinkman youve a way to contact pietr he said her uncertainty was just a moment too long no she said i dont believe you pietr said it would be dangerous too dangerous that i had to trust him pity said brinkman why like i said if we cant have him no ones going to how can you stop it brinkman laughed at the innocence of her question by ensuring that the soviet authorities come to know whats happening before pietr has a chance to get out what erupted the woman you havent listened to me remonstrated brinkman ive already told you several times that if he doesnt come to the british he isnt going anywhere you wouldnt you prepared to take that chance said brinkman please dont because i would really i would motherfucker she shouted the worst abscenity she could find yes agreed brinkman unoffended his voice conversational but but i cant believe you i just cant believe that anyone would think her voice trailed as her mind blocked refusing the words to express her disgust i would said brinkman really i would now whats the way of contacting pietr harriet started to cry and brinkman sat back easily letting her she seemed suddenly aware of his calmly being there watching her and brought herself to a snuffling halt she blew her nose and scrubbed her hands across her eyes motherfucker she repeated brokenvoiced brinkman let her have the last moment of defiance the system he said whats the system she blew her nose a second time composing herself pietr knew he was going back to a favoured position she began haltingly i dont think he anticipated what would happen he never said so and i know he would have done but he expected the privileges he was allowed some here one was books he was allowed to keep a book account here through the un service and to let it stay open when he went back to moscow if there were an emergency but only the most extreme emergency i was to get myself a book it didnt matter what because if he hadnt ordered it himself hed know it was from me and go through my own copy picking out letters in the third chapter that spelled out what i wanted to say under the letters i had to put a tiny pinprick when the book reached him hed search the third chapter and pick out the message not brilliant but not bad either conceded brinkman he said how could you get the marked book back into the un system it had to be one with several copies in the bookshop there she explained having made my message i had to go back and switch take an unmarked one for myself for which id have the purchase ticket anyway and personally hand the marked copy to the desk clerk and tell her it had to be charged to pietr orlovs account send him a book tomorrow ordered brinkman he wished there were something more guaranteed saying what it was a good question and he hadnt worked it out realised brinkman for safety it had to be kept to the minimum just a meeting then knowing it was from harriet orlov would make a meeting and if the kgb intercepted it theyd keep it too as maxwell said the risk was appalling have you a paper and pen he said while she fetched it brinkman tried to think of a meeting place it had to be somewhere public with as many people as possible a place where orlov could explainably be if he were seen himself too he smiled when it came to him appropriate too the bolshoi was one of his favourite places after all when harriet returned he printed out the name in block capitals then paused the place what about the date and time a date was impossible because he didnt know how long it would take the book to reach the russian every tuesday he wrote then seventhirty north entrance anything else he looked up at the woman and said only in an emergency that was the arrangement she said ive never used it to the message brinkman added urgent orlov would come if he got it brinkman decided it was still uncertain too uncertain there was no other way he said no said the woman what about harriet thought brinkman was there any need to get her out of new york not really orlov was the one who mattered if they got him arrangements for a reunion could be made anywhere anywhen suddenly for her to disappear would only alarm the cia and cause unnecessary ripples what if the agency changed the operation and made a direct approach and she told them a gamble brinkman recognised he said you want to see pietr again thats a ridiculous question then do what ive told you and well get him out and hell be with you for good but try anything else adding something extra to the message for instance or imagining some protection if you make a direct approach to the americans and i guarantee i absolutely guarantee that youll never see him again brinkman didnt enjoy the bullying but decided it was necessary in front of him the womans lip quivered briefly but she managed to hold back from actually breaking down what happens when he gets out she said well put you together said brinkman ive promised you that i meant about pietr do you imagine hell cooperate with you and thats why youre doing all this i know in the hope that hell cooperate after what youve done brinkman smiled sympathetically at her attempted threat of course he will he said dont be a bloody fool she said dont you be a bloody fool harriet the houses in which youll live for the rest of your lives and the money youll have and the protection youll have will all depend on the degree of cooperation that pietr provides you should know what the russians are like how long do you think hed survive youd survive if your whereabouts became known and there was no protection harriet looked at him eyes bulged with a combination of astonishment and horror you are she said as if she still couldnt believe it you are an absolute fucking bastard dont let me have to prove just how much of one said brinkman the strain was showing and because he was aware of it orlov became further unsettled discourteous to secretaries and chauffeurs which hed never been before and unnecessarily critical to assistants and aides blaming them for his own oversights and mistakes habits had grown within habits for his regular meetings with sevin determined that the agricultural policy paper should be the document firmly to establish orlovs ascendancy sevin had initiated the practice of orlov taking for their nightly encounters draft pages for the old man to criticise and improve until he was entirely satisfied with them orlov was conscious of an attitude as soon as he entered sevins quarters the old man remained as his desk which he normally left for the more comfortable conference area near the window as he approached orlov saw the last ten pages he had presented spread out in front of the other man heavily annotated with margin notes and corrections what is it pietr i dont understand the question the document began so well clear and concise honestly confronting the stupidity of a system of insisting upon norms from antiquated methods and machinery without a sensible decision to suffer for two years while everything is reequipped and more land put over for private peasant cultivation weve talked it through night after night sevin gestured disparagingly to the sheets before him this is terrible pietr your arguments ramble and are inconclusive in at least three instances i have found your figures demonstrably wrong what is supposed to be a treatise that will revolutionise soviet agriculture is lapsing into the sort of meaningless polemic weve had and suffered from for the last fifty years im sorry said orlov humbly so am i said sevin deeply sorry this isnt going to establish a reputation for you its going to destroy one sevin left unsaid that it could destroy him too what the hell was wrong with the man ill rework it dont rework it refused sevin scrap it and start again which is what weve got to do with our agriculture all right agreed orlov so what is it prompted the old man again is there a problem orlov searched desperately for an excuse hating himself for it when it came the divorce he said its amicable to a degree but its always upsetting you said so yourself upsetting thought sevin but not to this degree and if it were true what sort of leader would orlov make if a simple thing like a divorce anyway so distressed the man had he missed something worried sevin if he had then it was too late his sponsorship was known now to those who mattered it was impossible to withdraw without losing his position of influence on the politburo and that was all sevin lived for any more he said urgently the marriage is over accept it put it behind you and start concentrating upon the important thing your future thats what i am thinking of said orlov my future chapter twentynine anns affair with jeremy brinkman created claustrophobia within claustrophobia she hadnt felt able to breathe or think or move so he had been right about his absence giving her time to think shed accustomed if not adjusted to the greater claustrophobia moscow but without jeremy and without eddie the tighter feeling had gone shed been able to examine things everything calmly and clearly she thought she did love both if that wasnt usual then it wasnt usual but for her it was possible and real love not dependence upon eddie and the excitement of the illicit with jeremy so it came down to whom she loved better which it always had she supposed shed been wrong so very wrong treating eddie as she had he should have discussed staying on she did deserve that but shed been unjustified raging as she had remorse for what else was happening and she deserved to feel remorseful he was kind and gentle and he did love her like hed said just before he left for washington and she believed hed never cheated on her and never told her a lie not an important matteringbetweenthem sort of lie it served her right after the way shed been behaving if he were being drawn back to ruth had she tried hard enough with moscow she thought she had she didnt know what else she could have done but she wasnt completely sure maybe what she hadnt done was talk it through enough with eddie she thought hed known but he clearly hadnt if shed talked it out with him then maybe he wouldnt have made the commitment in washington last time but he had and now she had to live with it or did she hed told her she didnt have to which had frightened her she admitted the thought of being alone frightened her and the toldyouitwouldntwork attitude of her family frightened her like her love for jeremy frightened her if only he hadnt come to moscow in the first place and hadnt been so much fun and been to cambridge like she had and known the city like she did and liked ballet like she did and that night they hadnt ann halted the torrent confronting the effort to avoid the responsibility he had come to moscow and he had done all those things and they had done all those things and now she loved him too did he love her like he said he did she had no way of knowing he was funnier than eddie even when eddie was trying which he didnt very often any more and more comfortable at dinner parties and wonderful in bed but if she were comparing which was what she had to do surely she felt that jeremy was the harder of the two ann tried to make the equation a different way given the choice between her and his career which would jeremy choose as she posed the question she realised she already knew how eddie would choose and then decided that wasnt fair he hadnt completely known jeremy did ann suspected it would still be the career for jeremy but wasnt that how it should be no or maybe yes she didnt know dear god she thought desperately why did every hopeful answer produce two more unanswerable questions maybe alone in moscow with eddie would help resolve everything she was glad he was coming back today and she was glad jeremy was still away so there wouldnt be any pressure maybe shed have the chance to show eddie she was sorry and hed be able to tell her what hed meant by that strange conversation the evening he left she made an effort for blairs homecoming the apartment never needed much preparation but she arranged fresh flowers and set the meal after his airport call so it was ready by the time he arrived she kissed him trying to show him how she felt and said shed missed him which she had he kissed her back and said hed missed her too which in truth he hadnt because he had been too busy having brought her so much returning from the last trip he had not been able to think of anything better than an assortment of the sort of chocolates which were unavailable in moscow and she was delighted and said they were super when they sat down to eat she said so how was paul ok said blair prepared during the homeward flight he started getting careless staying out so that his mother didnt know where he was and so she asked the counsellors for help there was a thought that hed have to go back before the court but we managed to scare him against doing it again practically all true and it sounded better than last time he thought eddie what what did you mean the night you went away about things not being as bad as i thought they were blair had guessed shed come back to it christ she must hate moscow the leaderships settled he said prepared for this too chebrakins in charge and all the indications are that hes a strong man wholl make changes and stay there i talked things through this time and everyone agreed with me my agreement to stay on stands if necessary but the fresh thought is that we wont have to that well leave on time anns face was set in her disappointment by herself able to fantasise and conjecture shed imagined something far more positive so we could still stay blair shook his head wishing he could give her more but knowing hed given her too much already i told you theres been a change of mind and could be again stop it she told herself i dont think there will be he said trying to sound as convincing as possible knowing the downward spiral of the subject and wanting to change it he said what happened while i was away jeremys gone back to london blair looked intently up from his food frowning recalled she nodded when asked blair day or two after you went to washington she said carelessly did he say why it was a too eager question he knew but the man might have said something not a thing said the woman just that it was going to be a quick trip but hes not back yet not as far as i know she hesitated smiling betty harrison hasnt reported in so i guess he hasnt not much of a quick trip then no said ann thank god she thought what had she decided really decided nothing she realised she said its good to have you home she paused and added im sorry about what he said knowing but guessing shed rehearsed the apology and wanting to give her the opportunity being such a bitch i know i have been and im really sorry lets forget it he said can you forget it for you i can do most things he said that night they made love better than it had been for a long time anns passion a part of her saying sorry she made more demands than she knew she should have done considering his tiredness after the flight and could have gone on but finally she let him sleep which he did heavily she lay awake beside him wet from his wetness knowing that she loved him please she thought refusing to confront reality again please let jeremy brinkman never come back to moscow the pickup and the surveillance from sheremetyevo was smooth and efficient sokol was informed by one of the following radio cars into the capital so he was able to build up the ground force around the foreigners enclave in advance of blairs actual arrival which was twice radioed into dzerzhinsky square once from the pursuit car and again from the transmission vehicle already in place and anxious to prove itself news had already filtered through of what had happened to the others that failed sokol sat contentedly gazing down at the proof of his personally devised observation a spider assured that all the flies would settle where he wanted to be trapped chapter thirty and still blair beat the surveillance because that was how good he was he emerged on to chaykovskovo on foot in apparent determination imagining he located two cars in addition to the usual embassy observation but not being absolutely sure and uncaring because it wasnt necessary for him to bother he made his way towards the inevitable red square and actually stopped to watch the perpetual line of visitors patiently queuing to view the supposed mummified remains of lenin went in one door of gum and straight out of another and caught the first taxi that stopped back to the embassy his passage through the building was as quick as it had been through the department store observedly in through one of the front entrances directly through to the back which had already been cleared of any imposed soviet cleaning staff and into the rear of a waiting car driven by one of the ciacleared secretaries blair lay prostrated covered by his own topcoat and then a blanket and actually emerged through the gates again while the accounts of his safe and unencountered return were being radioed to sokol in dzerzhinsky square blair remained crouched for almost a mile ignoring the first encouragement from the driver that it was all right to get up finally leaving the vehicle near pushkinskaya metro still careful he went three times through the ritual of route disembarkation and reboarding despite the precautions blair permitted himself more than sufficient time and reached krasnaya early taking that days issue of pravda and settling himself on a different bench than before hoping that he was unobtrusive and would merge into the surroundings of the park there was no assurance that orlov would be able to make the meeting which was why theyd made the elastic arrangements they had but the american knew that if he had to report a nonappearance to langley theyd fall out of their tree in the intervening two days since his return from washington the unanswerable queries and messages had been pointlessly irritating hed expected them to have more control than they were showing and guessed he was the shuttlecock in the game of headquarters politics he wondered what plans were being made in washington plans he had no need to know to gain the maximum advantage out of orlovs defection thered been someone of orlovs ambassadorial rank to defect once but never someone actually on the central committee theyd drain the defection and the man until there was nothing else to get blair hoped harriet johnson was worth it blair saw the russian coming although he gave no reaction detecting just the slightest sign of increased confidence as if orlov were becoming accustomed to the subterfuge it was right that the man shouldnt be quite so nervous but blair hoped his emotions didnt swing too far the other way into overconfidence orlov seated himself and started to read from the same newspaper blair realised at once that it looked obvious and closed and folded his own edition is everything arranged demanded orlov always the first edgy question yes assured blair perhaps the man was still as nervous after all when how the american set out the contingencies in detail wanting to impress orlov with the importance they attached to his defection and the care they were taking to ensure it would succeed i do not like the idea of trying to make a crossing into finland said orlov at once neither do we said blair its a fall back if it cant be done any other way to form part of an overseas delegation would be best agreed orlov is it possible for you to arrange i dont know admitted the russian it would have to be done carefully not hurried so it would mean a greater delay than i wanted surely the important thing is to make the crossing safely said blair we dont gain anything by trying to hurry and risking interception blair was conscious of the other man physically shuddering beside him at the prospect of arrest yes said orlov the important thing is safety so you will try to get on to an overseas delegation yes said orlov sensing the doubt in the russians voice blair said if it looks difficult remembering langleys anxiety he added or that it will take too long then maybe we should consider a border incursion that would be extremely dangerous wouldnt it yes replied blair honestly it must be a delegation said orlov more to himself than to the american he looked briefly sideways and said nothing has been done to involve harriet blair was glad it was orlov who raised the subject of the girl he said no were doing exactly as you asked but why tell me why you are so adamant against our putting her under some of kind of protection at the end towards the very end i suspected i was under some sort of surveillance that our relationship had become known orlov looked quickly sideways again you know how the soviet delegations are watched of course yes he said i know how theyre watched shit he thought why hadnt the damned man told him this before but then why hadnt he asked if they did suspect and harriet were unaccountably to disappear from where she should be i might be put under surveillance here so nothing would work automatically blair gazed around the midday park he said if there had been any reason to doubt you then you would not have got the promotion would you i try to convince myself by the same reasoning said orlov as i said i only suspected once a strange conversation with a man whom i knew to be kgb maybe it was nothing i just dont want to take the slightest chance his own people would have detected any soviet surveillance on the woman blair thought in attempted reassurance and would the soviets have considered it necessary anyway with orlov back in moscow it created an added uncertainty definitely one about which langley should be warned it would make the temperature go up a few more degrees he thought he said there isnt a risk weve made no approach to the woman what happens now asked orlov seeking guidance that depends upon you said blair you must try to get on a delegation orlov nodded as if reminded we will keep these meetings yes said blair theyd have to change the venue soon but he decided krasnaya was still safe for the moment ill risk finland if it looks like taking too long i dont think i can go on for a lengthy period confessed orlov blair looked worriedly at the russian aware for the first time of the strain etched into the mans face he might outwardly appear confident but it was eggshell thin blair decided dont worry he said trying to placate orlov its all going to work finland wont be as easy as a delegation but theres a huge backup well get you out i so much want that said orlov distantly i so much want to get out when orlov returned to his office that afternoon the consignment of books he was allowed from the west as part of his privileges were unpacked and neatly arranged on a side table beside his main desk there was one he hadnt ordered chapter thirtyone in his belated excitement maxwell talked too fast and was uncoordinated and smoked haphazardly once remembered brinkman hed liked and admired the man it was difficult now fantastic enthused maxwell absolutely fantastic i knew it was going to work asshole thought brinkman he hadnt done all that he had and got this far to have an asshole like maxwell take the credit and hed make bloody sure it didnt happen he said nothings worked yet hes still got to make contact and weve still got to get him across theres a lot to be done agreed maxwell youll need help not in moscow refused brinkman at once the accolades were going to be all his there unshared by anyone he wondered if blair had been put under the same sort of pressure he argued against an attempt to get more people into russia ironically using the same reasoning as blair but maxwell wasnt so easily dissuaded it may be necessary the deskman insisted well start the formalities as a precaution if the need arises well be in a position to move he couldnt dispute the commonsense of that brinkman realised he said ill want full backup outside ill see to it assured maxwell and ensure that he would be seen by everyone to have provided it thought brinkman he said what depends how it goes between you and orlov pointed out maxwell sas snatch squads i would have thought full logistical support ill do a complete memorandum to the director today hell probably want to raise it before the security committee maybe the cabinet do you want me to stay asked brinkman maxwells name would be on every damned thing he knew initiator planner organiser and genius bloody asshole no no said maxwell quickly the message might be quite quick in reaching orlov its one of the uncertainties i want you back there as soon as possible tonight i was thinking of seeing my father said brinkman the reminder might curb some of the other mans extravagant claims no time for social gatherings come on jeremy dont you realise how important this is if he hadnt witnessed it himself brinkman thought he would have had difficulty believing the transformation in the other mans attitudes all right he said hed made no plans to see the old man maxwell had smiled a lot in anticipation but now he became seriousfaced youre going to be at the sharp end all the time he warned well do everything we can of course but it all depends on you the division chief paused for the familiar injunction so be careful be very very careful dont forget what i said before if anything goes wrong weve got a major international incident maybe maxwell wouldnt try to take everything for himself not at this stage anyway brinkman guessed the man would lay the groundwork for later glory but involve him too in case there were the need to apportion blame i understand he said get back there jeremy said maxwell like the rugby cheerleader brinkman suspected him of being on a saturday afternoon get back there and make it work for all of us maxwell wasnt a serious threat brinkman reasoned on the flight back to moscow hed try for that glory of course although taking out the necessary protection but he wouldnt be able to disguise who made it work like maxwell himself said there was only going to be one man at the sharp end taking all the risks jeremy brinkman and everyone the important ones at least would recognise that soon enough maybe better to let maxwell make the effort laying out sufficient rope with which to hang himself he wouldnt be able to remain in moscow so why not head of the russian desk hed proved himself able a dozen times over getting orlov out would be the culmination and confirmation of brilliant soviet expertise he hadnt imagined headquarters quite so soon traditionally he was much too young but what else was there washington was a recognised stepping stone but he certainly wouldnt be acceptable there if it all worked out and there was nowhere else that particularly attracted him anywhere else would be marking time and brinkman had never had any intention of marking time and washington might be unacceptable for other reasons he thought ann had been given enough time to decide and brinkman knew she loved him as much as he loved her consciously brinkman stemmed the growing belief remembering her agonised outburst about loving them both brinkman was sure she no longer loved eddie blair what she felt for blair was a mixture of loyalty and kindness and dependence and a reluctance too to break everything apart having gone through the traumatic divorce but not love brinkman knew how to tilt the balance to make her reach the right decision when he got orlov out of russia the leadership after chebrakin became the biggest guessing game in town blair would be kept in moscow for years sticking pins into a list of names brinkman was convinced it wouldnt take ann more than minutes to make up her mind when he told her how long she was likely to remain there if she stayed with blair brinkman wanted to call her the moment he got to his apartment but he controlled the impatience not knowing if blair had returned from washington ahead of him and unwilling to get involved in a probing conversation with the man if he answered the telephone instead he waited until the following day reaching blair at the embassy and arranging to have lunch with him there having placed blair at the embassy and knowing he would remain there to keep their appointment brinkman called ann and said he wanted to see her her attempted objection that she was going out surprised him but he bulldozed over her insisting that it was important and that he could only remain a few moments anyway she kissed him when he entered her apartment but brinkman thought he detected a reservation about that too whats so important she said i thought you would have known that please she said lets have a rest from that for a moment there isnt time ann had been looking away refusing to meet his gaze she turned to him now curiously why not i might be leaving moscow being withdrawn ann felt the relief move through her without him here everything would be so much easier there would only be one problem the big problem if jeremy werent here wonderful she said a reaction to her own feelings i want you to come with me ann shook her head i cant ive thought about it and i cant you can insisted brinkman refusing her refusal i know how you feel about eddie what it would mean to you but in the end when it was all over you know youd be happier with me no why wouldnt he just go away go away before she weakened and changed her mind and ended up as confused as shed been before they both left on their trips should he tell her about moscow not yet brinkman decided he still hadnt got orlov yet still a lot to do hed have to let her know hint at least something of what might be happening to convince her he was telling the truth and it was inevitable shed challenge blair about not going back and it would all become confused and more importantly dangerous think about it some more he urged think about what it would be like i have she said misunderstanding he said so you know it would work out give me more time she pleaded again her wellworn retreat ive told you reminded brinkman there isnt much im leaving here and i dont want to go without you brinkman was slightly late arriving at the american embassy so they didnt stay in blairs office but went immediately to the cafeteria how was london asked blair good to be back after so long said brinkman the story prepared he said i had to go before a promotion board and there was some discussion about the next posting must be pleased about the way things have turned out here then seems like it said brinkman how was washington his story prepared blair said it was a personal thing my first wife is having some problems with our eldest boy sorry to hear that said brinkman automatically itll work out said blair wonder how long itll be before things start moving here again said brinkman theres no way of telling said the american harriet had considered disobeying the englishmans instructions about adding to the message knowing there was nothing physically he could do to stop her but then she remembered the threat and the way he had looked when he made it and decided hed meant it so shed done what she was told bastard she thought as the days passed however she rationalised her attitude accepting something the most important thing that was happening pietr was coming hed got the divorce to protect natalia and the promotions and the acclaim hadnt meant as much to him as she did and so he was coming which made it right everything that america would give you the motherfucking sonofabitch had promised america had seemed obvious because she was there and pietr knew the country but hed adjust easily enough to england they both would the most important thing was that they would be together and shed happily live in a tent in the middle of a jungle just to be with him and he was coming she knew he was coming harriet was aware she should be patient god hadnt she been patient enough already but now that she was sure it was more difficult than before coming she thought her mind blocked by a single word she loved him so much brinkman evaded the surveillance by a combination of expertise and luck the expertise was the adherence like blair had earlier adhered to standard training the luck came from sokols decision to concentrate upon the american who was proveably known to have cleared his trail and made two visits to washington and withdraw the earlier intended complement assigned to the englishman to reinforce what the russian considered more important brinkman set out simply to avoid the customary usually laughedat foreign observation utilising the edict that people schooled to watch can be lulled into expectation anticipating that those at the compound would prepare for him to leave by car for the embassy on morisa toreza because that was what he always did he set out on foot instead the ridiculously easy ploy created immediate confusion and he increased it by his subsequent action the depleted surveillance group split one squad going after him the other hurrying directly and pointlessly by car to the embassy another anticipation to warn those already in place and to supplement them not at that stage desperately worried because they were still confident brinkmans obvious destination was the british legation it left only seven men in pursuit two of whom brinkman lost at the first of the three obligatory metro disembarkations and two more of whom he slipped before regaining street level by the time brinkman reached the ulitza gorkova just before the cinema towards which he was heading he was quite alone he succeeded in getting a seat in the rear of the auditorium giving himself a view of those coming directly after him just to be sure and after thirty minutes relaxed quite satisfied it was a typical production from the soviet film institute an achingly boring parable involving loyal peasants striving against overwhelming odds during an invasion which appeared to be prussian from the uniforms but was never made quite clear with much hillclimbing and flagplanting to indicate gained ground brinkman allowed the time to pass confidently cocooned and increasingly bored by the repeated saga he was sure that evenings ballet would be much more exciting it was unfortunate he wasnt going to be able to see it would orlov have received the message he wondered chapter thirtytwo brinkman quit the cinema with several hours to go before his eagerlyhoped encounter with pietr orlov with things to do before actually reaching the bolshoi as he walked back down the ulitza gorkova he reflected that if orlov didnt make todays meeting the day wouldnt have been entirely wasted on impulse he chose a kiosk on gorkova but then spread the contact points selecting kiosks at random and over a wide area on oktyabrskaya at street level and then in the metro station itself another at the far end of leninskiy prospekt and then allowing a gap not bothering with any further kiosks until he reached ulitza dostoyevskovo he listed one there and another on kommuny and decided that was sufficient he could always add if it were necessary he was still early at the theatre the performance was a revival of don quixote created in the specialised soviet narrative form and brinkman particularly wanted to see it he supposed he could always apply for tickets through the embassy if orlov didnt make the meeting and there was the need to come again but brinkman was reluctant to link attention between himself and the ballet because of the clandestine purpose for which hed designated it and knew that all official applications were monitored reluctantly it seemed that don quixote would have to go on tilting at windmills without his appreciation it had been a hurried decision in the manhattan apartment but brinkman was pleased with it the crowds were building up people ebbing and eddying throughout the expansive ornate foyer creating a swirl of concealment brinkman allowed himself to be moved with the tide always remaining near the north side but not standing around as if he were even innocently awaiting someone to join him brinkman realised he would be fortunate if it happened soon if it happened at all he frowned at the doubt if orlov had received the book then it would happen he was sure shed put the message in it because of the cia surveillance he had not been able actually to go through the procedure with her even to be seen around the united nations again but hed made the same sort of confident entrance the second night as he had the first to her apartment block and theyd talked again and brinkman was convinced she had done what hed told her precisely how hed told her so orlov would definitely come if hed got the book so what if he hadnt it became a waiting game to see if the americans could get their escape organised before he through harriet had the opportunity to screw it all up except that at the pace at which he was working and the pace at which he knew the americans would be moving it could hardly be described as waiting which was what he was doing now hopefully the tide of people began to flow into the theatre taking away his cover and brinkman moved near a pillar there was still quite a crowd around but brinkman felt naked and exposed perhaps not as good as he had thought in fifteen minutes they would all be inside and he would be entirely obvious an actual object of attention the reverse of what he wanted hed have to go before then certainly if he wanted to use it as a meeting spot again which he did because he had no other orlov came curiously through the foyer his coat not checked although over his arm in readiness programme notes already purchased and thoughtfully cleverly in his hand it would have been difficult to imagine the russian as anything other than a genuine ballet lover if he were under surveillance orlov had no reason to know or imagine why he was there remembered brinkman he moved out through the rapidly thinning crowd not to intercept the russian but to move parallel and just slightly ahead of him so that orlov would see him approaching orlov gave no sign of recognition until just before brinkman spoke a frown of halfrecollection deepening at full memory as soon as he heard the words the american embassy said brinkman with only seconds and therefore the need immediately to snare the other man he went on the night you made the approach to blair ive seen harriet comrade orlov i spoke to her a few days ago in new york shes very anxious to see you again ive promised her ill make that possible brinkman broke away without waiting for a reaction moving not towards the body of the theatre the direction in which the latecomers were going but through the last exit door out on to sverdlova anxious for the sudden darkness it should have worked but he didnt know if it would hed been quite sure until the actual moment of approach but now he wasnt he didnt know what he would do what he could do if orlov didnt follow but he did brinkman was conscious of the footsteps if it were an arrest there would be more than one man surely and then the russian drew level and reached out to stop him what is it what does it mean demanded orlov hed made the catch thought brinkman was this exhausted but triumphant feeling the sensation that fishermen felt landing a game fish after a battle that seemed as if it would never end it was an intrusive indulgently dramatic thought and brinkman put it irritably aside knowing that he had to establish control from the outset were going towards red square he pointed out i think we should walk the other way dont you obediently orlov turned practically gaffed thought brinkman it means that the british want to offer you everything that the americans have he said i know it all why you want to defect that you intend to defect we want you to change your plans come with us not the americans that is not possible there are already preparations started orlov but brinkman cut him off determined for supremacy it is possible the preparations youve already made must be broken if theyre not youll never see harriet again orlov stopped turning to him what do you mean by that brinkman told him he knew the words now because hed set it out to maxwell and to harriet and to maxwell again and orlov listened in complete silence im not interested in your telling me what you think of me personally concluded brinkman harriet did that used all the words i actually agreed with her its just the way its got to be orlov didnt waste his time on unnecessary anger and brinkman was grateful who says its the way its got to be the russian demanded we do said brinkman please dont be resentful i know its going to be difficult at first but i mean what i say well provide everything that the americans would have done maybe more you will be safe and harriet will be safe eventually if you decide you dont like england it would probably be possible for you to go on to america after you think youve got everything from me that its possible to get said orlov yes said brinkman at once maintaining brutal honesty after we think weve got every last thing its possible to get from you ive been utterly and completely truthful with you i dont know or care what the americans have told you you know what youre doing and you know what we want for helping you for making it possible i want you to believe me and i want you to believe me when i say that if you dont come with me then you wont go with anyone do you enjoy what you do mr brinkman im prepared to argue philosophy and morals if you want to said brinkman easily would you like to argue the morality of the soviet occupation of afghanistan or the psychiatric prisons in which you incarcerate and make mindless your dissidents or the siberian gulags all right you are not personally involved governments and members of those governments never are in america theres even an accepted phrase freeing the president from any culpability for anything that goes wrong and becomes public knowledge its called plausible denial im the sort of person whos denied and cast aside if anything does go wrong despite knowing which yes i like it im not doing you any harm comrade orlov you want to cross to the west to be with someone you love and im making that possible for you i dont see anything to be ashamed of in that you evaded the criticism and you know it said orlov i was talking about your threats if i dont agree to cooperate with you what are you prepared to do to get to the west demanded brinkman orlov considered the question anything he said i am quite determined which is what i am professionally determined said brinkman so i am prepared to do what needs to be done to achieve the objective do you know what would happen to me if you exposed me to the authorities the last time hed walked along this road it had been with ann remembered brinkman he said yes i know what would happen to you and so do you which is why i know after youve made the protests and the arguments youll do exactly as i say yes conceded orlov sagshouldered i suppose i will wont i theres really no alternative is there not now no said brinkman but it isnt as if you arent achieving what you want is it should i be comforted by that i dont see why not brinkman paused then demanded tell me all the arrangements youve so far reached with the americans all the plans that have been made it took a long time and before orlov had finished they had walked a considerable distance from the centre of the city and actually turned back upon themselves when orlov finished brinkman said what about a delegation it hasnt been possible not yet the occasion hasnt occurred even to make discussing it possible its the best way so try for that if you can said brinkman somewhere in the east if actually getting out into western europe isnt possible ill ensure that london create an incursion operation to get you out if a delegation is not possible you are so similar to the american said orlov we even share the same wife thought brinkman he said you must break all contact of course no more meetings what if his response is to do what you threaten it wont be said brinkman confidently he wont know youre with me hell imagine some internal difficulty which could arise said orlov how asked brinkman his confidence dipping orlov recounted the fears of his affair with harriet being suspected and a danger arising if she were contacted and in the darkness brinkman smiled to himself the reason why the americans had not put the woman under agreed protection finally explained he wasnt behind in the race any more he thought he was way out ahead and could actually see the finishing line with the white tape stretched out invitingly he said no one was aware of my approaching her if the kgb had known they wouldnt have let the book reach you and if they had wed have both been arrested by now orlov stared abruptly around him at the realisation yes he said yes i suppose you are right so theres no danger to harriet and theres no danger to you youre going to get out like you want to i suppose youll want to maintain this sort of contact said orlov wearily contact agreed brinkman but not personal meetings like blair wanted theyre too dangerous he took the russians hand and placed in it a list of the public telephone numbers hed laboriously copied after leaving the cinema theyre all street kiosks brinkman explained all untraceable well keep tuesdays every tuesday at three oclock precisely you telephone me starting with the number at the top of the list ive given you if theres a problem wait until the succeeding tuesday at the same time and move one number down therell be no proveable connection between us youll be quite safe brinkman was conscious of the other man nodding in the darkness thats good he said thats very good i was getting extremely frightened having to make personal meetings the only purpose of the calls will be for you to tell me that youve succeeded in getting on a delegation once you do ill set everything up orlov sighed i understand he said its going to be all right said brinkman trying to encourage the other man orlov stopped walking again and turned to confront the englishman im sick of hearing that he said and phrases like that shall i tell you something mr brinkman i know im trapped now trapped without any possibility of going back but if i had that opportunity i think i would i think id abandon harriet and remain in russia it was difficult almost impossible in the first gutchurning hours for sokol to subdue his feardriven fury but he did it would have been easy but pointless to punish the street men like hed punished the others it was his fault for not taking personal charge to the point of facetoface briefings and control room command leaving it instead to subordinates who in turn left it to the ground personnel embassy surveillance was regarded within the serice as the most menial although it shouldnt have been the place for rejects from other departments which was an attitude hes also known and disregarded no mistakes sokol remembered and hed gone on making them would it be possible to catch up chapter thirtythree with sokol in personal control the surveillance was complete there were rotating squads attached to blair and brinkman the schedule devised so that at no time day or night did the number in those squads fall below thirty men each group was supported again on a twentyfour hour basis by a fleet of radio cars which were linked through individual studio vans there were disguised television vehicles employed whenever possible picturing the englishman and the american as they moved openly about the city on the first friday blair tried to leave the embassy by the same method as before but this time every vehicle was followed and he was seen getting out on the ulitza neglinnaya before the american successfully crossed and entered the foyer of the metropole hotel going into his avoidance pattern the alarm had been raised the central control room in dzerzhinsky square was the centrepiece of the voice traffic and sokol worked from there a map spread out before him to coordinate the operation he swamped the sverdlova area bringing in all his prepared units the vast building was surrounded twenty people in place and more en route when blair emerged from the west door on to the marksa prospekt and started north towards ostankino he was identified immediately and around him formed a phalanx of unseen unrealised watchers by the time blair reached the main metro station serving dzerzhinsky square a television van was in place but it was useless because blair ducked down into the underground system from his command post ironically less than half a mile from where blair was moving sokol muttered to the attentive technicians got him this time weve got him the russian snapped his fingers expectantly and was obediently handed another map this time of the underground system sokol gave his instructions over the radio crisply and concisely identifying the interchange points from which blair might try to switch moving cars and men to them to be ready above and below ground within minutes one of the men who had descended into dzerzhinskaya emerged to report through the waiting radio the direction in which blair caught the underground train and sokol began to track the americans route on the map with a wax pencil blair was vaguely aware that for the time of the day the carriages seemed more crowded than normal and he wrinkled his nose at the cabbage smell that seemed so pervasive in the city the seeming indigenous smell had worried him when he first arrived but now apart from rare occasions like this he ceased to notice it ann still smelled it of course poor ann blair reckoned that she could recite every disadvantage of the soviet capital without missing one blair made his first move at kropotkinskaya alert for anyone who followed three people did but only one remained on the platform and blair hung back letting the man take the next train without attempting to board it himself he got confidently on to the second connection unaware that the two who had hurried up the stairs had done so to alert four more at ground level who came down in time to follow the american on to the train blair disembarked again at arbatskaya and climbed to street level setting off down suvorovskiy boulevard and abruptly hailing a taxi which would have worked had the surveillance been less complete as it was there were two radiolinked cars able to alternate the pursuit and give literallya running commentary back to sokol at the kgb headquarters sokol moved his pencil from the underground to the street map staying close to the river he realised at once to the people around him he said get a boat blair paid his cab off on the ulitza bolshiye kamenshchiki going at once underground again but only for a short journey this time emerging once again at kiyevskaya and walking the remaining distance to the park krasnaya identified sokol triumphantly as the pencil stopped its movement encircle it he ordered i want people moved in carefully replacing any staff there attendants sweepers everyone in the park blair settled himself near the archer statue feigning to read his copy of pravda how long would it all take he wondered it could be weeks months possibly before orlov could get on to a delegation he hoped it wasnt months he wanted to resolve things with ann quicker than that and the problems could be resolved he knew they could everything could be resolved and they could be happy again if they had the chance it was only moscow hed be glad to get out now once hed regarded it as the most important posting of his career which it undoubtedly was but now he regarded settling things with ann as more important blair checked his watch seeing there were only fifteen minutes to go before the appointed meeting idly watching a park attendant emerge from a side path stabbing at leaves with a spiked stick from another path a couple came hand in hand appearing unaware of anyone or anything and sat on a bench facing him from across the circle blair hoped their presence wouldnt disturb orlov if the russian kept todays meeting there was no reason why it should from their absorption in each other which was getting increasingly intimate it was more likely that the presence of the two men would eventually disturb the lovers noon guessed sokol aloud as the information about the americans watch check was radioed into the control room sokol was tensed in anticipation of what was going to happen it would be a coup to trap blair actually in the act of proveable espionage if he could do the same with brinkman and he was determined to do the same with brinkman sokol knew it would be the coup to make everything possible sokol stayed crouched forward over his maps table but not looking at them concentrating instead upon the slow moving clock mounted against the far wall watching the quarter half and then three quarters eventually pass with no news from the now completely occupied park on his seat in that park blair decided to allow more time there were a dozen reasons why orlov could be late although hed never been late on the previous occasions and a dozen more reasons why he wouldnt be able to keep the appointment at all this friday or several fridays after blair was still unsettled by orlovs nonappearance although blair knew all the reasons and all the difficulties hed still unprofessionally convinced himself of the russians appearance and was disappointed that it hadnt happened it still could he thought checking the time once more it was still only onethirty the park attendant completed his leaf collection and the lovers stopped short of positive intercourse and blair actually read the soviet newspaper from cover to cover at three oclock he finally quit rising slumpshouldered and catching the first taxi he managed to stop blairs expertise was still such to prevent his being ordinarily careless although his hopscotch from car to metro to bus was always monitored because the surveillance was extraordinary in the dzerzhinsky square radio room an equally dejected sokol stared down at the scrawled pencil lines losing interest momentarily in the crackled requests for further instructions from the radio it was supposed to be a meeting sokol said more to himself than to anyone else in the room i know it was intended to be a meeting when he got back to his own office sokol found waiting for him the request to contact the chairman of the kgb for a personal interview sokol threw down the memorandum sighing he was surprised it had taken so long in coming the reaction from washington came close to hysteria blair factually reported that he had attended as arranged but that orlov failed to appear and then emphasised that from the beginning hed anticipated a quite understandable interruption to any regular weekly meetings and arranged the fallback with the man his attempted assurance with which blair was unhappy anyway failed entirely to placate langley headquarters blairs attempts to maintain an open line of communication were constantly broken with a flurry of questions some of which his messages had already answered and some of which were beyond answer at all aware despite being so far away of the growing inquest blair repeated orlovs concern about any approach to harriet being made and asked for a categoric assurance that the agreement had been kept and that no kgb watch squad could have themselves become aware of the american surveillance the apparent guarantee came but blair thought it was muted and decided hed made a telling point he bet that harriet johnson was as sanitised and isolated as any goldfishbowled astronaut on a moonwalk and bet further that any intelligence operator worth his salt could have picked the observation up in five seconds flat allowing for natural blinking brinkman timed perfectly his arrival at the public kiosk on the ulitza gorkova its possible use the only uncertainty it was empty so even that wasnt a problem brinkman hadnt bothered to evade what he still believed to be only the normal embassy personnel attention because having established his undetectable contact routine evasion simply wasnt necessary professional to the letter he made the pretence of seeking a coin at the moment of entry and snatched the telephone from the rest at the beginning of the first ring so successfully that sokols radio van with its directional pistol microphone failed to pick up that it was an incoming call orlov hadnt managed to get a delegation and brinkman had nothing to say except that he would be at the subsequent kiosk at exactly the same time the following week brinkman succeeded in covering the exchange against any outside interest by fumbling with the rare and tattered directory until orlov disengaged and then calling his own number coin ready in the slot finally again for external observation if there was any slamming down the headpiece a man frustrated at being unable to make a connection although outwardly brinkman maintained the annoyed pretence he left the telephone box hot with excitement seeing orlovs contact the proof that the russian had come over to the british and that hed snatched the prize right from beneath blairs nose the first prize brinkman told himself there was another to follow when ann made her decision the telephone visit was recorded in the account of the observation upon brinkman but so casual and quick was it that no specific importance was attached and sokol did not single it out as anything of relevance either chapter thirtyfour it took every extreme of willpower and concentration that pietr orlov possessed and then some the russian didnt know he had but knowing that everything he wanted depended upon it he cleared his mind of a woman he loved called harriet johnson and an american he tolerated called blair and an englishman he despised called brinkman and devoted himself entirely to the agricultural policy he recognised to be the passport for what he wanted he rewrote and reworked and then rewrote again the passages that had offended sevin rightly offended the man orlov acknowledged because they were careless and when he got them right he started again until finally he was confident they were perfect which sevin assured him they were accepting them practically without correction still orlov forced himself determined to maintain the standard and sevin remained congratulatory angry at himself for displaying an old mans lack of judgement and reflecting a lifetimes suspicion accepting the temporary distraction had after all been the disruption of a broken marriage the chance came sooner than he expected it to on the fourth week orlov evolved from the beginning a system of monitoring everything that was happening elsewhere the work of the other committees and the other groups involved in the agronomy review and into the net in exactly a month the system brought the memorandum from the central working committee discussing the delegation visit to europe orlov felt hollowed by the initial flood of excitement at the quickness of its happening and his luck in discovering it and the thought of it all everything being settled there was fear too as great as excitement he hoped so much that he wouldnt fail hed be all right naturally if things went smoothly it was of the unexpected that orlov was frightened on the day the memorandum reached him his hand positively trembled so that he had difficulty in reading the words and had to put it down upon the unmoving desk and bend over it france first the inviting country and then denmark to study their dairy system a full fifteen days tour starting in just three and a half weeks time orlov prepared his approach to sevin with the consummate care that he knew everything now required the sort of care hed taken over the embassy visit when hed made contact with the american getting approval for his latest section of his report first and then letting the conversation between them ramble into generalities before mentioning in an apparent aside the proposed european visit when sevin seized upon it as orlov guessed and hoped he would the younger russian said more direct than before i thought i should be part of the delegation he nodded towards the papers on sevins desk all that is being written and compiled from previous reports and statistics id be better able to argue innovations and change if id personally seen the methods of other more advanced countries what right had he had to question morality with brinkman thought orlov the names will have already been selected pointed out sevin i realise that said orlov increasingly an astute kremlin operator i wonder why the visit wasnt made generally known in the first place the reaction of sevin who had lived through a lifetime of plot and counterplot was as predictable as orlov expected it to be you think it was kept from us ive no way of knowing that said orlov honestly but prepared was it ever brought up at any meeting you attended no said the old man nor at any in which ive sat said orlov playing the best card last he said comrade didenko is on the central working committee sevins face tightened you think he is trying to exclude us ive no way of knowing that either said orlov four days later sevin announced to orlov that he would be forming part of the soviet delegation to france and to denmark the pressure from washington upon eddie blair was of a ridiculous degree so ridiculous that blair recognised it and tried as best he could to stop it spreading over into his already strained private life but that was difficult because the demands kept him late at the embassy and required his early attendance in the morning and the workload created greater tension between himself and ann he studiously kept the friday assignations and when orlov failed to show up on the fourth occasion three of the insistent questions came from the washington headquarters signed personally by the director which was practically unheard of and blair recognised his replies clearly showed his contempt he sent them anyway irritated by the panic he was as uncertain as they were more so because they were safe and protected back at langley and it was still his ass displayed and waiting to be shot off but it was still only four weeks and there could be the simplest of explanations why orlov needed to keep away this wasnt sunday brunch at the mayflower for christs sake as the thought came to blair the cipher machine stuttered into life again and he transcribed as it printed reading that langley had succeeded in getting visas for two men who would be arriving in advance of the next scheduled meeting there was nothing whatsoever they could do less now that orlov had severed contact but blair realised it enabled langley once more to be able to imagine they were doing something active and positive blair realised too that it indicated their belief in his inability successfully to continue with the operation so maybe it would be he who was brunching soon at the mayflower in washington he hadnt thought it was possible for things to develop as they had quite so quickly it was the following tuesday that brinkman took the telephone call at the public kiosk on leninskiy prospekt and orlov told him of the place on the delegation to france youre free promised brinkman at once i wish i were said the russian youve no idea how i wish i were the breathing of aleksai panov seemed more difficult than usual his shoulders lifting and falling with the effort but despite his illness the inevitable tubed cigarette was in his hand when sokol entered the chairmans office on the seventh floor of dzerzhinsky square the wheezing man indicated a chair without any greeting and sokol took it from where he sat he could look out over the huge piazza and actually see the statue to the founder of the soviet intelligence service whats happening demanded panov i dont know conceded sokol reluctantly but im certain that something is set it out insisted the chairman sokol recounted everything wishing he had more positive evidence to support his convictions intent for any reaction from the other man panov smoked steadily lighting fresh cigarettes from the stubs of those he exhausted face expressionless when sokol stopped talking panov said you assembled a large body of men a lot of equipment too yes agreed sokol unsure of the point yet they lost them both of them sokol wondered if there were recordings being made of the meeting for some later disciplinary action he thought it probable he said there have been mistakes im sorry so am i said panov unhelpfully if youre right in believing there are two definite operations underway here in moscow you should have maintained personal control from the beginning to plead the pressure that had arisen in the provinces wouldnt be accepted as an excuse sokol knew it was a miscalculation he conceded with no alternative the americans are sending in more people it would appear so said sokol the foreign ministry have advised me of the visa applications described as an archivist and a trade counsellor anything known from the names sokol shook his head theres no file on either whatever it is the american situation at least could be coming to a head if theyre sending in reinforcements yes agreed sokol why dont we move against both of them the american and the englishman demanded panov some sort of technical entrapment could be easily arranged an allegation of simple lawbreaking would be enough all thats necessary is to frighten them if we want something more elaborate why not lure them into an espionage situation and we can formally expel them if we did that we wouldnt know what it was that either of them were doing pointed out sokol simply panov looked intently at the glowing end of a fresh cigarette admiring the professionalism he said true but can we risk letting it run each day that passes can mean the damage is worsening shouldnt that be the consideration minimising any unknown damage sokol decided the question was phrased for whatever recording was being made he said theyd pass it on both of them to whoever it was succeeded them here thats what wed have our people do in similar circumstances so we wouldnt be closing anything down panov nodded in further admiration wed be gaining some time though so far youve discovered remarkably little sokol gave no reaction to the criticism he said at the moment i know the people im sure in the case of the american that kr as nay a is the contact point if we move now and get them expelled ill have to identify their replacements and discover the new routines because the existing ones would be scrapped for obvious protection the time that would take would extend rather than limit the period of potential damage panov frowned irritated at being outargued but unable to confront the other man with a better alternative view he said it cant be openended i dont want the americans allowed the opportunity of getting themselves organised how long asked sokol risking the rudeness of interruption to obtain a positive instruction from his superior a month determined panov if we dont get results in a month i want entrapment operations against blair and brinkman and well expel them chapter thirtyfive brinkman had consciously to suppress the euphoria realistically knowing the danger of overconfidence that the excitement could bring but it wasnt easy perfect he thought everything was perfect there was an intervening tuesday before the departure of the delegation a full seven days before his next telephone link with orlov which enabled london to make and then doublecheck every conceivable part of their snatch plan and actually discuss and refine it with brinkman over the secure embassy communication wires before he made his final contact with the russian and the plan was perfect too because it was so simple on the final tuesday brinkman went through the ritual of clearing his trail because it was professional to do so but as he moved around the russian capital on his way to kommuny he realised that it didnt matter if he were under any sort of observation because there was nothing that could stop it happening any more he was still however careful like he had been with his evasions aware that todays conversation would be longer than any others he carried with him a small transistor radio tuning it to a programme relaying some mournful slavik dirge as he walked towards the kiosk and placing it on the shelf as he moved in to pick up the dutifully ringing telephone precisely on time the tune was a minimal distraction to him but brinkman knew it would block any sort of listening apparatus directed at him if he were under surveillance which he was sure he wasnt there were a total of fifteen kgb men within a hundred yards of him on the street with a concealed camera operating from an enclosed van and another technician in a separate vehicle directing the pistol microphone that was as brinkman unknowingly intended completely baffled by the radio its arranged demanded orlov at once from his end of the line brinkman was conscious of the russians nervousness it was understandable he supposed dear god dont let everything fail through the mans collapse he said trying to infuse the confidence into his voice everything its guaranteed and nothing nothing at all can go wrong its only two more days this time on thursday itll all be over youll be safe with harriet how demanded orlov listen urged brinkman listen very carefully but dont take any notes i understand said orlov appearing to realise brinkmans concern he added im all right really all right the delegation is flying direct to charles de gaulle airport by the scheduled aeroflot service departing sheremetyevo at seven began brinkman telling the russian something he already knew but including the detail to show the uncertain man how well everything had been planned you go along as a normal part of that delegation you go through all the usual formalities bothering about nothing because everything is being done for you london are sending a complete contingent to paris well in advance of the moscow flight theyll all be briefed from the photographs we have of you how to recognise you theyre professionals dont worry there will be men lingering from incoming international flights within the baggage claim and immigration areas and more outside being an official government party the normal regulations will be waived follow whatever routine the french insist upon dont try to make any identification or seem to be looking for anyone until the moment you emerge into the public part of the airport at the moment you do emerge theres going to be a diversion it will be an incendiary explosion in a washroom it will cause an instant fire at the very moment that happens youll be aware of men around you hurrying you away just go dont do or say anything it doesnt matter whats happening to the rest of the russian party therell be men to intervene and confuse them a car will be waiting three times youll change cars in fact transferring until you reached a military airfield near orly a british military aircraft will be waiting there a designated flight plan already filed to a british military airfield at northolt near london the passenger manifest will have you listed under the name entered into a valid british passport that you will be given during the drive to the orly airstrip a photograph and a satisfactorily forged signature already in it brinkman paused breathlessly you got all that orlov did not immediately respond then he said you will not be with me ill be alone brinkman was very conscious of orlovs fear he said not on the flight from moscow the men who are going to snatch you are experts theres no need no need at all for you to be frightened that everything wont go as ive said it will an hour after the aeroflot flight theres a british airways service to london i shall be on it by the time you get to northolt ill be there to meet you you promise demanded orlov urgently i promise assured brinkman it was fortunate they had time to consider everything and recognise orlov would have the need for someone he knew he said ill be there to meet you and ill stay with you that hadnt been part of the planning but brinkman couldnt imagine maxwell objecting what about harriet said orlov were doing exactly what you asked said brinkman the moment youre safe people already waiting and ready in new york will bring her to you in england he allowed the pause believe me he said everything has been thought of i wish there wasnt so long to wait only two days insisted brinkman youve waited a long time you can wait just two more days you mean what you say you wont try to cheat or trick me he deserved the question brinkman accepted unoffended no he said ill not cheat you everything will happen as ive promised it will we will not see each other again until london brinkman knew there was nothing he could do to allay orlovs fear of being left alone he said not until london but you can do it i hope i can said orlov honestly until london said brinkman theres no way we can get into contact blurted orlov not wanting brinkman to put down the telephone you know there isnt said brinkman sternly trying to infuse confidence into the other man until london accepted orlov his voice uneven ill buy the champagne for you and harriet said brinkman grandiosely he replaced the receiver switched off his radio and hurried away from the kiosk in the direction of the nearest metro station everything settled he thought complacently settling himself into a seat and watching his own reflection in the darkened glass facing him everything except ann it was while he was thinking of her that his mind ran on and he realised worriedly that his planning might not be as perfect as he thought brinkman came slightly forward in his seat at the awareness worried at the oversight he had intended going back to the apartment but instead rerouted himself to the embassy where the files were it took him two hours of concentrated reading to go through the back copies of pravda and izvestia and the smaller publications and the tass tapes alert for any disclosure of the delegation he found it in an issue of pravda eight days earlier his apprehension immediate until he read it through it was an announcement of the delegation and the countries it was visiting but contained no details of its composition with a date as a guide brinkman checked the tass wires for that day theyd carried the story but again omitted any names hed been lucky brinkman decided relaxing there was no way blair could have learned that orlov was among a group of people going abroad now it really was only ann brinkman risked the call to her apartment something he didnt normally do because of the danger of blair being there and intent once more upon omens decided from the tone in her voice that she was pleased to hear from him im leaving he declared abruptly what there couldnt be any mistaking the feeling in her voice that time thought brinkman thursday he said everythings happened very suddenly for good yes it was what she wanted thought ann at the other end of the telephone or what she imagined she wanted now it was happening happening the way shed prayed it would when he was last in london she wasnt so sure will i see you again thats the decision ive been asking you to make for weeks i didnt mean that im not going until thursday night i think eddie is going to be at the embassy all day i could telephone ill wait for your call and ann yes i want a decision and he knew how to get it brinkman decided hed held back until now but he couldnt any longer hed spell out to her how long shed have to stay in moscow exaggerate if he had to and tell her if she doubted him directly to challenge blair to try to get a definite time brinkman was sure that would sway it he wished he hadnt had to use it as the final pressure that shed found it easier to choose between them but she hadnt so there it was he intended to leave moscow with everything he wanted everything chapter thirtysix the senior of the two men whom langley sent was a supervisor the same grade as blair named art blakey the younger man was harry king who said please call him hank everybody did there was an understandable embarrassment between them more for the newcomers than for blair blakey said they were sons of bitches at langley stretching the metaphor by saying all they did was piss up each others legs and that he was sorry theyd been sent and he knew damned well blair didnt need any help on anything blair said it didnt matter but thanks he suggested they carry out a full reconnaissance of krasnaya and they both agreed at once deferring to him and making it quite clear they expected him to act as the leader of the group it was obvious of course that they couldnt go together blair identified krasnaya on a map and explained the subway system and how the buses worked and what the route numbers were and isolated the hotels and the stores gum naturally first which he thought best to clear their trail they let king go ahead it was his first foreign assignment and the better experienced men realised he might need more time to find his way around an unfamiliar city paradoxically it was king who managed to evade the surveillance cleverly mingling with a group of american tourists leaving the druzhba hotel on vernadskovo prospekt and managing to reach red square on their coach before the intourist guide discovered him king disembarked pleading confusion and spent more time losing himself among other visitors around lenins tomb before setting out for the destination where they were to rendezvous the kgb observation team located art blakey as he left the embassy and by the time sokol gained the communication centre the news had already been received of blairs departure sokol hunched over the now familiar table unnecessarily reciting the coordinates of the two mens movements around the capital as they were radioed in marking fresh route marks on his map both were making obvious attempts at evasion so could this be it whatever it was sokol checked his duty roster reminding himself that he had forty men assigned to the surveillance deciding at once to increase the cover he snapped out a series of orders to the men grouped around in the control room ordering mobilisation of the street reserves and demanding access to every vehicle and operator in the basement motorpool as he issued the instructions sokol realised that the information of such an assembly would naturally be communicated to the chairman four floors above so having made his dispositions he called panov on the internal telephone the kgb chairman listened without any interruption until sokol finished and then said i think youre right to take the precaution it was obviously unthinkable that the chairman of the kgb should descend to the control room but he had the technicians activate the switching apparatus that enabled him to listen simultaneously to the information that was being relayed in and to sokols instructions on the outward channel it meant sokol realised that he was under as much observation as the americans he was following it wouldnt be necessary for panov to turn on the recording machinery in his office all traffic into the communication centre was automatically taped sokol bent over his maps in absolute concentration becoming more and more convinced of the destination as he traced the route blair and blakey were independently taking it had to be krasnaya he hesitated momentarily unsure whether to consult panov and then deciding against it aware it would indicate his uncertainty through the transmitters linked to panovs monitoring apparatus sokol called up half of the waiting reserves of street and mobile personnel and despatched them to the park in advance of the americans arrival sokol would have liked the time to brief them in one of the lecture rooms but decided speed was more important so he isolated himself briefly from the constantly incoming surveillance information and withdrew to another radio installation although still one to which the listening chairman above had simultaneous access over a separate wavelength he specifically instructed every car identifying by name the men in each and insisting upon a response so that everyone understood what he was demanding photographs had been taken of blakey and king on their arrival at the airport and copies issued to every surveillance vehicle it was from the photograph in the first car to arrive at krasnaya that the occupants identified the undetected younger american already there attempting to appear inconspicuous by the archer statue and when the information was relayed sokol felt a warmth of satisfaction at being right the feeling grew with the news from the followers that both blair and blakey were approaching the park as well by the time the two older americans entered krasnaya it was completely under the control of and sealed by the kgb all the attendants and staff even staff at the solitary refreshment stall were intelligence personnel and the apparently innocent pedestrians and users were kgb officers there were radiocontrolled pursuit cars in all of the five main approach routes with extra men concealed in closed vans blair didnt need to study any further the layout of the intended meeting place so by arrangement he went directly to the bench where hed sat before with orlov leaving blakey and king to orientate themselves at sokols insistence there was a running commentary now being sent into the control room from four separate observers concealed within the park operating mobile apparatus there was no other sound whatsoever in the room sokol and the technicians all stared at the receivers through which the voices were coming as if they expected to see as well as hear in the park blair saw art blakey approaching and rose before the american reached him what do you think he said good a place as any judged blakey the remark was picked up by a directional microphone aimed from about twentyfive yards away by an operator hidden in dense shrubbery and sokol couldnt suppress the smile of triumph he was glad panov was listening to everything king came into the area smiling ok said blair tell you on friday said the younger man the second remark came clearly into the radio room and sokol turned away from the technicians not wanting the gossip to spread of his reaction to the absolute confirmation of everything anything more you want to see blair asked both men blakey shook his head king said cant think of anything this looks like an ordinary park what else should it look like asked blair curiously king shrugged embarrassed at disclosing an idle thought just felt it might somehow be different really you know what i thought on my way here what that the people physically seem different different how asked blakey leading the way out of krasnaya king laughed dismissively further embarrassment square somehow he said physically square theres a revolving restaurant on the top of the ostankino tv tower said blair you can see something of moscow they were beyond the range of the directional eavesdroppers now so the remark was missed by the listening russians sounds like a good idea said blakey weve been going round and round for quite a while anyway on the ulitza akademika korolyova blair led the way into the sedmoye nebo restaurant and in his fluent russian engaged in the ritual of negotiating a favoured table with the head waiter and because those on either side of the window location were already occupied it meant that the pursuing kgb men were unable to get near enough to hear any conversation and long boomed microphones were impossible in such public surroundings as they sat blair warned i hope youre not in a hurry or hungry these things take quite a long time its something you have to get accustomed to in moscow you know what id like demanded blakey id like orlov to turn up this week with a perfectly sensibly explanation of why he hasnt been able to make the contacts so that all those pricks at headquarters can realise theyd been just that pricks it would be good agreed blair he added somehow i cant see it happening ive got a gut feeling that its gone cold you think it was the watch upon the woman in new york asked the other supervisor i dont know said blair i warned them as strongly as i could i would have expected our people to have recognised any soviet surveillance if thered been any wouldnt there have been some sort of announcement naming orlov if theyd moved against him because of what we were doing in new york asked king acknowledging blairs experience not yet said blair maybe not at all just something in a few months time saying that hed been voted off a committee and then later dismissed from the central committee itself hell be in jail by then of course creepy country said the inexperienced king he stared out over the slowly revolving panorama of the soviet capital and said thats something else that occurred to me this morning everythings grey actually coloured grey i mean its not really said blair but its a pretty common first impression you know how it happened dont you said blakey to the cia resident how your balls got caught in the vice how said blair perelmen disclosed blakey george bush was a cia director and made vice president perelmen thought the pathway looked pretty attractive set out to portray himself as the indispensible foreign affairs expert better than state and better than anyone sorry i let him down said blair bitterly you didnt said blatkey he let himself down announcing coups before they happened this thing should have been kept under wraps so tight an egyptian mummy would have looked naked pity it wasnt said blair he pulled back for the arrival of the tardy waiter giving their order for bortsch in russian sure its a pity agreed blakey now its blame time and youre right at the end of the line ive been at langley for the last three years know how the system works youre the one who fouled up according to the book all the panic and all the bullshit will be justified the proper reaction to what seemed to be happening youre the one left carrying the can seems pretty shitty said king coming back from his examination of the russian capital believe me said blakey im right just how right was proven by the message awaiting blair when they got back to the embassy that afternoon after further consideration cabled hubble it had been decided there would be no purpose in blairs tour being extended longer than originally scheduled blakey was to remain as acting intelligence resident blair smiled wanly down at the decision remembering it was what hed told ann to fob her off after his most recent return from washington she should be pleased everything was turning out as she wanted it to im sorry said blakey when blair showed him the recall cable i didnt try for this you know i know you didnt assured blair things could still turn out for the good reconnaissance said panov unquestionably said sokol recognising that panov was speaking for the benefit of the record to show his awareness the kgb chairmans attitude was remarkably changed hed stood smiling to greet him when he entered directly from the control room and within minutes of their conference beginning the vodka had been served he went on from what we heard we know positively that theres a meeting and we know its to be friday congratulations allowed panov youve been proven right thank you said sokol knowing the required modesty about one man balanced the chairman nothings been resolved about the englishman it will be undertook sokol it was not until he returned to his own department that sokol reflected on the extent of the exaggeration at the moment he only had half a success and that was still positively to materialise he cleared his desk of everything except the files on jeremy brinkman right back to the first entry of the mans arrival looking for anything he might have missed he stopped curiously going to blairs file for comparison and then calculating from the guard reports that the englishman appeared to have visited the blair apartment on more than one several in fact occasions when the american was back in washington he made a note and put a genuine question mark after it unsure if there was any significance it was a pity that blair was so good at cleansing his apartment of the listening devices so regularly planted and equally regularly found and jammed by the man it took sokol two hours to exhaust the written dossiers and then exhausted himself he lowered the lights and started on the videos and the attempted eavesdropping with the pistol microphones that had already proved so effective that day upon blair as he moved about the city he saw it on the last film at first he wasnt sure stopping and rewinding the film and then stopping it again on a freeze frame at the actual moment of brinkman putting the transistor on the kiosk edge with the frame held sokol found the independent sound tape coordinating it by date and time to the attempt to overhear the tuesday conversation when brinkman and orlov had arranged the russians escape there was just the meaningless snarl of interfering static that brinkman intended sokol picked out all the tuesday films looking for the kiosks now all so brief they had been missed until the latest longer conversation isolating the contact every time he watched the most recent tape through again and then put the lights up confident hed found the method and the dating of liaison and depressed by it from the reports it was always a different kiosk and so because they could never know in advance what the next box was going to be they couldnt put a tape on it for next tuesday there was never any evidence of his dialling out so it was always an incoming call from another untraceable telephone the englishman had been clever cleverer in fact than blair next tuesday the watch upon the englishman would be very different and very concentrated and before it happened sokol knew he needed an intensive session with the electronic experts he had to have a listening van capable of connecting at once within seconds to the call if he were to be as successful here as he had been in krasnaya park sokol decided until he talked to the experts to keep this from panov the man had had sufficient with which to be impressed in one day he promised protested paul he promised hed write and fix the trip your fathers a busy man darling said ruth if he made a promise hell keep it the vacation is soon now why not write again to remind him ive written twice already he hasnt bothered to reply thats not fair defended ruth he always replies you know what i think said paul i think hes dumped us just like before chapter thirtyseven brinkman had acquired few possessions in moscow wanting to travel lightly he bothered only with an overnight shoulderbag and that more for effect at the airport than for necessity and left everything else to be shipped out as diplomatic luggage by the embassy he took particular care packing the icon that ann gave him on his birthday sure it was going to have special meaning for both of them he was cleared up and ready early in the day like a deprived child anxious for its first holiday he remained careful in everything he paid kabalin the muttering maid three weeks salary and said he looked forward to returning to ensure that her inevitable report wouldnt cause any uncertainty before he was able to leave although he knew that in the few hours remaining it would be unlikely that any report would be properly channelled or assessed she thanked him and promised to come in as she always did while he was away and brinkman said he would appreciate it knowing that she was lying she hadnt stolen as much as he expected and brinkman reckoned hed been lucky he guessed shed come under some severe investigation which was unfortunate but unavoidable brinkman moved aimlessly around the apartment impatient for anns call idly looking around to impress it upon his memory it would be a good memory he decided hed achieved everything he set out to do on the posting more in fact and no one could detract from that hed proved himself to everyone it didnt matter what credit maxwell attempted to claim his reputation had been established before this what was happening today was just planting the flag on top of the mountain like the flags had been planted in that preposterous film hed watched waiting for contact with orlov he looked at his watch calculating against the time difference it would have already started by now in london the aircraft would have probably gone to france overnight maybe the snatch squads who were going to work outside the restricted areas too he wondered where those who were going to be on the inside picked up the international flight to put them in the right terminal area therell be a hell of a row of course france protesting because they had to about violation and invasion of sovereignty and russia denouncing everything and everybody all because of him thought brinkman in private gloating triumph he pitied everyone he was leaving behind in moscow life was going to be unbearable for a long time after this he guessed russia would insist upon some expulsions from the british embassy here and wondered who it would be someone senior if they tried to equate the action against orlovs rank properly to do that would mean the ambassador he supposed all because of me he thought again he snatched at the telephone when it rang and promised ann he would be with her in fifteen minutes he made it in ten she didnt hold back when he kissed her and he thought her eyes were wet and wondered if shed been crying at the thought of his going i never really thought you meant it she said about leaving i mean i just thought it was something you said to try to make me make a decision now you know it wasnt he said he paused and said but i want you to make up your mind she shook her head not in refusal but in perpetual uncertainty looking away from him if it had to be it had to be thought brinkman he said eddie lied to you ann about how long youre likely to be here i cant tell you how i know all i ask is that you trust me but there are going to be a lot of things happening here things which are going to upset a lot of forecasts eddies going to be kept on here not just for months but for years which means if you stay that youll be here for years youre going to become the den mother of the diplomatic wives like betty harrison youre going to see them come and youre going to see them go and youll still be here no she said eddies never lied to me he told me that and i believe him he said it wouldnt be as bad as i first thought what the hell does that mean he said his anger slipping bugger all and you know it he was trying to squeeze out of a corner and so he said something that sounded ok to get you off his back but it doesnt mean anything cant you see that ann nodded dumbly it was vague just like he said it was im not brave enough she said ill make you brave said brinkman urgently seeing the crack widen just leave just leave moscow use whatever excuse you like and then let him know youre not coming back i couldnt do it like that she said at once that wouldnt be she hesitated at the word i know it doesnt sound right but that wouldnt be honest if im going to leave then ill tell him to his face tell him then i dont know if i want to dont tell me again that youre confused im fed up with hearing it dont pressure me all the time you know what you want to do so do it why did you ever have to come to moscow if you hadnt come here everything would have been all right you know that isnt true ill decide she said when and dont say soon dont try to run away again a week she said ill decide in a week i promise if she hadnt intended to do it she would have refused now here on the spot thought brinkman she was going to come with him like hed known she would all along he held out his arms and she came to him her arms tight around him he wanted to make love to her and knew she wanted it too there wasnt time not for how he wanted to make love he didnt want a snatched illicit screw that was all over he wanted her to be his wife and now he knew she was going to be i must go he said seeing at once the frown of annoyance that he wasnt going to do what she expected i thought youd have more time therell be all the time in the world later he said yes she said distantly all the time in the world a week thats what i said ill be waiting its going to be wonderful ann believe me everything is going to be wonderful did orlov love harriet as much as he loved ann he must do brinkman supposed the moment of actual parting was difficult for them both each holding to the other reluctant to sever the physical contact but brinkman knew he had to it would be ludicrously stupid to ruin everything by staying here an extra thirty minutes when they had a whole lifetime ahead of them ill be waiting he reminded her i know i love you he waited but she didnt respond and he smiled and kissed her unconcerned shed pleaded with him not to pressure her and he wouldnt by his very absence the soviet authorities would identify him with what happened so the consideration was really unnecessary but brinkman didnt take an embassy vehicle to the airport deciding instead upon one of the officially approved airport taxis as the vehicle started to clear the moscow suburbs a clocktower suddenly appeared before him six he saw orlov would be at sheremetyevo now maybe going through the routine of a departure ceremony brinkman hoped the mans nerve held it was the one uncertainty that remained whether orlov would actually be able to go through with it without someone in the party and there would be kgb guardians in the party because there were on every overseas russian trip becoming aware of his anxiety maybe he should have gone earlier to the airport to see the man through but why there was nothing he could have done they hadnt arranged that he should be there during the last meeting so his unexpected appearance might have had the reverse of that intended alarming the man even more there was nothing he could do now nothing except hope if orlov made the plane then everything would be all right all he had to do then was wait until paris and let himself be spirited away by men who would already be in place now calm and expert and trained and waiting they began leaving the city behind and brinkman strained around realising it would be his last sight of the soviet capital a good memory he thought again now it was time to move on to what he wondered the day was in the halflight when brinkman reached the airport he remained inside the taxi to pay the driver and then stepped out on to the wide pavement in front of the departure building the large car park was filled as it always appeared to be and cars and taxis formed a solid line against the pavement edge brinkman picked his path through them making his way towards the identifiable insignia of british airways which would lead him to the desk inside it was about five doors ahead and brinkman thought in passing that he should have had the driver bring him nearer hed practically reached it when he heard the shout and at first gave no reaction because there was no one who could be shouting for him and then he heard it again and stared beyond the door into the british airways desk orlov had been walking waving to attract his attention but suddenly the russian began to run and as he did so brinkman saw uniformed security guards a long way beyond him but plainclothes men who appeared to be moving with some coordination much nearer fanning out into an embracing movement brinkman thought he heard stoitye but wasnt sure because ordinary passengers were becoming aware of the scene and there were other shouts orlov was only about twenty yards away and brinkman knew everything had gone disastrously wrong and that he should feign ignorance of the man but then orlov was upon him and brinkman couldnt shake the man off what is it demanded orlov whats the problem brinkman stared at the man unable to comprehend what was happening the plane he shouted why arent you on the plane the message said orlov the message at the desk telling me not to board why did you leave a message it was madness insanity but i didnt tried brinkman but the security police were much nearer now ordered by the plainclothes men brinkman heard stoitye plainly this time and orlov heard it too but he didnt stop like he was told all control gone fear whimpering from him the russian pulled himself away from brinkman and started running mindlessly through the line of parked cars there were more demands to stop and orlovs hand thrust out a physical gesture of rejection which the later enquiry determined made the security men in the confusion of the moment imagine that the fleeing russian had a weapon clutched in his hand and intended using it because for them to start shooting was a mistake against every order instinctively brinkman had snatched out trying to hold the thrustingaway man and when he missed he began going through the cars too so they were both running the bullets from the first misunderstanding soldiers were wide warning shots but other security men believed they were actually being fired at now with the breath groaning from him brinkman shouted too for orlov to stop but the russian was beyond reach encompassed and completely driven by the fear hed tried so hard to control brinkman was the first to be hit when everyone started firing an agonising pain in his thigh like a punch that after the first spurt of pain took all feeling away and he screamed but the sound was cut short because the weapons started firing on automatic and he was caught by the first swathe the same arc caught orlov too tipping them both over the lip of the carpark perimeter it was about a five foot drop and both were dead when they reached the bottom chapter thirtyeight blair started moving when he saw them hit knowing they were dead wanting to get out on to the road before the russians cordoned the airport because it shouldnt have happened like this and he was shaking from the shock of it and he knew he couldnt withstand or pass any examination he kept just within the limit to avoid attracting any attention about a mile towards moscow a lot of police and military vehicles hurtled past in the opposite direction sirens blaring but no one tried to stop him it was another fives miles before he felt he was safe the shaking was still as bad he intended going to the embassy anyway but it was essential now for him to recover he drove directly to chaykovskovo sure that at this time of night the embassy would be deserted apart from the skeleton night staff certainly art blakey and king wouldnt be there he wanted the cia residency within the embassy to himself its innermost room was steellined for security and it was there he went sitting at the desk and physically holding himself trying to quieten the reaction he stared around the room willing himself back to normality by the normality of accustomed surroundings there were duplicate cipher machines for direct contact with langley if necessary and a radio receiver and transmitter against the far wall adjoining that was the special equipment blair had created and assembled with his electronic expertise hed start to dismantle it tomorrow thought the american as he recovered begin packing everything in fact theyd said he could pull out early so why not reminded he called the duty clerk to ensure that the diplomatic pouch hadnt gone and said he had a letter to enclose in it and could they wait the clerk said there was plenty of time there was some sort of flap out at the airport and all the planes were delayed anyway writing to paul would help blair decided something else that was normal he always typed his letters because his handwriting was so bad he apologised to paul for not replying earlier to his letters but said he had been extremely busy the moscow trip didnt look like coming off now because unexpectedly he was being reassigned but that was great because at the moment it looked like washington which meant they could see each other all the time when he and john got to know ann and blair underlined his conviction they were going to like her they could stay over weekends and things like that he was sorry about the moscow vacation but thinking about it they might have found it dull after a while ann didnt like it all that much in fact very little to make up for moscow why didnt they go away for a vacation in america as a kid his own father had taken him on horseback and by canoe through a lot of the grand canyon why didnt they do that camping and stuff something mat hadnt been available when he was a kid were the special flights out of las vegas flying right along the canyon they could do that if they preferred it why didnt he talk it through with john and let him know as soon as he got back which wouldnt be long now he sent his love to john and to ruth read it through and sealed it as a test to ensure he had recovered he took it along to the duty clerk the man repeated there was no hurry latest news was that the airport was closed from the mans demeanour towards him blair was sure hed passed his own test the door leading into the inner top security room was steellined of course and fitted with a designation window into which coloured strips could be operated from the inside indicating the degree of security applicable to whatever was going on inside crimson was absolute security excluding even the ambassador blair locked the door using all the devices and although the embassy was empty put up the crimson code he sat for a long time at the desk staring at the electrical equipment he created but not really aware of the apparatus deep in thought gradually recovering further he stirred reaching back into the cabinet and taking out a burnbag he erected it carefully upon its tripod and with more care prepared the phosporus compound which operated upon contact with air and incinerated whatever was put inside satisfied he went to the safe for which for the last few hours only he had the combination theyd change it after he left giving blakey a new one there were a lot of tapes because as an internal precaution blair installed nine listening devices in his apartment intention at the time was to have detected any soviet entry when they might have been away from the flat they were in those ridiculous matroyshka dolls sets that ann seemed to like so much and in the light socket by the bed and again in the living room and every telephone was monitored not in the instrument itself which the russians would have discovered attempting the inevitable bug but back along the connecting wire all were voice and noise activated so the installation was automatic feeding directly into the electronic equipment that blair put into the office and which he intended to dismantle the following day the tapes were numbered and dated because blair was a ruthlessly methodical man tape one was recorded while he was in america the first time when hed been recalled for pauls initial problem blair picked it up and was moving towards the bag when he hesitated changing his mind instead he slotted it into the machine and depressed the button listening to the first dinner party that ann and brinkman had in the apartment christ it hasnt been bloody easy he heard ann say then their meeting and their love did she really think of him as all john wayne and howdy anywhere but here if there were an embassy at the north pole id happily swop it for here blair ran the tape on sadly knowing the stop points it was brinkmans voice its allowed for special friends blair snatched the tape from the machine and dropped it into the burn bag there was a faint skein of black smoke and a brief acrid smell the next tape was from the telephone where the installation was better and the quality clearer what are you doing nothing much nothing at all in fact just sitting here thinking what about i would have thought that was obvious sorry stupid question thered been a lot of talk about regret upon the tape blair thought he wondered if it were genuine sorry of course im sorry arent you i dont think so you havent got so much to be sorry about i dont think i would be even if i had the quality was slightly lower on the second section because hed been in the apartment then the living room first elsewhere later blair winced in physical pain at the bedroom sounds and at the conversation dont you think im a whore what a whore of course i dont think youre a whore what then i think youre lonely i think youre very unhappy i think youre looking for something you havent got maybe cant have i think youre very beautiful and i think you are a fantastic lover and more hatefully except that he couldnt hate only love more no it isnt a casual fuck and it isnt romeo and juliet either whats wrong with you and then quality improved from her end at least because it was the telephone again it was eddie hes coming home blair realised just how upset ann had been during that homecoming argument when hed announced he was staying on you know damned well how i hate it here how ive always hated it but then hed lost his temper as well i dont expect you to stay thank god she had he loved her so much so very much brinkman had been right about warning her of talking on an open line when shed called the man at the embassy and told him of their row and ann had been so honest oh darling im so unsure of everything suddenly impatient blair stopped reminding himself of the tapes of the whispered telephone conversations and the bedroom sounds abruptly discarding one after another into the destruct bag stopping at one he knew better than all the others the one hed replayed over and over again do you love me brinkmans voice i dont know ann do you love me brinkman yes i suppose so ann again what about eddie brinkman awful fucking brinkman thats it i love him too blair had heard it so often that he didnt think he could cry now but he did not breaking down into sobs but feeling the tears move irritatingly down his face you cant love two people at the same time the insistent brinkman who says where are the rules that everyone obeys that say you cant love two people a desperate ann youre going to have to make a choice cocky pushing fucking brinkman i dont want to im frightened poor lovely confused ann because everything was so carefully annotated it was something other than a tape next in line for destruction blair gazed down at a piece of paper that the sad nervous knowingly sacrificed orlov slipped to him in the krasnaya park with harriet johnsons telephone extension at the united nations it had been an impromptu improperly thoughtout decision openly to leave the copy like he had on the apartment desk because by then what else hed known he had to destroy brinkman but still wasnt sure how to hook him brinkman must have been desperate certainly the questions seemed that way a desperation not to have realised the impossibility of his ever having made a mistake like leaving around the most important part of an emerging intelligence operation but then brinkman had other distractions what a bastard the man had been blair threw orlovs pitiful note into the bag and it was destroyed so swiftly that there wasnt a wisp of smoke the american stretched aware that he had been sitting at the desk for almost two hours and that it was getting late did he need any more reminders no more now the need was to forget he loved ann so much so very much more than she would ever know there was only one tape left the one that had been made that afternoon blair made himself do it needing to hear of her uncertainty needing to know of her love dont pressure me all the time you know what you want so do it why did you ever have to come to moscow if you hadnt come here everything would have been all right you know that isnt true ill decide when and dont say soon dont try to run away again a week ill decide in a week i promise now she wouldnt have to decide to be undecided thought blair taking the final tape from the machine and putting it into the bag the equipment was extremely efficient and there was only a miniscule amount of detritus he shook it into the special container and sealed it along with the remaining exhausted phosphorus for collection and disposal the following morning blair rose stretching again and looked at the telephone unsure whether to call ann to tell her he was on his way no reason any more he realised no longer any need for discretion he collected his solitary car from the pound and eased out on to the near deserted night streets of moscow where he wondered were all the cars with all the observers who had made themselves so obvious so obvious that he would have aborted the mission anyway if he hadnt decided to handle it another way the recall to washington was a bonus something he hadnt anticipated but everything else had gone exactly as planned until the absolute end that is it had been easy from the intercepted conversations and brinkmans hurried return to england to know that the man had correctly interpreted the extension and imagined he could win blair wondered if the surveillance team would still be in place in new york and whether they had seen the british make contact had it been brinkman personally the man had been away long enough and was ambitious enough blair guessed orlov had gained the agricultural delegation hed read about in pravda and brinkman confirmed it by the sudden departure so easily set out upon the tape the airport message had been impromptu like leaving the united nations number in his apartment once he positively identified orlov arriving but it had worked like everything else except the shooting blair had not expected that wanted it blair had imagined an arrest a trial and an imprisonment until an exchange deal had been worked out like exchange deals were always worked out long enough for ann to forget but not that the man should get killed panic thought blair it was always fatal to panic at the apartment block he put his car in the reserved space and climbed slowly to their apartment outside blair hesitated remembering the recall to washington hed tell her tomorrow he determined not tonight tonight was going to be a shock shed need something tomorrow poor ann poor lovely adorable ann blair hesitated a few moments longer preparing himself and finally went in ann was sitting in the main room close to the matroyshka set he hated something he shouldnt forget to clear and pack tomorrow darling said blair solemnvoiced ive got the most terrible news about jeremy brinkman epilogue could there have been a connection panov was ashenfaced and the hand holding the cigarette had a palsied shake his question was blurred by an outburst of coughing and sokol waited until the chairman recovered before replying a possibility the two were friends he said it had all been resolved by the most incredible luck but no one apart from himself knew that and sokol had cleverly orchestrated all the credit blairs gone and the man king whom they drafted in with the cover of temporary archivist confirmed sokol weve kept krasnaya under observation for two months now the new man hasnt been there once there was another outburst of coughing and sokol waited patiently eventually the kgb chairman said weve been able to mount a very effective propaganda campaign because of the position of brinkmans father everything has worked out most satisfactorily not completely thought sokol im still waiting for the announcement he said im glad the congratulations this time dont just come from me said panov ive been asked to express them on the part of the politburo as well thats extremely gratifying said sokol properly modest was today going to be the day it is necessary for me to retire declared panov clearing his throat as if to indicate the reason he smiled across the desk of course that will mean changes it was to be today thought sokol he said hoping the excitement wasnt obvious in his voice of course i understand ive already made clear the admiration that the politburo have for you not just for the brinkman affair they fully realise how well you contained the disruption following the famine the chairmans pause this time was for the other man to assimilate the praise they feel panov began again that there is no one else at the required echelon within the organisation who could fulfil as well as yourself the position of deputy in charge of the second chief directorate and i of course
