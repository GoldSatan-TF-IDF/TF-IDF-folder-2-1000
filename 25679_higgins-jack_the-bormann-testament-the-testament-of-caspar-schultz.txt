jack higgins the bormann testament the testament of caspar schultz the first book in the paul chavasse series previously published as the testament of caspar schultz authors note ive explored the history of nazi germany and the second world war in a number of novels the most famous of them being the eagle has landed for me the german connection has always been very personal during the cold war i soldiered in the royal horse guards in berlin and patrolled the east german border trying to stem the flood both of illegal refugees fleeing to the west as well as gangs of black marketers usually exss who operated out of east germany using it as a refuge my uncle a regular soldier in the british army and a former prisoner of war married a german war widow her nephew konrad was a chief inspector in the hamburg criminal investigation department and during the war had been drafted into the gestapo which needed experienced detectives his stories about the top nazis he had met fired my imagination particularly anything to do with martin bormann hitlers righthand man who according to legend escaped from the bunker in berlin in the last few days of the war so the bormann testament was born for legal and security reasons however my publishers in were only prepared to put it out if changes were made the major result was that martin bormann vanished from the book and a fictional nazi leader took over as indicated by the title under which the novel was finally published the testament of caspar schultz but times have changed and this present offering after so many years is a return to what the original intended and a little more jack higgins london germany chapter chavasse lay with his head pillowed on one arm and stared up at the ceiling through the darkness he was tired more tired than he had been in a long time and yet he couldnt sleep he switched on the bedside lamp and reached for a cigarette as he struck a match the telephone started to ring he lifted the receiver quickly and a womans voice sounded in his ear cool and impersonal paul is that you he pushed himself up against the pillow whos speaking jean frazer your flight got into london airport from greece three hours ago why havent you checked in whats the rush chavasse said i made a preliminary report from athens yesterday ill see the chief in the morning youll see him now jean frazer said and youd better hurry hes been waiting for you since that flight got in chavasse frowned what the hell for ive just done two months in greece and it wasnt pleasant im entitled to a nights sleep at least youre breaking my heart she told him calmly now get your clothes on like a good little boy ill send a car round for you her receiver clicked into place and he cursed softly and threw back the bedclothes he pulled on a pair of pants and padded across to the bathroom in his bare feet his eyes were gritty from lack of sleep and there was a bad taste in his mouth he filled a glass with water and drank it slowly savoring its freshness and then quickly rinsed his head and shoulders in cold water as he toweled himself dry he examined his face in the mirror there were dark circles under the eyes and faint lines of fatigue had drawn the skin tightly over the high cheekbones that were a heritage from his french father it was a handsome even an aristocratic face the face of a scholar and somehow the ugly puckered scar of the old gunshot wound in the left shoulder looked incongruous and out of place he fingered the flesh beneath the gray eyes and sighed christ but you look like hell he said softly and the face in the mirror was illuminated by a smile of great natural charm it was one of his most important assets he ran a hand over the twoday stubble of beard on his chin decided against shaving and returned to the bedroom as he dressed rain tapped against the window with ghostly fingers and when he left the flat ten minutes later he was wearing an old trench coat the car was waiting at the bottom of the steps when he went outside and he climbed in beside the driver and sat there in silence staring morosely into the night as they moved through deserted rainswept streets he was tired tired of living out of a suitcase of hopping from one country to another of being all things to all men and someone very different on the inside for the first time in five years he wondered why he didnt pack it all in and then they turned in through the gates of the familiar house in st johns wood and he grinned ruefully and pushed the thought away from him the car braked to a halt before the front door and he got out without a word to the driver and mounted the steps he pressed the bell beside the polished brass plate that carried the legend brown amp company importers amp exporters and waited after a few moments the door opened and a tall graying man in a blue serge suit stood to one side a slight smile on his face nice to see you back mr chavasse chavasse grinned and punched him lightly on the shoulder as he passed youre looking fine joe he went up the curving regency staircase and passed along a thickly carpeted corridor the only sound was a slight persistent hum from the dynamo in the radio room but he moved past the door and mounted two steps into another corridor here the silence was absolute and he opened a large whitepainted door at the far end and went in the room was small and plainly furnished with a desk in one corner on which stood a typewriter and several telephones jean frazer was bending over a filing cabinet and she looked up a slight smile on her round intelligent face she removed her spectacles with one hand and frowned you look pretty rough chavasse grinned i usually do at this time of the morning she was wearing a plain white blouse and a tweed skirt of deceptively simple cut that molded her rounded hips his eyes followed her approvingly as she walked across to her desk and sat down he sat on the edge of the desk and helped himself to a cigarette from a packet that was lying there he lit it and blew out a cloud of smoke with a sigh of satisfaction now whats all the fuss about whats the chief got on his mind thats so important it cant wait until a respectable hour she shrugged why dont you ask him yourself hes waiting for you inside he frowned slightly another job already she nodded i think its something pretty big chavasse cursed softly and got to his feet what does he think im made of iron without waiting for a reply he walked across to the far door opened it and went in the room was half in shadow the only light the shaded lamp that stood upon the desk by the window the chief was reading a sheaf of typewritten documents and he looked up quickly a slight frown on his face it was replaced by a smile and he waved a hand toward a chair so they finally managed to locate you paul sit down and tell me about greece chavasse slumped into the chair and pushed his hat back from his forehead didnt you get my coded report from the embassy in athens the chief nodded i had a quick look at it when it came in yesterday it seems satisfactory any loose ends chavasse shrugged one or two your hunch about skiros was right he was a double agent been working for the commies for the past four years theyll have to wait a long time for his next report the chief selected a cigarette from a silver box and lit it carefully how did you manage it i traced him to lesbos chavasse said he was having a skindiving holiday unfortunately something went wrong with his aqualung one afternoon by the time they got him back to the beach it was too late the chief sighed most unfortunate chavasse leaned across the desk now ive explained the finer points of the affair perhaps i can go back to bed he got to his feet and crossed to the window i feel as if i havent slept for a month he stood there staring out into the rain for a moment and then turned abruptly to be perfectly frank on the way over here i was considering packing things in the chief raised his eyebrows in surprise could you see yourself going back to lecturing in a provincial university he shook his head not a chance paul youre the best man ive got one of these days youll be sitting behind this desk if i live that long chavasse said sourly the chief gestured to the chair come and sit down and have another cigarette you always feel like this when a jobs over especially when youve killed somebody what you need is a long rest then what about it chavasse said christ knows ive earned one this last years been hell i know paul i know the chief said soothingly and ill see you get one after this next job chavasse turned from the window angrily for gods sake am i the only man the bureaus got what about wilson or lacosta the chief shook his head i sent wilson to ankara last month he disappeared his second day there im afraid well have to cross him off the list and lacosta he cracked up after that affair in cuba ive put him into the home for six months the chief sighed i had a psychiatrists report this morning frankly it wasnt too good im afraid we wont be able to use lacosta again chavasse moved across to his chair and slumped down into it he helped himself to a cigarette from the box the chief held out to him and lit it with a steady hand after a while he smiled all right i give in youd better put me in the picture the chief got to his feet i knew youd see it my way paul and dont worry youll get that holiday this affair shouldnt take you more than a couple of weeks at the most where am i going chavasse said simply west germany the chief walked to the window and spoke without turning round what do you know about martin bormann chavasse frowned one of the top nazis probably killed in the final holocaust in berlin when the russians moved in wasnt he in the bunker with hitler till the very end the chief turned and nodded we know that for certain he was last reported trying to break out of the city in a tank what actually happened we dont know but certainly his body was never identified chavasse shrugged thats hardly surprising a lot of people died when the russians moved in the chief moved back to the desk and sat down from time to time there have been vague rumors about bormann one of them said that he was living in the argentine another that he was farming in ireland we checked these stories very carefully but they proved to have no foundation in fact chavasse straightened slowly and now youve had another report something a little more substantial this time the chief nodded do you know sir george harvey chavasse frowned slightly wasnt he minister of intelligence for a time in the coalition government during the war thats the man the chief said he retired from politics after the war to concentrate on his business interests yesterday he went to the foreign office with a very strange story the foreign secretary sent him straight to me id like you to hear what he has to say he pressed a buzzer on his desk twice after a moment the door opened and jean ushered in a tall graying man in his early sixties she went out closing the door softly behind her and the chief got to his feet come in sir george id like you to meet paul chavasse the young man i was telling you about earlier chavasse stood up and they shook hands sir george harvey had obviously kept himself in good condition his handclasp was strong his face tanned and the clipped mustache gave him a faintly military appearance he smiled pleasantly and sat down ive been hearing some very complimentary things about you mr chavasse chavasse grinned and offered him a cigarette ive had my share of luck sir george took one and smiled again in your game you need it my friend the chief struck a match and held it out in cupped hands i wonder if youd mind telling chavasse here exactly what you told me sir george sir george nodded and leaned back in his chair he turned slightly toward chavasse among my many business interests mr chavasse i hold a great number of shares in a publishing house which shall remain nameless yesterday morning the managing director came to see me with an extraordinary letter he and his board felt that it should be placed before the foreign secretary as soon as possible and knowing that i was a personal friend of his they asked me to handle the affair who was the letter from chavasse said a german called hans muller sir george told him this man states in the letter that martin bormann is alive he says that he lived in portugal until when he returned to germany where he has since been living quietly under an assumed name but what does he want with a publishing firm chavasse asked im coming to that sir george told him if the letter is to be believed bormann has written his memoirs and wants them published with muller acting as middleman chavasse said but why hasnt he tried a german publisher i should have thought that such a book would have been an even bigger sensation over there than in england apparently muller did just that sir george said unfortunately he chose the wrong publishers he wrote them a similar letter and within hours had the nazi underground hot on his trail according to muller in what might be described as an extremely illuminating manner bormann has written about many people in germany who up to now have always affirmed that they never really supported hitler very important people i might add he even deals with nazi sympathizers here in england and includes a chapter on the man who was prepared to act as our quisling in when the german invasion was expected chavasse whistled softly does he give any names in the letter sir george shook his head no he simply states that he has the manuscript and that it is handwritten by bormann himself a fact which can of course be verified and that there is only one copy needless to say the sum of money he mentioned was rather large ill bet it was chavasse said if only the poor fool realized it hes carrying a time bomb around with him he turned to the chief i havent worked in germany for nearly three years how strong are the nazis now a lot stronger than most people realize the chief said ever since the german government set up the office for the detection of war crimes at ludwigsburg its been engaged in a battle of wits with the nazi underground senior exss officers have managed to infiltrate into the police because of this the nazi intelligence service has been able to warn a number of former ss camp officials who were about to be arrested this has given many of them a chance to escape to the united arab republic but there are still plenty left in high places that fact is impossible to dispute theyre in the government in big business the chief laughed ironically muller must have found that out to his cost when he wrote to that german publishing company does he name the firm the chief shook his head he didnt even give his own address said hed get in touch by phone and did he the chief nodded six oclock last night on the dot just as he said he would the managing director took the call he told muller they were definitely interested and made arrangements for a director of the firm to meet him and thats me i suppose correct the chief said i want you to cross to the hook of holland by the afternoon boat youll catch the northwest express for hamburg he opened a drawer and took out a large envelope youll find everything you need in there new passport in your own name but changing your occupation to publisher money for expenses and a few other things that might come in useful why the night train to hamburg chavasse asked im coming to that the chief told him ive got you a firstclass sleepingcar berth in a reserved compartment youll find the tickets in the envelope muller will board the train at osnabruck a few minutes before midnight and come straight to your compartment and what do i do with him once ive got him the chief shrugged its entirely up to you i want that manuscript but more than that i want bormann as it happens sir george is going to hamburg on the same train to attend the united nations peace conference thats one of the reasons ive rushed these arrangements through without discussing them with you string muller along tell him you must see the manuscript or at least part of it if necessary call sir george in to meet him tell him that sir george has a big interest in the firm that the publishers have asked him to accompany you as an evidence of their good faith sir george got to his feet yes indeed mr chavasse you can rely on me to do anything i can to help he smiled its like old times being on the inside of a thing like this but now if youll excuse me i really must go the train leaves liverpool street at ten and id like an hour or two in bed before then he held out his hand with a smile if youll take my advice young man youll do the same thing you look as though you could do with it ill see you on the train i hope the chief ushered him out of the door and then came back he sat down behind his desk well what do you think chavasse shrugged it all depends on muller have we got anything on him ive had the files checked the chief said but this seems to be the first time weve come into contact with him of course we have no description and he may have used another name previously did he say what his connection was with bormann the chief shook his head that also is a complete mystery im afraid chavasse picked up the envelope that contained his passport and tickets and slipped it into his pocket what about german intelligence will they be in on this the chief shook his head i thought about that but decided against it for the moment i dont want things to get confused if the affair gets out of hand and you decide you need some local help telephone me here ask for mr taylor and use the name cunningham just say that business is booming and you could use some help ill bring german intelligence into it at that point chavasse nodded slowly and got to his feet that seems to be everything i think ill take sir georges advice and go back to bed he started to move to the door and then paused by the way how much can i count on him on sir george harvey the chief shrugged well hes an important man and we dont want any international scandals i think youll find hell do anything within reason to help he was a great success at the ministry during the war you know chavasse nodded ill try not to use him if i can help it but he might be just the extra thing needed to make muller believe im on the level thats what i thought the chief said he came round the desk and held out his hand anyway good luck paul i think youll find this is a pretty straightforward job whatever happens ill see you get that holiday after its all over chavasse opened the door and halfturned a curious smile on his lips im sure you will he said dryly and closed the door before the chief could reply jean frazer had gone and judging by the neat and orderly condition of her desktop and the cover on the typewriter she was not coming back he went slowly downstairs his mind going back over the interview recalling each remark made by the chief and sir george shaping them into a coherent whole the car was waiting for him outside and he climbed in beside the driver and sat hunched in his seat wrapped in thought all the way back to the flat one thing puzzled him assuming the whole thing was genuine and not a hoax then why had bormann decided on this time rather than on any other to offer his memoirs for publication the war had been over for fifteen years years during which bormann had successfully evaded discovery by the intelligence agents of all the great powers why then should he now set off on an undertaking that by its very nature would start the most colossal manhunt in history with himself as the quarry chavasse was still thinking about it as he undressed at the flat but it was a problem that could have no solution for the time being only hans muller could supply the answer he brewed a pot of coffee and got into bed it was just after three am and the rain drummed steadily against the windows he lit a cigarette and opened the envelope that the chief had given him theyd done a good job on the passport it had been issued four years previously and was true in all personal particulars except for his occupation he had apparently been to the continent several times during the period and once to america he memorized the dates quickly and then examined the other documents his tickets were all in order and so were the travelers checks there was also a current driving license and a members ticket for a city luncheon club finally he had been supplied with several letters that purported to be from business contacts and one couched in affectionate terms from a girl called cynthia he read the letter through with interest it was goods very good indeed he wondered whether the chief had gotten jean frazer to write it and there was a smile on his face when he finally switched off the lamp and turned his face into the pillow chapter the train started to slow down as it entered the outskirts of rheine and chavasse put down the book he had been reading and checked his watch it was eleven pm they were due at osnabruck in just under an hour he pulled on his jacket and went out into the corridors as the train came to a halt the sleepingcar attendant who was standing nearby opened one of the doors and stepped down onto the platform obeying a sudden impulse chavasse followed him and stood there hands in pockets drawing the cold night air deep into his lungs the platform was almost deserted and no one seemed to be getting on or off he was about to get back into the train when a group of men emerged from the waiting room and came toward him the one who led the way was a tall heavily built man with an ironhard face and eyes like chips of blue ice behind him came two attendants in white coats carrying a man on a stretcher the man who brought up the rear wore a homburg hat and an expensive overcoat with a fur collar his gaunt face was halfcovered by a carefully trimmed black beard that looked as if it had been dyed chavasse moved out of the way and the two attendants carefully maneuvered the stretcher onto the train and into the next apartment to his own the other two men followed them in and closed the door as chavasse climbed back into the corridor he turned inquiringly to the attendant who had followed him what was all that about he asked in german the man shrugged the toughlooking one is inspector steiner of the hamburg police the bearded man is called kruger hes one of the bestknown physicians in hamburg and the man on the stretcher a criminal theyre taking back to hamburg the attendant said he was injured in a fight with the police and they called in dr kruger to see whether he was fit to be moved chavasse nodded i see thanks very much a pleasure the attendant said is there anything else i can get you chavasse shook his head not at the moment perhaps a coffee a little later on ill let you know the man nodded and walked away and chavasse went back into his compartment he sat on the edge of the bunk and checked his watch again three quarters of an hour and the train would be in osnabruck there would be a light tap on the door it would open and hans muller would walk in he wondered what the man would look like what his first words would be and then it occurred to him that perhaps muller wouldnt show up for some obscure reason the thought vaguely amused him and he lit a cigarette feeling suddenly sanguine about the whole thing he decided to pay sir george harvey a visit so far they had only had time for a brief word on the boat coming over it was probably a good moment to put him in the picture he opened the door of the compartment and walked out into the corridor cannoning heavily into someone who was coming from the opposite direction there was a muffled curse and he was sent staggering backward by a strong push he straightened his tie and moved forward facing him was an american army sergeant whose jaw stuck out belligerently why the hell cant you look where youre going buddy the man asked chavasse took a deep breath of corn whiskey and forced a smile im sorry i didnt see you there the american seemed to undergo a change of attitude he swayed forward and patted chavasse on the shoulder thats okay pally we all make mistakes his eyes swam myopically enormously magnified by the thick lenses of his steelrimmed spectacles and his peaked cap was tilted forward over his nose making him look faintly ridiculous he patted chavasse on the shoulder again sidled past him and lurched away chavasse moved along the corridor pausing outside the end compartment he knocked and went in sir george was sitting at a small collapsible table writing a letter he looked up with a smile and laid down his pen ah mr chavasse i was hoping to see you im afraid ive been rather busy with various matters concerning this peace conference is everything under control chavasse nodded as far as possible well be in osnabruck in about forty minutes i thought id better have a chat with you before we arrive sir george poured sherry into two glasses and handed him one do you anticipate any trouble with muller chavasse shook his head not really i should imagine hes going through hell at the moment probably frightened of his own shadow all i want to do is gain his confidence and make him believe im what im supposed to be i dont want to use you if i can help it but if he turns awkward or gets suspicious then i might have to call on you with any luck that should clinch things do you think hell have the manuscript with him hell be a damn fool if he does chavasse said ill try and make arrangements to meet him at some later date to see the manuscript from that point anything can happen but im hoping the trail will lead me to bormann well drink to that sir george said and refilled his glass after a moments silence he said inquiringly chavasse thats a french name isnt it chavasse nodded my father was a lawyer in paris but my mother was english he was an officer in the reserve killed at arras when the panzers broke through in i was only eleven at the time my mother and i came out through dunkirk so you werent old enough to serve in the war sir george carefully lit a small cigar and carried on i was in the first lot you know lieutenant at twenty lieutenant colonel at twentyfour promotion was quick in those days it must have been pretty rough chavasse said oh i dont know sir george told him there was a wonderful spirit abroad people still clung to the old values it was after the war that the rot set in the lost generation chavasse said sir george stared back into the past and sighed everything changed nothing was ever quite the same again i went into politics like many others with the intention of doing something about it but we were too late a civilization in decline chavasse said one could draw a remarkable parallel between the british and roman empires sir george said universal suffrage and the voice of the mob leading to an internal weakness and eventual collapse the barbarians at the gates he got to his feet and smiled if i sound like an oldfashioned imperialist forgive me frankly i look back on the days of empire with nostalgia however we could talk in this vein all night and that wont do at all chavasse glanced at his watch in exactly twenty minutes they would be in osnabruck he opened the door and moved out into the corridor whatever happens ill keep in touch where are you staying in hamburg the atlantic sir george said by all means contact me there if you dont need me tonight to help deal with muller ill be interested to know what happens chavasse closed the door and moved back along the corridor as he paused outside his compartment he heard a faint sound of movement inside he flung the door open and moved in quickly the american army sergeant turned from the bunk an expression of alarm on his face he lurched forward and stood swaying in front of chavasse one hand braced against the wall he seemed completely befuddled guess i made a mistake he said thickly it seems like it chavasse replied the american started to squeeze past him i dont feel so good travel sickness it always gets me i had to go to the can i must be in the wrong coach for a brief moment chavasse stood in his way gazing into the eyes that peered anxiously at him from behind thick lenses and then he moved to one side without a word the american lurched past and staggered away along the corridor chavasse closed the door and stood with his back to it everything looked normal enough and yet he felt vaguely uneasy there was something wrong about the american something larger than life he was more like a figure from a cheap burlesque show the pathetic clown who spent his life walking into bedrooms where showgirls were pulling on their underwear and then blundered around shortsightedly while the audience roared chavasses suitcase was on the top bunk and he took it down and opened it it was still neatly packed just as he had left it except for one thing his handkerchiefs had originally been at the bottom of the case now they were on top it was the sort of mistake anyone might make even an expert especially when he was in a hurry he closed the case put it back on the top bunk and checked his watch the train would be in osnabruck in fifteen minutes it was impossible for him to do anything about the american until after he had seen muller there was a discreet tap on the door and the attendant entered a tray balanced on one hand coffee mein herr chavasse nodded yes i think i will the man quickly filled a cup and handed it to him chavasse helped himself to sugar and said are we on time the attendant shook his head about five minutes late can i get you anything else chavasse said no and the man bade him good night and went out closing the door behind him the coffee wasnt as hot as it could have been and chavasse drained the cup quickly and sat on the edge of his bunk it was warm in the compartment too warm and his throat had gone curiously dry beads of perspiration oozed from his forehead and trickled down into his eyes he tried to get up but his limbs seemed to be nailed to the bunk something was wrong something was very wrong but then the lightbulb seemed to explode into a thousand fragments that whirled around the room in a glowing nebula and as he fell back across the bunk darkness flooded over him after a while the light seemed to come back again to rush to meet him from the vortex of the darkness and then it became the lightbulb swaying rhythmically from side to side he blinked his eyes several times and it became stationary he was lying on his back on the floor of the compartment and he frowned and tried to remember what had happened but his head ached and his brain refused to function what am i doing here he thought what the hell am i doing here he reached for the edge of the bunk and pulled himself up into a sitting position a man was sitting on the floor in the far corner of the room by the washbasin chavasse closed his eyes and breathed deeply when he opened them again the man was still there there was only one thing wrong his eyes were fixed and staring into eternity where his jacket had fallen open a ragged smokeblackened hole was visible on the lefthand side of the white shirt he had been shot through the heart at close quarters chavasse got to his feet and stood looking down at the body his mind working sluggishly and then something seemed to surge up from his stomach and he leaned over the basin quickly and vomited he poured water into a glass and drank it slowly and after a moment or two he felt better there was a bruise on his right cheek and a streak of blood where the skin had been torn he examined it in the mirror with a frown and then glanced at his watch it was twelvefifteen that meant that the train had already passed through osnabruck and was speeding through the night toward bremen even before he examined the body chavasse knew in his heart what he was going to find the man was small and dark with thinning hair and his cheeks were cold and waxlike to the touch the fingers of his right hand were curved like hooks reaching out toward a wad of banknotes that lay scattered under the washbasin it was in the inside pocket that chavasse found what he was looking for there was a membership card for a club on the reeperbahn in hamburg in the name of hans muller a faded snapshot of him in a luftwaffe uniform with his arm round a girl and several letters from someone called lilli addressed to a hotel in gluckstrasse hamburg chavasse slowly got to his feet his mind working rapidly as he turned away from the body his eyes fell upon the mauser automatic pistol lying in the corner as he bent to pick it up there was a thunderous knocking on the door and it was flung open inspector steiner was standing there the attendant peering anxiously over his shoulder herr chavasse steiner said politely i regret to trouble you but the attendant reports hearing a shot from this compartment have you any explanation at the same moment he saw the mauser lying on the floor and picked it up the attendant gasped in horror and steiner pushed chavasse back into the compartment and followed him in chavasse sat on the edge of the bunk and steiner examined the body quickly after a moment he called the attendant in what is your name he said schmidt herr steiner the attendant said otto schmidt his face had turned a sickly yellow color pull yourself together steiner snapped have you ever seen this man before schmidt nodded he boarded the train at osnabruck herr steiner and then steiner asked schmidt glanced furtively at chavasse i saw him enter this compartment steiner nodded i see ask dr kruger to step in here schmidt went out into the corridor and steiner turned and held out his hand chavasse realized that he was still holding the things he had taken from mullers pocket and handed them over steiner examined the letters quickly and grunted this man hans muller who was he why did you kill him chavasse shrugged you tell me steiner bent down and picked up the wad of banknotes from beneath the washbasin he held them up in one hand i dont think we have to look very far my friend unless you are going to try to tell me this money is yours chavasse shook his head no it isnt mine steiner nodded in satisfaction good then we are getting somewhere there was a quarrel perhaps over this money he struck you there is the mark of the blow on your cheek and a cut caused by the rather ornate ring worn on the middle finger of his right hand and then i shot him chavasse said helpfully steiner shrugged you must admit it looks that way at that moment kruger came into the compartment he glanced inquiringly at steiner who nodded toward the body kruger frowned and dropped down onto one knee after a brief examination he stood up a clean shot through the heart death must have been instantaneous steiner put the money into one of his pockets and became suddenly businesslike have you anything further to tell me before i take you into custody herr chavasse chavasse shook his head no i dont think so theres just one thing id like to ask schmidt if i may he turned to the attendant before steiner could reply tell me schmidt is there an american army sergeant traveling on the train schmidt looked genuinely bewildered an american army sergeant mein herr no you must be mistaken chavasse smiled gently somehow i thought i was he got to his feet and turned to steiner well where do we go inspector steiner looked inquiringly at schmidt have you got an empty compartment yes herr steiner schmidt said in one of the other coaches kruger stood to one side and steiner pushed chavasse into the corridor the noise of the voices had brought several people to the doors of their compartments and as chavasse followed schmidt along the corridor people stared curiously at him sir george harvey was standing outside his compartment a bewildered expression on his face as they approached he seemed about to raise a hand but chavasse frowned and shook his head slightly sir george stepped back into his compartment and closed the door chavasse had decided a good ten minutes earlier that there was little point in sitting in a hamburg jail for six months while lawyers argued over his ultimate fate as they passed through the second coach a plan had already started to form in his mind the empty compartment was at the far end of the third coach and by the time they reached it he was ready schmidt bent down to unlock the door and chavasse waited steiner close behind him as the door started to open chavasse pushed his hand into schmidts back sending him staggering into the compartment at the same moment he whirled on the ball of one foot and rammed the stiffened fingers of his left hand into steiners throat the policeman collapsed on the floor of the corridor chavasse quickly closed the compartment door cutting off schmidts cry of alarm and turned the key in the lock then he stepped over steiners writhing body and ran back the way they had come his intention was to reach the sanctuary of sir george harveys compartment there he would be safe at least until they reached hamburg but first it was necessary to make steiner believe he had left the train he turned the corner at the end of the corridor and reached for the handle of the emergencystop lever above the door as the train started to slow he opened the door and the cold night air sucked it outward sending it smashing back against the side of the coach he moved on quickly into the next coach he was almost at the end of the corridor and within a few yards of sir georges compartment when he heard voices coming toward him for a moment he hesitated and then as he turned to run the door of the compartment opened silently a hand reached out and pulled him backward through the doorway he lost his balance and fell to the floor behind him the door clicked firmly into place he started to move ready to come up like a steel spring uncoiling with explosive force but he paused one knee still on the floor lying on the bunk in front of him was an american army uniform with the sergeants stripes showing on the neatly folded tunic on top of the tunic rested a military cap and on top of the cap a pair of thicklensed steelrimmed spectacles chapter the man who leaned against the door held an italian beretta automatic negligently in his right hand he was of medium build and his eyes seemed very blue in the tawny face an amused smile twisted the corners of his mouth you do seem to have stirred things up old man he said in an impeccable english accent the train had finally come to a stop and there was shouting in the corridor outside chavasse listened keenly and managed to distinguish steiners voice he scrambled to his feet and the man said steiner doesnt sound very pleased what did you do to him chavasse shrugged judo throat jab a nasty trick but i didnt have time to observe the niceties he nodded toward the automatic you can put that thing away no rough stuff i promise you the man smiled and slipped the gun into his pocket i wasnt sure how youd react when i dragged you in here he extracted a leatherandgold cigarette case from his inside pocket and flicked it open chavasse took a cigarette and leaned across for the proffered light he hadnt been working for the chief for five years without being able to tell a professional when he saw one people in his line of business carried a special aura around with them indefinable and yet sensed at once by the trained agent one could even work out the nationality by attitude methods employed and other trademarks but in this case he was puzzled who are you he said hardts the name mr chavasse the man told him mark hardt chavasse frowned a german name and yet youre not a german israeli hardt grinned a slightly bastardized form by winchester out of emmanuel college the picture was beginning to take shape israeli intelligence chavasse asked hardt shook his head once upon a time but now nothing so official lets say im a member of an organization which by the very nature of its ends is compelled to work underground i see said chavasse softly and what exactly are your aims at the moment the same as yours hardt said calmly i want that manuscript but even more than that i want bormann before chavasse could reply hardt got to his feet and moved to the door i think id better go into the corridor and see whats going on the door closed behind him and chavasse sat on the edge of the bunk a slight frown on his face as he considered the implications of what hardt had said it was well known that there was at least one strong jewish underground unit that had been working ceaselessly since the end of the war in all parts of the world tracking down nazi war criminals who had evaded the allied net in he had heard that its members were fanatically devoted to their task brave people who had dedicated their lives to bringing some of the inhuman monsters responsible for belsen auschwitz and other hellholes to justice on several occasions during his career with the bureau he had found himself competing with the agents of other powers toward the same end but this was different this was very different the train started to move the door opened and hardt slipped in i just saw steiner hes been raging like a lion up and down the track it was finally pointed out to him that you were probably several miles away by now and he was persuaded to come back on board i dont fancy your chances if he ever manages to get his hands on you ill try to see that he doesnt chavasse nodded toward the american uniform a neat touch your disguise after the crime the criminal simply ceases to exist eh hardt nodded its proved its worth on several occasions although the spectacles can be a bit of a nuisance i cant see a damned thing in them he locked the door pulled a stool from beneath the bunk and sat on it his shoulders resting comfortably against the wall dont you think its time we got down to business chavasse nodded all right but you first how much do you know about this affair before i start just tell me one thing hardt said it is muller who is dead isnt it i heard one of the other passengers say something about a shooting and then steiner marched you along the corridor chavasse nodded i had a cup of coffee just before osnabruck whatever was in it put me out for a good half hour when i came round muller was lying in the corner shot through the heart a neat frame on somebodys part as a matter of fact i thought it was your handiwork chavasse told him what exactly were you looking for in my compartment anything i could find hardt said i knew muller was supposed to meet you at osnabruck i didnt expect him to be carrying the manuscript but i thought he might take you to it even to bormann and you intended to follow us chavasse said naturally hardt told him chavasse lit another cigarette just tell me one thing how the hell do you know so much hardt smiled we first came across muller a fortnight ago when he approached a certain german publisher and offered him bormanns manuscript how did you manage to find out about that this particular publisher is a man weve been after for three years now we had a girl planted in his office she tipped us off about muller did you actually meet him hardt shook his head unfortunately the publisher got some of his nazi friends on the job muller was living in bremen at the time he left one jump ahead of them and us and you lost track of him i presume hardt nodded until we heard about you id like to know how you managed that chavasse said it should be most interesting hardt grinned an organization like ours has friends everywhere when muller approached the firm of publishers youre supposed to be representing the directors had a word with sir george harvey one of their biggest shareholders he got in touch with the foreign secretary who put the matter in the hands of the bureau chavasse frowned what do you know about the bureau i know its a special organization formed to handle the dirtier and more complicated jobs hardt said the sort of things mi and the secret service dont want to touch but how did you know i was traveling on this train to meet muller chavasse said remember that the arrangement with muller by which he was supposed to contact you at osnabruck was made through the managing director of the publishing firm he was naturally supposed to keep the details to himself presumably he didnt hardt nodded i suppose it was too good a tale to keep from his fellow directors and he told them everything over dinner that same evening luckily one of them happens to be sympathetic to our work and thought we might be interested he got in touch with our man in london who passed the information over to me at once as i was in hamburg it was rather short notice but i managed to get a midmorning flight to rotterdam and joined the train there that still doesnt explain how the people who killed muller knew we were supposed to meet on this train chavasse said i cant see how there could possibly have been another leak from the london end i dont think its very probable that theres also a nazi sympathizer on the board of directors of the firm im supposed to be representing hardt shook his head as a matter of fact ive got a theory about that muller was living in bremen with a woman called lilli pahl she was pulled out of the elbe this morning apparently a suicide case and you think she was murdered hardt nodded she disappeared from bremen when muller did so theyve probably been living together my theory is that the other side knew where he was all along that they were leaving him alone hoping hed lead them to bormann i think muller gave them the slip and left hamburg for osnabruck last night that left them with only one person who probably knew where he had gone and why lilli pahl ill go along with that chavasse said it sounds reasonable enough but it still doesnt explain why they shot him hardt shrugged muller could have been carrying the manuscript but i dont think thats very likely i should imagine the shooting was an accident muller probably jumped the person who was waiting for him in your compartment and was killed in the struggle chavasse frowned considering everything hardt had told him after a while he said theres still one thing which puzzles me muller is dead and that means ive come to a dead end as far as finding bormann goes i cant be of any possible use to you so what made you go to the trouble of saving my skin you could say im sentimental hardt told him i have a soft spot for israeli sympathizers and how would you know that is what i am do you recall a man named joel ben david hardt asked he was an israeli intelligence agent in cairo in you saved his life and enabled him to return to israel with information which was of great service to our army during the sinai campaign i remember chavasse said but i wish youd forget about it it could get me into hot water in certain quarters i wasnt supposed to be quite so violently partisan at the time but we jews do not forget our friends hardt said quietly chavasse was suddenly uncomfortable why are you so keen to get hold of bormann he isnt another eichmann theres bound to be an outcry for an international trial even the russians would want a hand in it hardt shook his head i dont think so in any case we arent too happy about the idea of leaving him in germany for trial for this reason theres a statute of limitations in force under german law cases of manslaughter must be tried within fifteen years of the crime murder within twenty years chavasse frowned you mean bormann might not even come to trial hardt shrugged who knows anything might happen he got to his feet and paced restlessly across the compartment we are not butchers chavasse we dont intend to lead bormann to the sacrificial stone with the whole of jewry shouting hosannas we want to try him for the same reason we have tried eichmann so that his monstrous crimes might be revealed to the world so that people will not forget how men treat their brothers his eyes sparkled with fire he was held in the grip of a fervor that seemed almost religious something that possessed his heart and soul so that all other things were of no importance to him a dedicated man chavasse said softly i thought theyd gone out of fashion hardt paused one hand raised in the air and stared at him and then he laughed and color flooded his face im sorry at times i get carried away but there are worse things for a man to do than something he believes in how did you come to get mixed up in this sort of thing chavasse asked hardt sat down on the bunk my people were german jews luckily my father had the foresight in to see what was coming he moved to england with my mother and me and he prospered i was never particularly religious i dont think i am now it was a wild adolescent impulse which made me leave cambridge in and journey to palestine by way of an illegal immigrants boat from marseilles i joined haganah and fought in the first arab war and that turned you into a zionist hardt smiled and shook his head it turned me into an israeli theres a difference you know i saw young men dying for a belief i saw girls who should have been in school sitting behind machine guns until that time my life hadnt meant a great deal after that it had a sense of purpose chavasse sighed and offered him a cigarette you know in some ways i think i envy you hardt looked surprised but surely you believe in what you are doing in your work your country its political aims do i chavasse shook his head im not so sure there are men like me working for every great power in the world ive got more in common with my opposite number in the kgb than i have with any normal citizen of my own country if im told to do a thing i get it done i dont ask questions men like me live by one code only the job must come before anything else he laughed harshly if id been born a few years earlier and a german id probably have worked for the gestapo then why did you help joel ben david in cairo hardt said it hardly fits into the pattern you describe chavasse shrugged and said carelessly thats my one weakness i get to like people and sometimes it makes me act unwisely before hardt could reply he went on by the way i searched muller before steiner arrived on the scene there were some letters in his inside pocket from this lilli pahl you mentioned the address was a hotel in gluckstrasse hamburg hardt frowned thats strange i should have thought hed have used another name did you find anything else an old photo chavasse said must have been taken during the war he was wearing a luftwaffe uniform and standing with his arm around a young girl hardt look up sharply are you sure about that that it was a luftwaffe uniform he was wearing chavasse nodded quite sure why do you ask hardt shrugged it probably isnt important i understood he was in the army thats all my information must have been incorrect after a moment of silence he went on this hotel in gluckstrasse might be worth investigating chavasse shook his head too dangerous dont forget steiner knows about the place i should imagine hell have it checked but not straightaway hardt said if i go there as soon as we reach hamburg i should be well ahead of the police after all theres no particular urgency from their point of view chavasse nodded i think youve got something there then there remains only one thing to decide hardt said and that is what you are going to do i know what id like to do chavasse said have five minutes alone with schmidt the sleepingcar attendant who served me that coffee id like to know who hes working for i think youd better leave me to handle that for the moment hardt said i can get his address and well visit him later it wouldnt do for you to hang about the hauptbahnhof too long when we reach hamburg then what do you suggest hardt seemed to be thinking hard after a while he appeared to come to a decision before i say anything more i want to know if you are prepared to work with me on this thing chavasse immediately saw the difficulty and stated it what happens if we find the manuscript who gets it hardt shrugged we can make a copy and bormann we cant copy him well cross that bridge when we come to it chavasse shook his head i dont think my chief would see things your way hardt smiled coolly the choice is yours without my help youll get nowhere you see i have an ace up my sleeve something which will probably prove to be the key to the whole affair then what do you need me for chavasse said hardt shrugged i told you before im sentimental he grinned okay ill be honest things are moving faster than i thought they would and at the moment i havent got another man in hamburg i could use you the advantages to be obtained from working with hardt were obvious and chavasse came to a quick decision he held out his hand all right im your man well discuss the division of spoils if and when we get that far good man hardt said listen carefully to what im going to tell you muller had a sister now we know it but i dont think the other side do he always thought she was killed in the incendiary raids during july they only got together again recently shes working as a showgirl at a club in the reeperbahn called the taj mahal calls herself katie holdt ive had an agent working there for the past week shes been trying to get friendly with the girl hoping she might lead us to muller chavasse raised his eyebrows in surprise is your agent a german girl hardt shook his head israeli born of german parents her name is anna hartmann he pulled a large silver ring from the middle finger of his left hand show her this and tell her who you are she knows all about you ask her to take you back to her flat after the last show ill meet you there as soon as i can chavasse slipped the ring onto a finger that seems to settle everything what time do we get to hamburg hardt glanced at his watch about two hours why chavasse grinned because ive been missing a hell of a lot of sleep lately and if its all right with you im going to make use of your top bunk hardt smiled and he got to his feet and pushed the mounting ladder into position you know i like your attitude were going to get on famously i think we can say thats mutual chavasse said he hung his jacket behind the door and then climbed the ladder and lay full length on the top bunk allowing every muscle to relax in turn it was an old trick and one that could only be used when he felt easy in his mind about things because of that special extra sense that was a product of his training and experience he knew that for the moment at any rate the affair was moving very nicely very nicely indeed he turned his face into the pillow and went to sleep at once chapter chavasse looked at his reflection in the mirror he was wearing a white continental raincoat and green hat both of which belonged to hardt he pulled the brim of the hat down over his eyes how do i look hardt slapped him on the shoulder fine just fine there should be a lot of people leaving the train if you do as i suggest youll be outside the station in two minutes you can get a taxi chavasse shook his head dont worry about me its a long time since ive been to hamburg but i can still find my way to the reeperbahn ill see you later then hardt opened the door and looked out and then he stood to one side all clear chavasse squeezed past him and hurried along the deserted corridor the train was coming slowly into the hauptbahnhof and already the platform seemed to be moving past him he passed through one coach after another pushing past people who were beginning to emerge from their compartments until he reached the far end of the train as it stopped he opened a door and stepped onto the platform he was first through the ticket barrier and a moment later he was walking out of the main entrance it was twothirty and at that time in the morning the sbahn wasnt running it was raining slightly a warm drizzle redolent of autumn and obeying a sudden impulse he decided to walk he turned up his coat collar and walked along monckebergstrasse toward st pauli the notorious nightclub district of hamburg the streets were quiet and deserted and as he walked past the magnificent buildings he remembered what hamburg had been at the end of the war not a city but a shambles it seemed incredible that this was a place in which nearly seventy thousand people had been killed in ten days during the great incendiary raids of the summer of germany had certainly risen again like a phoenix from her ashes the reeperbahn was as he remembered it noisy and colorful and incredibly alive even at that time in the morning as he walked amongst the jostling cheerful people he compared it with london at almost three in the morning what was it they called the heart of st pauli die grosse freiheit the great freedom it was an apt title he walked on past the garish neonlit fronts of the nightclubs ignoring the touts who clutched at his sleeve and passed the davidstrasse where young girls could be found in the windows displaying their charms to the prospective customers after asking the way he found the taj mahal in an alley off talstrasse the entrance had been designed to represent an indian temple and the doorman wore ornate robes and a turban chavasse passed in between potted palms and a young woman in a transparent sari relieved him of his hat and coat the interior of the club was on the same lines fake pillars along each side of the long room and more potted palms the waiter who led him to a table was magnificently attired in gold brocade and a red turban although the effect was spoiled by his rimless glasses and westphalian accent chavasse ordered a brandy and looked about him the place was only halffull and everyone seemed a little jaded as if the party had been going on for too long on a small stage a dozen girls posed in a tableau that was meant to represent bath time in the harem in their midst a voluptuous redhead was attempting the dance of the seven veils with a complete lack of artistry the last veil was removed there was a little tired clapping from the audience and the lights went out when they came on again the girls had disappeared the waiter returned with the brandy and chavasse said you have a fraulein hartmann working here how can i get in touch with her the waiter smiled exposing goldcapped teeth nothing could be easier mein herr the girls act as dancehostesses after each show i will point fraulein hartmann out to you when she comes in chavasse gave him a large tip and ordered a half bottle of champagne and two glasses during his conversation with the waiter a small band had been arranging itself on the stage and now they started to play at that moment a door by the entrance to the kitchens opened and the showgirls started to come through as if on cue most of them were young and reasonably attractive and wore dresses that tended to reveal their charms they were all stamped in the same mold with heavily madeup faces and fixed mechanical smiles for the customers he was conscious of a vague irrational disappointment at the thought that one of them must be the girl he was seeking and then as he was about to turn away the door swung open again he did not need the waiters slight nod from the other side of the room to know that this was anna hartmann like the other girls she wore highheeled shoes dark stockings and a sheath dress of black silk that was barely kneelength and clung to her hips like a second skin but there the resemblance ended there was about her a tremendous quality of repose of tranquillity almost she stood just inside the door and gazed calmly about the room and it was as if she had no part in it as if the ugliness of life could not touch her he was filled with a sudden excitement that he found impossible to analyze it was not that she was beautiful her skin was olivehued and the blueblack hair was shoulderlength her rounded face and full curving mouth gave her a faintly sensual appearance and yet her good bone structure and firm chin indicated a strength of character that placed her immediately in a world apart from the other girls she moved forward and heads turned as men looked at her admiringly she skillfully evaded the clutching hand of a drunk and then she was passing chavasses table he stood up and touched her arm quickly fraulein hartmann he said i wonder if youd care to have a drink with me she turned and looked into his face and then she noticed the champagne and two glasses ready and waiting you seem to have gone to considerable trouble herr chavasse he said paul chavasse something seemed to move in the brown eyes but her face betrayed no emotion to anyone watching she was just another of the girls accepting a drink from a customer thats very kind of you herr chavasse champagne is always most acceptable as he sat down he pulled off the ring hardt had given him and pushed it across to her i hope you find this also acceptable fraulein hartmann then he took the bottle of champagne from the ice bucket and opened it as he filled her glass she studied the ring her face quite calm and then slipped it into her handbag when she looked up there was a slight crease between her eyes the sure sign of stress whats happened to mark she said simply chavasse smiled drink your champagne and dont worry were working together now youre supposed to take me back to your flat with you hell meet us there as soon as he can she sipped a little of her champagne and frowned down at the glass as if considering what he had said after a few moments she looked up i think youd better tell me everything herr chavasse he gave her a cigarette and took one himself they leaned across the table like two lovers heads almost touching and he brought her up to date in a few brief sentences when he was finished she sighed so muller is dead what about his sister chavasse said is she here at the moment anna hartmann shook her head im afraid not when she didnt report for work this evening i phoned her apartment her landlady told me that she packed a bag and left this morning without leaving any forwarding address chavasse frowned that isnt so good we dont have a clear lead to follow now theres always the sleepingcar attendant you told me about she said through him you can at least find out something about the opposition youve got a point there he checked his watch and saw that it was almost threethirty i think wed better make a move she smiled im afraid that isnt as easy as it sounds im supposed to work until fourthirty if you want me to leave before that time youll have to pay the management a fee chavasse smiled youre kidding no its quite true she said but first we must have a dance together to make it look good she pulled him to his feet and onto the tiny dance floor before he could protest she slipped one arm around his neck and danced with her head on his shoulder her firm young body pressed so closely against him that he could feel the line from breast to thigh most of the other couples on the crowded dance floor seemed to be dancing in the same way and chavasse whispered in her ear how long are we supposed to keep this up she smiled up at him and there was a hint of laughter in her eyes i think five minutes should be enough have you any objection he shook his head no but if its all right with you id like to relax and enjoy it the smile slipped from her face and she regarded him gravely for a moment and then she turned her head against his shoulder once more and he tightened his arm about her wasist chavasse forgot about the job forgot about everything except the fact that he was dancing with a warm exciting girl whose perfume filled his nostrils and caused a pleasant ache of longing in the pit of his stomach it had been a long time since he had last slept with a woman but that wasnt the whole explanation that anna hartmann attracted him physically was undeniable but there was something more there something deeper they had been dancing for at least fifteen minutes when she at last pulled gently away from him wed better go now she said gravely and led the way back to the table she picked up her handbag and turned with a smile as i said youll have to buy my time otherwise i cant leave she glanced at her watch i think thirty marks should cover it he opened his wallet and counted out the money do you do this often he asked she smiled delightfully her whole face lighting up oh no this will be my very first time until now the manager has despaired of me after this he will go home to his breakfast a happy man she moved away between the tables and disappeared through the door at the rear of the club chavasse called the waiter paid his bill and then he retrieved his hat and coat from the cloakroom he lit a cigarette and stood on the pavement outside the club and after five minutes she joined him she was wearing a fur coat and a silk scarf was tied around her hair peasant fashion do we have far to go he asked as she slipped a hand into his arm and they moved along the street i have a car she said it only takes ten minutes at this time in the morning when the roads are deserted the car was parked round the corner a small battered volkswagen and a moment later they were moving away through the quiet windswept streets she seemed a competent sure driver and chavasse slouched down into his seat and relaxed he was still puzzled by her for one thing she seemed young for the kind of work she was doing and for another there was no hint of the ruthlessness so essential to success she was a warm intelligent and lovely girl and he wondered how the hell she had come to be mixed up in this sort of thing they came to a halt in a narrow street outside an old brownstone apartment house her flat was on the second floor and as they went upstairs she said apologetically not very fancy im afraid but theres an atmosphere of genteel decay about the place which pleases me for some strange reason and its nice and quiet she opened the door and when she switched on the light he found himself in a large comfortable room i must get out of this dress she said excuse me for a moment chavasse lit a cigarette and moved casually around the room on a table by the window he found several hebrew textbooks and an exercise book in which she had obviously been making notes he was leafing through it when she came back into the room she was wearing an embroidered kimono in heavy japanese silk and her hair was tied back with a ribbon i see youve found my homework mark said you were something of an expert on languages do you speak hebrew not enough for it to count he said she went into the kitchen still talking and he followed her i speak it well enough but i still need to practice reading she said he leaned in the doorway and watched her prepare coffee tell me something he said how did a girl like you get mixed up in this sort of game she smiled briefly over her shoulder and then continued with her work its not much of a story im afraid i left school at sixteen and studied economics at the hebrew university in jerusalem after that i went into the israeli army did you see any fighting enough to make me realize i had to do more she said briefly she placed cups and the coffeepot on a tray and then she moved over to a cupboard and took down a tin of cream chavasse watched her as she moved about the small kitchen as she leaned over the table to pick up the tray her kimono tightened outlining the sweet curves of her body and then she turned the tray in her hands and smiled at him no woman had ever smiled at him quite like that it was the sort of smile that went with the surroundings drawing him in enveloping him with a tenderness he had never experienced before as if she sensed what he was thinking the smile disappeared from her face he took the tray from her hands and said gently the coffee smells good she led the way into the other room and they sat down by the empty fireplace and he put the tray on a small table as he poured he said nothing youve told me fully explains why a girl like you should be doing this sort of work she held her cup in both hands and sipped coffee slowly my parents were german refugees who went to palestine during the nazi persecution but im a sabra israeli born and bred it makes me different in a way which would be difficult to explain people like me have been given so much ive never known what it is to suffer as my parents did because of that i have a special responsibility it sounds more like a kingsize guilt complex to me she shook her head no that isnt true i volunteered for this work because i felt i had to do something for my people surely there are other things you could have done back home he said theres a new country to be built but for me it isnt enough this way i feel i can do something for all men not just for my own race chavasse frowned and drank some of his coffee and she sighed im sorry its difficult to put into words but then feelings always are she shrugged and produced a packet of cigarettes from the pocket of her kimono and offered him one if it comes to that how does anyone get into this kind of work what about you for instance he smiled and gave her a light i started as an amateur i was a university lecturer phd in modern languages a friend of mine had an elder sister whod married a czechoslovakian after the war her husband died she wanted to return to england with her two children but the communists wouldnt let her and you decided to get her out he nodded the government couldnt help and as i speak the language i decided to do something unofficially it must have been difficult anna said he smiled how we managed it ill never know but we did i was in hospital in vienna recuperating from a slight injury when the man i work for now came to see me he offered me a job but that still doesnt explain why you took it he shrugged i didnt not straightaway i went back to my university for the following term and what happened he got to his feet and walked across to the window it was still raining and he stared out into the night and tried to get it straight in his own mind finally he said i found that i was spending my life teaching languages to people who in their turn would spend their lives teaching languages to other people it suddenly seemed rather pointless but that isnt a reason she said thats the whole human story but dont you see he said id discovered things about myself that i never knew before that i liked taking a calculated risk and pitting my wits against the opposition on looking back on the czechoslovakian business i realize that in some twisted kind of way id enjoyed it can you understand that im not really sure she said slowly can anyone honestly say they enjoy staring death in the face each day i dont think of that side of it he said any more than a grand prix racing driver does but youre a scholar she said how can you waste all that it takes intelligence to stay alive in this game there was a slight silence and then she sighed dont you ever feel like giving it up he shrugged and said lightly only when its four oclock in the morning and i cant sleep sometimes i lie in the dark with a cigarette and listen to the wind rattling the window frames and i feel alone and completely cut off from the rest of humanity there was a dead somber quality in his voice and she reached across quickly and took one of his hands and can you find no one to share that loneliness a woman you mean he laughed now what could i ever offer a woman long unexplained absences without even a letter to comfort her there was a sudden pity in her eyes and he leaned across and gently covered her hand with his dont feel sorry for me anna he said dont ever feel sorry for me her eyes closed and tears beaded the dark eyelashes he got to his feet suddenly angry and said brutally keep your sorrow for yourself youll need it im a professional and work against professionals men like me obey one law only the job must come first she opened her eyes and looked up at him and dont you think that i live by that law just as fully he pulled her up from the chair dont make me laugh he said you and hardt are dedicated souls amateurs playing with fire she tried to look away and he forced her chin up with one hand could you be ruthless really ruthless i mean could you leave hardt to lie with a bullet in his leg and run on to save yourself something very like horror appeared in her eyes and he said gently ive had to do that on several occasions anna she turned her face into his shoulder and he held her close why didnt you stay back in israel where you belong she raised her head and looked up into his face and she was no longer crying its because i wanted to stay that i had to come she pulled him over to the couch and they sat down as a small girl i lived on a kibbutz near migdal there was a hill i used to climb from the top i could look out over the sea of galilee it was very beautiful but beauty like everything else in life must be paid for can you understand that she was very close to him and he looked down into her eyes and they moved together naturally and easily and kissed they stayed that way for quite some time and after a while she said with a sigh this shouldnt have happened should it he shook his head no very definitely not but i knew it would happen she said from the moment you spoke to me at the club i knew it would happen and why not we are human beings after all are we he said and got to his feet he walked over to the window and lit a cigarette taking his time perhaps you are but i dont think i could change now if i wanted to she walked near and faced him eyes searching his face then what just happened changes nothing for you he nodded somberly except to make me feel even lonelier at four oclock in the morning a sudden determination showed in her face and she was about to reply when there was a knock on the door when she moved across the room and opened it mark hardt came in chapter he wore a dark belted raincoat and his hair was wet from the rain he slipped an arm about annas shoulders and kissed her lightly on the cheek and then he smiled across at chavasse so you found her all right chavasse nodded no trouble at all hardt removed his coat and threw it across a chair and then he walked to the table and sat down anna got another cup from the kitchen and filled it with coffee he drank a little its raining heavier than ever now he looked up at her anything to report she nodded katie holdt didnt come in to work i checked with her landlady apparently she packed a bag and left without leaving any forwarding address he put down the cup i was hoping she might put us onto something in time what about the hotel in gluckstrasse chavasse asked did you find anything of interest only the fact that muller never lived there hardt said he seems to have used the place simply as an address where he could safely pick up his mail and otto schmidt chavasse said any luck there hardt nodded hes a widower lives on his own in an apartment in steinerstrasse thats not too far from here chavasse glanced at his watch it was just after fourthirty how about paying him a visit its amazing what one can sometimes get out of people in the cold gray light of dawn just what i was going to suggest hardt got to his feet and as he reached for his coat he appeared to remember something he turned to the girl by the way anna didnt you tell me that muller had been in the army she nodded a puzzled look on her face thats right why is anything wrong only that according to a photo chavasse found when searching mullers body on the train he was in the luftwaffe but he was in the army anna said ive got an old photo to prove it she picked up her handbag and rummaged through it after a moment she handed it across it fell from katies handbag yesterday after shed been showing it to me it was taken in when she was only a child hardt took the photo and chavasse moved to look over his shoulder the photo was cracked and faded but it was still possible to see the pride in the face of the little girl as she held the hand of the big brother who stood stiffly to attention in his army uniform chavasse frowned but this isnt muller he said to anna she said firmly but it is why would katie holdt lie in any case i can tell that she definitely is the little girl and theres an unmistakable family likeness between her and the soldier it must be her brother then who was the man in your compartment hardt said to chavasse chavasse shook his head he wasnt muller we can be certain of that then what do you think happened chavasse pulled on his raincoat and buttoned it quickly id only be guessing he said and i never like to do that lets say a certain pattern has formed in my mind i think a few words with otto schmidt might go a long way toward completing the picture then well go and see him hardt said he turned to anna well take the car have you got the keys she quickly took them from her bag and handed them across and then she opened the door for them hardt went out without a word but as chavasse descended the stairs he glanced back and saw her still standing there framed in the opening of the door she raised her hand and her mouth moved silently when he looked back again she had closed the door they parked the car around the corner from steinerstrasse and walked the rest of the way hardt found the apartment house with no difficulty and they moved inside schmidts apartment was on the third floor and they paused outside the door and listened there was no sound and chavasse gently tried the door it was locked hardt pressed the bell firmly holding it in position and they waited within a few moments they heard steps approaching the door it opened on a chain and schmidt said sleepily yes who is it police chavasse said gruffly in german come on open up schmidt seemed to come to life at once he disengaged the chain and opened the door as he saw chavasse his jaw dropped chavasse moved in quickly and jabbed a fist into the mans belly before he could cry out schmidt sagged at the knees and started to keel forward chavasse ducked caught him across one shoulder and walked on into the room behind him hardt closed the door and chavasse flung schmidt into a chair he lit a cigarette sat back and waited schmidt looked terrible in the halflight of the nearby table lamp after a while he seemed to have got his breath back chavasse pulled a chair forward and sat in front of him surprised to see me schmidt schmidt looked frightened to death he moistened his lips the police are looking for you herr chavasse nice of you to let me know chavasse said he leaned across and slashed schmidt backhanded across the mouth now lets cut out the polite talk and get down to business the coffee you served me on the train just before we arrived at osnabruck it was drugged wasnt it schmidt made a feeble effort to protest i dont know what you are talking about mein herr chavasse leaned forward i havent got much time schmidt so ill make it brief ill give you about ten seconds to start talking if you dont im going to have to break your left wrist if that doesnt work well try the right one as well schmidts mouth went slack but i darent tell you mein herr if i do hell kill me who will hardt said moving across the room quickly and standing at the back of the chair schmidt looked up at him his eyes round and staring inspector steiner he whispered i thought so chavasse said now were beginning to get somewhere the man who was killed in my compartment was he the man who boarded the train at osnabruck schmidt shook his head no mein herr who was he then hardt demanded schmidt seemed to have difficulty in forming the words and when he spoke it was in a whisper he was the one steiner and dr kruger brought on board at rheine on the stretcher and was there anything peculiar about him when they boarded the train chavasse said he pulled schmidt forward by the front of his dressing gown come on answer me he was dead mein herr schmidt moaned and collapsed in the chair sobbing chavasse stood up i thought so there was something about the body that didnt quite fit when i examined it at the time my brain was still feeling the aftereffects of the drug and i couldnt make any sense of it but i remembered on the way here in the car the fingers had already stiffened and the body was as cold as clay because hed been dead for some hours hardt said chavasse nodded i dont know who he was perhaps simply a body supplied by dr kruger he and steiner boarded the train at rheine made schmidt drug my coffee and waited in my compartment for the real muller to board the train at osnabruck then muller was the man on the stretcher when it left the train at hamburg hardt said chavasse nodded it was a neat plan they eliminated me and they got their hands on muller presumably they intend to screw the information out of him at their leisure i wonder where theyve taken him hardt said chavasse shrugged and then a thought occurred to him perhaps our friend here can tell us he lifted schmidts head back by the hair any suggestions schmidt the ambulance was from dr krugers private clinic at blankenese schmidt said he lifted his hands pleadingly for gods sake mein herr you mustnt let steiner know you found these things out from me hes a terrible man he was a group leader in the ss then why did you help him hardt said but i had no choice schmidt said you do not know how powerful these people are at that moment a step sounded outside on the landing and there was a knock at the door chavasse jerked schmidt to his feet and pulled him close find out who it is he whispered and dont try anything funny schmidt walked hesitantly toward the door and said in a cracked voice who is it inspector steiner the words came clearly through the thin paneling and schmidt turned toward the two men inside what shall i do chavasse looked inquiringly at hardt are you armed hardt shook his head no but steiner will be chavasse nodded thats what i was thinking what a wonderful opportunity for him to get rid of both of us and prove himself a hero at the same time we wouldnt stand a chance he walked across to the window brushing aside the panicstricken schmidt who clutched at his sleeve and opened it a little to one side a thick iron drainpipe dropped forty feet to the cobbles of the yard at the rear of the building three feet beyond it there was an iron fire escape as hardt moved beside him steiner hammered on the door and said angrily schmidt open up schmidt plucked at chavasses arm hell kill me chavasse ignored him and nodded toward the fire escape id say its our best way down without waiting for hardt to agree he climbed out onto the windowsill he reached out for the drainpipe skinning his knuckles on the rough brickwork as he slid his hands round it for a moment he paused and then he launched himself to one side his left hand grabbing for the iron railing of the fire escape a moment later and he was safe on the platform hardt emerged onto the windowsill he successfully negotiated the drainpipe and jumped for the fire escape chavasse reached out and caught him by the arm as his foot slipped a moment later and hardt stood safely beside him on the platform schmidt leaned out of the window a look of terror on his face help me i implore you hes breaking in the door chavasse was already clattering down the iron steps of the fire escape and hardt followed him as they started across the cobbled yard to the alley that gave access to the front of the house there was a sudden cry from above and they both paused and looked up schmidt was hanging onto the drainpipe obviously too terrified to make a move at that moment steiner leaned out of the window and reached toward him with a courage born of desperation schmidt jumped for the fire escape his hand clawing the air his fingers seemed to find a hold and for a moment he hung there and then he slipped and fell his body twisting in midair so that he hit the cobbles headfirst hardt gave a cry of horror and started forward but chavasse grabbed him by the arm and hustled him through the alley and out into the street weve got to think about the living he said if we dont get away from here fast steiner will have half the hamburg police force breathing down our necks when they were safe in the volkswagen and moving away through the deserted back streets of the city chavasse laughed shakily it was a pretty close thing back there for a moment or two i thought we werent going to make it hardt glanced across at him his face white and strained the sound that poor devils head made when it hit the cobbles i dont think im ever likely to forget it he shuddered and turned his attention to the road steiner probably intended to get rid of him one way or another at some time in the future chavasse said he knew too much hardt nodded yes i suppose youre right it had stopped raining as they slowed to a halt outside annas apartment house and hardt switched off the engine in the silence that followed he sat smoking a cigarette and nervously tapping his fingers against the rim of the steering wheel after a while chavasse said well whats our next move hardt frowned and said slowly a visit to this clinic of krugers at blankenese i suppose and when do you suggest we make it tonight after dark i think ill see what i can find out about the place during the day he opened the door and got out and chavasse slid across the seat and followed him they walked to the door of the apartment house and hardt paused outside arent you coming in chavasse asked in surprise hardt shook his head no ill get back to my place i could do with a few hours sleep im afraid i cant take you with me but youll be all right here anna will make up a bed for you on the couch arent you going to take the car chavasse said hardt shook his head i feel like the walk it isnt far he started to move away and then hesitated and turned slowly dawn was just beginning to break and in its gray light he looked sickly and unwell i didnt lose my nerve back there he said i know that chavasse told him it was just that ghastly sound when his head hit the cobbles ive seen men die ive killed several myself but ive never heard anything quite like that go home to bed for a moment longer hardt stared fixedly at him and then he walked slowly away along the wet pavement chavasse watched him for a little while and then he turned in through the entrance to the apartment house and went quickly upstairs at his first light knock anna opened the door and let him in as he peeled off his raincoat she said anxiously wheres mark gone back to his hotel chavasse told her hell be getting in touch later in the day after hes checked on krugers clinic at blankenese well be paying it a visit tonight after dark she went into the kitchen and returned almost at once with a fresh pot of coffee as she filled two cups she said what happened did you see schmidt he drank his coffee sitting beside her on the couch and told her when he finished she shuddered that poor man what a horrible way to die he couldnt have known much about it chavasse said he must have been killed instantly at least we now know who were working against she said he nodded according to schmidt steiner was a group leader in the ss kruger was probably a camp doctor or something of the sort do you think theyll be mentioned in bormanns memoirs he shook his head i shouldnt think so my hunch is that theyre both simply active members of the nazi underground the people they take their orders from probably figure in bormanns book and you think theyll have muller at this clinic in blankenese lets hope so he put down his coffee cup and got to his feet and now if i can have the use of your couch she went into the bedroom and came back carrying several blankets and a pillow as he watched she quickly made a bed for him she turned with a smile i think youll find its pretty comfortable and i can promise you wont be disturbed i could sleep for a week myself suddenly she seemed very close and he felt tired really tired youre very sweet anna he said she raised a hand and touched his cheek and he bent his head quickly and kissed her on the mouth for a moment she responded but as soon as she felt his hands on her waist she pulled away and rushed across to her bedroom the door closed behind her for a moment chavasse looked at it and then he sighed and started to peel off his clothes by the time he had finished fatigue had seeped into his brain he had barely enough strength left to crawl between the blankets and switch off the table lamp before he dived into darkness chapter he awakened slowly from a deep dreamless sleep to an atmosphere of brooding quiet pale autumn sunlight reached in through the window and faintly in the distance he could hear church bells and remembered it was sunday he checked his watch and found with something of a shock that it was half past one he threw aside the blankets and started to get dressed and then he saw the letter propped against the flower vase on the small table it was from anna she had decided to pay katie holdts landlady a visit in the hope of getting a lead on the girls whereabouts she expected to be back by three oclock at the latest he lit a cigarette and went into the kitchen he didnt feel hungry and ate only one buttered roll as he waited for his coffee to brew and then returned to the living room he sat on the edge of the couch with the cup in both hands and wondered how hardt was getting on he felt restless and ill at ease and he got to his feet and paced up and down the apartment it was the inaction he hated he preferred being in at the center of things checking the other mans move or making one himself on impulse he picked up the phone rang the atlantic hotel and asked for sir george harvey there was a slight click as the receiver was picked up at the other end and sir george spoke yes who is it your traveling companion chavasse said sir georges voice didnt change i was hoping youd ring he said ive had your boss on the phone from london he asked me to pass on some information to you is it important nothing startling but it might prove useful good wed better get together then im afraid thats going to be rather awkward sir george told him ive hired a car and im driving out to the race track at farmsen with some of the other conference delegates were leaving in a few minutes the first race starts at twothirty chavasse considered the situation he had been to farmsen before to see the trotting races they were usually well attended on a sunday afternoon he came to a decision quickly ill meet you in the bar under the grandstand in the secondclass enclosure at three oclock he said will that be all right i dont see why not sir george replied i can easily leave my friends in the firstclass enclosure for a few minutes as long as you think its safe to show your face dont worry about me chavasse said ill only be a dot among several thousand people he replaced the receiver and hurriedly finished dressing he left a brief note for anna left the apartment and walked through the quiet streets to the nearest station where he caught a crowded underground train when they reached farmsen he mingled with the large crowd that streamed toward the entrance of the race track as he passed through the turnstiles he saw a couple of boredlooking policemen leaning against the barrier and chatting he ignored them and moved on quickly passing round the great curve of the track and entered the secondclass enclosure the first race was just finishing and he stood at the rail and watched the light twowheeled sulkies bounce on the corners the drivers hanging grimly onto the reins as the horses trotted toward the finishing line at an incredible speed there was a roar from the crowd and a moment later the result was announced over the loudspeaker he looked across into the firstclass enclosure and checked his watch there were still ten minutes to go he sauntered across to the grandstand and went into the bar for the moment trade seemed to be slack and he ordered a beer and lit a cigarette as he carried his drink across to a corner table sir george harvey appeared in the entrance he came straight over and sat down dont you think youre asking for trouble showing your face in a public place like this chavasse shook his head theres safety in numbers i still think its damned risky sir george said but now you are here you can tell me what happened on that blasted train why did you have to kill muller but i didnt chavasse said as far as i know hes still alive and kicking he went on to describe what had really taken place when he had finished sir george leaned back in his chair a slight frown on his face its the most extraordinary thing ive ever heard of so steiner and this kruger fellow are presumably working for the nazi underground it certainly looks that way and this other chap sir george said the one who saved your bacon i suppose hes working for the people who spirited eichmann away to israel chavasse nodded thats about the size of it sir george shook his head in bewilderment you know even during the war when this sort of thing came under my department i never heard anything quite like it dammit all man we went through six years of hell to give these nazis what was coming to them and here they are sticking their heads up again and apparently able to get away with it but not for long chavasse said the very fact that they have to work underground is an encouraging sign he lit another cigarette you had a message for me so i did sir george said im sorry i was forgetting your chief wanted you to know theyve got a line on muller he was bormanns orderly apparently in civilian life hed been a valet his family lived in hamburg and he had one sister they were all killed in the bombing in does that help at all chavasse shook his head not really the only thing i didnt already know was that muller was once bormanns orderly that at least explains their connection the sisters still alive until yesterday we knew where she was living and working but for the moment weve lost track of her then obviously you must find her again sir george said she may be the key to the whole thing chavasse shook his head muller is the key to the whole thing hes the one weve got to find he glanced at his watch id better be making a move sir george nodded it might be wiser ill walk down to the gates with you they left the bar and moved through the crowd following the broad curve of the track as they walked chavasse said by the way did you tell the chief anything about this mess when he spoke to you on the telephone sir george shook his head emphatically no i thought perhaps youd want to handle that yourself they had passed where the cars were parked and were moving toward the gate through the stream of people who were still coming in chavasse started to thank him but sir george suddenly caught hold of his arm and jerked him violently around as they started to move back the way they had come chavasse said whats wrong steiners standing at the gates with halfadozen policemen sir george said chavasse glanced back over his shoulder quickly steiner and his men had obviously only just arrived and they stood around him in a group as he gave them their instructions as chavasse watched they moved away taking up prearranged positions so that all the exits were covered for gods sake come on man sir george said and pulled him into the car park as they moved between the crowded vehicles chavasse said theres bound to be another way out of this damn place no need to worry about that sir george said and halted beside a mercedes im going to take you out and by the front gate not on your life chavasse told him im not getting you involved in this he started to turn away and sir george grabbed hold of his arm and held him with a grip of surprising strength his face flushed and when he spoke his voice shook with anger what sort of a man do you think i am he demanded im not going to stand by and see a pack of damned nazis have their way youre going to get on the floor in the back of the car with a rug over you and were going out that main gate do you understand the years seemed to have fallen away from him and for the moment he was once more the young colonel who had led his men over the top at the somme armed with a swagger stick his belt and buttons gleaming he opened the rear door of the mercedes get in he said chavasse hesitated and then he shrugged and did as he was ordered he lay on the floor and sir george covered him with a rug and closed the door a moment later and they moved slowly away they came to a halt and steps approached as the man started to speak chavasse held his breath and then he heard steiners voice break in angrily leave this to me go back to your post he leaned down to the window and said in his careful clipped english sorry youve been troubled sir george ah inspector steiner sir george said who are you looking for this time chavasse could almost see steiners characteristic shrug no one in particular sir george its an old police custom to spread a net when there is a large crowd it is surprising how often it pays with a good haul i regret you have been inconvenienced the car moved on and picked up speed chavasse remained on the floor for another five minutes and then he pushed back the rug and sat in the rear seat that was close sir george shook his head i wasnt worried for a minute he laughed excitedly you know im beginning to enjoy this chavasse ive been living my safe ordered and rather stuffy existence for so long now id almost forgotten what it could be like to take a chance youve taken enough for one day chavasse said you can stop any time you like and let me out ill catch the ubahn back into town sir george shook his head nothing doing my boy ill take you to where you want to go and what about your friends chavasse reminded him theyll be wondering whats happened to you sir george swore mildly youre right i suppose where can i drop you then were coming into hellbrook chavasse said you can stop outside the underground station i can manage fine from there a few moments later the car drew in to the side of the road and chavasse got out he leaned in at the window thanks for everything you deserve a medal sir george snorted just remember to call on me if you need any more help he chuckled you know youve given me a new lease on life i dont think ive enjoyed myself so much for years the big car turned and roared back along the road to farmsen chavasse stood there watching it go and thinking about sir george harvey he was quite a man there was no doubt about that as the car disappeared from sight round a bend in the road he turned and went quickly into wandsbek station it was nearly fourthirty when he mounted the stairs to anna hartmans apartment and knocked on the door it was opened almost at once and she pulled him inside her face white and strained where have you been she demanded i was almost out of my mind with worry any particular reason he said as he took off his coat she shook her head there hasnt been a mention of the train affair on the radio ive listened to every bulletin i cant understand it you worry too much chevasse said steiners probably persuaded his superiors to allow him to handle the case in his own way after all he cant let someone else get their hands on me i might talk too much hes got to reach me first if only to save his own skin he pulled her down beside him on the couch did you manage to find out anything about katie holdt she shook her head not a thing her landlady didnt even see her go apparently she left the rent she owed in an envelope with a brief note saying shed been called away urgently there was definitely no forwarding address thats a pity chavasse said she might have proved useful at least we now know how muller came to be connected with bormann in the first place she looked surprised and he quickly explained about his trip to farmsen how on earth can you take such risks she said when he had finished couldnt sir george have given you the message over the phone chavasse jumped to his feet and walked across to the window i suppose he could but i get restless i have to be in at the heart of things he turned with a smile never mind about me has hardt been in touch yet she nodded were to meet him at blankenese tonight in a café by the elbe i know the place apparently hes found out everything we need to know about kruger and his clinic that sounds fair enough chavasse said what time are we meeting him nine oclock she said it will be dark by then he moved across to the couch and pulled her to her feet that gives us almost five hours to kill he held her hand securely what on earth can we find to do she drew away from him theres a newspaper there she told him you can read that while i prepare a meal for you she went into the kitchen and he followed her and stood leaning in the doorway a slight smile on his face i much prefer to watch you she turned to look at him and suddenly she moved forward and into his arms oh paul i was so frightened for you she said youll never know how frightened i was he held her tightly in his arms and stroked her hair and whispered comfortingly and all the time he was staring out of the opposite window as he admitted the one hard fact that he had not wanted to acknowledge that from the moment he had first seen her at the taj mahal standing just inside the door in her ridiculous harlots dress he had been caught in a tide of emotion so strong it could not possibly be denied as he lifted her face he wondered ironically what the chief would say and then he kissed her and forgot about everything about muller steiner the bormann manuscript everything except this girl chapter they arrived at blankenese at half past eight and parked the car in the hauptstrasse anna led the way and chavasse followed her along a narrow steeply sloping alley that finally brought them out onto the shore of the elbe there were plenty of people about and the gaily painted brightly lit cafés that lined the shore seemed to be doing good business anna led the way into one of them and they sat down at a corner table on a terrace that jutted out over the water chavasse ordered two beers and gave her a cigarette while they waited the terrace was lit by a string of chinese lanterns and they had it completely to themselves as they sat there in silence he felt curiously at peace with himself a small wind lifted across the water carrying with it the dank moist smell of autumn i like this place he said have you been here often she nodded blankenese is one of my favorite spots its very popular with young couples you know he leaned across and placed a hand on one of hers do you think we could qualify for the club a sudden delightful smile appeared on her face and she took hold of his hand and gripped it firmly wouldnt it be wonderful if we could paul if only we were like all the other couples strolling along the strandweg just two people in love and enjoying each others company with nothing else to worry about for a moment he wanted to tell her that there was always something to worry about money disease poverty old age but he didnt have the heart he smiled and said lightly mark isnt due until nine that gives us at least half an hour to pretend she smiled again and said softly then lets pretend the waiter brought their beer and chavasse drank his slowly reveling in the cold dryness of it and watched a passenger ship steam slowly past on its way out to sea a blaze of lights from stem to stern faintly across the water he could hear voices and careless laughter above the throb of the engines i wonder where its going he said would it matter she smiled sadly and he took her hands and said gently youve stopped pretending already she looked down into her glass for a moment a slight frown on her face and then she disengaged her hands and lit another cigarette after a while she looked across at him a slight wry smile on her face its rather ironic really until yesterday i was perfectly sure of myself happy in the knowledge that i was doing something important something worthwhile nothing else seemed to matter and now she sighed now i am in love she laughed briefly for me its a new experience i havent had time before but you jumped into my life feetfirst you appeared in my line of vision and i couldnt possibly avoid you are you sorry i did for a moment she hesitated and then she flicked her cigarette down into the water and shook her head no if i regretted having known you id be regretting life itself for a moment longer she stared out over the water at the ship disappearing into the night and then she turned and said in a low intense voice is there anything for us paul can we ever get away from this sort of life he stared out into the darkness and thought about it how many times during the last five years had he been at this stage in a job one jump ahead of trouble with the prospect of more to come treading the razor edge of danger half his life seemed to be spent under cover of darkness meeting strange people in even stranger places and when all was said and done when everything was finally under wraps to what ultimate purpose was any of it worth what he held now in the hollow of his hand he looked across at her at the despondent droop of her shoulders and as he watched she took a deep breath and straightened she smiled bravely i wonder if mark will be on time he reached across to hell with mark to hell with the whole bloody show for two pins id walk out now we could take the volkswagen and drive to holland cross the border on foot before daylight ive got friends in rotterdam good friends she shook her head slowly but you wont will you paul the job comes before everything remember telling me that and its a fine principle and an honest one if anything he loved her even more for saying it he leaned across until their faces were almost touching and said urgently but afterwards anna with any luck well have this whole thing wrapped up within two or three days i could pack the game in then she seemed to be infected by his own enthusiasm and a faint flush of excitement tinged her cheeks do you really mean it paul but where would we go he smiled hell what does it matter israel if you like perhaps i could get a job lecturing at this hebrew university of yours she sighed and shook her head im afraid we suffer from a surplus of intellectuals he shrugged all right then well go back to the land my grandfather was a breton farmer id probably manage to hold my own on that kibbutz you told me about near migdal where i was raised she said that would be wonderful paul of all things i think that would be the most wonderful we could climb that hill of yours he said i can see us now a fine warm afternoon with no one else for miles and what would you do when we reached the top he grinned oh i dont know id find something she reached across and touched his face gently and shook her head in mock disapproval from another café a little way along the strand someone played an accordion and the music drifted sweetly across the water a little sad transitory like the autumn leaves that the small wind scattered from the trees at the waters edge and chavasse pulled her to her feet and into his arms and they danced alone there on the terrace her head against his shoulder for a little while it was as she had wanted it to be and nothing else seemed to matter just the two of them there on the terrace alone and then there was a slight polite cough and they drew apart hastily to find mark hardt standing looking at them a strange expression on his face so you got here chavasse said rather pointlessly and they all sat down at the table you two seem to have been enjoying yourselves hardt said he looked across at anna and she gazed back at him calmly he shrugged and turned to chavasse where did you get to this afternoon a little unwise venturing out during daylight hours surely chavasse shrugged not really there was a message for me from london i went to the races at farmsen to meet sir george harvey hardt raised his eyebrows anything interesting theyd just discovered who muller was and thought it might be useful apparently he was bormanns orderly for a time that was something i didnt know hardt said however weve got more important things to think about at the moment he unfolded a sheet of paper and placed it on the table where they could all see it it was a carefully drawn sketchplan of the clinic and chavasse examined it with interest this is good he said at length where did you get it a local realestate agent hardt said theres an empty house next door and i told him i was interested in buying the plan he showed me included krugers clinic as well apparently the property was only converted last year did you find out anything else about the place chavasse said hardt nodded yes security is pretty strict high walls broken glass set in concrete theres a bar opposite the main gate and i had a word with the proprietor according to him kruger handles a lot of mental cases rich neurotics women with twisted sex lives all that sort of thing chavasse studied the plan again how are we going in it should be pretty simple hardt leaned over the plan the dividing wall between the clinic and the empty house is about ten feet high once over that we enter the building by way of the boilerhouse door there are several cellars beyond that and from one of them a small service elevator serves all floors its used for laundry what about the patients chavasse said every sunday night they have a film show in the lounge on the ground floor it doesnt finish until ten from what i can find out everybody goes chavasse nodded that should give us a clear field if muller is in there it stands to reason he must be on either the first or second floor and it shouldnt take long to locate him there are only fifteen rooms hardt glanced at his watch wed better make a move its ninefifteen already and we havent got a lot of time to spare where have you parked the car when anna told him he nodded its only five minutes from there chavasse paid the waiter and they left quickly and climbed back up the steeply sloping alley until they reached the hauptstrasse he and anna got into the rear seat and hardt drove the clinic was on the corner of a narrow side street lined with chestnut tress and a sound of music came from the small bar opposite the great iron gates as hardt drove past chavasse saw that they were securely locked and beyond them the clinic loomed out of the night halfhidden by trees hardt stopped the volkswagen a few yards beyond the gate of the next house and switched off the engine he turned to anna i want you to wait for us here with luck we should be in and out within twenty minutes she nodded calmly and if you are not chavasse who was getting out of the car said grimly if we arent back by ten oclock you get out of here and fast she seemed about to protest but hardt broke in and said gently hes right anna theres no point in your being dragged down with us if anything happens return to the flat and get in touch with london theyll know what to do chavasse could feel her eyes imploring him to turn and look at her but some stubborn impulse kept him walking steadily back along the pavement and in through the gates of the empty house there was no sound only the slight rustle of the wind through halfbare trees and hardt pushed him forward there was a decaying summer house set against the dividing wall and chavasse hoisted himself up onto its roof and peered cautiously over into the grounds of the clinic the top of the wall was covered with concrete in which hundreds of pieces of broken glass had been set and he tested them gingerly with his fingertips hardt moved up beside him and quickly draped several old sacks across a section of the wall i found these in the summer house when i was nosing around this afternoon he whispered they could see the windows of the lounge running toward the front to the house and heard a sudden burst of laughter from the patients who were watching the film sounds as if theyre enjoying it chavasse said are you ready hardt nodded and chavasse placed one hand lightly on the thick padding of the sacks and vaulted over the wall he landed kneedeep in dead leaves and a moment later hardt was beside him they moved across the lawn keeping under the trees and approached the door to the boiler house chavasse listened intently at the door for a moment and then opened it easily and quickly and moved inside hands ready there was no one there he moved on without speaking through the opposite door and along a narrow stone passage facing him was another door when he opened it the room was in darkness his groping hand found the switch and turned it on the cellar was full of laundry baskets and facing him was the entrance to the service elevator chavasse examined it quickly it was simple enough to operate and he turned to hardt who had followed him in and said ive been thinking well do better if we take one floor each you take the first floor ill take the second if you like hardt nodded without saying anything he took out the beretta automatic and checked the action chavasse said without a silencer that things worse than useless on a job like this if you do meet anyone and use it youll have the entire household breathing down our necks hardt said what do you suggest i do raise my hands and go quietly chavasse grinned i could tell you but we havent the time now he pushed hardt into the elevator and followed him a moment later the doors closed silently and they were rising he pressed the button for the first floor and they came to a halt he turned to hardt and whispered lets hope theres no one in the corridor the doors slid open and he peered out the corridor was deserted and he pushed hardt forward without a word and quickly pressed the button for the second floor he was beginning to enjoy himself and the old familiar elation lifted inside him it was a feeling he could not analyze successfully he only knew that it existed that at the bottom of things it was what made him continue to lead the kind of life he did and that it would be impossible to explain to anybody even anna the elevator came to a halt the doors opened silently and he stepped into the corridor everything was still and he hesitated undecided on which way to go and then he shrugged and turned to his left he checked two rooms cautiously in each case listening outside the door before opening it the occupants were obviously downstairs enjoying the film he checked his watch and saw that it was almost a quarter to ten there wasnt much time left at that moment he heard someone singing as they came down the attic stairs at the far end of the corridor he moved quickly to the next door opened it and went inside closing it behind him the room was in darkness and when he switched on the light he found that he was standing in a linen cupboard he opened the door slightly and peered out the singer was a young girl in a starched apron and cap she went into each bedroom in turn reappearing again within a moment or two he decided she must be a chambermaid and was probably turning down the beds she paused outside the door that was next to the linen cupboard and adjusted her blond hair she was extremely pretty with blue eyes red pouting lips and rounded cheeks she went into the bedroom and he closed the door of the linen cupboard and waited for her to pass chapter remembering it afterward he could not be sure who was the more surprised when she opened the door and found him she stood there one hand raised to the bun at the nape of her neck the other still on the handle of the door and her eyes went round with astonishment as she opened her mouth to cry out chavasse did the only possible thing he pulled her forward and kissed her crushing his mouth fiercely against hers at the same time closing the door with his free hand at first she struggled and he held her fast in his arms and continued to kiss her and then she relaxed quite suddenly and her softness seemed to melt into him as her hands came up and linked behind his neck after a while he moved his head back a little and whispered in her ear dont be frightened liebling i wont hurt you that seems obvious enough she said and laughter seemed to bubble over in her voice who are you mein herr a burglar he shook his head nothing quite so romantic im afraid i know she said youve secretly admired me for months and tonight you finally plucked up enough courage to declare yourself chavasse stifled an insane desire to laugh out loud whats your name liebling gisela she said im one of the maids here maybe you can help me he said im looking for a friend of mine he was brought here early this morning in an ambulance from the hauptbahnhof thatll be the one in number twelve on the first floor she said they keep him locked in his room karl the chief nurse says hes really mad that one thats the whole trouble chavasse told her i dont happen to think he is but they wont let me in to see him thats why i decided to try the more unconventional approach she looked up at him critically you know youre rather handsome in your own particular way thats what all the girls say he told her and reached for the door handle she pulled him back and sliding one arm up around his neck kissed him full on the mouth as he gently disengaged himself she said hopefully ill be off duty at eleventhirty im on late shift this week sorry gisela he said its been fun but ive got to see my friend before the film ends number twelve i think you said as he moved out into the corridor she whispered softly whatever you do watch out for karl hes a terrible brute when he gets going he walked quickly along the corridor and started to move downstairs to the first floor there were only ten minutes left in which to finish this thing and as he turned the corner into the corridor he wondered how hardt was getting on he soon found out the door to number twelve stood open and from inside he heard steiners voice and it was not pleasant i am really quite disappointed he was saying i had hoped to see our mutual friend herr chavasse but for the moment you will do i am sorry herr muller isnt here to greet you personally but dont let that worry you i think i can safely say youll be seeing him before much longer now turn hands high and move out into the corridor chavasse moved three steps up the staircase and waited his body flat against the wall hardt was the first to cross his line of vision hands held above his head and then steiner moved into view he was holding a mauser with a bulbous barrel that acted as an effective silencer it was a relic of the war years and much used by german counterintelligence chavasse said steiner as the big german swore and turned toward him he kicked the mauser from his hand it hit the wall and fell onto the bottom step as steiner reached for it hardt chopped him across the back of the neck and he slumped forward on to his face chavasse jumped down into the corridor and hardt gave him a warning cry as a man in a white jacket moved out of the open door of room number twelve and launched himself forward he must have been at least six and a half feet tall with a scarred hairless head and a face out of a nightmare as chavasse tried to duck hands reached out and fastened around his throat remembering giselas warning chavasse decided this must be the terrible karl he allowed himself to go limp and spit in the germans face karl instinctively released his hold and chavasse lifted his knee into the mans crotch karl grunted with pain but kept on his feet his left arm lashed out smashing hardt against the wall and with his right arm he reached for chavasse chavasse twisted the arm around in a shoulder lock exerting all his strength and karl screamed still keeping that terrible hold in position chavasse ran him forward along the corridor toward the head of the stairs a few feet from the rail he released the arm and kicked the german with all his force behind the left knee karl went headfirst over the wroughtiron rail of the landing as his body crunched against the marble floor of the hall the doors of the lounge were thrown open and a woman screamed chavasse paused long enough to retrieve steiners automatic from the floor hardt was already at the end of the corridor pressing the button for the elevator as chavasse arrived the doors opened and they jumped inside a moment later they were running through the cellars to the boiler house faintly from the interior of the house came the sound of disorder and they started across the lawn toward the wall behind them a door was flung open and there was a cry as chavasse entered the bushes he heard the muted report of a silenced automatic he slipped the mauser into his pocket and ran on when they reached the wall hardt cupped his hands into a stirrup and braced himself chavasse didnt argue he took the offer and jumped for the top of the wall hardt pushing him upward his hands clawed across the sacking and as he pulled himself over glass sliced its way through pain knifing into him in a wave of agony he swung himself onto the roof of the summer house and then turned quickly and leaned across the sack reaching a hand down to hardt hardt moved a little way back and then ran forward and jumped chavasse caught hold of his right wrist and held on as hardt secured a grip on the edge of the wall there was a crashing through the bushes below and then another muted cough as the silenced automatic was fired again at pointblank range hardt started to slip hes got me in the shoulder he said for a moment longer he seemed to make an effort to hang on chavasse desperately tried to pull him up but it was no use get out of here you fool hardt grunted and fell as he crashed into the bushes below there was a cry of triumph from his pursuers chavasse didnt wait to hear any more he jumped down to the ground from the roof of the summer house and staggered through the bushes toward the path he turned out of the gates and ran along the pavement and the pain in his arms was intense he wrenched open the door of the volkswagen and slid into the passenger seat slamming the door behind him lets get out of here he gasped anna turned in alarm what about mark dont argue just get this thing moving for a moment it seemed as if she intended to protest and then she thought better of it and switched on the engine a few seconds later they were turning into the main road and she moved into top gear and drove very fast toward the center of hamburg after a while she said are you all right he nodded ive cut my arms getting across the blasted glasstopped wall but i dont think its serious and mark he told her what had happened when he had finished she said with surprising calm how badly do you think he was wounded he said it was in the shoulder chavasse said i dont think it could have been very serious and what happens now she said i want some first aid for these arms for one thing i can manage that all right she told him ive got a firstaid box back at the apartment she drove the rest of the way in silence and chavasse lay back against the seat and closed his eyes what a complete and utter mess the whole thing had been since steiner knew they had talked to schmidt it must have been obvious to him that sooner or later they would be paying the clinic a visit and yet what other move could they possibly have made he was still thinking about it when the volkswagen came to a halt and he followed anna upstairs to her apartment she switched on the light and turning to examine him she gave a gasp of horror the sleeves of his jacket were torn in several places and stained with blood she pulled off her coat and led the way into the bathroom she took down a firstaid box and made everything ready before she gently eased him out of his jacket and dropped it into the corner there were three deep cuts in one arm four in the other and he laughed shakily as she bathed them with an antiseptic solution you know it got pretty hot back there for a while i thought i wasnt going to make it she glanced up at him a strange expression in her eyes as she cut strips of surgical tape from a large roll she said quietly you enjoyed it didnt you paul for a moment he was going to say no but the moment passed and he nodded i dont know what it is but something gets into me the excitement i suppose and the uncertainty of the whole business she sighed heavily and finished taping his arms and thats why youll never change he had no time for arguments he took the surgical scissors from her hand and quickly cut away the bloodstained section of each sleeve of his shirt is there by any chance a spare jacket of marks here she nodded yes i think so shall i get it for you he followed her back into the living room she went into the bedroom and came back with a grey tweed jacket he pulled it on and buttoned it up rather small but it will have to do for the moment he went into the bathroom and retrieved the mauser from the pocket of his bloodstained jacket then he returned to the living room and took down from a peg behind the door the raincoat and green hat hardt had originally given him as he buttoned the raincoat anna said where are you going to find out whats happening to hardt he told her ive got a hunch theyll be moving him tonight and id like to know where she reached for her coat im coming with you he gently took the coat from her and hung it behind the door no youre not it only needs one of us to do a job like this she shrugged all right what do you want me to do he smiled cook me something nice for supper if you like ill only be an hour or so if im lucky she turned away without speaking and he went out quickly and down to the car he drove straight back to blankenese and parking the volkswagen around the corner from the clinic went into the little bar opposite the main gates and ordered a beer the place was empty and the proprietor leaned on the zinctopped bar reading a newspaper chavasse moved to the curtained window and stared across at the gates as he watched they were opened wide by a man in uniform and peaked cap when he had finished his task he came across the road and entered the bar the proprietor smiled and laid down his paper dont tell me theyre sending you out at this time of night the man in uniform nodded just the sort of thing these bastards are always doing he said bitterly give me a packet of cigarettes will you where to this time the proprietor of the bar said as he pushed the cigarettes across berndorf again the man snorted its bad enough on some of those country roads during the day but at night its just impossible the door closed behind him with a crash and he moved back across the road and entered the gates a few moments later a heavy ambulance came down the drive and turned into the road a large dark car followed close behind they were obviously taking every precaution against being followed chavasse moved out onto the pavement considering his next move and at that moment gisela came out of the main gates and crossed the street she turned the corner into the main road and chavasse hurried after her he caught up with her as she drew abreast of the volkswagen can i offer you a lift he said she turned in surprise and then recognition came to her face oh its you is it she moved closer and there was respect in her voice what on earth did you do to karl they say hes broken both his legs he smiled and opened the door of the car do you have far to go she shook her head not really only to flottbek far enough he said and handed her into the car he went round to the other side climbed behind the wheel and drove away as they moved through the deserted streets he said my friend wasnt in room twelve by the way apparently theyve moved him she seemed genuinely surprised i didnt know that was there much of a disturbance back there after i left you he said she shrugged theres always a fuss of some sort going on you get so you dont take any notice some of the women are terrible you know are they chavasse said tell me has dr kruger got another clinic anywhere she shook her head not that i know of the ambulance driver was in the bar a little while ago he told her he was saying something about taking a patient to a place called berndorf oh they often take people to berndorf she said but not to a clinic they go there to convalesce dr kruger has a friend called herr nagel who owns a castle there its supposed to be a lovely place i see chavasse said casually and this man nagel does he visit the clinic often oh yes she said he and dr kruger are great friends hes very wealthy something to do with steel i think and then it clicked into place and chavasse remembered something hed read in a newspaper at annas apartment kurt nagel was a big industrialist a man with a lot of influence in political circles he was one of the prime organizers of the un peace conference and later in the week he was giving a ball in honor of the delegates if a man like nagel was working hand in glove with the nazi underground then things were more serious than even the chief had believed as chavasse considered the situation he was following giselas instructions and finally slowed to a halt outside a modest house in an unpretentious neighborhood well its been nice he said she had already got the door open and she turned and looked at him arent you coming in for a while its perfectly safe theyll all be in bed by this time he shook his head im afraid not gisela some other time she leaned across kissed him and sighed men are such liars i bet you anything you like ill never see you again he drove away quickly and left her standing there on the pavement looking wistfully after him he had forgotten her within seconds as his mind went back to the problem in hand the way things looked they were taking hardt to this castle of nagel s at berndorf and that meant that muller was probably there also there was only one thing to do pay the place a visit but it would be risky as he went upstairs to the apartment he was still thinking about it when he went in he found anna cooking in the kitchen i took you at your word she said he grinned ive got good news for you ive managed to find out where theyve taken hardt i think muller is probably a prisoner there as well she was immediately excited and demanded an explanation when he had finished she said whats our next move then he frowned thinking about it and then he smiled i think well pay this place a visit in the morning theres bound to be some sort of inn in the village young honeymooners would fit the bill best she blushed and started to turn away he pulled her into his arms have you any objections to spending a honeymoon with me she smiled no not really after all i suppose its the only one youre likely to give me he crushed her against him i shouldnt count on that if i were you she pulled away from him then theres still hope for me she said and pushed him toward the door go and sit down and ill bring you something to eat he went and sat on the divan and she placed the small table in front of him and brought in the food and sat in the chair opposite and watched him eating afterward as she cleared away the things and made coffee he leaned back content and for the moment happy for the first time it occurred to him that they might make a go of it that after this job was over he would tell the chief he was through but is anything ever that easy he thought to himself even when she came and curled up beside him her arms around his neck chapter it was a damp misty morning when they set out and they halted in hamburg only for as long as it took anna to purchase a readymade tweed jacket for chavasse and a cheap gold wedding ring for herself berndorf was only twenty miles out of hamburg on the road to lubeck chavasse did the driving and after forty minutes anna tugged at his sleeve as they approached a signpost he swung left into a narrow lane that plunged into thickly wooded country and three miles farther on they came to the village it consisted of a single street of stonebuilt houses and looked completely deserted the inn lay beyond it an old twostoried building in heavy weatherbeaten stone with great wooden gables that seemed almost too large for the house they parked the car and entered through a door that had the date carved on the lintel the main room was long with a low roof crossed by great beams and had a huge fireplace in which a man might comfortably stand there was a bright fire burning and anna stood in front of it warming her hands while chavasse went to the small reception desk near the door and rang the bell after a while there was movement in the dim interior and an old woman with a face wrinkled and bright entered and bobbed a curtsy wed like a room for a couple of days chavasse said she nodded her head you must see herr fassbender i will fetch him she disappeared into the rear of the house and chavasse lit a cigarette and waited after a moment or two a large redfaced man with closecropped hair emerged from the kitchen you wish for a room mein herr chavasse nodded yes for my wife and myself just for a couple of days he tried to look suitably embarrassed and anna moved beside him and they linked hands ah i understand mein herr i have a very nice room available as it happens he went behind the desk and produced a register which chavasse signed in the name of reimarch fassbender took down a key and led the way upstairs a pity the weather is so bad but then it takes more than a little rain to spoil a holiday he opened a door and led the way in it was a pleasant room with a fireplace dark oak furniture and a large double bed in one corner this should suit us admirably chavasse told him fassbender smiled again i will have a fire lit for you would you like something to eat now chavasse shook his head no well wait i think well spend a little time exploring shall we darling he looked inquiringly at anna she smiled i think that would be very nice fassbender nodded there is not a great deal for you to see im afraid to truly appreciate the beauty of this region it is necessary to visit us in the summertime any special places of interest chavasse asked casually fassbender shrugged there is the castle of course you can have a look at it but it isnt open to members of the public theres a path through the woods which will take you there it starts from the yard at the rear of the inn chavasse thanked him and they went outside as they followed the path between the fir trees he said with a grin how did you like my performance did i resemble the young man trembling on the brink of his wedding night you almost overdid it well you looked frightened to death when you saw the bed he said she laughed it was the most enormous bed ive ever seen i bet id have the devils own job catching you in it he said brazenly and her face colored so that she looked exactly like what she was supposed to be a young newly married girl on her wedding day there was a gleam of water as the trees thinned and then they came out onto the shores of a lake and saw the tall gothic towers of the castle rearing out of the mist in front of them it had been built on a small island and was reached by a narrow causeway about a hundred yards long that started a little further along the shore its like something out of the brothers grimm anna said chavasse nodded slowly without speaking the mist seemed to be getting thicker and it was difficult to see the castle clearly he took her arm and turned away from the direction of the causeway as they walked he said its certainly going to be tough getting inside how are you thinking of doing it he shrugged im not sure but id like a closer look at the place first as they walked along the wet shingle visibility seemed to grow even worse and then a boathouse loomed out of the mist in front of them i wonder he said softly he clambered up onto the lichencovered slipway that sloped down into the water floating on the other side of it tethered to a ring bolt was a small rowing boat it looked as if it hadnt been used for a while and there was water in the bottom but the oars were there and an old cane fishing rod he pulled anna up beside him and pointed who do you think it belongs to she said perhaps our friend fassbender he replied not that it matters im going to borrow it anyway dont you think it might be dangerous to show too much interest in the castle he shook his head not in this mist its a firstrate chance to get a closer look ive got to find a way in anna its no use coming back after dark and hoping for the best i suppose youre right she said calmly do you want me to come with you it would look better he shook his head no you wait here if anything does go wrong i want you out of it he dropped down into the boat and untied the knot of the wet rope with some difficulty there was so much water in the bottom of the boat that it covered his shoes but he ignored the sudden clammy chill that began to spread through his body and fitted the oars into their rowlocks and pushed away from the slipway anna raised her hand and then she was gone and he was alone in a cocoon of mist he looked over his shoulder and could just distinguish the pointed tops of the towers as they floated above the mist and he pulled strongly toward them the strangest thing of all was the quiet which was complete and absolute only the slight splash of his oars as they lifted from the water disturbed the silence and no bird sang and then somewhere in the distance he heard the dull throbbing note of an engine curiously muffled by the mist he stopped rowing at once and listened intently gradually the noise increased until it was almost on top of him and then it passed through the mist a distinct ripple ran across the water and splashed against the hull chavasse quickly shipped his oars and reached for a fishing rod the line was knotted and tangled into a hopeless mess and he wrestled with it for a moment until he heard the sound of the engine coming back he gave up the struggle and held the rod out over the water its point only a few inches above the surface his free hand was in his pocket ready to draw the mauser he had taken from steiner at the clinic the boat rocked violently as the other vessel approached and then the engine was cut chavasse huddled over the rod keeping his face down and then a launch drifted out of the mist and bumped gently against the rowing boat a familiar voice said had a good catch my friend slowly chavasse turned his head and looked over his shoulder steiner leaned over the rail of the launch an affable smile on his face you dont seem very talkative this morning herr chavasse to be perfectly frank im rather at a loss for words chavasse replied his thumb pushed back the safety catch of the mauser and his index finger gently crooked around the trigger fassbender like all tenants of this estate is extremely loyal steiner said but come my friend you seem to be soaked to the skin a glass of schnapps will do you a world of good chavasse stood up slowly and turned to face him i hope you arent going to try anything foolish steiner said as you can see hans has the perfect remedy hans was blackbearded and dangerouslooking and the shotgun he was holding to one shoulder was as steady as a rock to draw and fire before the shotgun blasted his head off was an impossibility but chavasse had only one thing on his mind the need to warn anna he allowed his shoulders to drop and sighed it looks as though you win this trick steiner at the same moment he threw himself backward into the water drew the mauser and fired it blindly into space the sound of its report seemed very loud in his ears but not so loud as the thunderous roar of the shotgun the pellets sang past him and then he was under the surface he hadnt had time to take in much air and he pulled himself downward desperately and swam under the keel of the launch surfacing on the other side where he hung onto a rope ladder he listened for a moment to steiners shouting and then started to peel off his raincoat his only chance was to swim for the shore hoping the thick mist would hide him and the coat would only be a hindrance he finally managed to get it off as he struck out from the launch a bullet chopped into the water beside his head and steiner cried hold it right there chavasse chavasse paused treading water and steiner went on now turn and swim back to the launch and i warn you the slightest attempt at any funny business and ill shoot you through the head suddenly chavasse was cold and tired he swam back to the launch and hauled himself up the rope ladder as he neared the top hans reached over and jerked him across the rail so that he stumbled and fell he got wearily to his feet and stood there shivering as the wind cut into his wet clothes steiner came forward a luger in his right hand he smiled youre quite a man chavasse under different circumstances i think wed have got along together however you carelessly chose the wrong side stupid of me wasnt it chavasse said as youll soon find out steiner told him because i always pay my debts heres something on account he moved with surprising speed for such a large man and before chavasse could duck the barrel of the luger slashed across his right cheek drawing blood at the same moment hans moved in from behind and chopped him across the back of the neck chavasse doubled over and the deck lifted to meet him for what seemed an age there was only the pain and he lay with his cheek pillowed against the deck eyes closed vaguely he was aware of the engine coughing into life and then water was dashed in his face and he shook his head and got slowly to his feet steiner threw the bucket carelessly into a corner and laughed you look quite a sight my friend i wish you could see yourself chavasse ignored him and turned to the rail they were very close to the castle and on this side the walls dropped sheer into the water they were moving toward a dark archway and hans cut the engine to half speed and took them in slowly as they entered chavasse was conscious of the terrible coldness of the damp air and he shivered and wiped his face with the back of one hand it came away covered with blood the launch bumped gently against the side of a stone jetty and hans ran along to the bows quickly vaulted over the rail and tied up to a large metal ring after you steiner said and gestured over the rail chavasse moved forward and stepped onto the jetty a flight of stone steps lifted out of the gloom to a landing above their head and he mounted them steiner and hans close behind him hans brushed past him and opened the door chavasse found himself in a long stoneflagged passage hans led the way to the far end opened another door and climbed a short flight of steps which entered directly into an immense hall great curved beams of black oak arched into the gloom and chavasse paused at the far end there was a wide marble stairway and above it a gallery at one side a log fire blazed in an immense medieval fireplace steiner said quite a sight isnt it used to belong to a prince but things have changed since the war chavasse moved on without answering and crossed the hall to the door that hans had just opened he hesitated on the threshold and steiner pushed him roughly inside the room was comfortably furnished and there was a luxurious carpet on the floor dr kruger and another man were sitting in front of the fire and they both stood up as hans pushed chavasse forward this is the man herr nagel steiner said nagel was tall and elegant in a suit of dark broadcloth and scrupulously white linen the irongray hair was brushed carefully back on each side and his face was as cold and austere as that of any sixteenthcentury calvinist minister he screwed a goldrimmed eyeglass firmly in place and examined chavasse i must say he looks rather less formidable than i had imagined and considerably the worse for wear we had to be a little rough with him steiner explained he tried to go for a swim kruger pulled on his beard with one hand and the dark eyes gleamed in the gaunt face thats a nasty cut on your face herr chavasse you must allow me to stitch it for you im afraid i dont happened to have a local anesthetic with me but im sure a brave man like you can bear a little pain you remind me of a slug i once found under a flat stone chavasse said rage glowed in krugers eyes but he raised one hand to stop steiner who had taken a step forward no leave him steiner his time will come bring in the other one steiner opened the door and spoke to someone outside as chavasse turned anna was pushed into the room and behind her he saw the smirking face of fassbender im sorry anna chavasse said quietly she managed a smile its all right paul it wasnt your fault i should have used my brains he said but we all make mistakes is this the jewish one nagel said i must say shes charming quite charming kruger was regarding her with a peculiar fixed stare you know my opinion of the race my dear kurt he said to nagel but their womenfolk have always appealed to me anna shuddered and kruger moved closer and placed a hand on her arm youve nothing to worry about my dear as long as you behave yourself that is she pulled away from him keep your hands off me kruger shrugged if you want it the hard way thats all right with me he pushed her toward hans lock her in the room next to mine no food or water ill deal with her myself later chavasse tried to look reassuring as hans pulled her out into the hall she managed one brave smile over her shoulder and then steiner closed the door nagel said now then chavasse lets get down to business what do you know about this bormann business chavasse said why ask me when youve got muller nagel sighed unfortunately muller is proving to be extremely stupid so far he has refused to talk i confess to some puzzlement about this i offered him a large sum of money very large however we now have some more information which should help and what would that be chavasse said nagel smiled all in good time my friend first i am going to let you have a few words with muller perhaps you can make him see sense i cant see why anything i can say should make him change his mind chavasse said not after the things you must have done to him nagel shrugged you can tell him that my patience is at an end for one thing he turned to the others shall we all go i think this might prove interesting steiner opened the door and led the way and chavasse followed with kruger and nagel bringing up the rear they crossed the hall and mounted the great staircase to the gallery from somewhere in the very depths of the castle chavasse could hear several dogs barking monotonously and something seemed to crawl across his skin as he wondered if he would ever leave this place alive they mounted several stairs that led into an upper gallery and two men who had been sitting quietly reading in opposite chairs stood up they were stolid and brawny obviously picked more for muscle than for brain and kruger told them to go down to the kitchen for a meal as they walked away kruger turned to nagel and said shall we let him have a word with his friend before seeing muller he sniggered after all it may be their last chance nagel smiled thinly by all means kruger unlocked the next door they came to and steiner pushed chavasse inside the room was quite comfortably furnished and seemed normal except for the bars on the windows hardt was lying on the bed and he swung his legs to the floor and rose to meet them his right arm was in a sling and his face looked drawn and pale he stared somberly at chavasse eyes a little feverish and a savage smile touched the corners of his mouth so they managed to catch up with you paul chavasse nodded im afraid so are you all right kruger moved forward he is doing extremely well arent you herr hardt a minor flesh wound in the shoulder i attended to it myself without an anesthetic hardt looked across at chavasse he still hasnt grown up enjoys pulling the wings off flies and all that sort of thing kruger deliberately placed his hand on the injured shoulder and squeezed hardt fell back onto the bed i shall be in again later kruger said when i have finished with you you will have learned how to curb your tongue he pushed chavasse out of the door and told steiner to lock it they walked along to the other end of the gallery and paused outside the last door nagel said you can have five minutes herr chavasse for mullers sake i hope he listens to you kruger unlocked the door and steiner pushed chavasse violently inside the door closed behind him and he went forward it was a bare unfurnished room in the center a strong metal operating table was bolted to the floor and leather straps hung from it presumably used to hold the patient in position muller was lying on a trundle bed in the far corner under a barred window chavasse went across and sat on the edge of the bed and after a while muller opened his eyes and stared up at him he seemed to be in his early forties and had a gaunt skulllike face that was covered with skin the color of parchment there were no visible marks and chavasse leaned forward and gently lifted the sheet muller was completely naked and his body was crisscrossed with great livid bruises and angry red weals he had obviously been terribly beaten he stared vacantly at chavasse for a moment and then something seemed to click and fear appeared in his eyes he tried to draw away with a tiny moan and chavasse said gently dont worry muller im not one of them muller moistened cracked lips who are you paul chavasse the man you were supposed to meet on the northwest express at osnabruck muller shook his head weakly why should i believe you chavasse leaned closer and pointed to his wounded face who do you think gave me this muller frowned and looked halfconvinced and chavasse went on i even know about your sister they dont know about that she was working at the taj mahal under the name of katie holdt muller reached out and clawed feebly toward chavasse for gods sake you mustnt tell them that i beg you not to tell them there were tears in his eyes it is only for my sisters sake that i have kept quiet i know what they would do to her chavasse eased him back against the pillow and said reassuringly dont worry i wont tell them about her has she got the manuscript muller nodded feebly i thought no one knew of her existence she was supposed to have died in the bombing in and bormann chavasse said where is he thats the big joke muller said the best joke of all he died three months ago in a little village in the harz mountains you were his orderly during the war chavasse said what happened afterward muller moistened his lips again bormann had money salted away in portugal we lived there under assumed names and i acted as his valet when his health started to fail and he knew he was dying he decided to return to germany he spent the last year of his life writing the manuscript he called it his testament something seemed to rattle in his throat and he closed his eyes as chavasse stood up the door opened and the others moved in nagel was smoking a cigarette in a long holder have you anything to tell me herr chavasse chavasse shook his head not a thing nagel sighed what a pity in that case he made a slight gesture with one hand and hans who had moved behind chavasse grabbed his arms and jerked them behind his back steiner moved in very fast his great hands clenched now comes the rest of the debt i owe you he said coldly and chavasse rocked back against hans as a fist crashed against his already damaged right cheek sending waves of pain moving through him he lifted both feet and slammed them into steiners stomach as the big german moved in again steiner was thrown back against the operating table for a moment he hung there and then he moved forward a terrible look on his face as chavasse started to struggle hans slid one forearm across his throat and squeezed and chavasse started to choke steiners first blow landed in his stomach and was followed by another and still another until chavasse slid to the floor steiner kicked him in the side of the neck and as he drew back his foot again nagel said sharply thats enough we want him alive for the moment chavasse kept his eyes closed and breathed deeply fighting the pain that flooded over him fighting to stay conscious he was aware of mullers groans as they dragged him from the bed and strapped him to the operating table nagel said muller can you hear me there was a moan and he continued muller ive been very patient with you but im beginning to run out of time shall we start steiner said chavasse forced open his eyes steiner and hans were both stripped to the waist and holding long rubber truncheons nagel leaned over the table we know about your sister muller he said katie holdt she calls herself i believe shes got the manuscript hasnt she muller tell us where she lives i only want the manuscript ill see nothing happens to her again there came that curious rattling sound in mullers throat nagel gave an exclamation of annoyance and stood back carry on he said to steiner and hans and turned away chavasse closed his eyes again at the first sound of a rubber hose curling around flesh and bone and then muller screamed and the blows and the screaming seemed to mingle endlessly and chavasse gritted his teeth and tried to shut out the sounds and then slid into darkness chapter he regained his senses slowly and lay unmoving on the floor eyes tightly closed he could not have been unconscious for long because they were all still in the room the sound of the beating had stopped and nagel seemed angry are you sure hes all right he asked there was a moments silence before kruger replied hes still alive if thats what you mean the stubborn fool nagel said angrily shall we start again steiner said nagel made an impatient sound hes no use to us dead and he will be if you give him any more leave him alone for now we have important things to talk over remember what are the plans for tonight kruger said that is what i propose to discuss nagel told him the reception starts at seven dinner will be at eight and hauptmann will make his speech at ninethirty precisely at what time do you wish me to be there steiner said nine oclock you will wait in the bushes below the terrace of the ballroom there will be a table on the terrace especially prepared for hauptmann i shall take him out there at ninefifteen on the pretext that it will give him a chance to collect his thoughts while we are getting the other guests seated for his speech can you be absolutely sure he will go out onto the terrace kruger said of course nagel told him i have known hauptmann for several years now and he never uses prepared speeches he always does it in this way he turned to steiner i want no mistakes about this steiner you have been selected because of your proven reliability hauptmann must die tonight it shall be as you say herr nagel steiner said confidently hauptmanns connection with the office for the detection of war crimes at ludwigsburg has made him into something of a national hero we must teach people a lesson let them know our movement is still a force to be reckoned with nagel crossed the room and stirred chavasse with his foot you were really extremely rough with our friend here he seems to be in a bad way i trust hell be in a fit state to answer a few questions when i return tomorrow kruger moved over beside him ill give him an examination later this afternoon are you staying for lunch i dont think so nagel said i really must get back to hamburg such a lot of preparations for tonights little affair they moved to the door and chavasse opened one eye slightly and watched them go hans opened the door and as they went out kruger said youd better stay on duty at the end of the gallery hans until the other two have had their meal the door closed and the key turned in the lock chavasse sat up slowly and gingerly touched the side of his neck with his fingertips it was lucky that steiner had been wearing nothing heavier than crepesoled shoes his stomach muscles were bruised and tender to the touch but it was his face that caused him the most pain it somehow felt lopsided and heavy and his right cheek was swollen and sticky with blood muller groaned slightly and again there was that uncanny rattle in his throat chavasse got to his feet and went across to the operating table as he looked down at that poor broken body muller opened his eyes and stared up at him vacantly he seemed to be trying to speak and chavasse leaned down my sister muller croaked did i tell them where to find her chavasse shook his head no you didnt tell them a damn thing something resembling a smile appeared on mullers face he closed his eyes with a long sigh of relief suddenly chavasse realized that mullers breathing had stopped for a long time chavasse stayed there looking down at a dead man after a while he sighed well you had guts muller ill say that for you he went across to the bed for a blanket which he took back to the operating table and draped over the body he started to examine the room there was no fireplace and the only window was crossed with iron bars set firmly in solid stone he next tried the door but a close examination of the locks made it clear that escape by that way was out of the question he glanced at his watch it was almost twothirty and he sat down on the bed and considered the situation he had to get out somehow from the look in krugers eye when he had first seen anna it wouldnt be very long before he paid her a visit and then there was the hauptmann affair he tried to remember what he had read of the man a liberal politician who was immensely popular with the people possibly even a future chancellor his death would be a world sensation how ironic that it was to take place at the united nations peace conference the very fact that nagel and his associates dared attempt such a deed indicated the strength of their movement if they got away with it there was no telling what the ultimate effect would be on the german political scene if the nazis obtained any kind of government control then everything would swing out of balance including relations between east and west germany the repercussions on world politics could be immense he slammed a fist into the bed and started to get to his feet it was then he noticed one of the long rubber truncheons that had been used to beat muller obviously either steiner or hans had dropped it carelessly to the floor and it had rolled under the operating table it was sticky with blood when he picked it up he wiped it on one of the blankets and then stood in the center of the room bending it in his hands it was about two feet long a horrible and deadly weapon and as he examined it a plan slowly formulated in his mind he opened his mouth wide and screamed he allowed the sound to die away and then repeated it as he listened footsteps approached along the corridor and halted outside the door chavasse started to groan and whimper horribly hans shouted through the door stop that noise or ill come in and make you shut up chavasse groaned horribly as if in great pain and quickly crossed the room and flattened himself against the wall behind the door hans said angrily right my friend youve asked for it the key rattled in the lock and the door swung open hans moved forward into the room his great hands clenched and chavasse said from behind him here i am as hans turned chavasse swung the truncheon with all his strength catching the man full across the throat hans made no sound his eyes retracted and he fell backward as if poleaxed his beard was flecked with foam and for a little while his fingers scrabbled uselessly at the floorboards as he fought for air and then he was still chavasse dropped onto one knee and searched him quickly but he was out of luck hans had not been carrying a gun chavasse went out into the gallery and listened but all was quiet he quickly locked the door and pocketed the key and then as he turned to move down toward the room in which hardt was imprisoned a woman screamed somewhere close at hand he moved along the corridor quickly and then she screamed again the sound coming clearly through an oak door at the end of the gallery he turned the handle and opened the door anna was crouched in the corner by the fireplace her dress torn down the front and a livid weal glowing angrily across one bare shoulder kruger stood in the center of the room a small whip twitching nervously in his right hand you wont get away from me my dear he said but please continue to resist it adds a certain spice chavasse slipped in through the door and closed it quietly behind him as he started to move forward anna saw him and her eyes widened kruger turned an expression of alarm on his ravaged face and chavasse slashed him across the back of the hand that held the whip an expression of agony flooded krugers face he fell to his knees and started to whimper like a child and chavasse lashed him across the head with the truncheon kruger bowed his head like a man in prayer and keeled over slowly chavasse raised the truncheon again and anna flung herself forward and caught hold of his arm thats enough paul she said fiercely holding him with a grip of surprising strength he lowered his arm reluctantly has he harmed you she shook her head hes only been with me for ten minutes most of the time he spent talking the most unutterable filth we must thank god for the fact hes only half a man chavasse said and pulled her toward the door we havent got much time to waste we must release hardt and then find a way out of this place what about muller she said muller wont be going anywhere ever again he told her they paused outside the door of the room in which hardt was imprisoned and chavasse tried the key that he had taken from hans the door opened noiselessly to reveal hardt sitting on the edge of the bed head in hands he looked up slowly and an expression of amazement appeared on his face how the hell have you managed this i had to get a little violent chavasse told him how do you feel well enough to make a move id walk to china to get out of this place no need to go to extremes chavasse said if we can successfully negotiate the main hall and reach the cellars our troubles are over they keep a launch down there in an underground cavern with direct access to the lake and what about muller ive just spent the last hour with him chavasse said steiner and hans laid it on a bit too thick during the last beating i was alone with him when he died did he tell you anything hardt asked chavasse nodded apparently bormann died some months ago muller was just trying to make himself a little cash on the side and the manuscript thats genuine enough chavasse said his sisters looking after it shes the one weve got to find now he took annas hand and led the way out of the room and along the gallery the hall was completely deserted the only sound the peaceful crackle of the logs in the great fireplace he smiled reassuringly to the other two and they began a cautious descent when they were halfway down the staircase one of the doors was flung open and steiner entered the hall he was lighting a cigarette the match in his cupped hands so that for a moment he did not see them and then he looked up and an expression of astonishment appeared on his face as chavasse turned and started to push anna back up the staircase steiner pulled out a luger and fired the bullet chipped one of the marble pillars at the head of the stairs and chavasse pushed anna forward and followed her halfcrouching they ran along the gallery hardt at their heels and steiner fired again they plunged down a narrow flight of stairs and entered a lower corridor with a door at the end of it when chavasse tried to open it he found that it was locked we passed a door on the left hardt said and he turned and went back the way they had come the door opened to his touch and they entered into what looked like a servants bedroom at that moment steiner paused at the top of the flight of stairs and fired along the corridor chavasse slammed the door shut and pushed the bolts into place securing it for the moment now what do we do hardt demanded chavasse moved across to the window and opened it the waters of the lake splashed against the stone wall of the castle twenty feet below them he turned to hardt its only about a hundred yards to the shore do you think you could swim that far sink or swim what does it matter in a situation like this hardt said simply and you anna chavasse said she smiled ive been swimming all my life at that moment steiner kicked on the door youd better come out of there he bellowed angrily chavasse made a quick gesture toward the window after you two he said and good luck hardt went first and then anna as chavasse pulled himself up onto the sill steiner fired several times through the door chavasse took a deep breath and jumped he hit the water with a solid forceful smack and surfaced almost immediately it was bitterly cold and he was aware of anna floating beside him are you all right he gasped she nodded and gulped fine hardt was already disappearing into the mist as they struck out after him as the castle disappeared from view chavasse heard a sudden impotent cry of rage and a bullet sang over the water and then they were alone in a dark world that seemed to enclose them completely they swam together in a triangle with hardt leading he looked very white and strained and chavasse gasped you managing all right hardt spit out a stream of brown lake water and managed a tired grin my arm doesnt feel too good but dont worry ill reach the shore chavasse turned to look at anna and heard the engine of the launch shatter the silence with a roar as it emerged from beneath the castle they kept on swimming increasing the stroke as the launch passed them nearby and then returned again they moved together and stopped swimming treading water as they listened and then the launch seemed to be right on top of them and its roaring filled their ears down chavasse gasped desperately and they ducked under the water he felt himself thrash about helplessly like a fish in a net and then he erupted to the surface lungs bursting anna appeared first and hardt a little later and they huddled together tossed about by the turbulence and listened as the sound of the launch died away in the distance after a while chavasse nodded and they started to swim again the boathouse loomed out of the mist five minutes later and they waded through the shallows and mounted the slipway the wooden doors were not locked and chavasse opened them and they passed inside anna slumped down onto a pile of old sacks and pushed a damp tendril of hair back i dont think ive ever felt so cold in my life hardt ran a hand wearily across his face what do we do now chavasse shrugged play the cards as they fall but whatever happens one of us must get to hamburg steiners going to assassinate hauptmann at nagels reception for the peace conference delegates oh my god anna said hauptmann hes a good man one of the finest men in germany at that moment a dog howled suddenly from the direction of the causeway leading to the castle a little later the sound came again muffled by the mist but definitely coming nearer hardt turned quickly his eyes somber steiner has set the dogs on us i saw them early this morning when they brought me here three blackandtan dobermans trained to kill we dont stand a chance we do if we split up chavasse said one of us can lead the dogs off while the other two get away somebody must go to hamburg whom do you suggest hardt inquired ironically im in better shape than you are i could probably lead them a longer dance but youd be a damned sight more useful in handling these people when you get to hamburg hardt said chavasse started to protest but anna caught him by the hand and pulled him round to face her marks right paul you are the only one who can save hauptmanns life and that is the main thing now behind them a door banged and when chavasse turned hardt was gone they could hear him crashing his way through the fir trees making no attempt to hide the noise of his progress and then there were confused cries as the search party from the castle heard him a moment later the dogs started to howl and as chavasse and anna listened breathlessly the sounds faded into the distance and they were alone chapter hes quite a man chavasse said out of the silence anna nodded i found that out a long time ago where do we go from here back to the inn he said theres always the volkswagen with any luck we can be on the way back to hamburg in fifteen minutes she shook her head gravely im afraid not paul fassbender drove the car to the castle i saw it in the courtyard when they took me in he frowned for a moment as he considered possibilities and then he came to a decision well still go back to the inn theres a chance fassbender is with the search party and theyre going in the opposite direction but well have to hurry he led the way outside and they plunged into the wood after a few moments they came to the path that they had originally followed to the lake and chavasse took anna by the hand and started to run there was no sign of movement from the inn and only the thin spiral of blue smoke from one chimney indicated life they paused in the fringe of fir trees at the edge of the yard and then chavasse squeezed her hand and ran across to the back door halfcrouching he opened the door quickly pushed anna through and followed her closing it behind him they were standing in a large stoneflagged kitchen the old woman was bending over the sink scrubbing out a pan and she turned and looked at them vacantly you didnt come in for lunch she said chavasse smiled gently no we went boating on the lake and had an accident as you can see is herr fassbender about she shook her head he went to the castle he said he wouldnt be back until nightfall is anyone else here she looked bewildered but why would there be anyone else here mein herr she turned back to the sink and her pans muttering to herself and shaking her head chavasse opened the far door and pushed anna through into the stoneflagged passage a good thing for us the old girls a simpleton anna nodded what do we do now you can go straight upstairs and change into some dry clothes he said be as quick as you can and then look for fassbenders room and see if you can find me something suitable were about the same size what about you she said ive got some telephoning to do he smiled and pushed her gently toward the stairs hurry it up angel weve got to get out of here as fast as we damned well can when she had gone he went behind the reception desk and put a call through to london the operator promised to ring him back and he replaced the receiver and went into the bar where he helped himself to a double brandy and a packet of cigarettes he shivered with pleasure as the brandy spread through his body in a warm tide he decided to have another one and was just finishing it when the phone rang he lifted the receiver and waited and after a while jean frazers voice crackled over the wire brown amp company here can i help you this is cunningham speaking chavasse told her id like a word with mr taylor if hes available just a moment please mr cunningham she said calmly a moment later the chief s voice sounded in his ear taylor here is that you cunningham hows business booming chavasse said in fact i could use some help can you do anything its rather urgent its nice to know things are going so well the chief said and ill certainly do what i can where can you be reached ill be at the atlantic with sir george chavasse said ill try and hang on there until eight but i cant make it any later than that im afraid that should be fine the chief said weve a very good local contact name of von kraul ill see if hes available ill look forward to seeing him chavasse said now im afraid ill have to go things are moving pretty fast at the moment the chief s voice didnt change well thats nice to know cunningham well have to see about a bonus for you when you come home ill be looking forward to seeing you there was a click at the other end of the line and chavasse grinned and replaced his own receiver he felt a lot happier one thing about the chief he was completely reliable if he said hed see to something it got done he looked up the number of the atlantic hotel in the telephone directory and asked for sir george harvey it took them ten minutes to find him and they finally located him in the famous long bar he sounded a little irritated at being dragged away from his drink harvey here whos speaking he barked chavasse told him and sir georges tone changed at once my dear chap ive been wondering what had happened to you you said youd be willing to help me at any time chavasse said that all i had to do was call you does that still go naturally sir george said brusquely im not in the habit of saying things i dont mean then leave the hotel at once chavasse said get into your car and take the main road to lubeck about twenty miles out of hamburg youll come to a signpost on your left pointing the way to a place called berndorf ill be waiting for you there is this really important sir george asked its a matter of life and death chavasse told him and im not being melodramatic im on my way sir george said and his receiver clicked into place chavasse went upstairs and found anna in their bedroom laying out a tweed suit underwear and socks on the bed ive even managed a pair of shoes i hope they fit he started to strip his wet clothes and she toweled his body briskly ive been in touch with sir george harvey he said hes going to pick us up at the berndorf signpost on the main road what do we do when we reach hamburg she asked as he dressed quickly well drop you at your apartment he said ill go on to the atlantic with sir george ive been in touch with london theyre arranging for a german intelligence man called von kraul to meet me there do you know him she shook her head so far weve tried to stay out of their way she cleaned his battered face with a wet washcloth as she talked and covered the slash across his right cheek with sticking plaster thats partly why i want to leave you at the apartment he said the less von kraul knows about israeli underground groups working in germany the better another thing if mark manages to elude the chase thats where hell try to contact you do you think he stands a chance she said chavasse shrugged theres always hope in this heavy rain it will be difficult for the dogs to follow his scent and the mist should help him a lot i hope and pray he comes out of it safely she said and there was a poignancy and depth in her voice that he found curiously disturbing you think a lot of him dont you he said gently she nodded i should hes my stepbrother weve always been very close for once he could think of nothing to say and they went downstairs in silence from several coats hanging in the hall he selected a thighlength waterproof hunting jacket for himself and a green tyrolean hat he helped anna into an old and shabby trench coat that was far too large for her and they left they followed the road out of the village walking in silence and he felt curiously depressed it was a feeling difficult to analyze but probably caused by too little sleep for too long every muscle in his body seemed to be aching and his face pained him intensely after they had gone a couple of miles he paused i think wed better go through the trees for the rest of the way just in case they happen to be patrolling the main road she nodded without speaking and they left the road and walked through the trees brushing aside the rainsoaked branches of the firs chavasse saw the hunting lodge first and beyond it the white gleam of the road as they approached he realized that the place was derelict the door hung on one hinge and the windows gaped sightlessly he checked the time it was just after fourthirty it was unlikely that sir george would arrive before five weve got about half an hour to spare he told anna we might as well stay here the main road is only fifty or so yards away just as you like paul she said listlessly and preceded him through the door it had that peculiar musty smell usual to such places composed of dampness and leaf mold anna sat down on the windowsill and chavasse gave her a cigarette for a little while they smoked in silence and she gazed out of the window an expression of great sadness on her face after a while chavasse said anything the matter she shook her head not really nothing i could put my finger on she turned and smiled at him looking suddenly absurdly young in the old trench coat he grinned that coats far too large for you she nodded it was made in england i noticed the label when i put it on i wonder how it came to be hanging on that peg at the inn he shrugged probably left by some tourist a long time ago i think thats one of the saddest phrases in the english language she said a long time ago on me it has the same effect as a bugle sounding taps lights out youre through its all over there was a terrible pathos in her voice and he dropped his cigarette and caught hold of her arms anna what is it youve never talked like this before ive never felt like this before she said ive been watching you paul the way you react to danger the way you always have an answer for every emergency that utterly ruthless streak so essential to success she shook her head youll never change paul you couldnt even if you wanted to all those things we discussed the things we said wed do after this is all over they were just a pipe dream he gripped her arm fiercely bitter anger rising inside him but i can change he said i promise you anna when this job is finished im getting out of the game for good she touched his face gently with her fingers and shook her head no you wont paul you and i this hunting lodge everything weve gone through in the last few days none of it has any reality one day youll look back on it all and it will simply be something that happened a long time ago she laughed lightly what was that line in one of marlowes plays but that was long ago and in another country he pulled her into his arms holding her against him and then he heard the unmistakable sound of a car slowing down in the road she tried to pull away from him and said gently i think wed better go now paul that sounds like sir george he tried to bring her back into his arms but she braced herself to resist him hard and unyielding after a moment he shrugged and released her she turned without a word and he followed her out of the hunting lodge and through the trees toward the road chapter they drove very fast on the way back to hamburg anna huddled in a corner of the rear seat eyes closed while chavasse and sir george talked youll never know how much i appreciate this chavasse said sir george snorted rubbish my dear fellow as i told you before im glad to help i must say you look rather the worse for wear chavasse grinned im afraid i havent been mixing in very friendly company any new developments in the bormann affair chavasse nodded ive managed to find out that bormann himself died several months ago as for the manuscript apparently mullers sister has it have you got a line on her sir george said im afraid not chavasse told him in any case there are more important things to worry about at the moment id like you to drop miss hartmann at her apartment first then well carry on to the atlantic ive taken the liberty of arranging to meet a german intelligence man in your suite i hope you dont mind not in the least sir george said things must be getting warm if youve decided to call in the germans chavasse nodded this is something else ive uncovered and some extremely big people are involved under the circumstances im afraid i cant discuss it with you until ive seen this man from german intelligence its really something which directly concerns them i quite understand sir george said cheerfully after all the formalities must be observed and continentals are always so damned touchy just remember im always willing to do everything i can he sighed i shall be sorry when its time to go home chavasse ive rather enjoyed this little trip chavasse eased his aching body into a more comfortable position he closed his eyes and thought about anna and what she had said was it really true was he in fact a sort of twentiethcentury mercenary who enjoyed the game for its own sake there was no answer he wasnt even sure that to be that kind of man was such a bad thing he was still thinking about it when they entered the outskirts of hamburg sir george drove straight into the center crossed the alster by the lombardsbrucke and chavasse directed him from there it was almost a quarter to six when they turned into the quiet side street and halted outside annas apartment she was still dozing when chavasse got out of the car and opened the rear door when he touched her arm she opened her eyes at once and gazed blankly at him and then she smiled im sorry im so tired i could sleep for a week she turned to sir george may i add my thanks to pauls i dont know what wed have done without your help he held her hand for a moment admiration on his face youre an extremely courageous young woman its been a pleasure and a privilege to serve you she colored deeply and got out of the car without saying anything and chavasse walked to the door with her i want you to sit tight until i come back he said it might be late because ive got to get this hauptmann business sorted out she suddenly looked very tired i dont think i could go anywhere even if i wanted to he kissed her lightly on the mouth thats just something on account once all this is settled were going to have a serious talk about the future understand she was too tired to argue if you like paul she went up the steps to the front door as she opened it she turned and smiled and the smile seemed to get right inside him filling him with an aching longing to hold her in his arms for a moment or two he stayed there staring up at the door after she had closed it and then he went back to the car a very remarkable young woman sir george said as they drove away pretty into the bargain shes all that and more chavasse told him sir george smiled do i detect a hint of romance in the air chavasse nodded i certainly hope so i intend to get out of this game altogether when this bormann affair is satisfactorily concluded very sensible sir george said approvingly you cant last forever it was a sobering thought chavasse considered some of the people he had known during his five years with the bureau it was a universal human failing to think that you were cleverer than the next man or that it couldnt happen to you but how many intelligent resourceful people had he known who had failed to return from one assignment or another one of these days it would be his turn because sooner or later everybody made a mistake it was sound logic to get out while he was still ahead of the game he was still thinking about it when they reached the atlantic sir george had a suite on the second floor of the hotel as they went up in the elevator he glanced at his watch anxiously im afraid im going to have to leave you on your own to meet this german intelligence chap ive got an appointment for seven ive hardly got time to change into evening clothes a thought suddenly occurred to chavasse and he said are you going to this reception that kurt nagel is giving for the delegates sir george raised his eyebrows in surprise thats right how did you know i read about it chavasse told him i think the conference as a whole owes its success to nagel more than to any other man sir george said as he unlocked the door of his suite do you know anything about him chavasse shook his head i cant say i do but then ive been rather out of touch with the german scene until these last few days sir george told him to help himself to a drink and disappeared into the bedroom chavasse examined the bottles on the side of the table poured a brandy took a cigarette from a silver box and settled into a comfortable chair he was about to pick up a newspaper when the telephone rang when he lifted the receiver he recognized annas voice at once she sounded excited paul is that you what is it he demanded has something happened about ten minutes ago the porter brought a package up to my apartment she said it was delivered by mail this morning when i removed the outer wrapper i found it contained a letter and another sealed package with a sudden elation he knew what the answer to his next question would be before he put it to her let me guess the letter was from katie holdt right first time anna told him she says that shes had to go away for a while and asks me to look after the package for her obviously my time at the taj mahal wasnt wasted after all if i read or hear of anything happening to her im to post the package to the authorities at bonn needless to say youve already opened it chavasse said she laughed of course i have bormanns handwriting covers more than four hundred closely packed pages it should make very interesting reading shall i bring it over no sit tight where you are he said ive still got this hauptmann business to handle von kraul hasnt arrived yet ill be with you as soon as i can possibly make it in the meantime you have that sleep you were talking about she chuckled nothing doing ive never felt so wide awake in my life i intend to curl up on the sofa with a good book until you get back he replaced the receiver and turned to find sir george standing just inside the room adjusting his bow tie presumably that wasnt for me he said chavasse shook his head it was anna believe it or not the manuscript has turned up well ill be damned sir george said how did that happen chavasse explained about katie holdt i suppose she got into a panic and decided to clear out for a while leaving the manuscript with anna would seem like good insurance against being killed by the opposition if they caught up with her she could always pull the old bluff about the authorities getting the manuscript automatically if anything happened to her yes i suppose that explains it sir george pulled on his overcoat and sighed i wish i didnt have to go to this damned affair just when things are getting exciting i hope youll let me have a peep at the manuscript before it goes to the authorities i think we can manage that all right chavasse told him well i really must rush sir george said dont be afraid to ring room service for anything you need when he had gone chavasse poured himself another drink he was filled with a feeling of tremendous exhilaration the job was as good as finished getting the manuscript back to london was simply a matter of routine there only remained the hauptmann affair admittedly it would have to be handled by german intelligence but he still had a deep personal interest in seeing that steiner and nagel got what was coming to them at that moment a buzzer sounded sharply and he crossed to the door and opened it the man who faced him looked to be in his early fifties he carried a walking stick in one hand and was wearing a dark blue overcoat with a fur collar his face was round and benign the flesh pouching a little beneath the eyes and chin as if from overeating the rimless spectacles completed the picture of a reasonably averagelooking german businessman only the eyes shrewd and calculating and never still gave him away to the trained observer herr chavasse i believe he said in german i am colonel von kraul how did you recognize me chavasse said as he closed the door after the german had entered von kraul sat down in one of the easy chairs we have a dossier on you in our files ive heard a lot about you thats why i came at once after our mutual friend spoke to me from london on the telephone i trust i havent wasted my time you can judge for yourself chavasse said grimly how important would you say heinrich hauptmann is to the future of germany von kraul was lighting a long black cheroot he hesitated for a fraction of a second and then continued with what he was doing when the cheroot was burning to his liking he said hauptmann no man is indispensable but in german politics at the present time hauptmann comes closer to it than anyone else i know hes going to be assassinated at ninefifteen tonight chavasse said for a long moment von kraul gazed steadily at him and then he sighed and looked at his watch it is precisely seven oclock that gives us two and a quarter hours herr chavasse i suggest you tell me all you know as quickly as possible chavasse got to his feet do you know a man called kurt nagel the steel magnate von kraul nodded a very wellknown figure in hamburg life hes extremely wealthy and a great philanthropist as a matter of fact hes giving a reception tonight for the peace conference delegates to which hauptmann has also been invited to make a speech chavasse said for the first time von krauls calm deserted him are you trying to tell me that nagel has something to do with this business chavasse nodded hes a key man in the nazi underground i dont know how large his organization is but i can tell you who his two righthand men are a physician named kruger who runs a clinic in blankenese and a hamburg police inspector named steiner von kraul got to his feet and walked across to the table on which the bottles were standing and poured himself a large brandy with a steady hand he drank it down in one easy swallow and then stared reflectively into the empty glass from anyone else i would have regarded such a story with incredulity it is lucky for you mein herr that your name is paul chavasse lucky for hauptmann you mean chavasse said von kraul went back to his chair how exactly does the killing take place chavasse closed his eyes and let his mind wander back to the room in the castle at berndorf in which muller had died it was an old trick and one that had served him well in the past ill try to remember nagels exact instructions he said and after a moment started to speak when he had finished von kraul sat in the chair hands folded across the handle of his walking stick and gazed at the opposite wall after a while he said steiner will be there on his own you are sure of that chavasse nodded thats the essence of the whole plan simplicity and a simple plan may be thwarted just as simply von kraul said is that not logic herr chavasse what do you have in mind von kraul shrugged i was thinking that we do not want an unsavory scandal particularly one which suggested that the nazis were still active and powerful such things are meat and drink to our communist friends ill go that far with you chavasse said but where does it get us to the grounds of herr nagels house at blankenese von kraul said it seems to me that two determined men could handle this affair are you interested chavasse got to his feet a smile spreading across his face youre too damned right im interested then i suggest we be on our way as he stood von kraul said you know there are considerable gaps in your story and i am a man with a naturally tidy mind i would be very interested in knowing how you first became involved with nagel and his friends chavasse was in the act of pulling on the hunting jacket he had taken from the inn at berndorf and he smiled now surely you know better than to ask me a thing like that colonel von kraul sighed after all we are supposed to be allies how much simpler it would be if we were completely frank with each other he held open the door shall we go his car was a black porsche and he handled it more than competently as they moved through the heavy traffic in the center of the city and crossed the alster by the lombardsbrucke chavasse glanced at his watch it was just after seventhirty and he turned to his companion and said how long will it take us to reach nagels place von kraul said twenty minutes perhaps even thirty certainly not longer chavasse made a quick decision id like to call in on a friend if you dont mind just to let her know ill be a little later than i said von kraul chuckled a woman eh will it take long chavasse shook his head only a couple of minutes i promise you and its on our way von kraul made no further comment after chavasse gave him the address and they continued in silence through the busy streets it was a fine autumn evening and the rain had stopped chavasse lowered the window and lit a cigarette feeling suddenly content every so often he had a feeling that things were running his way that the job was going to get finished in exactly the way he wanted when the porsche braked to a halt in front of the apartment house where anna lived he got out feeling absurdly happy and grinned through the side window at von kraul ill only be a couple of minutes von kraul smiled the cheroot still between his teeth take your time my friend within reason of course he went up the stairs two at a time and rang annas bell and waited humming to himself there was no immediate reply and after a moment or two he rang the bell again still there was no reply he tried to open the door but it was locked and he frowned and pressed the bellpush again holding his thumb in place for several seconds this time thinking that perhaps she might be in the bath it was only then that he felt afraid he hammered several times on the door and called her name but there was no reply and he became aware of the peculiar silence that reigned throughout the entire house he went downstairs quickly and knocked on the door of the caretakers apartment in the hall at first nothing happened and he kicked the bottom of the door savagely and then he heard slow reluctant footsteps approaching the door opened a little and the caretaker peered out yes mein herr what is it miss hartmann chavasse said the young woman upstairs i cant get any reply the caretaker was a middleaged man with watery blue eyes and a pouched and wrinkled face he shrugged that is not surprising mein herr fraulein hartmann went out nearly an hour ago chavasse rammed his shoulder against the door with such force that the caretaker was sent staggering across the room to crash into the opposite wall there was a cry of alarm as chavasse followed him in and a grayhaired woman shrank back in her chair a hand covering her mouth chavasse grabbed the terrified caretaker by the front of his shirt and pulled him close youre lying he said i happen to know that nothing on earth would make her leave her apartment at this particular moment he slapped the man backhanded across the face where is she the mans head rolled from side to side helplessly i cant tell you mein herr its as much as my lifes worth chavasse slapped him again viciously and with all his strength the woman flung herself across the room and tugged at his arm leave him alone ill tell you what you want to know only dont hit him any more hes a sick man he was wounded at stalingrad chavasse pushed the caretaker down into a chair and turned to the woman all right you tell me and youd better make it convincing as she opened her mouth to speak her husband said desperately for gods sake keep your mouth shut remember what he threatened to do if we talked i know what im doing willi she said and turned back to chavasse about twenty minutes ago a car drew up outside there were two men in it only one got out how do you know about this chavasse asked i saw them from the window the one who came in knocked on the door and my husband answered he wanted to know the number of fraulein hartmanns apartment a few minutes afterward we heard a scream and when we went out into the hall he was dragging her down the stairs chavasse closed his eyes for a moment and drew a long breath why didnt you call the police he threatened us mein herr she said simply he said that at the very least he would see that my husband lost his job and you believed him chavasse said in disgust she nodded these people have the power to do anything mein herr they are all around us what chance have poor people like ourselves to oppose them they got us into the last war they will have us fighting again before they are done tomorrow the world he thought tomorrow the world he turned away from her a sudden hatred for everything german rising inside him she followed him to the door and held out a key this is a master key mein herr perhaps you would like to examine the apartment he took it from her without a word and went slowly up the stairs there was no life left in him at all and he unlocked the door and went inside and switched on the light shed put up a struggle that much was obvious the carpet was rucked up and the table in the center of the room was overturned the telephone lying on the floor the table and chair by the window were in their usual positions the hebrew textbook and notebook lying open almost as if she had been working a moment before and had simply left the room for a little while he looked into the bedroom she had obviously changed on coming in and undergarments were strewn carelessly across the bed he picked up a nylon stocking that had fallen to the floor and stood with it in his hands staring blindly into space after a while he dropped it onto the bed and returned to the living room and discovered colonel von kraul in the act of righting the upturned table chapter you were so long i began to worry von kraul said as he picked up the telephone and placed it on the table your friend has gone out chavasse nodded slowly yes and im very much afraid she wont be coming back there would appear to have been a struggle the german said dont you think you should tell me about it my friend presumably it has some connection with the business we have in hand chavasse sat down after a moment or two he looked up and said there doesnt seem much point in keeping it to myself now does there not really von kraul said in any case i may be able to help chavasse shook his head somehow i dont think so he stood up and walked across to the window and looked out into the darkening street i came to germany to find martin bormann wed heard that he was alive and that hed written his memoirs von krauls eyes had narrowed slightly but his face remained calm only the whiteness of his knuckles as his hands tightened over the handle of his walking stick betrayed the fact that he was considerably moved by what chavasse had just told him and were these facts true chavasse nodded in the main bormann died some months ago in a village in the harz apparently hed spent most of the postwar years in portugal his valet a man called muller got hold of the manuscript of the memoirs and tried to make himself a little money he approached a firm of german publishers and got the nazi underground on his track he then tried a british firm thats how we got onto him did you ever meet this man muller von kraul asked chavasse nodded i was present when he was beaten to death by steiner and another man in nagels castle at berndorf this is all beginning to sound very involved von kraul said and how does the young woman you were hoping to meet here fit into things she was working for an unofficial israeli underground organization chavasse told him the same people who tracked down eichmann i see von kraul said dryly she and her friends were also after bormann it would appear that everyone was in on the affair except for german intelligence she telephoned me at the atlantic an hour or so ago chavasse continued without going into details of how and why she found bormanns manuscript waiting for her when she returned to the apartment this evening it had been delivered by mail presumably thats what the opposition were after when they came here von kraul said chavasse shook his head i think they were looking for anna it was just luck that she happened to have the manuscript it must make interesting reading chavasse nodded i understand bormann washed a lot of dirty linen in public and gave names people whove always insisted they never really supported hitler important people presumably nagel must be included von kraul said he probably has a chapter to himself chavasse told him and at that moment the phone rang he lifted the receiver and said yes who is it knowing full well who it was steiners voice floated over the wire now thats a superfluous question surely you expected me to call how did you know i was here because ive had the place under observation since we left steiner sounded full of confidence lets cut the talk and get down to business chavasse told him what have you done with the girl steiner laughed harshly you know youre not as bright as i was led to believe chavasse you allowed us to follow you all the way from berndorf to the girls apartment youve got the manuscript chavasse said what more do you want ah yes the manuscript providential that she had it with her when we called im sure youll be interested to know that ive reduced it to ashes in the furnace of the establishment from which i am now speaking it made a fine blaze chavasse sat down there were beads of sweat on his forehead and the room seemed unbearably warm he cleared his throat youve got what you wanted why dont you let the girl go she cant harm you now but thats exactly what i intend to do steiner said with your cooperation of course von kraul was crouched beside chavasse his ear as close to the receiver as possible and he looked up eyes expressionless chavasse moistened his lips what do you want me to do im so glad youre being sensible steiner said to be perfectly honest weve found you a nuisance chavasse wed rather you were out of germany now that the bormann affair is finished theres really nothing to keep you here a london plane leaves the airport at ten oclock if youll give me your word not to trouble us any more you and the girl can leave together on that plane how do i know i can trust you chavasse asked you dont steiner replied but if you feel like taking a chance be outside altona station at nine oclock a car will pick you up there and take you to the girl take me to a quiet grave more likely chavasse told him just as you please steiner said coldly but make your decision quickly i dont have a great deal of time to spare chavasse glanced at von kraul and there was pity in the germans eyes chavasse said desperately how do i know the girl is still alive you can judge for yourself there was a murmur of conversation at the other end and then annas voice sounded clear and calm but somehow far away is that you paul he found difficulty in speaking im sorry anna ive made a fine mess of things dont listen to them she said calmly they mean to kill you there was a commotion and the receiver was pulled from her hand chavasse heard the confused sounds of a struggle and steiners cry of alarm stop her you idiot shes making for the window there was a crash of breaking glass and then the sound of three shots so close together that to anyone other than an expert they might have sounded like one chavasse got to his feet a terrible coldness seeping through him there was a slight click at the other end of the line and steiner said calmly all bets are off chavasse it appears we no longer have anything to discuss chavasse dropped the receiver into its cradle he felt a hand on his shoulder and von kraul said i think it would be better if you were to sit down my friend chavasse brushed the hand away ill be all right he said just give me a minute thats all he went into the kitchen and searched the cupboards until he found a halffull bottle of polish vodka on a lower shelf he pulled the cork with his teeth and tilted back his head the liquor burned its way into his stomach and he coughed and leaned over the sink after a moment von kraul appeared at his side do you feel any better chavasse turned and looked at him with staring eyes she did it deliberately she made him shoot her that way she solved my problem for me she must have been a very wonderful young woman colonel von kraul said in impotent fury chavasse smashed the bottle against the sink i only want one thing to wrap my hands around steiners throat i dont give a damn what happens to me as long as i can do that von kraul gently moved away then i suggest we leave we have not got a great deal of time chavasse followed him without a word and it was as if for the moment his mind had become frozen so that the sights and sounds of the streets as they drove out toward blankenese had no meaning for him he stared out of the windshield into the night and remembered that the last time he had driven out along this road anna had been by his side as they entered blankenese and passed the station he looked down toward the direction of the elbe remembering the café on the strandweg and the lights over the water and the feel of her in his arms the plans they had made it was all like something that had never really happened a dream already halfforgotten and fastfading so that now when he tried to picture her clearly he found it to be impossible nagels house was a large imposing mansion with grounds running down to the elbe and the road that ran past the main gates was lined with parked cars von kraul took the car to the end of the road and turned into a small dark culdesac where he braked to a halt and switched off the lights the terrace of the ballroom is at the rear of the house and looks down toward the river he said there is a little gate in the hedge which is mainly for the use of tradespeople it will be our best way in he found the gate with no difficulty and chavasse followed him through and they crossed the wide lawn toward the great house the place was ablaze with lights and several windows were halfopen so that chavasse could hear the murmur of conversation and occasional snatches of careless laughter the terrace stood some six feet above the level of the ground and a mass of rhododendron bushes ran along its entire length drapes were drawn across the french windows of the ballroom but here and there a ray of light poked out into the cold night air they found the table and chair arranged at the north end of the terrace they moved into the bushes until they were directly underneath it and von kraul said simple but extremely clever steiner can fire from here at virtually pointblank range and yet not be seen himself should anyone else appear on the terrace unexpectedly chavasse checked his watch without replying it was a quarter to nine and he squatted down beside von kraul in the bushes and waited feeling suddenly calm a small wind brought the smell of the river with it through the darkness and he could hear the sound of a ships engines clearly as it moved downriver he heard steiner coming before von kraul did and rose to his feet his hands coming out of his pockets they stood together in the sheltering darkness of the bushes and steiner paused no more than a foot or two away from them a ray of light streamed through a gap in one of the drapes and continued down through the bushes and slanted into the ground steiner dropped on one knee and took out a gun and quickly checked its action in the small pool of light it was a mauser with a silencer on the end of the barrel chavasse said quietly hello you bastard and as the kneeling man glanced up in alarm he kicked the mauser out of his hand steiner came to his feet slowly i knew you were trouble the first time i clapped eyes on you on the train i should have put one between your eyes at berndorf yesterday but nagel wanted to play games he laughed harshly but i fixed your girlfriend for you one in the back and two in the belly chavasse kicked for the crotch but steiner caught the blow on his thigh and swung with his fist catching chavasse high on the right cheek sending blood spurting from the gash that was already there pain flooded through chavasse and he lashed out viciously with the edge of his right hand catching steiner on the side of the neck steiner lurched into him and they fell to the ground chavasse underneath he felt the big policemans hands wrap themselves around his throat and he tensed his neck muscles and forced back the little finger of each hand steiner grunted with pain and released his grip and chavasse pushed back the mans head with the heel of his hand twisting the neck until steiner fell backward and rolled over onto his back coming to a stop so that his face lay in a pool of light chavasse moved forward hands reaching for the throat and then a hand appeared from the darkness holding the mauser the bulbous silencer on the end of the barrel was jammed against steiners right ear and there was a slight muffled cough steiners body jerked once and then blood poured from his eyes and nostrils chavasse got to his feet before he could speak von kraul whispered someone is coming they moved into the bushes and crouched down as one of the french windows was opened it was carefully closed again and steps crossed the terrace are you there steiner nagel whispered from the darkness and he leaned over the balustrade before chavasse could move von kraul rose to his feet and shot nagel between the eyes he must have been killed instantly and fell across the balustrade his body sliding headfirst into the bushes we must move fast von kraul said he took out a handkerchief and carefully wiped the mauser clean of his fingerprints and then he knelt down and folded the fingers of steiners right hand around the butt he stood up and gave chavasse a gentle push and now i think we had better leave events to take their course as they crossed the wide lawn rain started to fall and they hurried along the path passed out through the gate in the hedge and climbed into the car von kraul drove back the way they had come and they passed blankenese station and moved on toward hamburg after a while they came to a beer house on a corner and von kraul stopped the car and said i think we are entitled to drink my friend chavasse nodded and they went inside von kraul gave him a cheroot and they sat in silence over two glasses of brandy finally von kraul said you feel a little better now chavasse managed a smile i acted like a beginner on my first job im sorry when he boasted about what hed done to her i lost control under the circumstances it was understandable von kraul said but my way was better police inspector suffering from brainstorm shoots wellknown hamburg industrialist and then commits suicide the trimmings they give the story do not really matter it is the result which counts but why did you want to handle it that way chavasse said von kraul sighed can you imagine how difficult it would have been to have proved your allegations against nagel even steiner would have presented us with quite a problem unfortunately such people have many powerful sympathizers a long drawnout legal battle could have lasted for years i suppose youre right chavasse said so that wraps it up i wont be taking much back with me bormann was dead in the first place and his memoirs have gone up in smoke but you have been of great assistance to germany if i may say so colonel von kraul said chavasse shrugged and said bitterly yes i suppose you could say that von kraul placed his glass very carefully down upon the table and when he spoke there was a slight edge of emotion in his voice presumably this means nothing to you are we still fighting the war fifteen years later chavasse was immediately sorry im sorry if i sounded offhand i didnt mean to be von kraul finished his brandy and stared into the empty glass were you aware of the fact that at no time did the nazis ever achieve a vote of more than thirtyseven percent herr chavasse chavasse was surprised no i cant say i was then tell me something else and be perfectly honest von kraul said you are a frenchman by birth and english by adoption so you are an authority on two great nations how many men have you met of both countries who you consider would have made conscientious members of the ss or some similar organization a hell of a lot chavasse said thank you von kraul smiled slightly perhaps you will not be too harsh on us in the future he got to his feet are you ready my friend chavasse shook his head no i think ill stay and have another dont worry about me ill make my own way back von kraul held out his hand a real pleasure herr chavasse perhaps our paths will cross again i hope so for a moment he appeared to hesitate and then he said forgive me for stating the obvious but time is a great healer he turned without waiting for a reply and went outside chavasse ordered another brandy and sat there for a little while longer thinking about von krauls last remark but it didnt help it didnt help at all suddenly the noise and the bustle and the cheerful laughter of the beer house was too much for him and he got to his feet and left pushing his way roughly through a party of people who were at that moment coming in through the door as he walked along the pavement collar turned up against the rain a car drew up beside him and sir george harvey said hello there chavasse i thought it was you can i give you a lift chavasse hesitated and then climbed in beside him without a word as they moved away sir george said excitedly terrible business at nagels reception absolutely astounding somebody shot him and then committed suicide chavasse lit a cigarette and said carefully were you there when they discovered the bodies sir george shook his head no we were all requested to leave the excuse given was that nagel had met with an accident naturally i was curious and had a word with one of the servants on the way out he gave me the details have they identified the man who killed him yet chavasse said not as far as i know sir george told him the police had just arrived as i left chavasse didnt say anything more and sir george looked sideways at him curiously you dont know anything about it do you chavasse nodded slowly i should imagine theyll just be discovering that the dead man is inspector steiner of the hamburg police the car slewed violently and sir george fought for control and finally brought it to a standstill he took a handkerchief and mopped his brow sorry about that he said but to be perfectly frank you rather took the wind out of my sails chavasse didnt reply and after a moment of silence sir george went on i suppose it all ties in with the bormann affair chavasse wound down the window and flicked his cigarette out into the rain there is no bormann affair any longer its finished all wrapped up sir george frowned but what about the manuscript a heap of ashes chavasse said im afraid steiner was just one step in front of me out of the silence that followed sir george said awkwardly and miss hartmann for a moment the words refused to come but chavasse swallowed hard and forced them out im afraid he got to her as well sir george turned slowly and looked at him horror in his eyes you mean shes dead chavasse didnt bother replying and they sat there for some time in silence after a while sir george said is there anywhere i can take you chavasse nodded slowly yes i think id like to go back to her apartment if you dont mind sir george nodded seemingly too full of emotion to speak and switched on the engine a moment later they were continuing through the heavy rain toward the center of hamburg when they reached the house chavasse got out quickly and sir george kept the engine running he leaned out of the side window and said is there anything more i can do for you chavasse shook his head no ill be fine thanks im leaving on the afternoon train tomorrow sir george went on will i see you again before i go chavasse nodded slowly ill probably be returning by that train myself ive nothing to hang on here for any longer sir george smiled tightly i wont say goodbye then if i dont see you on the train we must certainly have a drink together on the boat going over he let in the clutch and the mercedes moved away quickly leaving chavasse alone on the edge of the pavement he went upstairs slowly taking his time reluctant to go into the empty apartment he hesitated outside for a moment and then took out the master key the caretakers wife had given him and unlocked the door as he turned the handle he became aware of a slight flurry of movement inside for a moment he hesitated and then flung the door open and went into the room halfcrouching his hands ready mark hardt was standing in the center of the room he was wearing a heavy driving coat but his trousers were wet and clung to his legs his face looked white and tense and when he saw chavasse he relaxed with a deep sigh you had me worried for a moment chavasse unbuttoned his hunting jacket slowly how did you manage to get away from them hardt shrugged it was easy enough once id led them away from you i stopped making such a damned noise the dogs couldnt pick up my scent in the heavy rain i crossed the main road and hid in the loft of a barn for two or three hours then i thumbed a lift from a passing truck driver i told him id been camping and got washed out by the heavy rain i dont think he believed me but he gave me this coat and dropped me off in hamburg hows the arm chavasse said bloody awful hardt replied with a tired grin but ill survive wheres anna chavasse said slowly i think youd better sit down mark im afraid ive got some bad news for you hardt frowned what are you trying to say shes dead chavasse said quietly steiner and his friends got hold of her hardt swayed slightly and then reached blindly for a chair and sat down after a while he said in a dead voice how did it happen chavasse told him when he had finished he hesitated and went on if its any comfort both steiner and nagel are dead i was waiting in the garden of nagel s house in blankenese with a german intelligence man when steiner arrived to assassinate hauptmann hardt got to his feet slowly its no consolation at all he said steiner nagel and martin bormann might have crawled out from under a stone but anna he smiled sadly suddenly it all seems so silly i wonder what weve come to he walked across to the table by the window and gently touched one of the hebrew books she always did her homework as she called it it doesnt seem possible does it chavasse and then his shoulders started to shake and the fine face crumpled he slumped down into the chair and bowed his head upon his arms and wept for a little while chavasse stood there watching him with pity in his heart and then he turned and went out closing the door gently behind him chapter it was bitterly cold at the hook of holland as the ship nosed her way out of the harbor and fog was rolling in steadily from the north sea pushed by a slight wind chavasse leaned over the rail and smoked a cigarette and watched the lights disappear into the darkness somewhere in the distance a bugle sounded faintly on the wind from one of the dutch army camps touching something deep inside him and filling him with a curious sadness for a brief moment he remembered annas words in the hunting lodge at berndorf lights out youre through its all over and as holland disappeared into the night behind them he flicked his cigarette down into the fog and went below he had a cabin to himself and stripped to the waist and washed and shaved afterward he dressed slowly putting on a fresh shirt and went up to the bar he hadnt slept in over twentyfour hours but after the first double whiskey he felt a little better he lit a cigarette and looked about him sir george harvey was sitting in a corner with two other men and he waved across the room chavasse nodded slightly and turned back to his drink he rested an elbow on the bar and stared blindly into space his mind going back over everything that had taken place during the last few days preparing for the report he would have to give the chief but it was very difficult no matter how hard he tried to concentrate it was unimportant things that persisted in pushing the other things the things the chief would want to know into the background it was a touch of brain fatigue that was all and he sighed and gave up the struggle he closed his eyes and her face seemed to float in the darkness before him there was a sweet grave smile on her lips and he was suddenly reminded that this was how she had looked in the hunting lodge at berndorf when they had waited for sir georges car he remembered what she had said one day youll look back on it all and it will simply be something that happened a long time ago and then shed quoted from one of marlowes plays but that was long ago and in another country for a moment he sat there eyes closed a slight frown on his face and then he remembered the quotation in full and shivered violently coldness seeping through him but that was long ago and in another country and besides the wench is dead had she perhaps had for a brief moment only a sudden foreknowledge of what was to happen but his brain refused to function efficiently and he reached for his glass and emptied it as he started to rise sir george harvey sat on the stool beside him got time for a nightcap he said chavasse nodded and sat down again just one if you dont mind im desperately tired havent slept since the day before yesterday sir george nodded sympathetically im sorry we couldnt meet on the train unfortunately several of the delegates decided at the last minute to spend a day or two in london before breaking up naturally i was compelled to travel with them thats all right chavasse said as the barman placed two large whiskies before them sir george offered him a cigarette and shook his head i felt particularly bad about it under the circumstances i wanted time to discuss things with you there isnt anything to discuss chavasse told him but there is sir george said i get the definite impression that youre feeling pretty grim about everything your original mission a failure miss hartmanns unfortunate death but there is another side to things you know after all you did manage to save hauptmann who knows what effect that may have on the future of germany chavasse nodded slowly yes i suppose one could look at it that way there was a dull throbbing pain behind his eyes and he felt curiously lightheaded he got to his feet and said i hope youll excuse me now im desperately tired sir george hastily finished his drink his face full of concern stupid of me to keep you here at all chavasse you look terrible they walked out of the lounge and paused at the top of the companionway ill leave you here sir george said i feel like a turn around the deck i can never sleep during this particular crossing he held out his hand if i dont see you again good luck if you should ever feel like returning to a more normal life come and see me ive a great deal of influence in business circles chavasse went along the corridor to his cabin thinking about sir georges offer he wondered what the chief would say if he walked into his office and handed over his resignation along with the report on the bormann affair it was tempting very tempting he opened the door of the cabin and went inside yawning as the tiredness seemed to melt into his very bones turning them to jelly he stood in front of the mirror and started to take off his tie and images and thoughts circled endlessly in his brain disjointed and meaningless and then something erupted out of his subconscious to scream one name at him through the silence he gripped the edge of the washbasin with both hands and stared into the mirror the shock of it like a bucket of ice water thrown in the face and then he no longer felt tired and he pulled on his raincoat quickly and left the cabin the ship was moving through a silent world of thick fog when he came out onto the top deck and a light rain was falling he lit a cigarette and moved forward his eyes probing every corner he found sir george leaning over the stern rail a cigar burning between his teeth one hand thrust deep into the pocket of a heavy overcoat a seaman in knitted cap and reefer jacket was coiling a rope nearby and he moved away into the fog as chavasse approached sir george turned from the rail oh its you chavasse changed your mind about going to bed eh chavasse nodded there are one or two loose ends to the bormann affair i thought you might be able to help me tie them up certainly my boy sir george said only too pleased to be of assistance i hoped youd feel that way chavasse smiled you can start by telling me how you came to be involved with nagel steiner and the rest of that pleasant bunch sir georges face looked suddenly old and careworn in the sickly light of the deck lamp i dont know what youre talking about then ill make it plainer for you chavasse told him youve been sticking a knife into my back from the very beginning of this affair id like to know why sir george moved forward suddenly and tried to brush past him chavasse pushed him violently and struck him a heavy blow in the face sir george staggered backward and slipped to one knee for a moment he stayed there blood on his mouth as he rose to his feet his right hand came out of his overcoat pocket holding an old webley with a specially shortened barrel that wont do you any good chavasse said sir george carefully wiped the blood from his mouth with a handkerchief when he spoke his voice was cold and impersonal how did you find out it was something you said in the bar earlier chavasse replied you told me not to feel too badly about things because at least id saved hauptmanns life for a moment sir george frowned and then a light suddenly dawned of course i wasnt supposed to know about the plan to assassinate hauptmann was i it was careless of you chavasse said sir george sighed we all make mistakes there were other things chavasse said they didnt make sense before but they do now the fact that the opposition knew muller was to meet me on the train at osnabruck that was something i was never really happy about and then there was something nagel said at berndorf when he first met anna his exact words were so this is the jewish girl whats so remarkable about that sir george asked chavasse shrugged at the best of times the word race is only an abstraction the only way nagel knew she was jewish was because hed been told and only one person other than myself knew that an israeli underground organization was also after bormann and the manuscript that was you because id told you i seem to have been even more careless than i imagined sir george sighed again its a great pity chavasse because id really taken a liking to you and now im going to have to kill you chavasse took out a cigarette and lit it calmly not without an explanation he said surely im entitled to that a quick one sir georges eyes glinted in the dark there was a period in my life when i was very dissatisfied with the way my country was being governed at that time i greatly admired what was going on in germany in fact i was censured by the press for my toowarm support of herr hitler and just how warm was that support chavasse asked i agreed to become head of the provisional government when the germans successfully invaded england sir george told him calmly and then the whole thing began to make sense bormann mentioned you in his manuscript didnt he chavasse said i should imagine he devoted at least a chapter to me he was the only member of the nazi hierarchy with whom i was in close contact during the years before the war the whole arrangement was made through him and was so secret that only bormann hitler and a gobetween from the political branch were in on it and who was the gobetween sir george allowed himself a slight smile kurt nagel now it is beginning to make sense chavasse said presumably hes been blackmailing you ever since sir george shook his head i wouldnt say that weve always understood each other very well let me put it this way i saw that he got his start in industry during the bad days after the war when things were very difficult in fact it proved quite profitable for me in the end weve always been on the best of terms did you know about his activities with the nazi underground not until recently when the directors of the publishing firm approached me regarding mullers offer i was trapped i couldnt stop their story from getting to the proper authorities so i decided that the best thing to do was to take it to them myself that was clever of you chavasse said and also dangerous sir george shook his head ive been lucky chavasse incredibly lucky from the beginning i got in touch with nagel and told him what was happening it turned out that he already had a line on muller from the german end and he arranged the business on the train it seemed clever at the time a good way of grabbing muller and getting rid of you but you hadnt reckoned on mark hardt sir george sighed heavily one cant think of everything i was as careful as i could possibly be i always acted through nagel so that none of the others knew that i was involved and then last night when you told me the girl had the manuscript i had to act fast and that unfortunately meant meeting steiner and taking him to her apartment chavasse said slowly then it was you and steiner who took her from the apartment sir george nodded im afraid so of course you do realize the predicament i was in i had to see that manuscript destroyed im sorry about the girl she just happened to be in the way it was steiner who shot her not me but youd have killed her anyway chavasse said because she knew your secret sir george nodded gravely yes im very much afraid i would the only reason i didnt kill steiner was because he told me about the hauptmann business that made me see some of the remarks you made earlier in the evening and the visit of that german intelligence chap in a new light i decided steiner was very probably a dead man walking anyway and you got two for the price of one chavasse said nagel as well now theres only one living person who knows you intended to be one of the dirtiest traitors in english history sir george nodded and moved round in a half circle the revolver never wavering for an instant stand with your back against the rail please he said sharply chavasse took his time about moving into the required position every muscle tensed and ready for action if he was going to die anyway he intended to make a move of some sort thats fine sir george said yes youre quite right youre the only person who can ruin me believe me im sorry about this i rather liked you he moved back a pace raising his arm and aimed so quickly that he caught chavasse off guard as his finger tightened on the trigger the seaman whom chavasse had noticed a little earlier moved out of the fog silently his arm swung and the edge of his right hand thudded across the back of sir georges neck the revolver dropped from the nerveless fingers and as he started to crumple to the deck the seaman caught the inanimate body across his shoulders he walked two quick paces to the rail and heaved sir george harvey down into the fog the whole thing had happened with such incredible speed that chavasse had been unable to do anything as the seaman kicked the revolver over the side chavasse grabbed him by the shoulder and swung him round and found himself looking into the pale impassive face of mark hardt for a moment there was silence and then hardt said calmly i think youd better go down to your cabin paul it wouldnt do to be seen on deck now you might be questioned later on how did you know chavasse said hardt shrugged after youd gone last night i was clearing up some of annas things apparently shed been reading bormanns manuscript and made notes in hebrew as she was going along it seems there was a chapter on harvey chavasse turned and looked over the rail down into the swirling fog he shivered its a hell of a way to go but i cant say im sorry for him he was directly responsible for annas death hardt nodded this way is better all round famous british politician has tragic accident and the country avoids a scandal of world dimensions chavasse looked at him closely for a moment and then shook his head youre a strange one mark i dont think ive ever really understood you hardt smiled and placed a hand on his shoulder you loved her didnt you paul chavasse nodded slowly and sighed not that it did her a great deal of good i loved her too hardt said well always have that bond between us they walked along the deck and paused at the entrance to the lounge hardt held out his hand and said gravely i dont think well be meeting again paul chavasse took the hand and held it for a moment he tried to think of something to say but hardt turned and melted into the fog before anything suitable came to mind the ship seemed to poise high on a wave and chavasse held his breath and for some reason thought of anna and then the vessel dipped smoothly down into the next hollow again and he pulled open the door and went inside chapter jean frazer was typing busily when chavasse went into her office he sat on the edge of the desk and helped himself to a cigarette and waited for her to finish what she was doing after a while she removed her spectacles leaned back in the chair and gazed up at him critically you dont look too good she said was it rough rough enough he told her has he read my report she nodded first thing this morning why didnt you bring it in personally he shrugged i needed some sleep i dont seem to have had much time for it during the last few days what you need is a holiday she said thats exactly what i intend to have he told her is he in she nodded hes waiting for you she replaced her spectacles and returned to her typing and chavasse moved across to the other door and opened it as he closed it behind him the chief looked up quickly and a smile appeared on his face ive been waiting for you to call paul from your report you seem to have had a hectic time of it chavasse slumped into a chair it was certainly one hell of an assignment didnt you ever have even the slightest suspicion about harvey the chief shook his head plenty of prominent people were favorably disposed toward the nazis in the years before the war dont forget that for a long time hitler seemed to be doing a good job there were several politicians who thought like harvey at the time he certainly managed to sabotage the operation chavasse said and he was directly responsible for the destruction of bormanns manuscript he was nobodys fool the chief said on the whole im glad you handled him the way you did saves a lot of unpleasantness all round you can thank hardt for that not me chavasse told him if he hadnt stepped in when he did id have been the one to take a dive over the side for an amateur he sounds a pretty useful type to have around the chief said you dont suppose hed like a job do you chavasse shook his head youre wasting your time hes a dedicated man the chief smiled wryly just a thought he picked up the report and quickly skimmed through it after a moment he went on so we can definitely say that nagel and steiner wont trouble anybody again and you can count the guard at the castle the man called hans chavasse said i think i broke his neck what about kruger the chief asked he sounds as if he could still be a thorn in somebodys flesh chavasse pulled a newspaper out of his pocket and pushed it across the desk thats the afternoon edition i got it on the way over if you look at the bottom of page two youll see a small item about the untimely death of dr otto kruger wellknown hamburg physician he was taking off in his own plane from a private airfield just outside hamburg destination unknown apparently there was an accident he nosedived from three hundred feet where do you think he was going the chief said the united arab republic chavasse shrugged probably it seems a popular choice wherever it was he didnt make it the chief grinned thats one thing about von kraul he doesnt let the grass grow under his feet i must admit i like the way he works chavasse said and he doesnt look like what he is which is certainly an asset in this game yes hes quite a man the chief sighed its a point worth remembering that all germans werent members of the nazi party any more than all hamburg police inspectors in any way resemble steiner chavasse nodded slightly without replying he had never felt so tired in his life and he closed his eyes for a moment and tried to relax he was like a hairspring that had been wound up too tightly and was taking its time in running down he fought against the feeling of fatigue and as he opened his eyes the chief looked up from the report and closed it taking it all in all i think things might have been a lot worse im glad you see it that way chavasse said after all we didnt get the manuscript and bormann was dead anyway but you did save heinrich hauptmanns life the chief pointed out and you cleaned out a pretty nasty nest of rats i wouldnt be too depressed about things he selected a cigarette from the silver box on his desk and went on it was a damned shame about the girl this anna hartmann i mean she must have had all the guts in the world chavasse shook his head slowly there was more to it than that much more she suffered from a virtue few people are cursed with complete integrity on top of that she was in love with me now that he had said it he found that his hands were shaking slightly he got to his feet crossed to the window and looked out into the garden a light wind tapped against the glass and a single leaf spiraled down into the damp grass leaving the plane tree in front of the window bare behind him the chief said softly so it was like that was it chavasse turned slowly when i entered this office i intended to hand you my resignation and now the chief said chavasse smiled and that slight rather boyish smile illuminated his entire face now i think id like that holiday you promised me when the chief spoke he sounded relieved thats more like it for a moment there you had me worried he chuckled youre overtired thats what it is i know it hasnt been much fun handling two tough assignments one after the other but now you can get away from everything for six weeks or so and relax soak up a little sun they say bermuda is nice at this time of year chavasse raised his eyebrows no expense spared to keep the help happy eh the chief smiled see jean on your way out tell her where you want to go and shell arrange the tickets for you he sighed and picked up a file and now if youll excuse me ive got to rush through an official report on this affair the foreign secretary is having dinner with the prime minister tonight and the old boy wants to know all about it he opened the file and picked up his pen and chavasse went back into the other office jean frazer was standing at the filing cabinet and she turned with a slight smile of inquiry on her face got what you wanted he nodded i think you could say that she picked up a memo pad wheres it to be bermuda he shook his head briefly you can telephone el al book me a seat on their first flight out to tel aviv in the morning as he crossed to the outer door and opened it jean frazer said blankly but why israel he turned and smiled at her theres a hill id like to climb just outside a place called migdal on the sea of galilee a promise i made to a friend a long time ago and he closed the door gently a long time ago as he went down the hall he smiled and shook his head because already she seemed close to him again
