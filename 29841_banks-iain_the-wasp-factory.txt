the wasp factory iain banks the sacrifice poles i had been making the rounds of the sacrifice poles the day we heard my brother had escaped i already knew something was going to happen the factory told me at the north end of the island near the tumbled remains of the slip where the handle of the rusty winch still creaks in an easterly wind i had two poles on the far face of the last dune one of the poles held a rat head with two dragonflies the other a seagull and two mice i was just sticking one of the mouse heads back on when the birds went up into the evening air kawcalling and screaming wheeling over the path through the dunes where it went near their nests i made sure the head was secure then clambered to the top of the dune to watch with my binoculars diggs the policeman from the town was coming down the path on his bike pedalling hard his head down as the wheels sank part way into the sandy surface he got off the bike at the bridge and left it propped against the suspension cables then walked to the middle of the swaying bridge where the gate is i could see him press the button on the phone he stood for a while looking round about at the quiet dunes and the settling birds he didnt see me because i was too well hidden then my father must have answered the buzzer in the house because diggs stooped slightly and talked into the grille beside the button and then pushed the gate open and walked over the bridge on to the island and down the path towards the house when he disappeared behind the dunes i sat for a while scratching my crotch as the wind played with my hair and the birds returned to their nests i took my catapult from my belt selected a halfinch steelie sighted carefully then sent the big ballbearing arcing out over the river the telephone poles and the little suspension bridge to the mainland the shot hit the keep out private property sign with a thud i could just hear and i smiled it was a good omen the factory hadnt been specific it rarely is but i had the feeling that whatever it was warning me about was important and i also suspected it would be bad but i had been wise enough to take the hint and check my poles and now i knew my aim was still good things were still with me i decided not to go straight back to the house father didnt like me to be there when diggs came and anyway i still had a couple of poles to check before the sun went down i jumped and slid down the slope of the dune into its shadow then turned at the bottom to look back up at those small heads and bodies as they watched over the northern approaches to the island they looked fine those husks on their gnarled branches black ribbons tied to the wooden limbs blew softly in the breeze waving at me i decided nothing would be too bad and that tomorrow i would ask the factory for more information if i was lucky my father might tell me something and if i was luckier still it might even be the truth i left the sack of heads and bodies in the bunker just as the light was going completely and the stars were starting to come out the birds had told me diggs had left a few minutes earlier so i ran back the quick way to the house where the lights all burned as usual my father met me in the kitchen diggs was just here i suppose you know he put the stub of the fat cigar he had been smoking under the cold tap turned the water on for a second while the brown stump sizzled and died then threw the sodden remnant in the bin i put my things down on the big table and sat down shrugging my father turned up the ring on the cooker under the souppan looking beneath the lid into the warming mixture and then turning back to look at me there was a layer of greyblue smoke in the room at about shoulder level and a big wave in it probably produced by me as i came in through the double doors of the back porch the wave rose slowly between us while my father stared at me i fidgeted then looked down toying with the wristrest of the black catapult it crossed my mind that my father looked worried but he was good at acting and perhaps that was just what he wanted me to think so deep down i remained unconvinced i suppose id better tell you he said then turned away again taking up a wooden spoon and stirring the soup i waited its eric then i knew what had happened he didnt have to tell me the rest i suppose i could have thought from the little hed said up until then that my halfbrother was dead or ill or that something had happened to him but i knew then it was something eric had done and there was only one thing he could have done which would make my father look worried he had escaped i didnt say anything though eric has escaped from the hospital that was what diggs came to tell us they think he might head back here take those things off the table ive told you before he sipped the soup his back still turned i waited until he started to turn round then took the catapult binoculars and spade off the table in the same flat tone my father went on well i dont suppose hell get this far theyll probably pick him up in a day or two i just thought id tell you in case anybody else hears and says anything get out a plate i went to the cupboard and took out a plate then sat down again one leg crossed underneath me my father went back to stirring the soup which i could smell now above the cigar smoke i could feel excitement in my stomach a rising tingling rush so eric was coming back home again that was goodbad i knew hed make it i didnt even think of asking the factory about it hed be here i wondered how long it would take him and whether diggs would now have to go shouting through the town warning that the mad boy who set fire to dogs was on the loose again lock up your hounds my father ladled some soup into my plate i blew on it i thought of the sacrifice poles they were my earlywarning system and deterrent rolled into one infected potent things which looked out from the island warding off those totems were my warning shot anybody who set foot on the island after seeing them should know what to expect but it looked like instead of being a clenched and threatening fist they would present a welcoming open hand for eric i see you washed your hands again my father said as i sipped the hot soup he was being sarcastic he took the bottle of whisky from the dresser and poured himself a drink the other glass which i guessed had been the constables he put in the sink he sat down at the far end of the table my father is tall and slim though slightly stooped he has a delicate face like a womans and his eyes are dark he limps now and has done ever since i can remember his left leg is almost totally stiff and he usually takes a stick with him when he leaves the house some days when its damp he has to use the stick inside too and i can hear him clacking about the uncarpeted rooms and corridors of the house a hollow noise going from place to place only here in the kitchen is the stick quieted the flagstones silence it that stick is the symbol of the factorys security my fathers leg locked solid has given me my sanctuary up in the warm space of the big loft right at the top of the house where the junk and the rubbish are where the dust moves and the sunlight slants and the factory sits silent living and still my father cant climb up the narrow ladder from the top floor and even if he could i know he wouldnt be able to negotiate the twist you have to make to get from the top of the ladder round the brickwork of the chimney flues and into the loft proper so the place is mine i suppose my father is about fortyfive now though sometimes i think he looks a lot older and occasionally i think he might be a little younger he wont tell me his real age so fortyfive is my estimate judging by his looks what height is this table he said suddenly just as i was about to go to the breadbin for a slice to wipe my plate with i turned round and looked at him wondering why he was bothering with such an easy question thirty inches i told him and took a crust from the bin wrong he said with an eager grin two foot six i shook my head at him scowling and wiped the brown rim of soup from the inside of my plate there was a time when i was genuinely afraid of these idiotic questions but now apart from the fact that i must know the height length breadth area and volume of just about every part of the house and everything in it i can see my fathers obsession for what it is it gets embarrassing at times when there are guests in the house even if they are family and ought to know what to expect theyll be sitting there probably in the lounge wondering whether fathers going to feed them anything or just give an impromptu lecture on cancer of the colon or tapeworms when hell sidle up to somebody look round to make sure everybodys watching then in a conspiratorial stagewhisper say see that door over there its eightyfive inches corner to corner then hell wink and walk off or slide over on his seat looking nonchalant ever since i can remember there have been little stickers of white paper all over the house with neat blackbiro writing on them attached to the legs of chairs the edges of rugs the bottoms of jugs the aerials of radios the doors of drawers the headboards of beds the screens of televisions the handles of pots and pans they give the appropriate measurement for the part of the object theyre stuck to there are even ones in pencil stuck to the leaves of plants when i was a child i once went round the house tearing all the stickers off i was belted and sent to my room for two days later my father decided it would be useful and characterforming for me to know all the measurements as well as he did so i had to sit for hours with the measurement book a huge looseleaf thing with all the information on the little stickers carefully recorded according to room and category of object or go round the house with a jotter making my own notes this was all in addition to the usual lessons my father gave me on mathematics and history and so on it didnt leave much time for going out to play and i resented it a great deal i was having a war at the time the mussels against the dead flies i think it was and while i was in the library poring over the book and trying to keep my eyes open soaking up all those damn silly imperial measurements the wind would be blowing my fly armies over half the island and the sea would first sink the mussel shells in their high pools and then cover them with sand luckily my father grew tired of this grand scheme and contented himself with firing the odd surprise question at me concerning the capacity of the umbrellastand in pints or the total area in fractions of an acre of all the curtains in the house actually hung up at the time im not answering these questions any more i said to him as i took my plate to the sink we should have gone metric years ago my father snorted into his glass as he drained it hectares and that sort of rubbish certainly not its all based on the measurement of the globe you know i dont have to tell you what nonsense that is i sighed as i took an apple from the bowl on the window sill my father once had me believing that the earth was a mobius strip not a sphere he still maintains that he believes this and makes a great show of sending off a manuscript to publishers down in london trying to get them to publish a book expounding this view but i know hes just mischiefmaking again and gets most of his pleasure from his acts of stunned disbelief and then righteous indignation when the manuscript is eventually returned this occurs about every three months and i doubt that life would be half as much fun for him without this sort of ritual anyway that is one of his reasons for not switching over to a metric standard for his stupid measurements though in fact hes just lazy what were you up to today he stared across the table at me rolling the empty tumbler around on the wooden tabletop i shrugged out walking and things building dams again he sneered no i said shaking my head confidently and biting the apple not today i hope you werent out killing any of gods creatures i shrugged at him again of course i was out killing things how the hell am i supposed to get heads and bodies for the poles and the bunker if i dont kill things there just arent enough natural deaths you cant explain that sort of thing to people though sometimes i think youre the one who should be in hospital not eric he was looking at me from under his dark brows his voice low once that sort of talk would have scared me but not now im nearly seventeen and not a child here in scotland im old enough to get married without my parents permission and have been for a year there wouldnt be much point to me getting married perhaps ill admit that but the principle is there besides im not eric im me and im here and thats all there is to it i dont bother people and they had best not bother me if they know whats good for them i dont go giving people presents of burning dogs or frighten the local toddlers with handfuls of maggots and mouthfuls of worms the people in the town may say oh hes not all there you know but thats just their little joke and sometimes just to rub it in they dont point to their heads as they say it i dont mind ive learned to live with my disability and learned to live without other people so its no skin off my nose my father seemed to be trying to hurt me though he wouldnt say something like that normally the news about eric must have shaken him i think he knew just as i did that eric would get back and he was worried about what would happen i didnt blame him and i didnt doubt that he was also worried about me i represent a crime and if eric was to come back stirring things up the truth about frank might come out i was never registered i have no birth certificate no national insurance number nothing to say im alive or have ever existed i know this is a crime and so does my father and i think that sometimes he regrets the decision he made seventeen years ago in his hippyanarchist days or whatever they were not that ive suffered really i enjoyed it and you could hardly say that i wasnt educated i probably know more about the conventional school subjects than most people of my age i could complain about the truth of some of the bits of information my father passed on to me mind you ever since i was able to go into porteneil alone and check things up in the library my father has had to be pretty straight with me but when i was younger he used to fool me time after time answering my honest if naive questions with utter rubbish for years i believed pathos was one of the three musketeers fellatio was a character in hamlet vitreous a town in china and that the irish peasants had to tread the peat to make guinness well these days i can reach the highest shelves of the house library and walk into porteneil to visit the one there so i can check up on anything my father says and he has to tell me the truth it annoys him a lot i think but thats the way things go call it progress but i am educated while he wasnt able to resist indulging his rather immature sense of humour by selling me a few dummies my father couldnt abide a son of his not being a credit to him in some way my body was a forlorn hope for any improvement so only my mind was left hence all my lessons my father is an educated man and he passed a lot of what he already knew on to me as well as doing a fair bit of study himself into areas he didnt know all that much about just so that he could teach me my father is a doctor of chemistry or perhaps biochemistry im not sure he seems to have known enough about ordinary medicine and perhaps still have had the contacts within the profession to make sure that i got my inoculations and injections at the correct times in my life despite my official nonexistence as far as the national health service is concerned i think my father used to work in a university for a few years after he graduated and he might have invented something he occasionally hints that he gets some sort of royalty from a patent or something but i suspect the old hippy survives on whatever family wealth the cauldhames still have secreted away the family has been in this part of scotland for about two hundred years or more from what i can gather and we used to own a lot of the land around here now all we have is the island and thats pretty small and hardly even an island at low tide the only other remnant of our glorious past is the name of porteneils hotspot a grubby old pub called the cauldhame arms where i go sometimes now though still under age of course and watch some of the local youths trying to be punk bands that was where i met and still meet the only person id call a friend jamie the dwarf whom i let sit on my shoulders so he can see the bands well i dont think hell get this far theyll pick him up my father said again after a long and brooding silence he got up to rinse his glass i hummed to myself something i always used to do when i wanted to smile or laugh but thought the better of it my father looked at me im going to the study dont forget to lock up all right okeydoke i said nodding goodnight my father left the kitchen i sat and looked at my trowel stoutstroke little grains of dry sand stuck to it so i brushed them off the study one of my few remaining unsatisfied ambitions is to get into the old mans study the cellar i have at least seen and been in occasionally i know all the rooms on the ground floor and the second the loft is my domain entirely and home of the wasp factory no less but that one room on the first floor i dont know i have never even seen inside i do know he has some chemicals in there and i suppose he does experiments or something but what the room looks like what he actually does in there i have no idea all ive ever got out of it are a few funny smells and the taptap of my fathers stick i stroked the long handle of the trowel wondering if my father had a name for that stick of his i doubted it he doesnt attach the same importance to them as i do i know they are important i think there is a secret in the study he had hinted as much more than once just vaguely just enough to entice me so that i want to ask what so that he knows that i want to ask i dont ask of course because i wouldnt get any worthwhile answer if he did tell me anything it would be a pack of lies because obviously the secret wouldnt be a secret any more if he told me the truth and he can feel as i do that with my increasing maturity he needs all the holds over me he can get im not a child any more only these little bits of bogus power enable him to think he is in control of what he sees as the correct fatherson relationship its pathetic really but with his little games and his secrets and his hurtful remarks he tries to keep his security intact i leaned back in the wooden chair and stretched i like the smell of the kitchen the food and the mud on our wellingtons and sometimes the faint tang of cordite coming up from the cellar all give me a good tight thrilling feel when i think about them it smells different when its been raining and our clothes are wet in the winter the big black stove pumps out heat fragrant with driftwood or peat and everything steams and the rain hammers against the glass then it has a comfortable closedin feeling making you feel cosy like a great big cat with its tail curled round itself sometimes i wish we had a cat all ive ever had was a head and that the seagulls took i went to the toilet down the corridor off the kitchen for a crap i didnt need a pee because id been pissing on the poles during the day infecting them with my scent and power i sat there and thought about eric to whom such an unpleasant thing happened poor twisted bugger i wondered as i have often wondered how i would have coped but it didnt happen to me i have stayed here and eric was the one who went away and it all happened somewhere else and thats all there is to it im me and heres here i listened wondering if i could hear my father perhaps he had gone straight to bed he often sleeps in the study rather than in the big bedroom on the second floor where mine is maybe that room holds too many unpleasant or pleasant memories for him either way i couldnt hear any snoring i hate having to sit down in the toilet all the time with my unfortunate disability i usually have to as though i was a bloody woman but i hate it sometimes in the cauldhame arms i stand up at the urinal but most of it ends up running down my hands or legs i strained plop splash some water came up and hit my bum and that was when the phone went shit i said and then laughed at myself i cleaned my arse quickly and pulled my trousers up pulling the chain too and then waddling out into the corridor zipping up i ran up the broad stairs to the firstfloor landing where our only phone is im forever on at my father to get more phones put in but he says we dont get called often enough to warrant extensions i got to the phone before whoever was calling rang off my father hadnt appeared hello i said it was a callbox skrawaak screamed a voice at the other end i held the receiver away from my ear and looked at it scowling tinny yells continued to come from the earpiece when they stopped i put my ear back to it porteneil l i said coldly frank frank its me me hello there hello is there an echo on this line or are you saying everything twice i said i could recognise erics voice both ha ha ha ha ha hello eric where are you here where are you here if were both here why are we bothering with the phone tell me where you are before your money runs out but if youre here you must know dont you know where you are he started to giggle i said calmly stop being silly eric im not being silly im not telling you where i am youll only tell angus and hell tell the police and theyll take me back to the fucking hospital dont use fourletter words you know i dont like them of course i wont tell dad fucking is not a fourletter word its its a sevenletter word isnt that your lucky number no look will you tell me where you are i want to know ill tell you where i am if youll tell me what your lucky number is my lucky number is e thats not a number thats a letter it is a number its a transcendental number thats cheating i meant an integer you should have been more specific i said then sighed as the pips sounded and eric eventually put more money in do you want me to call you back hoho you arent getting it out of me that easy how are you anyway im fine how are you mad of course he said quite indignantly i had to smile look im assuming youre coming back here if you are please dont burn any dogs or anything ok what are you talking about its me eric i dont burn dogs he started to shout i dont burn fucking dogs what the hell do you think i am dont accuse me of burning fucking dogs you little bastard bastard all right eric im sorry im sorry i said as quickly as i could i just want you to be ok be careful dont do anything to antagonise people you know people can be awful sensitive well i could hear him say i listened to him breathing then his voice changed yeah im coming back home just for a short while to see how you both are i suppose its just you and the old man yes just the two of us im looking forward to seeing you oh good there was a pause why dont you ever come to visit me i i thought father was down to see you at christmas was he well but why dont you ever come he sounded plaintive i shifted my weight on to my other foot looked around the landing and up the stairs halfexpecting to see my father leaning over the banister rail or to see his shadow on the wall of the landing above where he thought he could hide and listen to my phone calls without me knowing i dont like leaving the island for that long eric im sorry but i get this horrible feeling in my stomach as though theres a great big knot in it i just cant go that far away not overnight or i just cant i want to see you but youre so far away im getting closer he sounded confident again good how far away are you not telling you i told you my lucky number i lied im still not going to tell you where i am thats not well ill hang up now you dont want to talk to dad not yet ill talk to him later when im a lot closer im going now see you take care you take care whats to worry about ill be all right what can happen to me just dont do anything to annoy people you know i mean they get angry about pets especially i mean im not what what what was that about pets he shouted nothing i was just saying you little shit he screamed youre accusing me of burning dogs again arent you and i suppose i stick worms and maggots into kids mouths and piss on them too eh he shrieked well i said carefully toying with the flex now you mention it bastard bastard you little shit ill kill you you his voice disappeared and i had to put the phone away from my ear again as he started to hammer the handset against the walls of the callbox the succession of loud clunks sounded over the calm pips as his money ran out i put the phone back in the cradle i looked up but there was still no sign of father i crept up the stairs and stuck my head between the banisters but the landing was empty i sighed and sat down on the stairs i got the feeling i hadnt handled eric very well over the phone im not very good with people and even though eric is my brother i havent seen him for over two years since he went crazy i got up and went back down to the kitchen to lock up and get my gear then i went to the bathroom i decided to watch the television in my room or listen to the radio and get to sleep early so i could be up just after dawn to catch a wasp for the factory i lay on my bed listening to john peel on the radio and the noise of the wind round the house and the surf on the beach beneath my bed my homebrew gave off a yeasty smell i thought again of the sacrifice poles more deliberately this time picturing each one in turn remembering their positions and their components seeing in my mind what those sightless eyes looked out to and flicking through each view like a security guard changing cameras on a monitor screen i felt nothing amiss all seemed well my dead sentries those extensions of me which came under my power through the simple but ultimate surrender of death sensed nothing to harm me or the island i opened my eyes and put the bedside light back on i looked at myself in the mirror on the dressingtable over on the other side of the room i was lying on top of the bedcovers naked apart from my underpants im too fat it isnt that bad and it isnt my fault but all the same i dont look the way id like to look chubby thats me strong and fit but still too plump i want to look dark and menacing the way i ought to look the way i should look the way i might have looked if i hadnt had my little accident looking at me youd never guess id killed three people it isnt fair i switched the light out again the room was totally dark not even the starlight showing while my eyes adjusted perhaps i would ask for one of those led alarm radios though im very fond of my old brass alarm clock once i tied a wasp to the strikingsurface of each of the coppercoloured bells on the top where the little hammer would hit them in the morning when the alarm went off i always wake up before the alarm goes so i got to watch the snake park i took the little cinder that was the remains of the wasp and put it into a matchbox wrapped in an old photograph of eric with my father in the picture my father was holding a portraitsized photograph of his first wife erics mother and she was the only one who was smiling my father was staring at the camera looking morose the young eric was looking away and picking his nose looking bored the morning was fresh and cold i could see mist over the forests below the mountains and fog out over the north sea i ran hard and fast along the wet sand where it was good and firm making a jet noise with my mouth and holding my binoculars and bag down tight to my sides when i got level with the bunker i banked inland slowing as i hit the soft white sand further up the beach i checked the flotsam and jetsam as i swept over it but there was nothing interestinglooking nothing worth salvaging just an old jellyfish a purple mass with four pale rings inside i altered course slightly to overfly it going trrrrrfffaow trrrrrrrrrrrrrfffaow and kicking it on the run blasting a dirty fountain of sand and jelly up and around me puchrrt went the noise of the explosion i banked again and headed for the bunker the poles were in good repair i didnt need the bag of heads and bodies i visited them all working through the morning planting the dead wasp in its paper coffin not between two of the more important poles as i had intended originally but under the path just on the island side of the bridge while i was there i climbed up the suspension cables to the top of the mainland tower and looked around i could see the top of the house and one of the skylights over the loft i could also see the spire of the church of scotland in porteneil and some smoke coming up from the town chimneys i took the small knife from my left breast pocket and nicked my left thumb carefully i smeared the red stuff over the top of the main beam which crosses from one igirder to the other on the tower then wiped my small wound with an antiseptic tissue from one of my bags i scrambled back down after that and retrieved the ballbearing i had hit the sign with the day before the first mrs cauldhame mary who was erics mother died in childbirth in the house erics head was too big for her she haemorrhaged and bled to death on the marital bed back in i eric has suffered from quite severe migraine all his life and i am very much inclined to attribute the ailment to his manner of entry into the world the whole thing about his migraine and his dead mother had i think a lot to do with what happened to eric poor unlucky soul he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and something very unlikely happened which by sheer chance mattered more to him than anybody else it could have happened to but thats what you risk when you leave here thinking about it that means that eric has killed somebody too i had thought that i was the only murderer in the family but old eric beat me to it killing his mum before he had even drawn breath unintentional admittedly but it isnt always the thought that counts the factory said something about fire i was still thinking about that wondering what it really meant the obvious interpretation was that eric was going to set fire to some dogs but i was too wise in the ways of the factory to treat that as definite i suspected there was more to it in a way i was sorry eric was coming back i had been thinking of having a war shortly maybe in the next week or so but with eric probably going to make an appearance i had decided against it i hadnt had a good war for months the last one had been the ordinary soldiers versus the aerosols in that scenario all the ndscale armies complete with their tanks and guns and trucks and stores and helicopters and boats had to unite against the aerosol invasion the aerosols were almost impossible to stop and the soldiers and their weapons and equipment were getting burned and melted all over the place until one brave soldier who had clung on to one of the aerosols as it flew back to its base came back after many adventures with the news that their base was a breadboard moored under an overhang on an inland creek a combined force of commandos got there just in time and blew the base to smithereens finally blowing up the overhang on top of the smoking remains a good war with all the right ingredients and a more spectacular ending than most i even had my father asking me what all the explosions and the fire had been about when i got back to the house that evening but too long ago anyway with eric on his way i didnt think it would be a good idea to start another war only to have to abandon it in the middle of things and start dealing with the real world i decided i would postpone hostilities for a while instead after i had anointed a few of the more important poles with precious substances i built a dam system when i was younger i used to have fantasies about saving the house by building a dam there would be a fire in the grass on the dunes or a plane would have crashed and all that stopped the cordite in the cellar from going up would be me diverting some of the water from a dam system down a channel and into the house at one time my major ambition was to have my father buy me an excavator so that i could make really big dams but i have a far more sophisticated even metaphysical approach to dambuilding now i realise that you can never really win against the water it will always triumph in the end seeping and soaking and building up and undermining and overflowing all you can really do is construct something that will divert it or block its way for a while persuade it to do something it doesnt really want to do the pleasure comes from the elegance of the compromise you strike between where the water wants to go guided by gravity and the medium its moving over and what you want to do with it actually i think that life has few pleasures to compare with dambuilding give me a good broad beach with a reasonable slope and not too much seaweed and a fairsized stream and ill be happy all day any day by that time the sun was well up and i took off my jacket to lay it with my bags and binoculars stoutstroke dipped and bit and sliced and dug building a huge tripledeck dam the main section of which backed up the water in the north burn for eighty paces not far off the record for the position i had chosen i used my usual metal overflow piece which i keep hidden in the dunes near the best dambuilding site and the piece de resistance was an aqueduct bottomed with an old black plastic rubbishbag id found in the driftwood the aqueduct carried the overflow stream over three sections of a bypass channel id cut from further up the dam i built a little village downstream from the dam complete with roads and a bridge over the remnant of the burn and a church bursting a good big dam or even just letting it overflow is almost as satisfying as planning and building it in the first place i used little shells to represent the people in the town as usual also as usual none of the shells survived the flood when the dam burst they all sank which meant that everybody died by that time i was very hungry my arms were getting sore and my hands were red with gripping the spade and digging into the sand by themselves i watched the first flood of water race down to the sea muddy and littered then turned to head for home did i hear you talking on the phone last night my father said i shook my head nope we were finishing our lunch sitting in the kitchen me with my stew my father with brown rice and seaweed salad he had his town gear on brown brogues brown tweed threepiece suit and on the table sat his brown cap i checked my watch and saw that it was thursday it was very unusual for him to go anywhere on a thursday whether porteneil or any further afield i wasnt going to ask him where he was going because hed only lie when i used to ask him where he was going he would tell me to phucke which he claimed was a small town to the north of inverness it was years and a lot of funny looks in the town before i learned the truth im going out today he told me between mouthfuls of rice and salad i nodded and he continued ill be back late perhaps he was going to porteneil to get drunk in the rock hotel or perhaps he was off to inverness where he often goes on business he prefers to keep mysterious but i suspected that it was really something to do with eric right i said ill take a key so you can lock up when you want to he clattered his knife and fork down on the empty plate and wiped his mouth on a brown napkin made from recycled paper just dont put all the bolts on all right right youll make yourself something to eat this evening hm i nodded again not looking up as i ate and youll do the washingup i nodded again i dont think diggsll come round again but if he does i want you to stay out of his way dont worry i told him and sighed youll be all right then he said standing mmhm i said cleaning up the last of the stew ill be off then i looked up in time to see him place his cap on his head and look round the kitchen patting his pockets as he did so he looked at me again and nodded i said goodbye yes he said right you are ill see you later yes he turned round then turned back looked once more round the room then shook his head quickly and went to the door taking his stick from the corner by the washing machine on his way out i heard the outer door slam then silence i sighed i waited a minute or so then got up leaving my almost clean plate and went through the house to the lounge where i could see the path leading away through the dunes towards the bridge my father was walking along it head bowed going quickly with a sort of anxious swagger as he swung the stick as i watched he struck out with it at some wild flowers growing by the pathside i ran upstairs pausing by the back stairwell window to watch my father disappear round the dune before the bridge ran up the stairs got to the door to the study and twisted the handle briskly the door was firm it didnt shift a millimetre one day hed forget i was sure but not today after i had finished my meal and done the washingup i went to my room checked the homebrew and got my airrifle i made sure i had sufficient pellets in my jacket pockets then headed out of the house for the rabbit grounds on the mainland between the large branch of the creek and the town dump i dont like using the gun its almost too accurate for me the catapult is an inside thing requiring that you and it are one if youre feeling bad youll miss or if you know youre doing something wrong youll miss too unless you fire a gun from the hip its all outside you point and aim and thats it unless the sights are out or theres a really high wind once youve cocked the gun the powers all there just waiting to be released by the squeeze of a finger a catapult lives with you until the last moment it stays tensed in your hands breathing with you moving with you ready to leap ready to sing and jerk and leaving you in that dramatic pose arms and hands outstretched while you wait for the dark curve of the ball in its flight to find its target that delicious thud but going after rabbits especially the cunning little bastards out on the grounds you need all the help you can get one shot and theyre scurrying for their holes the gun is loud enough to frighten them just as much but calm surgical thing that it is it improves your chance of a firsttime kill as far as i know none of my illstarred relations has ever died by the gun theyve gone a lot of funny ways the cauldhames and their associates by marriage but to the best of my knowledge a gun has never crossed one off i came to the end of the bridge where technically my territory stops and stood still for a while thinking feeling listening and looking and smelling everything seemed to be all right quite apart from the ones i killed and they were all about the same age i was when i murdered them i can think of at least three of our family who went to whatever they imagined their maker was like in unusual ways leviticus cauldhame my fathers eldest brother emigrated to south africa and bought a farm there in i leviticus a person of such weapongrade stupidity his mental faculties would probably have improved with the onset of senile dementia left scotland because the conservatives had failed to reverse the socialist reforms of the previous labour government railways still nationalised working class breeding like flies now the welfare state existed to prevent the natural culling by disease stateowned mines intolerable i have read some of the letters he wrote to my father leviticus was happy with the country though there were rather a lot of blacks around he referred to the policy of separate development as aparthate in his first few letters until somebody must have clued him in on the correct spelling not my father im sure leviticus was passing police headquarters in johannesburg one day walking along the pavement after a shopping expedition when a crazed homicidal black threw himself unconscious from the top storey and apparently ripped all his fingernails out on the way down he hit and fatally injured my innocent and unfortunate uncle whose muttered last words in hospital before his coma became a full stop were my god the buggersve learned to fly a faint wisp of smoke rose ahead of me from the town dump i wasnt going that far today but i could hear the bulldozer they used sometimes to spread the garbage around as it revved and pushed i hadnt been to the dump for a while and it was about time i went to see what the good folk of porteneil had thrown out that was where i got all the old aerosols for the last war not to mention several important parts of the wasp factory including the face itself my uncle athelwald trapley from my mothers side of the family emigrated to america at the end of the second world war he threw in a good job with an insurance company to go off with a woman and ended up broke and heartbroke in a cheap caravan site outside fort worth where he decided to put an end to himself he turned on his calorgas stove and heater but didnt light them and sat down to await the end understandably nervous and no doubt a little distracted and distraught both with his loved ones untimely departure and that which he was planning for himself he resorted without a thought to his habitual method of calming himself down and lit a marlboro out of the blazing wreck he leaped stumbling around on fire from head to toe and screaming he had intended a painless death not being burned alive so he jumped head first into the fortygallon oildrum full of rainwater which stood at the rear of the caravan wedged inside that drum he drowned his little legs waggling pathetically as he gulped and squirmed and tried to get his arms into a position from which he could lever himself out twenty metres or so from the grasspacked hill which looks over the rabbit grounds i switched to silent running pacing stealthily through the long weeds and reeds careful not to let anything i was carrying make a noise i was hoping to catch some of the little pests out early but if i had to i was prepared to wait until the sun went down i crawled quietly up the slope the grass sliding under my chest and belly my legs straining to propel my bulk up and forward i was downwind of course and the breeze was stiff enough to cover most small noises as far as i could see there were no rabbit sentries on the hill i stopped about two metres down from the summit and quietly cocked the gun inspecting the composite steel and nylon pellet before placing it in the chamber and snicking the gun closed i closed my eyes and thought about the trapped compressed spring and the little slug sitting at the shiny bottom of the rifled tube then i crawled to the top of the hill at first i thought i would have to wait the grounds looked empty in the afternoon light and only the grass moved in the wind i could see the holes and the little piles and scatters of droppings and i could see the gorse bushes on the far slope above the bank which held most of the holes where the rabbitruns snaked tiny paths like jagged tunnels through the bushes but there was no sign of the animals themselves it was in those rabbitruns through the gorse that some of the local boys used to set snares i found the wire loops though having seen the boys set them and i tore them out or put them under the grass on the paths the boys used to take when they came to inspect their traps whether any of them was tripped up by his own snare or not i dont know but id like to think they did go sprawling head first anyway they or their replacements dont set snares any more i suppose it has gone out of fashion and they are out spraying slogans on walls sniffing glue or trying to get laid animals rarely surprise me but there was something about the buck once i noticed it sitting there that froze me for a second it must have been there all the time sitting motionless and staring straight at me from the far edge of the level area of the grounds but i hadnt noticed it at first when i did something about its stillness stilled me for a moment without actually moving physically i shook my head clear inside and decided that the big male would make a fine head for a pole the rabbit might as well have been stuffed for all the movement it made and i could see that it definitely was staring right at me its little eyes not blinking its tiny nose not sniffing its ears untwitched i stared straight back at it and very slowly brought the gun round to bear moving it first one way then slightly the other so that it looked like something swaying with the wind in the grass it took about a minute to get the rifle in place and my head in the correct position cheek by stock and still the beast hadnt moved a millimetre four times larger his big whiskered head split neatly into four by the crosshairs he looked even more impressive and just as immobile i frowned and brought my head up suddenly thinking that it might just be stuffed perhaps somebody was having a laugh at my expense town boys my father surely not eric yet it was a stupid thing to have done id moved my head far too quickly for it to look natural and the buck shot off up the bank i dipped my head and brought the gun up at the same time without thinking there was no time to get back into the right position take a breath and gently squeeze the trigger it was up and bang and with my whole body unbalanced and both hands on the gun i fell forward rolling as i did so to keep the gun out the sand when i looked up cradling the gun and gasping my backside sunk in sand i couldnt see the rabbit i forced the gun down and hit myself on the knees shit i told myself the buck wasnt in a hole however it wasnt even near the bank where the holes were it was tearing across the level ground in great leaps heading right at me and seeming to shake and shiver in midair with every bound it was coming at me like a bullet head shaking lips curled back teeth long and yellow and by far the biggest id ever seen on a rabbit live or dead its eyes looked like coiled slugs blobs of red arced from its left haunch with every pouncing leap it was almost on me and i was sat there staring there was no time to reload by the time i started to react there was no time to do anything except at the instinctive level my hands left the gun hanging in midair above my knees and went for the catapult which as always was hanging on my belt the armrest stuck down between that and my cords even my quickreaction steelies were beyond reach in time though the rabbit was on me in a halfsecond heading straight for my throat i caught it with the catapult the thick black tubing of the rubber twisting once in the air as i scissored my hands and fell back letting the buck go over my head and then kicking with my legs and turning myself so that i was level with it where it lay kicking and struggling with the power of a wolverine spreadeagled on the sand slope with its neck caught in the black rubber its head twisted this way and that as it tried to reach my fingers with its chopping teeth i hissed through my own teeth at it and tugged the rubber tighter then tighter still the buck thrashed and spat and made a high keening noise i didnt think rabbits were capable of and beat its legs on the ground i was so rattled i glanced round to make sure this wasnt a signal for an army of bunnies like this dobermann of a beast to come up from behind and tear me to shreds the damn thing wouldnt die the rubber was stretching and stretching and not tightening enough and i couldnt move my hands for fear of it tearing the flesh off a finger or biting my nose off the same consideration stopped me from butting the animal i wasnt going to put my face near those teeth i couldnt get a knee up to break its back either because i was almost slipping down the slope as it was and i couldnt possibly get any purchase on that surface with only one leg it was crazy this wasnt africa it was a rabbit not a lion what the hell was happening here it finally bit me twisting its neck more than i would have thought possible and catching my right index finger right on the knuckle that was it i screamed and pulled with all my might shaking my hands and my head and throwing myself backwards and over as i did so banging one knee off the gun where it lay fallen in the sand i ended up lying in the scrubby grass at the bottom of the hill my knuckles white as i throttled the rabbit swinging it in front of my face with its neck held on the thin black line of rubber tubing now tied like a knot on a black string i was still shaking so i couldnt tell if the vibrations the body made were its or mine then the tubing gave way the rabbit slammed into my left hand while the other end of the rubber whipped my right wrist my arms flew out in opposite directions crashing into the ground i lay on my back my head on the sandy ground staring out to the side where the body of the buck lay at the end of a little curved line of black and tangled in the armrest and grip of the catapult the animal was still i looked up at the sky and made a fist with the other hand beating it into the ground i looked back at the rabbit then got up and knelt over it it was dead the head rolled slack neck broken when i lifted it the left haunch was matted red with blood where my pellet had hit it it was big size of a tomcat the biggest rabbit id ever seen obviously id left the rabbits alone for too long or id have known about the existence of such a brute i sucked at the little trickle of blood from my finger my catapult my pride and joy the black destroyer itself destroyed by a rabbit oh i suppose i could have written off and got a new length of rubber or got old cameron in the ironmongers shop to find me something but it would never feel right again every time i lifted it to aim it at a target living or not this moment would be at the back of my mind the black destroyer was finished i sat back in the sand and looked quickly round the area still no other rabbits hardly surprising there was no time to waste theres only one way to react after something like this i got up retrieved the rifle lying halfburied in the sand on the slope went to the top of the hill looked round then decided to risk leaving everything as it was i cradled the gun in my arms and set off at emergency speed hurtling down the path back to the island at maximum trusting to luck and adrenalin that i wouldnt put a foot wrong and end up lying gasping in the grass with a multiple fracture of the femur i used the gun to balance myself with on the tighter corners the grass and the ground were both dry so it wasnt as risky as it might have been i cut off the path proper and charged up over a dune and down its other side to where the service pipe carrying the water and electricity to the house appears out of the sand and crosses the creek i jumped the iron spikes and landed with both feet on the concrete then ran over the narrow top of the pipe and jumped down on to the island back at the house i went straight to my shed i left the rifle checked the war bag and put its strap over my head tying the waiststring quickly i locked the shed again and jogged as far as the bridge while i got my breath back once through the narrow gate in the middle of the bridge i sprinted at the rabbit grounds everything was as id left it the buck lying strangled in the broken catapult the sand kicked up and messed where id gone crashing the wind still moved the grass and flowers and there were no animals around even the gulls hadnt spotted the carrion yet i got straight to work first i took a twentycentimetre electricpiping bomb out of the war bag i slit the buck in the anus i checked that the bomb was all right especially that the white crystals of the explosive mixture were dry then added a plasticstraw fuse and a charge of the explosive around the hole bored in the black pipe and taped everything up i shoved the lot inside the still warm rabbit and left it sort of sitting squatting looking towards the holes in the bank then i took some smaller bombs and planted them inside some of the rabbit holes stamping down the roofs of the tunnel entrances so that they caved in and left only the straw fuses sticking out i filled the plastic detergentbottle and primed the lighter left it lying on the top of the bank most of the rabbit holes were in then went back to the first of the blockedup holes and lit the fuse with my disposable cigarettelighter the smell of burning plastic stayed in my nose and the bright glare of the burning mixture danced in my eyes as i hurried to the next hole glancing at my watch as i did so id placed six smaller bombs and had them all lit in forty seconds i was sitting on the top of the bank above the holes the lighter of the flamethrower burning weakly in the sunlight when just over the minute the first tunnel blew i felt it through the seat of my pants and grinned the rest went off quickly the puff of smoke from the charge around the mouth of each bomb bursting out of the fuming earth just before the main charge went off scattering earth was blasted out into the rabbit grounds and the thudding noises rolled through the air i smiled at that there was very little noise really you wouldnt have been able to hear a thing back at the house almost all the energy from the bombs had gone into blowing the earth out and the air in the burrows back the first dazed rabbits came out two of them bleeding at the nose looking otherwise unharmed but staggering almost falling i squeezed the plastic bottle and sent a jet of petrol out of it over the wick of the lighter held a few centimetres out from the nozzle by an aluminium tentpeg the petrol burst into flame as it flew over the wick in the tiny steel cup roared through the air and fell brightly on and around the two rabbits they took flame and blazed running and stumbling and falling i looked round for more as the first two flamed near the centre of the grounds finally collapsing into the grass stifflimbed but twitching crackling to the breeze a tiny lick of flame flickered round the mouth of the thrower i blew it out another smaller rabbit appeared i caught it with the jet of flame and it zipped off out of range heading for the water by the side of the hill the savage buck had attacked me on i dug into the war bag drew out the airpistol cocked it and fired in one movement the shot missed and the rabbit trailed a thread of smoke round the hill i got another three rabbits with the thrower before i packed it in the last thing i did was to fire the blazing stream of petrol at the buck still sitting stuffed and dead and oozing blood in the forefront of the grounds the fire dropped all round it so that it disappeared in the rolling orange and curling black in a few seconds the fuse caught and after about ten seconds the mass of flame blew up and out throwing something black and smoking twenty metres or more into the lateafternoon air and scattering pieces all over the grounds the explosion much bigger than the ones in the holes and with almost nothing to muffle it cracked across the dunes like a whip setting my ears ringing and making even me jump a bit whatever was left of the buck landed way behind me i followed the smell of burning to where it lay it was mostly the head and a grubby stub of spine and ribs and about half the skin i gritted my teeth and picked the warm remnant up took it back to the grounds and flung it into them from the top of the bank i stood in the slanting sunlight warm and yellow around me the stench of burning flesh and grass on the wind the smoke rising into the air from burrows and cadavers grey and black the sweet smell of leaking unburned petrol coming from the flamethrower where id left it and i breathed deeply with the last of the petrol i covered the body of the catapult and the usedup bottle of the thrower where they lay on the sand and set fire to them i sat crosslegged just by the blaze staring into it from upwind until it was out and only the metal of the black destroyer remained then i took the sooty skeleton and buried it where it had been ruined at the bottom of the hill it would have a name now black destroyer hill the fire was out everywhere the grass too young and moist to catch not that id have cared if it had gone up i considered setting the whin bushes alight but the flowers always looked cheerful when they came out and the bushes smelled better fresh than burned so i didnt i decided id caused enough mayhem for one day the catapult was avenged the buck or what it meant its spirit maybe soiled and degraded taught a hard lesson and i felt good if the rifle was all right and hadnt got sand inside the sights or anywhere else awkward to clean it would almost have been worth it the defence budget would stand buying another catapult tomorrow my crossbow would just have to wait another week or so with that lovely sated feeling inside me i packed the war bag and went wearily home thinking what had happened over in my mind trying to figure out the whys and wherefores see what lessons were to be learned what signs to be read in it all on the way i passed the rabbit i thought had escaped lying just before the sparkling clean water of the stream blackened and contorted locked into a weird twisted crouch its dead dry eyes staring up at me as i passed by accusatory i kicked it into the water my other dead uncle was called harmsworth stove a halfuncle from erics mothers side of the family he was a businessman in belfast and he and his wife looked after eric for nearly five years when my brother was a toddler harmsworth committed suicide eventually with an electric powerdrill and a quarterinch bit he inserted it through the side of his skull and finding that he was still alive though in some pain drove to a nearby hospital where he later died actually i might just have had a little to do with his death as it occurred less than a year after the stoves lost their only child esmerelda unknown to them and to everybody else for that matter she was one of my victims i lay in bed that night waiting for my father to return and for the phone to ring while i thought about what had happened maybe the big buck was a rabbit from outside the grounds some wild beast come into the warren from beyond to terrorise the locals and make itself boss only to die in an encounter with a superior being it could have no real comprehension of whatever it was a sign i was sure of that the whole fraught episode must signify something my automatic response might just have had something to do with the fire that the factory had predicted but deep inside i knew that that wasnt all there was to it and that there was more to come the sign was in the whole thing not just the unexpected ferocity of the buck id killed but also in my furious almost unthinking response and the fate of the innocent rabbits who took the brunt of my wrath it also meant something looking back as well as forward the first time i murdered it was because of rabbits meeting a fiery death and meeting that fiery death from the nozzle of a flamethrower virtually identical to the one i had used to exact my revenge on the warren it was all too much all too close and perfect events were shaping up faster and worse than i could have expected i was in danger of losing control of the situation the rabbit grounds that supposed happy huntingground had shown it could happen from the smaller to the greater the patterns always hold true and the factory has taught me to watch out for them and respect them that was the first time i killed because of what my cousin blyth cauldhame had done to our rabbits erics and mine it was eric who first invented the flamethrower and it was lying in what was then the bicycleshed now my shed when our cousin who had come to spend the weekend with us along with his parents decided it would be fun to ride erics bike into the soft mud at the south end of the island this he duly did while eric and i were out flying kites then he came back and filled the flamethrower with petrol he sat in the back garden with it obscured from the windows of the lounge where his parents and our father sat by the washing blowing in the breeze he lit the thrower and sprayed our two hutches with flame incinerating all our beauties eric in particular was very upset he cried like a girl i wanted to kill blyth there and then the hiding he got from his father my dads brother james was not enough as far as i was concerned not for what hed done to eric my brother eric was inconsolable desperate with grief because he had made the thing blyth had used to destroy our beloved pets he always was a bit sentimental always the sensitive one the bright one until his nasty experience everybody was sure he would go far anyway that was the start of the skull grounds the area of the big old partially earthedover dune behind the house where all our pets went when they died the burned rabbits started that old saul was there before them but that was just a oneoff thing i hadnt said anything to anybody even eric about what i wanted to do to blyth i was wise in my childishness even then at the tender age of five when most children are forever telling their parents and friends that they hate them and they wish they were dead i kept quiet when blyth came back the next year he was even more unpleasant than before having lost his left leg from above the knee in a road accident the boy he was playing chicken with was killed blyth resented his handicap bitterly he was ten by that time and very active he tried to pretend that the nasty pink thing he had to strap on didnt exist that it had nothing to do with him he could just about ride a bike and he liked wrestling and playing football usually in goal i was just six then and while blyth knew that i had had some sort of little accident when i was much younger i certainly seemed to him to be a lot more ablebodied that he was he thought it was great fun to throw me about and wrestle with me and punch and kick me i made a convincing show of joining in all this horseplay and appeared to enjoy it hugely for a week or so while i thought about what i could do to our cousin my other brother a full brother paul was still alive at the time he eric and i were supposed to keep blyth entertained we did our best taking blyth to our favourite places letting him play with our toys and playing games with him eric and i had to restrain him at times when he wanted to do something like throw little paul into the water to see if hed float or like when he wanted to fell a tree over the railway line that goes through porteneil but as a rule we got on surprisingly well even though it rankled to see eric who was the same age as blyth obviously in fear of him so one day very hot and insecty with a faint breeze coming in off the sea we were all lying in the grass on the flat area just to the south of the house paul and blyth had fallen asleep and eric was lying with his hands behind his neck staring drowsily up at the bright blue blyth had taken off the hollow plastic leg and left it lying tangled in its straps and the long grass blades i watched eric fall slowly asleep his head gently tipping to one side eyes closing i got up and went for a walk and ended up at the bunker it hadnt assumed the full importance it later would in my life though i already liked the place and felt at home in its coolness and dark it was an old concrete pillbox built just before the last war to house a gun covering the firth and it stuck in the sand like a big grey tooth i went inside and found the snake it was an adder i didnt see it for ages because i was too busy sticking an old rotten fencepost out through the slits in the pillbox pretending it was a gun and firing at imaginary ships it was only after id stopped doing that and gone into the corner to have a piss that i looked over into the other corner where there was a pile of rusty cans and old bottles there i saw the jagged stripes of the sleeping snake i decided what i was going to do almost immediately i went outside quietly and found a length of driftwood of the appropriate shape came back to the bunker caught the snake by the neck with the piece of wood and bundled it into the first rusty can i could find which still had a lid i dont think the snake had fully wakened up when i caught it and i was careful not to jar it as i ran back to where my brothers and blyth were lying on the grass eric had rolled over and had one hand under his head the other over his eyes his mouth was open slightly and his chest moved slowly paul lay in the sunlight curled up into a little ball quite still and blyth was lying on his stomach hands under his cheek the stump of his left leg drawn up in the flowers and the grass sticking out from his shorts like some monstrous erection i went closer still clutching the rusty can in my shadow the gable end of the house looked down on us from about fifty metres away windowless white sheets flapped feebly in the back garden my heart beat wildly and i licked my lips i sat down by the side of blyth careful not to let my shadow cross his face i put one ear to the can and held it still i couldnt hear or feel the snake stir i reached for blyths artificial leg lying smooth and pink by the small of his back and in his shadow i held the leg to the can and took the lid away sliding the leg over the hole as i did so then i slowly turned the can and the leg the other way up so that the can was over the leg i shook the can and felt the snake fall into the leg it didnt like it at first and moved and beat against the sides of the plastic and the neck of the can while i held it and sweated listening to the hum of the insects and the rustling of the grass staring at blyth as he lay there still and silent his dark hair ruffled now and again by the breeze my hands shook and the perspiration ran into my eyes the snake stopped moving i held it longer glancing at the house again then i tipped the leg and the can over until the leg was lying at the same angle on the grass as it had been behind blyth i took the can carefully away at the last moment nothing happened the snake was still inside the leg and i couldnt even see it i got up walked backwards towards the nearest dune threw the can way high over the top of it then came back lay down where id been sitting earlier and closed my eyes eric woke first then i opened my eyes as though sleepily and we woke little paul and our cousin blyth saved me the trouble of suggesting a game of football by doing it himself eric paul and i got the goalposts together while blyth hurriedly strapped his leg on nobody suspected from the first moments when my brothers and i stood there incredulous as blyth screamed and jumped and tugged at his leg to the tearful farewell of blyths parents and diggs taking statements a bit even appeared in the inverness courier which was picked up for its curiosity value by a couple of the fleet street rags not one person even suggested that it might have been anything other than a tragic and slightly macabre accident only i knew better i didnt tell eric he was shocked by what had happened and genuinely sorry for blyth and his parents all i said was that i thought it was a judgement from god that blyth had first lost his leg and then had the replacement become the instrument of his downfall all because of the rabbits eric who was going through a religious phase at the time which i suppose i was to some extent copying thought this was a terrible thing to say god wasnt like that i said the one i believed in was at any rate such was the reason that particular patch of ground got its name the snake park i lay in bed thinking back on all this father still hadnt come back perhaps he was going to stay out all night that was extremely unusual and rather worrying perhaps he had been knocked down or had died of a heart attack ive always had a rather ambivalent attitude towards something happening to my father and it persists a death is always exciting always makes you realise how alive you are how vulnerable but sofarlucky but the death of somebody close gives you a good excuse to go a bit crazy for a while and do things that would otherwise be inexcusable what delight to behave really badly and still get loads of sympathy but id miss him and i dont know what the legal position would be about me staying on here by myself would i get all his money that would be good i could get my motorbike now instead of having to wait jesus thered be so many things i could do i dont even know where to start thinking about them but it would be a big change and i dont know that im ready for it yet i could feel myself starting to slide off into sleep i began to imagine and see all sorts of weird things behind my eyes mazeshapes and spreading areas of unknown colours then fantastic buildings and spaceships and weapons and landscapes i often wish i could remember my dreams better two years after i killed blyth i murdered my young brother paul for quite different and more fundamental reasons than id disposed of blyth and then a year after that i did for my young cousin esmerelda more or less on a whim thats my score to date three i havent killed anybody for years and dont intend to ever again it was just a stage i was going through in the bunker my greatest enemies are women and the sea these things i hate women because they are weak and stupid and live in the shadow of men and are nothing compared to them and the sea because it has always frustrated me destroying what i have built washing away what i have left wiping clean the marks i have made and im not all that sure the wind is blameless either the sea is a sort of mythological enemy and i make what you might call sacrifices to it in my soul fearing it a little respecting it as youre supposed to but in many ways treating it as an equal it does things to the world and so do i we should both be feared women well women are a bit too close for comfort as far as im concerned i dont even like having them on the island not even mrs clamp who comes every week on a saturday to clean the house and deliver our supplies shes ancient and sexless the way the very old and the very young are but shes still been a woman and i resent that for my own good reason i woke the next morning wondering if my father had come back or not without bothering to dress i went to his room i was going to try the door but i could hear him snoring before i touched the handle so i turned and went to the bathroom in the bathroom after a piss i went through my daily washing ritual first i had my shower the shower is the only time in any twentyfourhour period i take my underpants right off i put the old pair in the dirtylinen bag in the airing cupboard i showered carefully starting at my hair and ending between my toes and under my toenails sometimes when i have to make precious substances such as toenail cheese or bellybutton fluff i have to go without a shower or bath for days and days i hate doing this because i soon feel dirty and itchy and the only bright thing about such abstinence is how good it feels to have a shower at the end of it after my shower and a brisk rubdown with first a facecloth and then a towel i trimmed my nails then i brushed my teeth thoroughly with my electric toothbrush next the shave i always use shaving foam and the latest razors twinblade swivelheads are stateoftheart at the moment removing the downy brown growth of the previous day and night with dexterity and precision as with all my ablutions the shave follows a definite and predetermined pattern i take the same number of strokes of the same length in the same sequence each morning as always i felt a rising tingle of excitement as i contemplated the meticulously shorn surfaces of my face i blew and picked my nose clean washed my hands cleaned the razor nailclipper shower and basin rinsed out the flannel and combed my hair happily i didnt have any spots so there was nothing else required but a final handwash and a clean pair of underpants i placed all my washing materials towels razor and so forth exactly where they should be wiped a little steam off the mirror on my bathroom cabinet and returned to my room there i put on my socks green for that day then a khaki shirt with pockets in the winter id have a vest underneath and a green army jumper over the shirt but not in the summer my green cord trousers came next followed by my fawn kickers boots labels removed as from everything i wear because i refuse to be a walking advertisement for anybody my combat jacket knife bags catapult and other equipment i took down to the kitchen with me it was still early and the rain id heard forecast the previous night was looking about ready to drop i had my modest breakfast and i was ready i went out into the fresh damp morning walking quickly to keep warm and get round the island before any rain started the hills beyond the town were hidden by cloud and the sea was rough as the wind freshened the grass was heavy with dew drops of mist bowed the unopened flowers and clung to my sacrifice poles too like clear blood on the shrivelled heads and tiny desiccated bodies a couple of jets screamed over the island at one point two jaguars wing to wing about one hundred metres up and going fast crossing the whole island in an eyeblink and racing out to sea i glared at them then went on my way once they made me jump another couple of them a couple of years ago they came in illegally low after bombing practice on the range just down the firth blasting over the island so suddenly that i jumped while in the delicate manoeuvre of teasing a wasp into a jar from the old tree stump near the ruined sheeppen at the north end of the island the wasp stung me i went into town that day bought an extra plastic model of a jaguar made the kit up that afternoon and ceremonially blew it to pieces on the roof of the bunker with a small pipebomb two weeks later a jaguar crashed into the sea off nairn though the pilot ejected in time id like to think the power was working then but i suspect it was coincidence highperformance jets crash so often it was no real surprise my symbolic and their real destruction came within a fortnight of each other i sat on the earth banking that looks out over the muddy creek and ate an apple i leaned back on the young tree that as a sapling had been the killer it was grown now and a good bit taller than me but when i was young and we were the same size it had been my static catapult defending the southerly approaches to the island then as now it looked out over the broad creek and the gunmetalcoloured mud with the eatenlooking wreck of an old fishing boat sticking out of it after the tale of old saul i put the catapult to another use and it became the killer scourge of hamsters mice and gerbils i remember that it could whack a fistsized stone well over the creek and twenty metres or more into the undulating ground on the mainland and once i got keyed into its natural rhythm i could send off a shot every two seconds i could place them anywhere within a sixtydegree angle by varying the direction in which i pulled the sapling over and down i didnt use a little animal every two seconds they were expended at a few a week for six months i was the best customer the porteneil pet shop had going in every saturday to get a couple of beasts and about every month buying a tube of badminton shuttlecocks from the toyshop as well i doubt anybody ever put the two together apart from me it was all for a purpose of course little that i do is not one way or another i was looking for old sauls skull i threw the core of the apple over the creek it plopped into the mud on the far bank with a satisfying slurp i decided it was time to look into the bunker properly and set off along the bank at a jog swinging round the southernmost dune towards the old pillbox i stopped to look at the shore there didnt seem to be anything interesting there but i remembered the lesson of the day before when i had stopped to sniff the air and everything had seemed fine then ten minutes later i was wrestling with a kamikaze rabbit so i trotted down off the side of the dune and down to the line of debris thrown up by the sea there was one bottle a very minor enemy and empty i went down to the waterline and threw the bottle out it bobbed head up ten metres out the tide hadnt covered the pebbles yet so i took up a handful and lobbed them at the bottle it was close enough to use the underarm style and the pebbles id selected were all of roughly the same size so my fire was very accurate four shots within splashing distance and a fifth which smashed the neck off the bottle a small victory really because the decisive defeat of the bottles had come about long ago shortly after i learned to throw when i first realised the sea was an enemy it still tried me out now and again though and i was in no mood to allow even the slightest encroachment on my territory the bottle sunk i returned to the dunes went to the top of the one the bunker lay halfburied in and had a look round with my binoculars the coast was clear even if the weather wasnt i went down to the bunker i repaired the steel door years ago loosening the rusted hinges and straightening the guides for the bolt i took out the key to the padlock and opened the door inside there was the familiar waxy burned smell i closed the door and propped a piece of wood against it then stood for a while letting my eyes adjust to the gloom and my mind to the feel of the place after a while i could see dimly by the light filtering through the sacking hung over the two narrow slits which are the bunkers only windows i took off my shoulder bag and binoculars and hung them on nails hammered into the slightly crumbling concrete i took up the tin with the matches in it and lit the candles they burned yellowly and i knelt clenching my fists and thinking id found the candlemaking kit in the cupboard under the stairs five or six years ago and experimented with the colours and consistencies for months before hitting on the idea of using the wax as a waspprison i looked up then and saw the head of a wasp poking up from the top of a candle on the altar the newly lit candle blood red and as thick as my wrist contained the still flame and the tiny head within its caldera of wax like pieces of an alien game as i watched the flame a centimetre behind the wasps waxgummed head freed the antennae from the grease and they came upright for a while before they frazzled the head started to smoke as the wax dribbled off it then the fumes caught light and the wasp body a second flame within the crater flickered and crackled as the fire incinerated the insect from its head down i lit the candle inside the skull of old saul that orb of bone holed and yellowing was what killed all those little creatures who met their death in the mud on the far side of the creek i watched the smoky flame waver inside the place where the dogs brains used to be and i closed my eyes i saw the rabbit grounds again and the flaming bodies as they jumped and sped i saw again the one that escaped the grounds and died just before it made it to the stream i saw the black destroyer and remembered its demise i thought of eric and wondered what the factorys warning was about i saw myself frank l cauldhame and i saw myself as i might have been a tall slim man strong and determined and making his way in the world assured and purposeful i opened my eyes and gulped breathing deeply a fetid light blazed from old sauls sockets the candles on either side of the altar flickered with the skullflame in a draught i looked round the bunker the severed heads of gulls rabbits crows mice owls moles and small lizards looked down on me they hung drying on short loops of black thread suspended from lengths of string stretched across the walls from corner to corner and dim shadows turned slowly on the walls behind them around the foot of the walls on plinths of wood or stone or on bottles and cans the sea had surrendered my collection of skulls watched me the yellow brainbones of horses dogs birds fish and horned sheep faced in towards old saul some with beaks and jaws open some shut the teeth exposed like drawn claws to the right of the brick wood and concrete altar where the candles and the skull sat were my small phials of precious fluids to the left rose a tall set of clear plastic drawers designed to hold screws washers nails and hooks each drawer not much larger than a small matchbox held the body of a wasp which had been through the factory i reached over for a large tin on my right prised the tight lid off with my knife and used a small teaspoon inside to place some of the white mixture from the tin on to a round metal plate in front of the old dogs skull then i took the oldest of the wasp cadavers from its little tray and tipped it on to the white pile of granules i replaced the sealed tin and the plastic drawer and lit the tiny pyre with a match the mixture of sugar and weedkiller sizzled and glared the intense light seared through me and clouds of smoke rolled up and around my head as i held my breath and my eyes watered in a second the blaze was over the mixture and the wasp a single black lump of scarred and blistered debris cooling from a bright yellow heat i closed my eyes to inspect the patterns but only the burning afterimage remained fading like the glow on the metal plate it danced about briefly on my retinas then disappeared i had hoped for erics face or some further clue about what was going to happen but i got nothing i leaned forward blew out the wasp candles right then left then blew through one eye and extinguished the candle inside the dog skull still glareblind i felt my way to the door through the dark and the smoke i went out letting the smoke and fumes free into the damp air coils of blue and grey curled off my hair and clothes as i stood there breathing deeply i closed my eyes for a bit then went back into the bunker to tidy up i closed the door and locked it i went back to the house for lunch and found my father chopping driftwood in the back garden good day he said wiping his brow it was humid if not particularly warm and he was stripped to the vest hello i said were you all right yesterday i was i didnt get back till late i was asleep i thought you might be youll be wanting some lunch ill make it today if you want no thats all right you can chop the wood if you have a mind to ill make lunch for us he put the axe down and wiped his hands on his trousers eyeing me was everything quiet yesterday oh yes i nodded standing there nothing happened nothing special i assured him putting down my gear and taking my jacket off i took up the axe very quiet in fact good he said apparently convinced and went into the house i started swinging the axe at the lumps of driftwood after lunch i went into town taking gravel my bike and some money i told my father id be back before dinner it started to rain when i was halfway to porteneil so i stopped to put on my kagool the going was heavy but i got there without mishap the town was grey and empty in the dull afternoon light cars swished through on the road going north some with their headlights on making everything else seem even dimmer i went to the gun and tackle shop first to see old mackenzie and take another of his american huntingcatapults off him and some airgun pellets too and how are you today young man very well and yourself och not too bad you know he said shaking his grey head slowly his yellowed eyes and hair rather sickly in the electric light of the shop we always say the same things to each other often i stay longer in the shop than i mean to because it smells so good and hows that uncle of yours these days i havent seen him for oh a while hes well oh good good mr mackenzie said screwing up his eyes with a slightly pained expression and nodding slowly i nodded too and looked at my watch well i must be going i said and started to back off putting my new catapult into the daypack on my back and stuffing the pellets wrapped in brown paper into my combatjacket pockets oh well if you must you must said mackenzie nodding at the glass counter as though inspecting the flies reels and duckcalls within he took up a cloth by the side of the cash register and started to move it slowly over the surface looking up just once as i left the shop saying goodbye then yes goodbye in the firthview cafe apparently the location of some awful and localised ground subsidence since it was named because it would have to be at least a storey taller to catch a view of the water i had a cup of coffee and a game of space invaders they had a new machine in but after a pound or so i had mastered it and won an extra spaceship i got bored with it and sat down with my coffee i inspected the posters on the cafe walls to see if there was anything interesting happening in the area in the near future but apart from the film club there wasnt much the next showing was the tin drum but that was a book my father had bought for me years ago one of the few real presents he has ever given me and i had therefore assiduously avoided reading it just as i had myra breckinridge another of his rare gifts mostly my father just gives me the money that i ask for and lets me get what i want for myself i dont think hes really interested but on the other hand he wouldnt refuse me anything as far as i can tell we have some sort of unspoken agreement that i keep quiet about not officially existing in return for being able to do more or less as i like on the island and buy more or less what i like in the town the only thing we had argued about recently was the motorbike which he said he would buy me when i was a bit older i suggested that it might be a good idea to get it in midsummer so that i could get plenty of practice in before the skiddy weather set in but he thought there might be too much tourist traffic going through the town and on the roads around it in the middle of the summer i think he just wants to keep putting it off he might be frightened of me gaining too much independence or he might simply be scared that ill kill myself the way a lot of youths seem to when they get a bike i dont know i never know exactly how much he really feels for me come to think of it i never know exactly how much i really feel for him i had rather been hoping that i might see somebody i knew while i was in the town but the only people i saw were old mackenzie in the gun and tackle shop and mrs stuart in the cafe yawning and fat behind her formica counters and reading a mills boon not that i know all that many people anyway i suppose jamie is my only real friend though through him i have met a few people of about my own age i regard as acquaintances not going to school and having to pretend i didnt live on the island all the time has meant that i didnt grow up with anybody of my own age except eric of course but even he was away for a long time and about the time i was thinking of venturing further afield and getting to know more people eric went crazy and things got a bit uncomfortable in the town for a while mothers told their children to behave or eric cauldhame would get them and do horrible things to them with worms and maggots as i suppose was inevitable the story gradually became that eric would set fire to them not just their pet dogs and as was probably also inevitable a lot of kids started to think that i was eric or that i got up to the same tricks or perhaps their parents guessed about blyth paul and esmerelda whatever they would run from me or shout rude things from a distance so i kept a low profile and restricted my brief visits to the town to a taciturn minimum i get the odd funny look to this day from children youths and adults and i know some mothers tell their children to behave or frankll get you but it doesnt bother me i can take it i got on my bike and went back to the house a bit recklessly shooting through puddles on the path and taking the jump a bit on the path where theres a long downhill on a dune and then a short uphill where its easy to leave the ground at a good forty kilometres per hour landing with a muddy thump that nearly had me in the whin bushes and left me with a very sore bum making me want to keep opening my mouth with the feeling of it but i got back safely i told my father i was all right and id be in for my dinner in an hour or so then went back to the shed to wipe gravel down after id done that i made up some new bombs to replace the ones id used the day before and a few extra besides i put the old electric fire on in the shed not so much to warm me as to keep the highly hygroscopic mixture from absorbing moisture out of a damp air what id really like of course is not to have to bother with lugging kilo bags of sugar and tins of weed killer back from the town to stuff into electricalconduit piping which jamie the dwarf gets for me from the building contractors where he works in porteneil with a cellar full of enough cordite to wipe half the island off the map it does seem a bit daft but my father wont let me near the stuff it was his father colin cauldhame who got the cordite from the shipbreaking yard there used to be down the coast one of his relations worked there and had found some old warship with one magazine still loaded with the explosive colin bought the cordite and used it to light fires with uncontained cordite makes a very good firelighter colin bought enough to last the house about two hundred years even if his son had continued using it so perhaps he was thinking of selling it i know that my father did use it for a while lighting the stove with it but he hasnt for a while god knows how much there still is down there ive seen great stacks and bales of it still with the royal navy markings on it and ive dreamed up any number of ways of getting at it but short of tunnelling in from the shed and taking the cordite out from the back so that the bales looked untouched from the inside of the cellar i dont see how i could do it my father checks the cellar every few weeks going nervously down with a torch counting the bales and sniffing and looking at the thermometer and hygrometer its nice and cool inside the cellar and not damp though i guess it can only be just above the water table and my father seems to know what hes doing and is confident that the explosive hasnt become unstable but i think hes nervous about it and has been ever since the bomb circle guilty again that was my fault too my second murder the one when i think some of the family started to suspect if hes that frightened though i dont know why he doesnt just throw it out but i think hes got his own little superstition about the cordite something about a link with the past or an evil demon we have lurking a symbol for all our family misdeeds waiting perhaps one day to surprise us anyway i have no access to it and have to cart metres of black metal piping back from the town and sweat and labour over it bending it and cutting it and boring it and crimping it and bending it again straining with it in the vice until the bench and shed creak with my efforts i suppose its a craft in some ways and certainly it is quite skilled but i get bored with it sometimes and only thinking of the use ill put those little black torpedoes to keeps me heaving and bending away i tidied everything away and cleaned the shed up after my bombmaking activity then went in for dinner theyre searching for him my father said suddenly in between mouthfuls of cabbage and soya chunks his dark eyes flickered at me like a long sooty flame then he looked down again i drank some of the beer i had opened the new batch of homebrew tasted better than the last lot and stronger eric yes eric theyre looking for him on the moors on the moors they think he might be on the moors yes that would account for them looking for him there indeed my father nodded why are you humming i cleared my throat and kept on eating my burgers pretending i hadnt heard him properly i was thinking he said then spooned some more of the greenbrown mixture into his face and chewed for a long time i waited to hear what he was going to say next he waved his spoon slackly pointing it vaguely upstairs then said how long would you say the flex on the telephone is loose or stretched i said quickly putting down my glass of beer he grunted and said nothing else going back to his plate of food apparently satisfied if not pleased i drank is there anything special youd like me to order from the town he said eventually as he rinsed his mouth with real orange juice i shook my head drank my beer no just the usual i shrugged instant potatoes and beefburgers and sugar and mince pies and cornflakes and junk like that i suppose my father sneered slightly though it was said evenly enough i nodded yes thatll do fine you know my likes you dont eat properly i should have been more strict with you i didnt say anything but kept on eating slowly i could tell that my father was looking at me from the other end of the table swilling his juice round in his glass and staring at my head as i bent over my plate he shook his head and got up from the table taking his plate to the sink to rinse it are you going out tonight he asked turning on the tap no iii stay in tonight go out tomorrow night i hope you wont be getting steaming drunk again youll be arrested some night and then where will we be he looked at me eh i dont go getting steaming drunk i assured him i just have a drink or two to be sociable and thats all well youre very noisy when you come back for somebody whos only been sociable so you are he looked at me darkly again and sat down i shrugged of course i get drunk what the hells the point of drinking if you dont get drunk but im careful i dont want to cause any complications well just you be careful then i always know how much youve had from your farts he snorted as though imitating one my father has a theory about the link between mind and bowel being both crucial and very direct its another of his ideas which he keeps trying to interest people in he has a manuscript on the subject the state of the fart which he also sends away to london to publishers now and again and which they of course send back by return he has variously claimed that from farts he can tell not only what people have eaten or drunk but also the sort of person they are what they ought to eat whether they are emotionally unstable or upset whether they are keeping secrets laughing at you behind your back or trying to ingratiate themselves with you and even what they are thinking about at the precise moment they issue the fart this largely from the sound all total nonsense hm i said noncommittal to a fault oh i can he said as i finished my meal and leaned back wiping my mouth on the back of my hand more to annoy him that anything else he kept nodding i know when youve had heavy or lager and ive smelt guinness off you too i dont drink guinness i lied secretly impressed im afraid of getting athletes throat this witticism was lost on him apparently for without a pause he continued its just money down the drain you know dont expect me to finance your alcoholism oh youre being silly i said and stood up i know what im talking about ive seen better men than you think they could handle the drink and end up in the gutter with a bottle of the fortified wine if that last sally was intended to go below the belt it failed the better men than you line was worked out long ago well its my life isnt it i said and putting my plate in the sink left the kitchen my father said nothing that night i watched television and did some paperwork amending the maps to include the newly named black destroyer hill writing a brief description of what id done to the rabbits and logging both the effects of the bombs that id used and the manufacture of the latest batch i determined to keep the polaroid with the war bag in future for lowrisk punitive expeditions like that against the rabbits it would more than repay the extra weight and the amount of time consumed using it of course for serious devilry the war bag has to go by itself and a camera would just be a liability but i havent had a real threat for a couple of years since the time some big boys in the town took to bullying me in porteneil and ambushing me on the path i thought things were going to get pretty heavy for a while but they never did escalate the way i thought they might i threatened them with my knife once after they stopped me on my bike and started pushing me around and demanding money they backed off that time but a few days later they tried to invade the island i held them off with steelies and stones and they fired back with airguns and for a while it was quite exciting but then mrs clamp came with the weekly messages and threatened to call the police and after calling her a few nasty names they left i started the cache system then building up supplies of steelies stones bolts and lead fishingweights buried in plastic bags and boxes at strategic points around the island i also set up snares and tripwires linked to glass bottles in the grass on the dunes over the creek so that if anybody tried to sneak up they would either catch themselves or snag the wire pulling the bottle out of its hole in the sand and down on to a stone i sat up for the next few nights my head poking out of the back skylight of the loft my ears straining for the tinkle of glass breaking or muffled curses or the more usual signal of the birds being disturbed and taking flight but nothing more happened i just avoided the boys in the town for a while only going in with my father or at times when i knew they would be in school the cache system survives and ive even added a couple of petrol bombs to one or two of the secret stores where a likely avenue of attack comes in over terrain the bottles would smash on but the tripwires ive dismantled and left in the shed my defence manual which contains things like maps of the island with the caches marked likely attack routes a summary of tactics a list of weapons i have or might make includes within this last category quite a few unpleasant things like tripwires and snares set a bodylength away from a concealed broken bottle sticking up in the grass electrically detonated mines made from pipebombs and small nails all buried in the sand and a few interesting if unlikely secret weapons like frisbees with razors embedded in the edge not that i want to kill anybody now but it is all for defence rather than offence and it does make me feel a lot more secure soon ill have enough money for a really powerful crossbow and that im certainly looking forward to itll help make up for the fact that ive never been able to persuade my father to buy a rifle or a shotgun that i could use sometimes i have my catapults and slings and airrifle and they could all be lethal in the right circumstances but they just dont have the longrange hitting power i really hanker after the pipebombs are the same they have to be placed or at best thrown at the target and even slinging some of the purposebuilt smaller ones is inaccurate and slow i can imagine some unpleasant things happening with the sling too the slingbombs have to be on a pretty short fuse if theyre to detonate soon enough after they land not to be throwbackable and ive had a couple of close calls already when theyve gone off just after they left the sling ive experimented with guns of course both mere projectile weapons and mortars which would lob the slingbombs but they have all been clumsy dangerous slow and rather prone to blowing up a shotgun would be ideal though id settle for a rifle but a crossbow will just have to do perhaps sometime ill be able to devise a way round my official nonexistence and apply for a gun myself though even then all things considered i might not be granted a licence oh to be in america i occasionally think i was logging the cache petrol bombs which hadnt been inspected for evaporation recently when the phone went i looked at my watch surprised at the lateness of the hour nearly eleven i ran downstairs to the phone hearing my father coming to the door of his room as i passed it porteneil pips sounded fuck it frank ive got luna maria callouses on me feet how the hell are ye me young bucko i looked at the handset then up at my father who was leaning over the rail from the floor above tucking his pyjama top into his trousers i spoke into the phone hello there jamie what are you doing calling me this late wha oh the old mans there is he eric said tell him hes a bag of effervescent pus from me jamie sends his regards i called up to my father who turned without a word and went back to his room i heard the door close i turned back to the phone eric where are you this time ah shit im not telling you guess well i dont know glasgow ah ha ha ha ha ha eric cackled i clenched plastic how are you are you all right im fine how are you great look how are you eating have you got any money are you hitching lifts or what theyre looking for you you know but there hasnt been anything on the news yet you havent i stopped before i said something he might take exception to im doing fine i eat dogs heh heh heh i groaned oh god youre not really are you what else can i eat its great frankie boy im keeping to the fields and the woods and walking a lot and getting lifts and when i get near a town i look for a good fat juicy dog and i make friends with it and take it out to the woods and then i kill it and eat it what could be simpler i do love the outdoor life you are cooking them arent you of course im fucking cooking them eric said indignantly what do you think i am is that all youre eating no i steal things shoplift its so easy i steal things i cant eat just for the hell of it like tampons and plastic dustbinliners and partysize packets of crisps and one hundred cocktail sticks and twelve cakecandles in various colours and photograph frames and steeringwheel covers in simulated leather and towelholders and fabricsofteners and doubleaction airfresheners to waft away those lingering kitchen smells and cute little boxes for awkward odds and ends and packs of cassettes and lockable petrolcaps and recordcleaners and telephone indexes slimming magazines potholders packs of namelabels artificial eyelashes makeup boxes antismoking mixture toy watches dont you like crisps i broke in quickly eh he sounded confused you mentioned partysize packets of crisps as being something you couldnt eat for christs sake frank could you eat a partysize packet of crisps and how are you keeping i said quickly i mean you must be sleeping rough arent you catching cold or something im not sleeping youre not sleeping of course not you dont have to sleep thats just something they tell you to keep control over you nobody has to sleep youre taught to sleep when youre a kid if youre really determined you can get over it ive got over the need to sleep i never sleep now that way its a lot easier to keep watch and make sure they dont creep up on you and you can keep going as well nothing like keeping going you become like a ship like a ship now i was confused stop repeating everything i say frank i heard him put more money into the box ill teach you how not to sleep when i get back thanks when do you expect to get here sooner or later ha ha ha ha ha look eric why are you eating dogs if you can steal all that stuff ive already told you you idiot you cant eat any of that crap but then why not steal stuff you can eat and dont steal the stuff you cant and dont bother with the dogs i suggested i already knew it wasnt a good idea i could hear the tone of my voice rising higher and higher as i spoke the sentence and that was always a sign i was getting into some sort of verbal mess eric shouted are you crazy whats the matter with you whats the point of that these are dogs arent they it isnt as though i was killing cats or field mice or goldfish or anything im talking about dogs you rabid dingbat dogs you dont have to shout at me i said evenly though starting to get angry myself i was only asking why you waste so much time stealing stuff you cant eat and then waste more time stealing dogs when you could steal and eat at the same time as it were as it were as it were what the hell are you gibbering about eric yelled his strangled voice hoarse and contralto oh dont start screaming i moaned putting my other hand over my forehead and through my hair closing my eyes ill scream if i want to eric screamed what do you think im doing all this for eh what the hell do you think im doing all this for these are dogs you brainless little shitbag havent you any brains left whats happened to all your brains frankie boy cat got your tongue i said cat got your tongue dont start banging the i said not really into the mouthpiece eeeeeeaaarrrggghhh bllleeeaarrrgggrrllleeeooouurrgghh eric spat and choked down the line and there followed the noise of the phonebox handset being smashed around the inside of the booth i sighed and replaced the receiver thoughtfully i just didnt seem to be able to handle eric on the telephone i went back to my room trying to forget about my brother i wanted to get to bed early so that i could be up in time for the naming ceremony of the new catapult id think about a better way to handle eric once i had that out of the way like a ship indeed what a loony the bomb circle often ive thought of myself as a state a country or at the very least a city it used to seem to me that the different ways i felt sometimes about ideas courses of action and so on were like the differing political moods that countries go through it has always seemed to me that people vote in a new government not because they actually agree with their politics but just because they want a change somehow they think that things will be better under the new lot well people are stupid but it all seems to have more to do with mood caprice and atmosphere than carefully thoughtout arguments i can feel the same sort of thing going on in my head sometimes the thoughts and feelings i had didnt really agree with each other so i decided i must be lots of different people inside my brain for example there has always been a part of me which has felt guilty about killing blyth paul and esmerelda that same part feels guilty now about taking revenge on innocent rabbits because of one rogue male but i liken it to an opposition party in a parliament or a critical press acting as a conscience and a brake but not in power and unlikely to assume it another part of me is racist probably because ive hardly met any colored people and all i know of them is what i read in papers and see on television where black people are usually talked of in terms of numbers and presumed guilty until proved innocent this part of me is still quite strong though of course i know there is no logical reason for race hatred whenever i see coloured people in porteneil buying souvenirs or stopping off for a snack i hope that they will ask me something so that i can show how polite i am and prove that my reasoning is stronger than my more crass instincts or training by the same token though there was no need to take revenge on the rabbits there never is even in the big world i think reprisals against people only distantly or circumstantially connected with those who have done others wrong are to make the people doing the avenging feel good like the death penalty you want it because it makes you feel better not because its a deterrent or any nonsense like that at least the rabbits wont know that frank cauldhame did what he did to them the way a community of people knows what the baddies did to them so that the revenge ends up having the opposite effect from that intended inciting rather than squashing resistance at least i admit that its all to boost my ego restore my pride and give me pleasure not to save the country or uphold justice or honour the dead so there were parts of me that watched the naming ceremony for the new catapult with some amusement even contempt in that state inside my head this is like intellectuals in a country sneering at religion while not being able to deny the effect it has on the mass of people in the ceremony i smeared the metal rubber and plastic of the new device with earwax snot blood urine bellybutton fluff and toenail cheese christened it by firing the empty sling at a wingless wasp crawling on the face of the factory and also fired it at my bared foot raising a bruise parts of me thought all this was nonsense but they were in a tiny minority the rest of me knew this sort of thing worked it gave me power it made me part of what i own and where i am it makes me feel good i found a photograph of paul as a baby in one of the albums i kept in the loft and after the ceremony i wrote the name of the new catapult on the back of the picture scrunched it up around a steelie and secured it with a little tape then went down out of the loft and the house into the chill drizzle of a new day i went to the cracked end of the old slipway at the north end of the island i pulled the rubber almost to maximum and sent the ballbearing and photograph hissing and spinning way out to sea i didnt see the splash the catapult ought to be safe so long as nobody knew its name that didnt help the black destroyer certainly but it died because i made a mistake and my power is so strong that when it goes wrong which is seldom but not never even those things i have invested with great protective power become vulnerable again in that headstate i could feel anger that i could have made such a mistake and a determination it wouldnt happen again this was like a general who had lost a battle or some important territory being disciplined or shot well i had done what i could to protect the new catapult and while i was sorry that what had happened at the rabbit grounds had cost me a trusted weapon with many battle honours to its name not to mention a significant sum out of the defence budget i thought that maybe what had happened had been for the best the part of me which made the mistake with the buck letting it get the better of me for a moment might still be around if that acid test hadnt found it out the incompetent or misguided general had been dismissed erics return might call for all my reactions and powers to be at their peak of efficiency it was still very early and although the mist and drizzle should have had me feeling a little mellow i was still in good and confident spirits from the naming ceremony i felt like a run so i left my jacket near the pole id been at the day diggs had come with the news and tucked the catapult tightly between my cords and my belt i tugged my boots to running tension after checking my socks were straight and unruffled then jogged slowly down to the line of hard sand between the seaweed tidelines the drizzle was coming and going and the sun was visible occasionally through the mist and cloud as a red and hazy disc there was a slight wind coming from the north and i turned into it i powered up gradually settling into an easy longpaced stride that got my lungs working properly and readied my legs my arms fists clenched moved with a fluid rhythm sending first one then the other shoulder forward i breathed deeply padding over the sand i came to the braided reaches of the river where it swung out over the sands and adjusted my steps so that i cleared all the channels easily and cleanly a leap at a time once over i put my head down and increased speed my head and fists rammed the air my feet flexed flung gripped and pushed the air whipped at me little gusts of drizzle stinging slightly as i hit them my lungs exploded imploded exploded imploded plumes of wet sand flew from my soles rising as i sped on falling in little curves and spattering back as i raced on into the distance i brought my face up and put my head back baring my neck to the wind like a lover to the rain like an offering my breath rasped in my throat and a slight lightheadedness i had started to feel owing to hyperoxygenating earlier waned as my muscles took up the slack of the extra power in my blood i boosted increasing speed as the jagged line of dead seaweed and old wood and cans and bottles skittered by me i felt like a bead on a thread being pulled through the air on a line sucked along by throat and lungs and legs a continual pounce of flowing energy i kept the boost up as long as i could then when i felt it start to go relaxed and went back to merely running fast for a while i charged across the sands the dunes to my left moving by like stands on a racetrack ahead i could see the bomb circle where i would stop or turn i boosted again head down and shouting to myself inside screaming mentally my voice like a press screwing down tighter to squeeze a final effort from my legs i flew across the sands body tilted crazily forward lungs bursting legs pounding the moment passed and i slowed quickly dropping to a trot as i approached the bomb circle almost staggering into it then flinging myself on to the sand inside to lie panting heaving gasping staring at the grey sky and invisible drizzle spreadeagled in the centre of the rocks my chest rose and fell my heart pounded inside its cage a dull roaring filled my ears and my whole body tingled and buzzed my leg muscles seemed to be in some daze of quivering tension i let my head fall to one side my cheek against the cool damp sand i wondered what it felt like to die the bomb circle my dads leg and his stick his reluctance to get me a motorbike perhaps the candles in the skull the legions of dead mice and hamsters theyre all the fault of agnes my fathers second wife and my mother i cant remember my mother because if i did id hate her as it is i hate her name the idea of her it was she who let the stoves take eric away to belfast away from the island away from what he knew they thought that my father was a bad parent because he dressed eric in girls clothes and let him run wild and my mother let them take him because she didnt like children in general and eric in particular she thought he was bad for her karma in some way probably the same dislike of children led her to desert me immediately after my birth and also caused her only to return on that one fateful occasion when she was at least partly responsible for my little accident all in all i think i have good reason to hate her i lay there in the bomb circle where i killed her other son and i hoped that she was dead too i went back at a slow run glowing with energy and feeling even better than i had at the start of the run i was already looking forward to going out in the evening a few drinks and a chat to jamie my friend and some sweaty earringing music at the arms i did one short sprint just to shake my head as i ran and get some of the sand out of my hair then relaxed to a trot once more the rocks of the bomb circle usually get me thinking and this time was no exception especially considering the way id lain down inside them like some christ or something opened to the sky dreaming of death well paul went about as quickly as you can go i was certainly humane that time blyth had lots of time to realise what was happening jumping about the snake park screaming as the frantic and enraged snake bit his stump repeatedly and little esmerelda must have had some inkling what was going to happen to her as she was slowly blown away my brother paul was five when i killed him i was eight it was over two years after i had subtracted blyth with an adder that i found an opportunity to get rid of paul not that i bore him any personal illwill it was simply that i knew he couldnt stay i knew id never be free of the dog until he was gone eric poor wellmeaning bright but ignorant eric thought i still wasnt and i just couldnt tell him why i knew i was paul and i had gone for a walk along the sand northwards on a calm bright autumn day after a ferocious storm the night before that had ripped slates off the roof of the house torn up one of the trees by the old sheeppen and even snapped one of the cables on the suspension footbridge father got eric to help him with the clearingup and repairs while i took myself and paul out from under their feet i always got on well with paul perhaps because i knew from an early age that he was not long for this world i tried to make his time in it as pleasant as possible and thus ended up treating him far better than most young boys treat their younger brothers we saw that the storm had changed a lot of things as soon as we came to the river that marks the end of the island it had swollen hugely carving immense channels out of the sand great surging brown trenches of water streaming by and tearing lumps from the banks continually and sweeping them away we had to walk right down almost to the sea at its lowtide limit before we could get across we went on me holding paul by the hand no malice in my heart paul was singing to himself and asking questions of the type children tend to such as why werent the birds all blown away during the storm and why didnt the sea fill up with water with the stream going so hard as we walked along the sand in the quietness stopping to look at all the interesting things which had been washed up the beach gradually disappeared where the sand had stretched in an unbroken line of gold towards the horizon now we saw more and more rock exposed the farther up the strand we looked until in the distance the dunes faced a shore of pure stone the storm had swept all the sand away during the night starting just past the river and continuing farther than the places i had names for or had ever seen it was an impressive sight and one that frightened me a little at first just because it was such a huge change and i was worried that it might happen to the island sometime i remembered however that my father had told me of this sort of thing happening in the past and the sands had always returned over the following few weeks and months paul had great fun running and jumping from rock to rock and throwing stones into pools between the rocks rock pools were something of a novelty for him we went farther up the wasted beach still finding interesting pieces of flotsam and finally coming to the rusted remnant i thought was a watertank or a halfburied canoe from a distance it stuck out of a patch of sand jutting at a steep angle about a metre and a half of it exposed paul was trying to catch fish in a pool as i looked at the thing i touched the side of the tapered cylinder wonderingly feeling something very calm and strong about it though i didnt know why then i stepped back and looked again at it its shape became clear and i could then guess roughly how much of it must still be buried under the sand it was a bomb stood on its tail i went back to it carefully stroking it gently and making shushing noises with my mouth it was rustred and black with its rotund decay smelling dank and casting a shellshadow i followed the line of the shadow along the sand over the rocks and found myself looking at little paul splashing happily about in a pool slapping the water with a great flat bit of wood almost as big as he was i smiled called him over see this i said it was a rhetorical question paul nodded big eyes staring this i told him is a bell like the ones in the church in the town the noise we hear on a sunday you know yes just after brekast frank what the noise jus affer sunday brekast frank paul hit me lightly on the knee with a podgy hand i nodded yes thats right bells make that noise theyre great big hollow bits of metal filled up with noises and they let the noises out on sunday mornings after breakfast thats what this is a brekast paul looked up at me with mightily furrowed little brows i shook my head patiently no a bell b is for bell paul said quietly nodding to himself and staring at the rusting device probably remembering an old nurserybook he was a bright child my father intended to send him off to school properly when the time came and had already started him learning the alphabet thats right well this old bell must have fallen off a ship or perhaps it got washed out here in a flood i know what well do ill go up on the dunes and you hit the bell with your bit of wood and well see if i can hear it will we do that would you like that itll be very loud and you might get frightened i stooped down to put my face level with his he shook his head violently and stuck his nose against mine no wont get frigh end he shouted ill he was about to skip past me and hit the bomb with the piece of wood he had already raised it above his head and made the lunge when i reached out and caught him round the waist not yet i said wait until im farther away its an old bell and it might only have one good noise left in it you dont want to waste it do you paul wriggled and the look on his face seemed to indicate that he wouldnt actually mind wasting anything just so long as he got to hit the bell with his plank of wood awright he said and stopped struggling i put him down but can i hit it really really hard as hard as you possibly can when i wave from the top of the dune over there all right can i prakiss practise by hitting the sand can i hit the puddles yes practise hitting the pools of water thats a good idea can i hit this puddle he pointed with the wood at the circular sandpool around the bomb i shook my head no that might make the bell angry he frowned do bells get anry yes they do im going now you hit the bell really hard and ill listen really hard right yes frank you wont hit the bell until i wave will you he shook his head pomiss good wont be long i turned and started to head for the dunes at a slow run my back felt funny i looked round as i went checking there was nobody about there were only a few gulls though wheeling in a sky shot with ragged clouds over my shoulder when i looked back i saw paul he was still by the bomb whacking the sand with his plank using both hands to hold it and bringing it down with all his strength jumping up in the air at the same time and yelling i ran faster over the rocks on to the firm sand over the driftline and on up to the golden sand slower and dry then up to the grass on the nearest dune i scrambled to the top and looked out over the sand and rocks to where paul stood a tiny figure against the reflected brightness of the pools and wet sands overshadowed by the tilted cone of metal beside him i stood up waited until he noticed me took one last look round then waved my hands high over my head and threw myself flat while i was lying there waiting i realised that i hadnt told paul where to hit the bomb nothing happened i lay there feeling my stomach sinking slowly into the sand on the top of the dune i sighed to myself and looked up paul was a distant puppet jerking and leaping and throwing back his arms and whacking the bomb repeatedly on the side i could just hear his lusty yells over the whisper of the grass in the wind shit i said to myself and put my hand under my chin just as paul after a quick glance in my direction started to attack the nose of the bomb he had hit it once and i had taken my hand out from under my chin preparatory to ducking when paul the bomb and its little halopool and everything else for about ten metres around suddenly vanished inside a climbing column of sand and steam and flying rock lit just the once from inside in that blindingly brief first moment by the high explosive detonating the rising tower of debris blossomed and drifted starting to fall as the shockwave pulsed at me from the dune i was vaguely aware of a lot of small sandslips along the drying faces of the nearby dunes the noise rolled over then a twisting crack and bellyrumble of thunder i watched a gradually widening circle of splashes go out from the centre of the explosion as the debris came back to earth the pillar of gas and sand was pulled out by the wind darkening the sand under its shadow and forming a curtain of haze under its base like you see under a heavy cloud sometimes as it starts to get rid of its rain i could see the crater now i ran down i stood about fifty metres away from the still steaming crater i didnt look too closely at any of the bits and pieces lying around squinting at them from the side of my eye wanting and not wanting to see bloody meat or tattered clothing the noise rumbled back uncertainly from the hills beyond the town the edge of the crater was marked with huge splinters of stone torn up from the bedrock under the sands they stood like broken teeth around the scene pointing at the sky or fallen slanted over i watched the distant cloud from the explosion drift away over the firth dispersing then i turned and ran as fast as i could for the house so nowadays i can say it was a german bomb of five hundred kilograms and it was dropped by a crippled he iii trying to get back to its norwegian base after an unsuccessful attack on the flyingboat base farther down the firth i like to think it was the gun in my bunker that hit it and forced the pilot to turn tail and dump his bombs the tips of some of those great splinters of igneous rock still stick above the surface of the longreturned sand and they form the bomb circle poor dead pauls most fitting monument a blasphemous stone circle where the shadows play i was lucky again nobody saw anything and nobody could believe that i had done it i was distracted with grief this time torn by guilt and eric had to look after me while i acted my part to perfection though i say it myself i didnt enjoy deceiving eric but i knew it was necessary i couldnt tell him id done it because he wouldnt have understood why id done it he would have been horrified and very likely never have been my friend again so i had to act the tortured selfblaming child and eric had to comfort me while my father brooded actually i didnt like the way diggs questioned me about what had happened and for a few moments i thought he might have guessed but my replies seemed to satisfy him it didnt help that i had to call my father uncle and eric and paul cousins this was my fathers idea of trying to fool the policeman about my parentage in case diggs did any asking around and discovered that i didnt exist officially my story was that i was the orphaned son of my fathers longlost younger brother and only staying on occasional extended holidays on the island while i was passed from relative to relative and my future was decided anyway i got through this tricky interval and even the sea cooperated for once coming in just after the explosion and sweeping away any telltale tracks i might have left an hour or more before diggs arrived from the village to inspect the scene mrs clamp was at the house when i got back unloading the huge wicker hopper on the front of her ancient bike which lay propped against the kitchen table she was busy stuffing our cupboards the fridge and the freezer with the food and supplies she had brought from the town good morning mrs clamp i said pleasantly as i entered the kitchen she turned to look at me mrs clamp is very old and extremely small she looked me up and down and said oh its you is it and turned back to the wicker hopper on the bike delving into its depths with both hands surfacing with long packages wrapped in newspaper she staggered over to the freezer climbed on to a small stool by its side unwrapped the packages to reveal frozen packs of my beefburgers and placed them in the freezer leaning over it until she was almost inside it struck me how easy it would be to i shook my head clear of the silly thought i sat down at the kitchen table to watch mrs clamp work how are you keeping these days mrs clamp i asked oh im well enough mrs clamp said shaking her head and coming down off the stool picking up some more frozen burgers and going back to the freezer i wondered if she might ever get frostbite i was sure i could see little crystals of ice glinting on her faint moustache my thats a big load youve brought for us today im surprised you didnt fall over on the way here you wont catch me falling over no mrs clamp shook her head once more went to the sink reached up and over while on her tiptoes turned on the hot water rinsed her hands wiped them on her bluecheck brinylon workcoat and took some cheese from the bike can i make you a cup of something mrs clamp not for me mrs clamp said shaking her head inside the fridge slightly below the height of the icemaking compartment oh well i wont then i watched her wash her hands one more time while she started sorting out the lettuce from the spinach i took my leave and went up to my room we ate our usual saturday lunch fish with potatoes from the garden mrs clamp was at the other end of the table from my father instead of me as is traditional i sat halfway down the table with my back to the sink arranging fish bones in meaningful patterns on the plate while father and mrs clamp exchanged very formal almost ritualised pleasantries i made a tiny human skeleton with the bones of the dead fish and distributed a little ketchup about it to make it more realistic more tea mr cauldhame mrs clamp said no thank you mrs clamp my father replied francis mrs clamp asked me no thank you i said a pea would do for a rather green skull for the skeleton i placed it there father and mrs clamp droned on about this and that i hear the constable was down the other day if you dont mind me saying so mrs clamp said and coughed politely indeed my father said and shovelled so much food into his mouth he wouldnt be able to speak for another minute or so mrs clamp nodded at her muchsalted fish and sipped her tea i hummed and my father glared at me over jaws like heaving wrestlers nothing more was said on the subject saturday night at the cauldhame arms and there i stood as usual at the back of the packed smokefilled room at the rear of the hotel a plastic pint glass in my hand full of lager my legs braced slightly on the floor in front of me my back against a wallpapered pillar and jamie the dwarf sitting on my shoulders resting his pint of heavy on my head now and again and engaging me in conversation what you been doin then frankie not a lot i killed a few rabbits the other day and i keep getting weird phone calls from eric but thats about all what about you nothin much how come erics calling you didnt you know i said looking up at him he leaned over and looked down at me faces look funny upside down oh hes escaped escaped sh if people dont know theres no need to tell them yeah he got out hes called the house a couple of times and he says hes coming this way diggs came and told us the day he broke out christ are they looking for him so angus says hasnt there been anything on the news i thought you might have heard something nup jeez do you think theyll tell people in the town if they dont catch him dont know i would have shrugged what if hes still into setting dogs on fire shit and those worms he used to try to get kids to eat the localsll go crazy i could feel him shaking his head i think theyre keeping it quiet probably they think they can catch him do you think theyll catch him ho i couldnt say he might be crazy but hes clever he wouldnt have got out in the first place if he hadnt been and when he calls up he sounds sharp sharp but bonkers you dont seem all that worried i hope he makes it id like to see him again and id like to see him get all the way back here because just because i took a drink shit i hope he doesnt cause any aggro he might thats all im worried about he sounds like he might still not like dogs an awful lot i think the kids are safe though all the same hows he travelling has he told you how hes intendin to get here has he any money he must have some to be making the phone calls but hes stealing things mostly god well at least you cant lose remission for escaping from a loony bin ay i said the band came on then a group of four punks from inverness called the vomits the lead singer had a mohican haircut and lots of chains and zips he grabbed the microphone while the other three started thrashing their respective instruments and screamed ma gurlfrens leff me an ah feel like a bumbr ah loss ma job an when ah wank ah cant cum i nestled my shoulders against the pillar a little more firmly and sipped from my glass as jamies feet beat against my chest and the howling crashing music thundered through the sweaty room this sounded like it would be fun during the interval while one of the barmen was taking a mop and bucket to the front of the stage where everybody had been spitting i went up to the bar to get some more drinks the usual said duncan behind the bar jamie nodded and hows frank duncan asked pulling a lager and a heavy ok and yourself i said getting along getting along you still wanting bottles no thanks ive got enough for my homebrew now well still see you in here though will we oh yes i said duncan reached up to hand jamie his pint and i took mine putting the money down at the same time cheers lads duncan said as we turned and went back to the pillar a few pints later when the vomits were doing their first encore jamie and i were up dancing jumping up and down j amie shouting and clapping his hands and dancing about on my shoulders i dont mind dancing with girls when its for jamie though one time with one tall lassie he wanted us both to go outside so he could kiss her the thought of her tits pressed up against my face nearly made me throw up and i had to disappoint him anyway most of the punk girls dont smell of perfume and only a few wear skirts and even then theyre usually leather ones jamie and i got pushed about a bit and nearly fell down a couple of times but we survived through to the end of the night without any scrapes unfortunately jamie ended up talking to some woman but i was too busy trying to breathe deeply and keep the far wall steady really to care yeah im going to get a bike soon twofifty of course jamie was saying i was halflistening he was not going to get a bike because he wouldnt be able to reach the pedals but i wouldnt have said anything even if i could have because nobody expects people to tell the truth to women and besides thats what friends are for as they say the girl when i could see her properly was a roughlooking twenty and had as many coats of paint over her eyes as a roller gets on its doors she smoked a horrible french cigarette ma mates got a bike sue its a suzuki gt her brother used tae have but shes saving up fur a gold wing they were putting the chairs up on the tables and wiping up the mess and the cracked glasses and limp crispbags and i still wasnt feeling too good the girl sounded worse the more i listened to her her accent sounded horrible west coast somewhere glasgow i shouldnt wonder naw i wouldnt have one of those too heavy a five hundred would do me i really fancy a moto guzzi but im not sure about shaft drive christ i was about to do the technicolor yawn all over this girls jacket through the tears and rusting her zips and filling her pockets and probably send jamie flying across the room into the beercrates under the speaker stacks with the first awful heave and here were these two trading absurd biker fantasies want a fag the girl said shoving a packet up past my nose towards jamie i was seeing trails and lights from the blue packets passing even after she brought it back down jamie must have taken a cigarette even though i knew he didnt smoke because i saw the lighter go up igniting in front of my eyes in a shower of sparks like a fireworks display i could almost feel my occipital lobe fusing i thought of making some smart remark to jamie about stunting his growth but all lines to and from my brain seemed to be jammed with urgent messages coming from my guts i could feel an awful churning going on down there and i was sure it would only end one way but i couldnt move i was stuck there like a flying buttress between the floor and the pillar and jamie was still gibbering away to the girl about the sound a triumph makes and the highspeed runs shed done up the side of loch lomond at night you on holiday like aye me an ma mates ahve got a boyfriend but hes oot on the rigs aw aye i was still breathing hard trying to clear my head with oxygen i didnt understand jamie he was half the size i was half the weight or less and no matter how much we drank together he never seemed to be affected he certainly wasnt dumping his pints on the floor on the sly id have got wet if he was i realised that the girl had finally noticed me she poked my shoulder for what i gradually comprehended wasnt the first time hey she said what i struggled you all right aye i nodded slowly hoping to content her with this then looked away and up to one side as though i had just found something very interesting and important to look at on the ceiling jamie nudged fie with his feet what i said again not trying to look at him you staying here all night what i said no how are you ready right i put my hands behind me to find the pillar found it and pushed myself up hoping my feet wouldnt slip on the beerwet floor maybe youd better let me down frank lad jamie said nudging me hard i looked sort of up and to the side again as though at him then nodded i let my back slide down the pillar until i was virtually squatting on the floor the girl helped jamie jump down his red hair and her blonde looked suddenly garish from that angle in the now brightly lit room duncan was coming closer with the brush and a big bucket emptying ashtrays and mopping things i struggled to get up then felt jamie and the girl take me one under each arm and help me i was starting to get triple vision and wondering how you did that with only two eyes i wasnt sure if they were talking to me or not i said aye just in case they were then felt myself being led out into the fresh air through the fire exit i needed to go to the toilet and with every step i took there seemed to be more convulsions from my guts i had this horrible vision of my body being made up almost completely of two equalsized compartments one holding piss and the other undigested beer whisky crisps dryroasted peanuts spit snot bile and one or two bits of fish and potatoes some sick part of my mind suddenly thought of fried eggs lying thick with grease on a plate surrounded with bacon curled and scooped and holding little pools of fat the outsides of the plate dotted with coagulated lumps of grease i fought down the ghastly urge coming up from my stomach i tried to think of nice things then when i couldnt think of any i determined to concentrate on what was happening around me we were outside the arms walking along the pavement past the bank jamie on one side of me and the girl on the other it was a cloudy night and cool and the streetlights were sodium we left the smell of the pub behind and i tried to get some of the fresh air through my head i was aware i was staggering slightly lurching sporadically into jamie or the girl but there wasnt a great deal i could do about it i felt rather like one of those ancient dinosaurs so huge that they had a virtually separate brain to control their back legs i seemed to have a separate brain for each limb but theyd all broken off diplomatic relations i swayed and stumbled along as best i could trusting to luck and the two people with me frankly i didnt have much faith in either jamie being too small to stop me if i really started to topple and the girl being a girl probably too weak and even if she wasnt i expected she would just let me crack my skull on the pavement because women like to see men helpless you tae alwiz like rat the girl said like what jamie said without i thought the correct amount of preemptive indignation you up on his showders oh no thats just so i can see the band better thank christ fur at ah thought maybe ye went tae ra bog like rat oh aye we go into a cubicle and frank goes in the bowl while i do it into the cistern yur kiddin aye jamie said in a voice distorted by a grin i was walking along as best i could listening to all this garbage i was slightly annoyed at jamie saying anything even jokingly about me going to the toilet he knows how sensitive i am about it only once or twice has he taunted me with what sounds like the interesting sport of going into the gents in the cauldhame arms or anywhere else i suppose and attacking the drowned fagends in the urinals with a stream of piss i admit i have watched jamie doing this and been quite impressed the cauldhame arms has excellent facilities for the sport having a great long gutterlike urinal extending right along one wall and halfway down another with only one drainhole according to jamie the object of the game is to get a soggy fagend from wherever it is in the channel along to and down the coverless hole breaking it up as much as possible en route you can score points for the number of ceramic divisions you can move the butt over with extra for actually getting it down the hole and extra for doing it from the far end of the gutter from the hole for the amount of destruction caused apparently its very hard to get the little black cone at the bummed end to disintegrate and over the course of the evening the number of fagends so dispatched the game can be played in a more limited form in the little bowltype individual urinals which are more fashionable these days but jamie has never tried this himself being so short that if he is to use one of those he has to stand about a metre back from it and lob his waste water in anyway it sounds like something to make long pisses much more interesting but it is not for me thanks to cruel fate is he yur bruthur or sumhin naw hes ma friend zay olwiz get like iss ay usually on a saturday night this is a monstrous lie of course i am rarely so drunk that i cant talk or walk straight id have told jamie as much too if id been able to talk and hadnt been concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other i wasnt so sure i was going to throw up now but that same irresponsible destructive part of my brain just a few neurons probably but i suppose there are a few in every brain and it only takes a very small hooligan element to give the rest a bad name kept thinking about those fried eggs and bacon on the cold plate and each time i almost heaved it took an act of will to think of cool winds on hilltops or the pattern of watershadows over wavecarved sand things which i have always thought epitomise clarity and freshness and helped to divert my brain from dwelling on the contents of my stomach however i did need to have a piss even more desparately than before jamie and the girl were inches away from me holding me by an arm each being bumped into frequently but my drunkenness had now got to such a state as the last two quickly consumed pints and an accompanying whisky caught up with my racing bloodstream that i might as well have been on another planet for all the hope i had of making them understand what i wanted they walked on either side of me alld talked to each other jabbering utter nonsense as though it was all so important and i with more brains than the two of them put together and information of the most vital nature couldnt get a word out there had to be a way i tried to shake my head clear and take some more deep breaths i steadied my pace i thought very carefully about words and how you made them i checked my tongue and tested my throat i had to pull myself together i had to communicate i looked round as we crossed a road i saw the sign for union street where it was fixed to a low wall i turned to jamie and then the girl cleared my throat and said quite clearly i didnt know if you two ever shared or indeed still do share for that matter for all that i know at least mutually between yourselves but at any rate not including me the misconception i once perchanced to place upon the words contained upon yonder sign but it is a fact that i thought the union referred to in said nomenclature delineated an association of working people and it did seem to me at the time to be quite a socialist thing for the town fathers to call a street it struck me that all was not yet lost as regards the prospects for a possible peace or at the very least a ceasefire in the class war if such acknowledgements of the worth of trade unions could find their way on to such a venerable and important thoroughfares sign but i must admit i was disabused of this sadly overoptimistic notion when my father god rest his sense of humour informed me that it was the then recently confirmed union of the english and scottish parliaments the local worthies in common with hundreds of other town councils throughout what had until that point been an independent realm were celebrating with such solemnity and permanence doubtless with a view to the opportunities for profit which this early form of takeover bid offered the girl looked at jamie dud he say sumhin er i thought he was just clearing his throat said jamie ah thought he said sumhin aboot bananas bananas jamie said incredulously looking at the girl naw she said looking at me and shaking her head right enough so much for communication i thought obviously both so drunk they didnt even understand correctly spoken english i sighed heavily as i looked first at one and then at the other while we made our slow way down the main street past woolworth and the traffic lights i looked ahead and tried to think what on earth i was going to do they helped me over the next road me nearly tripping as i crossed the far kerb suddenly i was very aware of the vulnerability of my nose and front teeth should they happen to come into contact with the granite of porteniels pavements at any velocity above quite a small fraction of a metre per second aye me and one of my mates have been going round the forestry commission tracks up in the hills goin round at fifty skiddin all over the place like a speedway zaafac my god they were still talking about bikes whereur we takin hum ownyway ma mums if shes still up shell make us some tea yer maws aye aw it came to me in a flash it was so obvious i couldnt imagine why i hadnt seen it before i knew there was no time to lose and no point in hesitating i was going to explode soon so i put my head down and broke free from jamie and the girl running off down the street id escape do an eric so i could find somewhere nice and quiet for a piss frank aw fur fucks sek gies a brek whits ay up tae noo the pavement was still below my feet which were moving more or less as they were supposed to i could hear jamie and the girl running after me shouting but i was already past the old chip shop and the war memorial and picking up speed my distended bladder wasnt helping matters but it wasnt holding me back as much as id feared either frank come back frank stop whats wrong frank ya crazy bastard youll break your neck aw lem gaw zafiez hied no hes my friend frank i turned the corner into bank street pounded down it just missing two lampposts took a sharp left into adam smith street and came to mcgarvies garage i skidded into the forecourt and ran behind a pump gasping and belching and feeling my head pound i dropped my cords and squatted down leaning back against the fivestar pump and breathing heavily as the pool of steaming piss collected on the barkrough concrete of the fuel apron footsteps clattered and a shadow came from the right of me i looked round to see jamie haw ha ha he gasped putting one hand on another pump to steady himself as he bent over a little and looked at his feet the other hand on a knee his chest heaving here ha here ha here you ha are fffwwaaw he sat down on the plinth supporting the pumps and stared at the dark glass of the office for a while i sat too slumped against the pump letting the last drops fall free i stumbled back and sat down heavily on the plinth then staggered upright and pulled my cords back up what did you do that for jamie said still panting i waved at him struggling to do my belt up i was starting to feel sick again getting magnified wafts of pub smoke off my clothes saw i started to say sorry then the word turned into a heave that antisocial part of my brain suddenly thought about the greasy eggs and bacon again and my stomach geysered i doubled up retching and heaving feeling my guts contract like a balling fist inside me involuntary alive like a woman must feel with a kicking child my throat was rasped with the force of the jet jamie caught me as i almost fell over i stood there like a halfopened penknife splattering the forecourt noisily jamie shoved one hand down the back of my cords to keep me from falling on my face and put the other hand on to my forehead murmuring something i went on being sick my stomach starting to hurt badly now my eyes were full of tears my nose was running and my whole head felt like a ripe tomato ready to burst i fought for breath between heaves snatching down flecks of vomit and coughing and spewing at the same time i listened to myself make a horrible noise like eric going crazy over the phone and hoped that nobody was passing and could see me in such an undignified and weak position i stopped felt better then started again and felt ten times worse i moved to one side with jamie helping me and went down on my hands and knees on a comparatively clean part of the concrete where the oil stains looked old i coughed and spluttered and gagged a few times then fell back into jamies arms bringing my legs up to my chin to ease the ache in my stomach muscles better now jamie said i nodded i tipped forward so that i rested on both buttocks and heels my head between my knees jamie patted me just a minute frankie lad i felt him go off for a few seconds he came back with some coarse paper towels from the forecourt dispenser and wiped my mouth with one bit and the rest of my face with another bit he even took them and put them in the litterbin though i still felt drunk my stomach ached and my throat felt like a couple of hedgehogs had had a fight in it i did feel a lot better thanks i managed and started trying to stand jamie helped me to my feet by god what a state to get yourself in frank aye i said wiping my eyes with my sleeve and looking round to see that we were still alone i clapped jamie on the shoulder a couple of times and we made for the street we walked up the deserted street with me breathing deeply and jamie holding me by one elbow the girl had gone obviously enough but i wasnt sorry whyd you run off like that i shook my head needed to go what jamie laughed why didnt you just say couldnt just cause there was a girl there no i said and coughed couldnt speak too drunk what laughed jamie i nodded yeah i said he laughed again and shook his head we kept on walking jamies mother was still up and she made us some tea shes a big woman whos always in a green housecoat when i see her in the evenings after the pub when as often happens her son and i end up at her house shes not too unpleasant even if she does pretend to like me more than i know she really does och laddie youre not looking your best here sit down and ill get some tea on the go ach you wee lamb i was planted in a chair in the livingroom of the council house while jamie hung up our jackets i could hear him jumping in the hall thank you i croaked throat dry there you are pet now do you want me to turn on the fire for you are you too cold i shook my head and she smiled and nodded and patted me on the shoulder and padded off to the kitchen jamie came in and sat on the couch next to my chair he looked at me and grinned and shook his head what a state what a state he clapped his hands and rocked forward on the couch his feet sticking out straight in front of him i rolled my eyes and looked away never mind frankie lad a couple of cups of tea and youll be fine huh i managed and shivered i left about one oclock in the morning more sober and awash with tea my stomach and throat were almost back to normal though my voice still sounded harsh i bade jamie and his mother goodnight and walked on through the outskirts of town to the track heading for the island then down the track in blackness sometimes using my small torch towards the bridge and the house it was a quiet walk through the marsh and dune land and the patchy pasture apart from the few noises i made on the path all i could hear was the very occasional and distant roar of heavy trucks on the road through town the clouds covered most of the sky and there was little light from the moon and none ahead of me at all i remembered once in the middle of summer two years ago when i was coming down the path in the late dusk after a days walking in the hills beyond the town i saw in the gathering night strange lights shifting in the air over and far beyond the island they wavered and moved uncannily glinting and shifting and burning in a heavy solid way no thing should in the air i stood and watched them for a while training my binoculars on them and seeming now and again in the shifting images of light to discern structures around them a chill passed through me then and my mind raced to reason out what i was seeing i glanced quickly about in the gloom and then back to those distant utterly silent towers of flickering flame they hung there in the sky like faces of fire looking down on the island like something waiting then it came to me and i knew a mirage a reflection of layers on air out to sea i was watching the gasflares of oilrigs maybe hundreds of kilometres away out in the north sea looking again at those dim shapes around the flame they did appear to be rigs vaguely made out in their own gassy glare i went on my way happy after that indeed happier than i had been before i had seen the strange apparitions and it occurred to me that somebody both less logical and less imaginative would have jumped to the conclusion that what they had seen were ufos i got to the island eventually the house was dark i stood looking at it in the darkness just aware of its bulk in the feeble light of a broken moon and i thought it looked even bigger than it really was like a stonegiants head a huge moonlit skull full of shapes and memories staring out to sea and attached to a vast powerful body buried in the rock and sand beneath ready to shrug itself free and disinter itself on some unknowable command or cue the house stared out to sea out to the night and i went into it a bunch of flowers i killed little esmerelda because i felt lowed it to myself and to the world in general i had after all accounted for two male children and thus done womankind something of a statistical favour if i really had the courage of my convictions i reasoned i ought to redress the balance at least slightly my cousin was simply the easiest and most obvious target again i bore her no personal illwill children arent real people in the sense that they are not small males and females but a separate species which will probably grow into one or the other in due time younger children in particular before the insidious and evil influence of society and their parents have properly got to them are sexlessly open and hence perfectly likeable i did like esmerelda even if i thought her name was a bit soppy and played with her a lot when she came to stay she was the daughter of harmsworth and morag stove my halfuncle and halfaunt by my fathers first marriage they were the couple who had looked after eric between the ages of three and five they would come over from belfast to stay with us in the summers sometimes my father used to get on well with harmsworth and because i looked after esmerelda they could have a nice relaxing holiday here i think mrs stove was a little worried about trusting her daughter to me that particular summer as it was the one after id struck young paul down in his prime but at nine years of age i was an obviously happy and welladjusted child responsible and wellspoken and when it was mentioned demonstrably sad about my younger brothers demise i am convinced that only my genuinely clear conscience let me convince the adults around me that i was totally innocent i even carried out a doublebluff of appearing slightly guilty for the wrong reasons so that adults told me i shouldnt blame myself because i hadnt been able to warn paul in time i was brilliant i had decided i would try to murder esmerelda before she and her parents even arrived for their holiday eric was away on a school cruise so there would only be me and her it would be risky so soon after pauls death but i had to do something to even up the balance i could feel it in my guts in my bones i had to it was like an itch something i had no way of resisting like when i walk along a pavement in porteneil and i accidentally scuff one heel on a paving stone i have to scuff the other foot as well with as near as possible the same weight to feel good again the same if i brush one arm against a wall or a lamppost i must brush the other one as well soon or at the very least scratch it with the other hand in a whole range of ways like that i try to keep balanced though i have no idea why it is simply something that must be done and in the same way i had to get rid of some woman tip the scales back in the other direction i had taken to making kites that year it was i i suppose i used many things to make them cane and dowling and metal coat hangers and aluminium tentpoles and paper and plastic sheeting and dustbin bags and sheets and string and nylon rope and twine and all sorts of little straps and buckles and bits of cord and elastic bands and strips of wire and pins and screws and nails and pieces cannibalised from model yachts and various toys i made a hand winch with a double handle and a ratchet and room for half a kilometre of twine on the drum i made different types of tails for the kites that needed them and dozens of kites large and small some stunters i kept them in the shed and eventually had to put the bikes outside under a tarpaulin when the collection got too large that summer i took esmerelda kiting quite a lot i let her play with a small singlestring kite while i used a stunter i would send it swooping over and under hers or dive it down to the sands while i stood on a dune cliff pulling the kite down to nick tall towers of sand id built then pulling up again the kite trailing a spray of sand through the air from the collapsing tower although it took a while and i crashed a couple of times once i even knocked a dam down with a kite i swooped it so that on each pass it caught the top of the dam wall with one corner gradually producing a nick in the sand barrier which the water was able to flow through quickly going on to overwhelm the whole dam and the sandhouse village beneath then one day i was standing there on a dune top straining against the pull of the wind in the kite gripping and hauling and sensing and adjusting and twisting when one of those twists became like a strangle around esmereldas neck and the idea was there use the kites i thought about it calmly still standing there as though nothing had passed through my mind but the continual computation guiding the kite and i thought it seemed reasonable as i thought about it the notion took its own shape blossoming as it were and escalating into what i finally conceived as my cousins nemesis i grinned then i recall and brought the stunter down fast and acute across the weeds and the water the sand and the surf scudding it in across the wind to jerk and zoom just before it hit the girl herself where she sat on the dune top holding and spasmodically jerking the string she held in her hand connected to the sky she turned smiled and shrieked then squinting in the summer light i laughed too controlling the thing in the skies above and the thing in the brain beneath equally well i built a big kite it was so big it didnt even fit inside the shed i made it from old aluminium tentpoles some of which i had found in the attic a long time previously and some i had got from the town dump the fabric at first was black plastic bags but later became tent fabric also from the attic i used heavy orange nylon fishingline for the string wound round a specially made drum for the winch which i had strengthed and fitted with a chestbrace the kite had a tail of twisted magazinepages guns and ammo which i got regularly at the time i painted the head of a dog on the canvas in red paint because i had yet to learn i was not a canis my father had told me years before that i was born under the starsign of the dog because sirius was overhead at the time anyway that was just a symbol i went out very early one morning just after the sun came up and long before anybody else woke i went to the shed got the kite walked a way along the dunes and assembled it battered a tentpeg into the ground tied the nylon to it then flew the kite on a short string for a while i sweated and strained with it even in quite a light wind and my hands grew warm despite the heavyduty weldinggloves i had on i decided the kite would do and brought it in that afternoon while the same wind now freshened still blew across the island and off into the north sea esmerelda and i went out as usual and stopped off at the shed to pick up the dismantled kite she helped me carry it far along the dunes dutifully clutching the lines and winch to her flat little chest and clicking the ratchet on the drum until we reached a point well out of sight from the house it was a tall dune head stuck nodding towards distant n orway or denmark grass like hair swept over the brow and pointing esmerelda searched for flowers while i constructed the kite with an appropriately solemn slowness she talked to the flowers i recall as though trying to persuade them to show themselves and be collected broken and bunched the wind blew her blonde hair in front of her face as she walked squatted crawled and talked and i assembled finally the kite was finished fully made up and lying like a collapsed tent on the grass green on green the wind coursed over it and flapped it little whip noises that stirred it and made it seem alive the dogface scowling i sorted the orange nylon lines out and did some tying untangling line from line knot from knot i called esmerelda over she had a fistful of tiny flowers and made me wait patiently while she described them all making up her own names when she forgot or had never learned the real ones i accepted the daisy she gave me graciously and put it in the buttonhole of my jackets left breast pocket i told her that i had finished constructing the new kite and that she could help me test it in the wind she was excited wanting to hold the strings i told her she might get a chance though of course i would have the ultimate control she wanted to hold the flowers as well and i told her that might just be possible esmerlda oohd and ahd over the size of the kite and the fierce doggy painted on it the kite lay on the windruffled grass like an impatient manta rippling i found the main control lines and gave them to esmerelda showing her how to hold them and where i had made loops to go over her wrists i told her so that she wouldnt lose her grip she struck her hands through the braided nylon holding one line tight and grasping the posy of bright flowers and the second line with her other hand i got my part of the control lines together and carried them in a loop round to the kite esmerelda jumped up and down and told me to hurry up and make the kite fly i took a last look round then only had to kick the top edge of the kite up a little for it to take the wind and lift i ran back behind my cousin while the slack between her and the rapidly ascending kite was taken up the kite blew into the sky like something wild hoisting its tail with a noise like tearing cardboard it shook itself and cracked in the air it sliced its tail and flexed its hollow bones i came up behind esmerelda and held the lines just behind her little freckled elbows waiting for the tug the lines came taut and it came i had to dig my heels in to stay steady i bumped into esmerelda and made her squeal she had let the lines go when the first brutal snap had straightened the nylon and stood glancing back at me and staring up into the sky as i fought to control the power in the skies above us she still clutched the flowers and my tuggings on the lines moved her arms like a marionette guided by the loops the winch rested against my chest a little slack between it and my hands esmerelda looked round one last time at me giggling and i laughed back then i let the lines go the winch hit her in the small of the back and she yelped then she was dragged off her feet as the lines pulled her and the loops tightened round her wrists i staggered back partly to make it look good on the off chance there was somebody watching and partly because letting go of the winch had put me off balance i fell to the ground as esmerelda left it forever the kite just kept snapping and flapping and flapping and snapping and it hauled the girl off the earth and into the air winch and all i lay on my back and watched it for a second then got up and ran after her as fast as i could again just because i knew i couldnt catch her she was screaming and waggling her legs for all she was worth but the cruel loops of nylon had her about the wrists the kite was in the jaws of the wind and she was already well out of reach even if i had wanted to catch her i ran and ran jumping off a dune and rolling down its seaward face watching the tiny struggling figure being hoisted farther and farther into the sky as the kite swept her away i could just barely hear her yells and shouts a thin wailing carried on the wind she sailed over the sands and the rocks and out towards the sea me running exhilarated underneath watching the stuck winch bob under her kicking feet her dress billowed out around her she went higher and higher and i kept running outpaced now by the wind and the kite i ran through the ripplepuddles at the margins of the sea then into it up to my knees just then something at first seemingly solid then separating and dissociating fell from her at first i though she had pissed herself then i saw flowers tumble out of the sky and hit the water ahead of me like some strange rain i waded out over the shallows until i came to them and gathered the ones i could looking up from my harvest as esmerelda and kite struck out for the north sea it did cross my mind that she might actually get across the damn thing and hit land before the wind dropped but i reckoned that even if that happened i had done my best and honour was satisfied i watched her get smaller and smaller then turned and headed for shore i knew that three deaths in my immediate vicinity within four years had to look suspicious and i had already planned my reaction carefully i didnt run straight home to the house but went back up into the dunes and sat down there holding the flowers i sang songs to myself made up stories got hungry rolled around in the sand a bit rubbed a little of it into my eyes and generally tried to psyche myself up into something that might look like a terrible state for a wee boy to be in i was still sitting there in the early evening staring out to sea when a young forestry worker from the town found me he was one of the search party drummed up by diggs after my father and relations missed us and couldnt find us and called the police the young man came over the tops of the dunes whistling and casually whacking clumps of reed and grass with a stick i didnt take any notice of him i kept staring and shivering and clutching the flowers my father and diggs came along after the young man passed word along the line of people beating their way along the dunes but i didnt take any notice of those two either eventually there were dozens of people clustered around me looking at me asking me questions scratching their heads looking at their watches and gazing about i didnt take any notice of them they formed their line again and started searching for esmerelda while i was carried back to the house they offered me soup i was desperate for but took no notice of asked me questions i answered with a catatonic silence and a stare my uncle and aunt shook me their faces red and eyes wet but i took no notice of them eventually my father took me to my room undressed me and put me to bed somebody stayed in my room all night and whether it was my father diggs or anybody else i kept them and me awake all night by lying quiet for a while feigning sleep then screaming with all my might and falling out of bed to thrash about on the floor each time i was picked up cuddled and put back to bed each time i pretended to go to sleep again and went crazy after a few minutes if any of them talked to me i just lay shaking in the bed staring at them soundless and deaf i kept that up until dawn when the search party returned esmereldaless then i let myself go to sleep it took me a week to recover and it was one of the best weeks of my life eric came back from his school cruise and i started to talk a little after he arrived just nonsense at first then later disjointed hints at what had happened always followed by screaming and catatonia sometime around the middle of the week dr maclennan was allowed to see me for a while after diggs overruled my fathers refusal to have me medically inspected by anybody else but him even so he stayed in the room glowering and suspicious making sure that the examination was kept within certain limits i was glad he didnt let the doctor look all over me and i responded by becoming a little more lucid by the end of the week i was still having the occasional fake nightmare i would suddenly go very quiet and shivery every now and again but i was eating more or less normally and could answer most questions quite happily talking about esmerelda and what had happened to her still brought on minifits and screams and total withdrawal for a while but after long and patient questioning by my father and diggs i let them know what i wanted them to think had happened a big kite esmerelda becoming entangled in the lines me trying to help her and the winch slipping out of my fingers desperate running then a blank i explained that i was afraid i was jinxed that i brought death and destruction upon all those near me and also that i was afraid i might get sent to prison because people would think i had murdered esmerelda i wept and i hugged my father and i even hugged diggs smelling his hardblue uniform fabric as i did so and almost feeling him melt and believe me i asked him to go to the shed and take all my kites away and burn them which he duly did in a hollow now called kite pyre dell i was sorry about the kites and i knew that id have to give up flying them for good to keep the act looking realistic but it was worth it esmerelda never did show up nobody saw her after me as far as diggs enquiries of trawlers and drillingrigs and so on could show so i got to even up the score and have a wonderful if demanding week of fun acting the flowers that i had still been clutching when they carried me back to the house had been prised from my fingers and left in a plastic bag on top of the fridge i discovered them there shrivelled and dead forgotten and unnoticed two weeks later i took them for the shrine in the loft one night and have them to this day little brown twists of dried plant like old sellotape stuck in a little glass bottle i wonder sometimes where my cousin ended up at the bottom of the sea or washed on to some craggy and deserted shore or blown on to a high mountain face to be eaten by gulls or eagles i would like to think that she died still being floated by the giant kite that she went round the world and rose higher as she died of starvation and dehydration and so grew less weighty still to become eventually a tiny skeleton riding the jetstreams of the planet a sort of flying dutchwoman but i doubt that such a romantic vision really matches the truth i spent most of sunday in bed after my binge of the previous night i wanted rest lots of liquid little food and my hangover to go away i felt like deciding then and there never to get drunk again but being so young i decided that this was probably a little unrealistic so i determined not to get that drunk again my father came and banged at my door when i didnt appear for breakfast and whats wrong with you as if i need ask nothing i croaked at the door thatll be right my father said sarcastically and how much did you have to drink last night not much hnnh he said iii be down soon i said and rocked to and fro in the bed to make noises which might make it sound as though i was getting up was that you on the phone last night what i asked the door stopping my rocking it was wasnt it i thought it was you you were trying to disguise your voice what were you doing ringing at that time aah i dont remember ringing dad honest i said carefully hnnh youre a fool boy he said and clumped off down the hall i lay there thinking i was quite sure i hadnt called the house the previous night i had been with jamie in the pub then with him and the girl outside then alone when i was running and then with jamie and later him and his mother then i walked home almost sober there were no blank spots i assumed it must have been eric calling from the sound of it my father couldnt have spoken to him for very long or he would have recognised his sons voice i lay back in my bed hoping that eric was still at large and heading this way and also that my head and guts would stop reminding me how uncomfortable they could feel look at you my father said when i eventually came down in my dressinggown to watch an old movie on the television that afternoon i hope youre proud of yourself i hope you think feeling like that makes you a man my father tutted and shook his head then went back to reading the scientific american i sat down carefully in one of the lounges big easy chairs i did get a bit drunk last night dad i admit it im sorry if it upsets you but i assure you im suffering for it well i hope that teaches you a lesson do you realise how many brain cells you probably managed to kill off last night a good few thousand i said after a brief pause for calculation my father nodded enthusiastically at least well ill try not to do it again hnnh brrap said my anus loudly surprising me as well as my father he put the magazine down and stared into space over my head smiling wisely as i cleared my throat and flapped the hem of my dressinggown as unobtrusively as i could i could see his nostrils flex and quiver lager and whisky eh he said nodding to himself and taking up his magazine again i felt myself blush and i gritted my teeth glad he had retreated behind the glossy pages how did he do that i pretended nothing had happened oh by the way i said i hope you dont mind but i told jamie that eric had escaped my father glared over the magazine shook his head and continued reading idiot he said in the evening after a snack rather than a meal i went up to the loft and used the telescope to take a distant look at the island making sure that nothing had happened to it while i rested inside the house everything appeared calm i did go for one short walk in the cool overcast just along the beach to the south end of the island and back then i stayed in and watched some more television when the rain came on carried on a low wind glum muttering against the window i had gone to bed when the phone rang i got up quickly as i hadnt really started to drop off when it went and ran down to get there before my father i didnt know if he was still up or not yes i said breathlessly tucking my pyjama jacket into the bottoms pips sounded then a voice on the other end sighed no what i said frowning no the voice on the other end said eh i said i wasnt even sure it was eric you said yes i say no what do you want me to say porteneil ok porteneil hello ok goodbye the voice giggled the phone went dead i looked at it accusingly then put it down in the cradle i hesistated the phone rang again i snatched it up halfway through the first tinkle ye i started then the pips sounded i waited until they stopped and said porteneil porteneil said eric i thought it was eric at least yes i said yes what yes this is porteneil but i thought this was porteneil this is who is that is that you its me is that porteneil yes i shouted and whos that frank cauldhame i said trying to be calm whos that frank cauldhame eric said i looked around up and down the stairs but saw no sign of my father hello eric i said smiling i decided that whatever else happened tonight i would not make him angry id put the phone down rather than say the wrong thing and have my brother wreck yet another piece of post office property i just told you my names frank why are you calling me eric come on eric i recognise your voice im frank stop calling me eric ok ok ill call you frank so who are you i thought for a moment eric i said tentatively you just said you were called frank well i sighed leaning against the wall with one hand and wondering what i could say that was that was just a joke oh god i dont know i frowned at the phone and waited for eric to say something anyway eric eric said whats the latest news oh nothing much i was out last night at the pub did you call last night me no oh dad said somebody did i thought it might have been you why would i call well i dont know i shrugged to myself for the same reason you called tonight whatever well why do you think i called tonight i dont know christ you dont know why ive called you arent sure of your own name you get mine wrong youre not up to much are you oh dear i said more to myself than to eric i could feel this conversation going all the wrong way arent you going to ask me how i am yes yes i said how are you terrible how are you ok why are you feeling terrible you dont really care of course i care whats wrong nothing that would interest you ask me something else like how the weather is or where i am or something i know you dont care how i feel of course i do youre my brother naturally i care i protested just at that moment i heard the kitchen door open and seconds later my father appeared at the bottom of the stairs and taking hold of the great wooden ball sculpted on to the top of the last banister stood glaring up at me he lifted his head and put it slightly to one side to listen better i missed a little of what eric said in reply to me and only caught care how i feel every time i ring up its the same where are you thats all you care about you dont care about where my heads at only my body i dont know why i bother i dont i might as well not take the trouble of calling hm well there you are i said looking down at my father and smiling he stood there silent and unmoving see what i mean thats all you can say hm well there you are thanks a fucking lot that shows all you care not at all quite the contrary i told him then put the phone just a little away from my mouth and shouted to my father its only jamie again dad why i bother to make the effort really i dont eric rambled on in the earpiece apparently oblivious to what id just said my father ignored it too standing in the same position as before head cocked i licked my lips and said well jamie what you see youve forgotten my name again now whats the use thats what id like to know hm whats the use he doesnt love me you love me though dont you hm his voice became slightly fainter and more echoey he must have taken his mouth away from the handset it sounded as though he was talking to somebody else in the callbox with him yes jamie of course i smiled at my father and nodded and put one hand under the other armpit trying to look as relaxed as possible you love me dont you my sweet as though your little heart was on fire for me eric mumbled far away i swallowed and smiled again at my father well thats the way things go jamie i was just saying that to dad here this morning i waved at father youre burning up with love for me arent you me little darlin my heart and stomach seemed to collide as i heard a rapid panting noise come over the phone behind erics muttering a slight whine and some slobbering noises brought goosepimples up all over me i shivered my head shook as though id just knocked back some hundredproof whisky pant pant whine whine went the noise eric said something soothing and quiet in the background oh my god he had a dog in there with him oh no well listen listen jamie what do you think i said loudly and desperately wondering if my father could see my goosebumps i thought my eyes must be starting out of my head too but there was little i could do i was trying the best i could to think of something distracting to say to eric i was ah i was just thinking that we really must must get willy to give us another shot of his old car you know the mini he bombs up and down the sands on sometimes that was really good fun earlier on wasnt it i was croaking by now my mouth drying up what what are you talking about erics voice said suddenly close to the phone again i swallowed smiled once more at my father whose eyes seemed to have narrowed slightly you remember jamie getting a shot of willys mini i really must get dad here i hissed those two words to get me an old car i could drive on the sands youre talking crap ive never driven anybodys car on the sands youve forgotten who i am again eric said still not listening to what i was saying i turned away from looking down at my father and faced into the corner sighing mightily and whispering oh my god to myself away from the mouthpiece yes yes thats right jamie i continued hopelessly that brother of mine is still making his way here as far as i can tell me and dad here are hoping hes all right you little bastard you re talking as though im not even here christ i hate when people do that you wouldnt do that to me would you me old flame his voice went away again and i heard doggy noises puppy noises come to think of it over the phone i was starting to sweat i heard footsteps in the hall below then the kitchen light click off the footsteps came again then started up the stairs i turned round quickly smiled at my father as he approached well there you go jamie i said pathetically drying up metaphorically as well as literally dont spend too long on that phone my father said as he passed me and continued up the stairs right dad i shouted merrily beginning to experience an ache somewhere near my bladder that i sometimes get when things are going particluarly badly and i cant see any way out aaaaoooo i jerked the phone away from my ear and stared into it for a second i couldnt decide whether eric or the dog had made the noise hello hello i whispered feverishly glancing up to see fathers shadow leave the wall on the floor above haaaooowwwaaaaooooww came the scream down the line i shook and flinched my god what was he doing to the animal then the receiver clunked i heard a shout like a curse and the phone rattled and crashed again you little bastard aargh fuck shit come back you little hello eric i mean frank i mean hello whats happening i hissed glancing up the stairs for shadows crouching down at the phone and covering up my mouth with my free hand hello there was a clatter then that was your fault shouted close to the handset then another crash i could hear vague noises for a bit but even straining i couldnt make out what they were and they could have been just noises on the line i wondered whether i should put the phone down and was about to do so when erics voice came again muttering something i couldnt make out hello what i said still there eh i lost the little bastard that was your fault christ whats the use of you im sorry i said genuinely too bloody late now bit me the little shit ill catch it again though bastard the pips went i heard more money being put in i suppose youre glad arent you glad what glad the goddam dog got away asshole what me i stalled you arent trying to tell me youre sorry it got away are you ah you did it on purpose eric shouted you did it on purpose you wanted it to get away you wont let me play with anything youd rather the dog enjoyed itself than me you shit you rotten bastard ha ha i laughed unconvincingly well thanks for calling ah frank goodbye i slammed the receiver down and stood for a second congratulating myself on how well i had done all things considered i wiped my brow which had become a little sweaty and took a last look up at the shadow less wall above i shook my head and trudged up the stairs id got as far as the top step on that flight when the phone went again i froze if i answered it but if i didnt and father did i ran back down picked it up heard the coins go in then bastard followed by a series of deafening crashes as plastic met metal and glass i closed my eyes and listened to the cracks and smashes until one especially loud thump ended in a low buzz telephones dont usually make then i put the phone down again turned looked upward and set wearily off back up the stairs i lay in bed soon i would have to try some longrange fixing of this problem it was the only way id have to try to influence things through the root cause of it all old saul himself some heavy medicine was required if eric wasnt to wreck singlehandedly the entire scottish telephone network and decimate the countrys canine population first though i would have to consult the factory again it wasnt exactly my fault but i was totally involved and i might just be able to do something about it with the skull of the ancient hound the factorys help and a little luck how susceptible my brother would be to whatever vibes i could send out was a question i didnt like too much to think about given the state of his head but i had to do something i hoped the little puppy had got well away dammit i didnt hold all dogs to blame for what had happened old saul was the culprit old saul had gone down in our history and my personal mythology as the castraitor but thanks to the little creatures who flew the creek i had him in my power now eric was crazy all right even if he was my brother he was lucky to have somebody sane who still liked him the skull grounds when agnes cauldhame arrived eight and a half months pregnant on her bsa with the sweptback handlebars and eye of sauron painted red on the petroltank my father was perhaps understandably not ferociously pleased to see her she had after all deserted him almost immediately after my birth leaving him holding the squealing baby to disappear without so much as a phone call or a postcard for three years and then breeze back down the path from the town and across the bridge rubber handlebars just clearing the sides and no more carrying somebody elses baby or babies and expecting to be housed fed nursed and delivered by my father was a little presumptuous being only three at the time i cant remember much about it in fact i cant remember anything about it at all just as i cant remember anything before the age of three but then of course i have my own good reasons for that from the little ive been able to piece together when my father has chosen to let slip some information ive been able to get what i think is an accurate idea of what happened mrs clamp has come across with some details on sporadic occasions too though they are probably no more to be relied on than what my fathers told me eric was away at the time staying with the stoves in belfast agnes tanned huge all beads and bright caftan determined to give birth in the lotus position in which she claimed the child had been conceived while going om refused to answer any of my fathers questions about where she had been for the three years and who she had been with she told him not to be so possessive about her and her body she was well and with child that was all he needed to know agnes ensconced herself in what had been their bedroom despite my fathers protests whether he was secretly glad to have her back and perhaps even had some foolish idea that she might be back to stay i cant say i dont think he is all that forceful really despite the aura of brooding presence he can show when he wants to be impressive i suspect that my mothers obviously determined nature would have been enough to master him anyway she got her way and lived in fine style for a couple of weeks that heady summer of love and peace etcetera my father still had full use of both his legs at the time and had to use them to run up and down from kitchen or lounge to the bedroom and back when agnes rang the little bells sewn into the bellbottoms of her jeans which lay draped over a chair by the side of the bed on top of that my father had to look after me i was toddling around at the time getting into mischief the way any normal healthy threeyearold boy does as i say i cant remember anything but im told that i did seem to enjoy annoying old saul the bandylegged and ancient white bulldog my father kept im told because it was so ugly and it didnt like women it didnt like motorbikes either and had gone wild when agnes first arrived barking and attacking agnes kicked it across the garden and it ran off yelping into the dunes only reappearing once agnes was safely out of the way confined to bed mrs clamp maintains that my father ought to have put the dog down years before all this happened but i think the wetjowled yellowblearyeyed fishysmelling old hound must have worked on his sympathy just by being so repulsive agnes duly went into labour about lunchtime one hot still day pouring sweat and omming to herself while my father boiled lots of water and things and mrs clamp dabbed agness brow and like as not told her of all the women shed known who had died in childbirth i played outside running around in a pair of shorts and i imagine quite happy to have the whole pregnancy thing going on because it gave me more freedom to do as i liked about the house and garden free from my fathers supervision what i ever did to annoy old saul whether it was the heat that made him especially cantankerous whether agnes really had kicked him in the head when she arrived as mrs clamp says none of this do i know but the little tousleheaded dirty tanned bold toddler that was me might well have been up to some sort of mischief involving the beast it happened in the garden over a piece of ground that later became a vegetable patch when my father went on his healthfood binge my mother was heaving and grunting pushing and breathing an hour or so away from producing and attended by both mrs clamp and my father when all three or at least two i suppose agnes might have been too preoccupied heard frenzied barking and one high awful scream my father rushed to the window looked out and down into the garden then shouted and ran out of the room leaving mrs clamp goggleeyed alone he ran out into the garden and picked me up he ran back into the house shouted up to mrs clamp then put me on the table in the kitchen and used some towels to stop the bleeding as best he could mrs clamp still ignorant and quite enraged appeared with the medicine he had demanded then almost fainted when she saw the mess between my legs my father took the bag from her and told her to get back upstairs to my mother one hour later i had recovered consciousness was lying drugged and bloodless in my bed and my father had gone out with the shotgun he owned then to look for old saul he found him in a couple of minutes before he had properly left the house the old dog was cowering by the door of the cellar down the steps in the cool shadow he whined and shivered and my young blood mixed on his slavering chops with gamey saliva and thick eyemucus as he girned and looked shakily and pleadingly up at my father who picked him up and strangled him now i did eventually get my father to tell me this and according to him it was just as he choked the last struggling life out of the dog that he heard another scream this time from above and inside the house and that was the boy they called paul being born what sort of twisted thoughts went through my fathers brain at the time to make him choose such a name for the child i cannot start to imagine but that was the name angus chose for his new son he had to choose it by himself because agnes didnt stay long she spent two days recovering expressed shock and horror at what had happened to me then got on her bike and roared off my father tried to stop her by standing in her way so she ran him over and broke his leg quite badly on the path before the bridge thus it was that mrs clamp found herself looking after my father while he insisted on looking after me he still refused to let the old woman call in any other doctor and set his own leg though not quite perfectly hence the limp mrs clamp had to take the newly born child into the local cottage hospital the day after pauls mother left my father protested but as mrs clamp pointed out it was quite enough to have to look after two invalids in the one house without having an infant needing constant care as well so that was my mothers last visit to the island and the house she left one dead one born and two crippled for life one way or the other n ot a bad score for a fortnight in the summer of groovy and psychedelic love peace and general niceness old saul ended up buried in the slope behind the house in what later i called the skull grounds my father claims that he cut the animal open and found my tiny genitals in its stomach but i never did get him to tell me what he did with them paul of course was saul that enemy was must have been cunning enough to transfer to the boy that was why my father chose such a name for my new brother it was just lucky that i spotted it in time and did something about it at such an early age or god knows what the child might have turned into with sauls soul possessing him but luck the storm and i introduced him to the bomb and that settled his game as for the little animals the gerbils white mice and hamsters they had to die their muddy little ploppy deaths so that i could get to the skull of old saul i catapulted the tiny beasts across the creek and into the mud on the far side so that i could have funerals my father would never have let me start digging up our graveyard for family pets otherwise so off they had to go departing this life in the rather undignified garb of half a badminton shuttlecock i used to buy the shuttlecocks in the town toy and sports shop and cut the rubber end off then squeeze the protesting guineapig i did use one once just on principle but as a rule they were too expensive and a little too big up through the funnel of plastic until it sat round their waist like a little dress thus flighted i sent them shooting out over the mud and the water towards their suffocating ends then i buried them using as coffins the big matchboxes we always kept by the stove and which i had been saving for years and using as toysoldier containers model houses and so on i told my father i was trying to get them over to the far side to the mainland and that the ones i had to bury the ones which fell short were victims of scientific research but i doubt i really needed this excuse my father never seemed bothered about the suffering of lower forms of life despite having been a hippy and perhaps because of his medical training i kept a log naturally and therefore have it recorded that it took no less than thirtyseven of these supposed flight experiments before my trusty longhandled trowel in biting the skull grounds earth skin struck something harder than the sandy soil and i finally knew where the dogs bones were it would have been nice if it had been a decade to the day since the dog died that i exhumed its skull but in fact i was a few months late nevertheless the year of the skull ended with my old enemy in my power the bone jug pulled from the ground like a very rotten tooth indeed one suitably dark and stormy night by torchlight and stoutstroke the trowel while my father was sleeping and i should have been and the heavens shook with thunder rain and gale i was shaking by the time i got the thing to the bunker nearly frightening myself to death with my paranoid imaginings but i prevailed i took the filthy skull there and i cleaned it and stuck a candle in it and i surrounded it with heavy magic important things and got back cold and wet to my warm little bed safely so all things considered i think i have done all right handled my problem as well as it could have been handled my enemy is twice dead and i still have him i am not a full man and nothing can ever alter that but i am me and i regard that as compensation enough this burning dogs stuff is just nonsense space invaders before i realised the birds were my occasional allies i used to do unkind things to them fish for them shoot them tie them to stakes at low tide put electrically detonated bombs under their nests and so on my favourite game was capturing two using bait and a net then tying them together usually they were gulls and i tied thick orange nylon fishingline to a leg each then sat on a dune and watched sometimes i would have a gull and a crow but whether they were the same species or not they quickly found out they couldnt fly properly though the twine was long enough in theory and ended up after a few hilariously clumsy aerobatics fighting with one dead though the survivor usually injured wasnt really any better off attached to a heavy corpse instead of a live opponent i have seen a couple of determined ones peck the leg off their defeated adversary but most were unable or didnt think of it and got caught by the rats during the night i had other games but that one always struck me as one of my more mature inventions symbolic somehow and with a nice blend of callousness and irony one of the birds shat on gravel as i pedalled up the path to town on the tuesday morning i stopped glared up at the wheeling gulls and a couple of thrushes then got some grass and wiped the yellowwhite mess off the front guard it was a bright sunny day and a light breeze blew the forecast for the next few days was good and i hoped the fine weather held for erics arrival i met jamie in the lounge bar of the cauldhame arms for lunch and we sat playing an electronic game over a tv table if hes that crazy i dont know why they havent caught him yet jamie said ive told you hes crazy but hes very cunning hes not stupid he was always very bright right from the start he was reading early and getting all his relations and uncles and aunts to say och theyre old so young these days and things like that before i was even born but he is insane all the same thats what they say but i dont know what about the dogs and the maggots ok that looks pretty crazy ill admit but sometimes i think maybe hes up to something maybe hes not really crazy after all perhaps he just got fed up acting normal and decided to act crazy instead and they locked him up because he went too far and hes mad at them jamie grinned drinking his pint as i annihilated various dodging multicoloured spacecraft on the screen i laughed yeah if you like oh i dont know maybe he really is crazy maybe i am maybe everybody is or at least all of my family now youre talking i looked up at him for a second then smiled it does occur to me sometimes my dads an eccentric i suppose i am too i shrugged concentrated on the space battle again but it doesnt bother me there are a lot madder people about the place jamie sat in silence for a while as i went from screenful to screenful of wheeling whining craft finally my luck ran out and they caught me i took up my pint as jamie settled in to blast a few of the gaudy formations i looked at the top of his head as he bent to the task he was starting to go bald though i knew he was only twentythree he reminded me again of a puppet with his outofproportion head and stubby little arms and legs waggling with the exertion of punching the fire button and jiggling the positioning joystick yeah he said after a while still attacking the oncoming craft and a lot of them seem to be politicians and presidents and things what i said wondering what he was talking about the madder people a lot of them seem to be leaders of countries or religions or armies the real loonies aye i suppose i said thoughtfully watching the battle on the screen upside down or maybe theyre the only sane ones after all theyre the ones with all the power and riches theyre the ones who get everybody else to do what they want them to do like die for them and work for them and get them into power and protect them and pay taxes and buy them toys and theyre the ones wholl survive another big war in their bunkers and tunnels so given things being the way they are whos to say theyre the loonies because they dont do things the way joe punter thinks they ought to be done if they thought the same way as joe punter theyd be joe punter and somebody else would be having all the fun survival of the fittest yeah survival of the jamie drew his breath in sharply and pulled the stick so hard he almost fell off his stool but he managed to dodge the darting yellow bolts that had driven him into the corner of the screen nastiest he looked up at me and grinned quickly before hunching over the controls again i drank nodded if you like if the nastiest survive then thats our tough shit us being all us joe punters jamie said aye or everybody the whole species if were really so bad and so thick that wed actually use all those wonderful hbombs and neutron bombs on each other then maybe its just as well we do wipe ourselves out before we can get into space and start doing horrible things to other races you mean well be the space invaders yeah i laughed and rocked back on my stool thats it thats really us i laughed again and tapped the screen above a formation of red and green flapping things just as one of them peeling off to the side of the main pack dived down firing at jamies craft missing it with its shots but clipping him with one green wing as it disappeared off the bottom of the screen so that jamies craft detonated in a blaze of flashing red and yellow shit he said sitting back he shook his head i sat forward and waited for my craft to appear just a little drunk on my three pints i cycled back to the island whistling i always enjoyed my lunchtime chats with jamie we sometimes talk when we meet on saturday nights but we cant hear when the bands are on and afterwards im either too drunk to talk or if i can speak im too drunk to recall much of what ive said which come to think of it is probably just as well judging by the way people who are normally quite sensible dissolve into gibbering rude opinionated and bombastic idiots once the alcohol molecules in their bloodstream outnumber their neurons or whatever luckily one only notices this if one stays sober oneself so the solution is as pleasant at the time at least as it is obvious my father was asleep in a deckchair in the front garden when i got back i left the bike in the shed and watched him from the shed door for a while poised so that if he happened to wake up it would look as though i was just in the act of shutting the door his head was tilted a little to me and his mouth was slightly open he had dark glasses on but i could just see through them to his closed eyes i had to go for a piss so i didnt watch him for very long not that i had any particular reason for watching him i just liked doing it it made me feel good to know that i could see him and he couldnt see me and that i was aware and fully conscious and he wasnt i went into the house i had spent monday after a cursory check of the poles making one or two repairs and improvements to the factory working through the afternoon until my eyes got sore and my father had to call up to me to come down for my dinner in the evening it rained so i had stayed in and watched television i went to bed early eric didnt call after id got rid of about half the beer id drunk in the arms i went to have another look at the factory i clambered up into the loft all sunlight and warmth and smelling of old and interesting books and i decided to clear the place up a bit i sorted out old toys into boxes got a few rolls of carpet and wallpaper back into their places from where theyd fallen pinned a couple of maps back on to the sloping wooden underroof cleared away some of the tools and bits and pieces that id used to repair the factory and loaded the various sections of the factory that needed to be loaded i found some interesting things while i was doing all this a homemade astrolabe id carved a box containing the foldedflat parts for a scale model of the defences around byzantium the remains of my collection of telegraphpole insulators and some old jotters from when my father was teaching me french leafing through them i couldnt see any obvious lies he hadnt taught me to say anything obscene instead of excuse me or can you direct me to the railway station please though id have thought the temptation would have been all but irresistible i completed tidying the loft sneezing a few times as the golden space filled with motes of shining dust i looked over the refurbished factory again just because i love looking at it and tinkering with it and touching it and tipping some of its little levers and doors and devices finally i dragged myself away telling myself that id get a chance to use it properly soon enough i would capture a fresh wasp that afternoon to use the following morning i wanted another interrogation of the factory before eric arrived i wanted more of an idea what was going to happen it was a little risky of course asking it the same question twice but i thought the exceptional circumstances demanded it and it was my factory after all i got the wasp without any difficulty it more or less walked into the ceremonial jamjar which i have always used to hold subjects for the factory i kept the jar sealed with the lid with the holes in it and stocked with a few leaves and a morsel of orange peel standing in the shade of the river bank while i made a dam there that afternoon i worked and sweated in the sunlight of late afternoon and early evening while my father did a bit of painting at the back of the house and the wasp felt its way around the inside of the jar antennae waving halfway through building the dam not the best time i thought it might be amusing to make it an exploder so i set the overflow going and trotted up the path to the shed for the war bag i brought it back and sorted out the smallest bomb i could find wired for electrical detonation i attached it to the wires from the torchfirer by the bared ends poking out of the drilled hole in the black metal casing and wrapped the bomb in a couple of plastic bags i shoved the bomb backwards into the base of the main dam leading the wires away and back behind the dam past the static waters backed up behind it to near where the wasp crawled in its jar i covered the wires over so that it looked more natural then went on building the dam the dam system ended up very big and complicated and included not one but two little villages one between two of the dams and one downstream from the last one i had bridges with little roads a small castle with four towers and two road tunnels just before teatime i played out the last of the wire from the torch body and took the wasp jar up on to the top of the nearby dune i could see my father still painting the window surrounds of the lounge i can just remember the designs he used to have on the front of the house the face turned towards the sea they were fading even then but they were minor classics of trippedout art as i recall great sweeping sworls and mandalas that leaped about the house front like technicolor tattoos curving round windows and arching over the door a relic from the days when my father was a hippy they are worn and gone now erased by wind and sea and rain and sunlight only the vaguest outlines are still discernible now along with a few freak patches of real colour like peeling skin i opened the torchfirer up shoved the cylindrical batteries inside secured them then clicked the flasher button on top of the torch body the current flowed in series with the ninevolt packbattery taped to the outside down the wires leading from the hole where the bulb used to go and into the casing of the bomb somewhere near its centre steel wool glowed dully then brightly and started to melt and the white crystal mixture exploded tearing the metal which it took me and a heavyduty vice a lot of sweat time and leverage to bend at all as though it was paper wham the front of the main dam crashed up and out a messy mix of steam and gas water and sand leaped into the air and fell back spattering the noise was good and dull and the tremor i felt through the seat of my pants just before i heard the whump single and strong the sand in the air slipped fell back splashed in the waters and thudded in little heaps on to roads and houses the unleashed waters flooded out of the gap smashed in the sand wall and rolled down sucking sand from the edges of the breach and spilling in a sloped brown tide down upon the first village cutting through it piling up behind the next dam backing up collapsing sand houses tipping the castle to one side as a unit and undermining its already cracked towers the bridge supports gave way the wood slipped fell in at one side then the dam started to spill over and soon its whole top was awash and being eaten away by the flood still piling out of the first dam as the head of water pushed forward from fifty metres or more back up the stream the castle disintegrated falling over i left the jar and ran down the dune exulting in the wave of water as it sped over the braided surface of the stream bed hit houses followed roads ran through tunnels then hit the last dam quickly overwhelmed it and went on to smash into the rest of the houses grouped into the second village dams were disintegrating houses slipping into the water bridges and tunnels falling and banks collapsing allover the place a gorgeous feeling of excitement rose in my stomach like a wave and settled in my throat as i thrilled to the watery havoc about me i watched the wires wash and roll themselves to one side of the floods course then looked at the front of the racing water as it headed quickly for the sea over the longdried sand i sat down opposite where the first village had been where long brown humps of water surged slowly advancing and waited for the storm of water to subside my legs crossed my elbows on my knees and my face in my hands i felt warm and happy and slightly hungry eventually when the stream was almost back to normal and there was virtually nothing left of my hours of work i spotted what i was looking for the black and silver wreck of the bomb sticking ripped and gnarled in the sand just downstream from the site of the dam it had destroyed i didnt take my boots off but with the tips of my toes still on the dry bank walked with my hands until i was almost at full stretch out in the middle of the stream i picked the remains of the bomb out of the stream bed put its jagged body carefully into my mouth then walked my hands back until i was able to throw myself back and stand up i wiped the almost flat piece of metal with a rag from the war bag put the bomb inside the bag then collected the wasp jar and went back to the house for tea leaping the stream just up from the highest point the waters had been backed up to all our lives are symbols everything we do is part of a pattern we have at least some say in the strong make their own patterns and influence other peoples the weak have their courses mapped out for them the weak and the unlucky and the stupid the wasp factory is part of the pattern because it is part of life and even more so part of death like life it is complicated so all the components are there the reason it can answer questions is because every question is a start looking for an end and the factory is about the end death no less keep your entrails and sticks and dice and books and birds and voices and pendants and all the rest of that crap i have the factory and its about now and the future not the past i lay in bed that night knowing the factory was primed and ready and waiting for the wasp that crawled and felt its way about the jar that lay by my bedside i thought of the factory above me in the loft and i waited for the phone to ring the wasp factory is beautiful and deadly and perfect it would give me some idea of what was going to happen it would help me to know what to do and after i had consulted it i would try to contact eric through the skull of old saul we are brothers after all even if only half so and we are both men even if i am only half so at some deep level we understand each other even though he is mad and i am sane we even had that link i had not thought of until recently but which might come in useful now we have both killed and used our heads to do it it occurred to me then as it has before that that is what men are really for both sexes can do one thing specially well women can give birth and men can kill we i consider myself an honorary man are the harder sex we strike out push through thrust and take the fact that it is only an analogue of all this sexual terminology i am capable of does not discourage me i can feel it in my bones in my uncastrated genes eric must respond to that eleven oclock came then midnight and the time signal so i turned the radio off and went to sleep the wasp factory in the early morning while my father slept and the cold light filtered through the sharp overcast of young cloud i rose silently washed and shaved carefully returned to my room dressed slowly then took the jar with the sleepylooking wasp in it up to the loft where the factory waited i left the jar on the small altar under the window and made the last few preparations the factory required once that was done i took some of the green cleaning jelly from the pot by the altar and rubbed it well into my hands i looked at the time tide and distance tables the little red book that i kept on the other side of the altar noting the time of high tide i set the two small wasp candles into the positions the tips of the hands of a clock would have occupied on the face of the factory if showing the time of local high tide then i slid the top off the jar a little and extracted the leaves and the small piece of orange peel leaving the wasp in there alone i set the jar on the altar which was decorated with various powerful things the skull of the snake which killed blyth tracked down and sliced in half by his father using a garden spade i retrieved it from the grass and hid that front part of the snake in the sand before diggs could take it away for evidence a fragment of the bomb which had destroyed paul the smallest bit i could find there were lots a piece of tent fabric from the kite which had elevated esmerelda not a piece of the actual kite of course but an offcut and a little dish containing some of the yellow worn teeth of old saul easily pulled i held my crotch closed my eyes and repeated my secret catechisms i could recite them automatically but i tried to think of what they meant as i repeated them they contained my confessions my dreams and hopes my fears and hates and they still make me shiver whenever i say them automatic or not one tape recorder in the vicinity and the horrible truth about my three murders would be known for that reason alone they are very dangerous the catechisms also tell the truth about who i am what i want and what i feel and it can be unsettling to hear yourself described as you have thought of yourself in your most honest and abject moods just as it is humbling to hear what you have thought about in your most hopeful and unrealistic moments once i had gone through this i took the wasp without further ado to the underside of the factory and let it in the wasp factory covers an area of several square metres in an irregular and slightly ramshackle tangle of metal wood glass and plastic it is all based around the face of the old clock which used to hang over the door of the royal bank of scotland in porteneil the clock face is the most important thing i have ever recovered from the town dump i found it there during the year of the skull and rolled it home down the path to the island and rumbled it over the footbridge i stored it in the shed until my father was away for the day then i strained and sweated all day to get it up into the loft it is made of metal and is nearly a metre in diameter it is heavy and almost unblemished the numerals are in roman script and it was made along with the rest of the clock in edinburgh in one hundred years exactly before my birth certainly not a coincidence of course as the clock looked both ways there must have been another face the other side of the clock but although i scoured the dump for weeks after i found the face i do have i never did discover the other one so that it too is part of the mystery of the factory a little grail legend of its own old cameron in the ironmongers shop in the town told me that he heard a scrapmetal dealer from inverness took the workings of the clock so perhaps the other face was melted down years ago or now adorns the wall of some smart house on the black isle built from the profits of dead cars and the varying price of lead id rather the former there were a few holes in the face which i soldered up but i left the hole in the dead centre where the mechanism connected with the hands and it is through that the wasp is let into the factory once there it can wander about the face for as long as it likes inspecting the tiny candles with its dead cousins buried inside if it likes or ignoring them if it would rather having made its way to the edge of the face though where i have sealed it with a wall of plywood two inches high topped with a metrecircle of glass i had the glazier in the town make specially the wasp can enter one of twelve corridors through little waspsized doors one opposite each of those to the wasp vast numerals if the factory so chooses the weight of the wasp trips a delicate seesaw trigger made from thin pieces of tin can thread and pins and a tiny door closes behind the insect confining it to the corridor it has chosen despite the fact that i keep all the door mechanisms well oiled and balanced and repair and test them until the slightest tremor sets them off i have to tread very lightly when the factory is doing its slow and deadly work sometimes the factory does not want the wasp in its first choice of corridor and lets it crawl back out on to the face again sometimes the wasps will fly or crawl upside down on the bottom of the circle of glass sometimes they stay a long time by the closedoff hole in the centre through which they enter but sooner or later they all choose a hole and a door which work and their fate is sealed most of the deaths the factory has to offer are automatic but some do require my intervention for the coup de grace and that of course has some bearing on what the factory might be trying to tell me i must pull the trigger on the old airgun if the wasp crawls down it i must turn on the current if it falls into the boiling pool if it ends up crawling into the spiders parlour or the venus cave or the antery then i can just sit and watch nature take its course if its path takes it to the acid pit or the ice chamber or the rather jocularly named gents where the instrument of ending is my own urine usually quite fresh then again i can merely observe if it falls into the many charged spikes of the volt room i can watch the insect get zapped if it trips the deadweight i can watch it get crushed and ooze and if it stumbles through to the blade corridor i can see it chopped and writhe when i have some of the alternative deaths attached i can watch it tip molten wax over itself see it eat poisoned jam or be skewered to a pin propelled by a rubber band it can even set off a chain of events which ought to end with it trapped in a sealed chamber blasted by carbon dioxide from a sodasyphon bulb but if it should choose either the hot water or the rifled length of the twist of fate then i have to take a direct part in its death and if it goes for the fiery lake it is me who has to press the rod which flicks the lighter which ignites the petrol death by fire has always been at twelve and it is one of the ends never replaced by one of the alternatives i have signified fire as pauls death that happened near to midday just as blyths exit by venom is represented by the spiders parlour at four esmerelda probably died by drowning the gents and i put her time of death arbitrarily at eight to keep things symmetrical i watched the wasp come up out of the jar under a photograph of eric i had placed face down on the glass the insect wasted no time it was up on the face of the factory in seconds it crawled over the makers name and the vear the clock was born ignored the wasp candles totally and went more or less straight for the big xii over that and through the door opposite which snicked quietly closed behind it it went at a fast crawl down the corridor through the lobsterpot funnel made from thread which would stop it from turning back then entered the highly polished steel funnel and slipped down into the glasscovered chamber where it would die i sat back then sighing i pushed a hand through my hair and leaned forward again watching the wasp where it had fallen as it clambered about the blackened and rainbowcoloured bowl of steel mesh which had been sold as a teastrainer but now hung over a bowl of petrol i smiled ruefully the chamber was well ventilated with many small holes in the metal top and bottom of the glass tube so that the wasp would not choke on the petrol fumes a slight odour of petrol could usually be sensed when the factory was primed if you put your mind to it i could smell that petrol as i watched the wasp and perhaps there was just a trace of drying paint in the atmosphere too though i couldnt be sure i shrugged to myself and pushed down on the chamber button so that a length of dowling slid down its guide of aluminium tentpole and came into contact with the wheel and gasrelease mechanism on top of the disposable lighter poised over the pool of petrol it didnt even need a few tries to catch it went first time and the thin flames still quite bright in the early gloom of the morninglit loft curled and licked about the open mesh of the strainer the flames did not go through but the heat did and the wasp flew up buzzing angrily above the silent flames bumping against the glass falling back hitting the side of the strainer going over the edge starting to fall into the flames then flying back up again knocking off the steel tube of the funnel a few times then falling back into the steelmesh trap it leaped up a final time flew hopelessly for a few seconds but its wings must have been singed because it was crazily erratic in its flight and soon fell into the gauze bowl and died there struggling then curling then staying still smoking slightly i sat and watched the blackened insect bake and crisp sat and watched the calm flames rise to the mesh and fan round it like a hand sat and watched the reflection of the little quivering flames on the far side of the glass tube then at last reached over unclipped the base of the cylinder slid the petroldish toward me under a metal cover and snuffed the fire i undid the top of the chamber and reached in with a pair of tweezers to remove the body i placed it in a matchbox and put that on the altar the factory does not always give up its dead the acid and the ants leave nothing and the venus flytrap and the spider give back only a husk if anything again though i had a burned body again i would have to do some disposing i put my head in my hands rocking forward on the small stool the factory surrounded me the altar was at my back i gazed round the factorys paraphernalia of places its many ways to death its crawlways and corridors and chambers its lights at the ends of tunnels its tanks and containers and hoppers its triggers its batteries and threads supports and stands tubes and wires i clicked a few switches and tiny propellers whirred down branchcorridors sending air sucked down vents over thimblefuls of jam and down towards the face i listened to them for a while until i could smell jam myself but that was to tempt slow wasps to their ends and not for me i turned the motors off i started switching everything off disconnecting emptying and feeding the morning was growing stronger in the space beyond the skylights and i could hear a couple of early birds calling in the new fresh air when the ritual standingdown of the factory was completed i went back to the altar looking round it at all its parts the assortment of miniature plinths and small jars the souvenirs of my life the previous things ive found and kept photographs of all my dead relations the ones ive killed and the ones that just died photographs of the living eric my father my mother photographs of things a bsa not the bike unfortunately i think my father destroyed all the photographs of it the house when it was still bright with swirling paint even a photograph of the altar itself i passed the matchbox containing the dead wasp over the altar waved it around in front of it before the jar of sand from the beach outside the bottles of my precious fluids a few shavings from my fathers stick another matchbox with a couple of erics first teeth set in cotton wool a phial with some of my fathers hair another with some rust and paint scraped from the bridge to the mainland i lit wasp candles closed my eyes held the matchbox coffin in front of my forehead so that i could feel the wasp in there from inside my head an itching tickling sensation just inside my skull after that i blew the candles out covered the altar stood up dusted down my cords took up the photograph of eric id placed on the glass of the factory and wrapped the coffin in it secured it with a rubber band and put the package in my jacket pocket i walked slowly along the beach towards the bunker my hands in my pockets my head down watching the sand and my feet but not really watching them everywhere i turned there was fire the factory had said it twice i had turned to it instinctively when attacked by the rogue buck and it was squeezed into every spare corner of my memory eric brought it closer all the time too i brought my face up to the sharp air and the pastel blues and pink of the new sky feeling the damp breeze hearing the hiss of the distant outgoing tide somewhere a sheep bleated i had to try old saul i had to make the attempt to contact my mad crazy brother before these many fires conjoined and swept eric away or swept my life on the island away i tried to pretend to myself that it might not really be that serious but i knew in my bones it was the factory does not lie and for once it had been comparatively specific i was worried in the bunker with the wasps coffin resting in front of old sauls skull and the light coming out through the sockets of his longdried eyes i knelt in the pungent darkness before the altar head bowed i thought of eric i remembered him as he was before he had his unpleasant experience when although he had been away from the island he was still really part of it i remembered him as the clever kind excitable boy he had been and i thought of what he was now a force of fire and disruption approaching the sands of the island like a mad angel head swarming with echoing screams of madness and delusion i leaned forward and put my right hand palm down on the top of the old dogs cranium keeping my eyes closed the candle was not long lit and the bone was only warm some unpleasant cynical part of my mind told me that i looked like mr spock in star trek doing a mindmeld or whatever but i ignored it that didnt matter anyway i breathed deeply thought more deeply erics face swam in front of me freckles and sandy hair and anxious smile a young face thin and intelligent and young the way i thought of him when i tried to remember him when he was happy during our summers together on the island i concentrated pressured my guts and held my breath as though i was trying to force a turd out when constipated the blood roared in my ears with my other hand i used forefinger and thumb to press my closed eyes into my own skull while my other hand grew hot on old sauls i saw lights random patterns like spreading ripples or huge fingerprints swirling i felt my stomach clench itself involuntarily and a wave of what felt like fiery excitement swept up from it only acids and glands i knew but i felt it transport me from one skull through another to another eric i was getting through i could feel him feel the aching feet the blistered soles the quivering legs the sweatstuck grimy hands the itching unwashed scalp i could smell him as myself see through those eyes that hardly closed and burned in his skull raw and shot with blood blinking drily i could feel the remains of some awful meal lying dead in my stomach taste burned meat and bone and fur on my tongue i was there i was a blast of fire crashed out at me i was thrown back slammed away from the altar like a piece of soft shrapnel and bounced off the earthcovered concrete floor to come to rest by the far wall my head buzzing my right hand aching i fell over to one side and curled up around myself i lay breathing deeply for a while hugging my sides and rocking very slightly my head scraping on the floor of the bunker my right hand felt as though it was the size and colour of a boxingglove with every slowing beat of my heart it sent a pulse of pain up my arm i crooned to myself and slowly sat up rubbing my eyes and still rocking very slightly my knees and head coming a little closer drawing slightly back i tried to nurse my battered ego back to health across the bunker as the dim view swam back to focus i could see the skull still glowing the flame still burning i glared at it and brought my right hand up started licking it i looked to see if my flight across the floor had damaged anything but as far as i could see everything was in its place only i had been affected i gave a shivery sigh and relaxed letting my head rest on the cool concrete of the wall behind me i leaned forward after a while and placed the palm of my hand still throbbing on the floor of the bunker letting it cool i kept it there for a while then brought it up and wiped some of the soil off it squinting to see if there was any visible damage but the light was too poor i got slowly to my feet and went to the altar i lit the side candles with shaking hands put the wasp with the rest in the plastic rack to the left of the altar and burned its temporary coffin on the metal plate in front of old saul erics photograph took flame the boyish face disappearing in fire i blew through one of old sauls eyes and put the candle out i stood for a moment collecting my thoughts then went to the metal door of the bunker and opened it the silky light of a cloudbright morning flooded in and made me grimace i turned back put out the other candles and took another look at my hand the palm was red and inflamed i licked it again almost i had succeeded i was sure i had had eric in my grasp had his mind there under my hand and been part of him seen the world through his eyes heard his blood pump in his head felt the ground beneath his feet smelled his body and tasted his last meal but he had been too much for me the conflagration in his head was just too strong for anybody sane to cope with it had a lunatic strength of total commitment about it which only the profoundly mad are continually capable of and the most ferocious soldiers and most aggressive sportsmen able to emulate for a while every particle of erics brain was concentrated on his mission of returning and setting fire and no normal brain not even mine which was far from normal and more powerful than most could match that marshalling of forces eric was committed to total war a jihad he was riding the divine wind to at least his own destruction and there was nothing i could do about it this way i locked up the bunker and went back along the beach to the house my head down again and even more thoughtful and troubled than i had been on the outward journey i spent the rest of the day in the house reading books and magazines watching television and thinking all the time i could not do anything about eric from the inside so i had to change the direction of my attack my personal mythology with the factory behind it was flexible enough to accept the failure it had just suffered and use such a defeat as a pointer to the real solution my advance troops had had their fingers burned but i still had all my other resources i would prevail but not through the direct application of my powers at least not through the direct application of any other power but imaginative intelligence and that ultimately was the bedrock for everything else if it could not meet the challenge that eric represented then i deserved to be destroyed my father was still painting hauling his way up ladders to windows with the painttin and brush clenched between his teeth i offered to help but he insisted on doing it himself i had used the ladders myself several times in the past when i was trying to find a way into my fathers study but he had special locks on the windows and even kept the blinds down and curtains drawn i was glad to see the difficulty he had making his way up the ladder hed never make it up into the loft it crossed my mind that it was just as well the house was the height it was or he might just have been able to climb a ladder to the roof and be able to see through the skylights into the loft but we were both safe our mutual citadels secure for the foreseeable future for once my father let me make the dinner and i made a vegetable curry we would both find acceptable while watching an open university programme on geology on the portable television which i had taken through to the kitchen for the purpose once the business with eric was over i decided i really must restart my campaign to persuade my father to get a vcr it was too easy to miss good programmes on fine days after our meal my father went into town this was unusual but i didnt ask why he was going he looked tired after his day spent climbing and reaching but he went up to his room changed into his town clothes and came limping back into the lounge to bid me farewell ill be off then he said he looked round the lounge as though searching for some evidence i had started some heinous mischief already before he had even left i watched the tv and nodded without looking at him right you are i said i wont be late you dont have to lock up ok youll be all right then oh yes i looked at him crossed my arms and settled deeper into the old easy chair he stepped back so that both feet were in the hall and his body was canted into the lounge only his hand on the doorknob stopping him from falling in he nodded again the cap on his head dipping once right ill see you later see you behave yourself i smiled and looked back to the screen yes dad see you hnnh he said and with one last look round the lounge as if still checking for vanished silver he closed the door and i heard him clicking down the hall and out the front door i watched him go up the path sat for a while then went up and tested the door to the study which as usual as always was so firm it might as well have been part of the wall i had fallen asleep the light outside was waning some awful american crime series was on the television and my head was sore i blinked through gummed eyes yawned to unstick my lips and get some air into my staletasting mouth i yawned and stretched then froze i could hear the telephone i leaped out of the seat stumbled almost fell then got to the door the hall the stairs and finally the phone as quickly as i could i lifted the receiver with my right hand which hurt i pressed the phone to my ear hello i said hi frankie lad hows it goin said jamie i felt a mixture of relief and disappointment i sighed ah jamie ok how are you off work dropped a plank on my foot this morning and its all swollen nothing too serious though naw ill get the rest of the week off if im lucky im goin to see the doctor tomorrow for a sick line just thought id let

was up early this morning i might see you tomorrow great well take care an that see you frank right jamie bye bye said jamie i hung up and went downstairs to turn the television over to something more sensible but got no farther than the bottom step when the phone went again i went back up just as i did so a tingle went through me that it might be eric but no pips sounded i grinned and said yeah what did you forget forget i didnt forget anything i remember everything everything screamed a familiar voice at the other end of the line i froze then gulped said er why are you accusing me of forgetting things what are you accusing me of forgetting what i havent forgotten anything eric gasped and spluttered eric im sorry i thought you were somebody else im me he yelled im not anybody else im me me i thought you were jamie i wailed closing my eyes that dwarf you bastard im sorry i then i broke off and thought what do you mean that dwarf in that tone hes my friend it isnt his fault hes small i told him oh yeah came the reply how do you know what do you mean how do i know it wasnt his fault he was born like that i said getting quite angry you only have his word for that i only have his word for what i said that hes a dwarf eric spat what i shouted scarcely able to believe my ears i can see hes a dwarf you idiot thats what he wants you to think maybe hes really an alien maybe the rest of them are even smaller than he is how do you know he isnt really a giant alien from a very small race of aliens eh dont be stupid i screamed into the phone gripping it sorely with my burned hand well dont say i didnt warn you eric shouted dont worry i shouted back anyway eric said in a suddenly calm voice so that for a second or two i thought somebody else had come on the line and i was left somewhat nonplussed as he went on in level ordinary speech how are you eh i said confused ah fine fine how are you oh not too bad nearly there what here no there christ it cant be a bad line over this distance can it what distance eh can it i dont know i put my other hand to my forehead getting the feeling that i was losing the thread of the conversation entirely im nearly there eric explained tiredly with a calm sigh not nearly here im already here how else could i be calling you from here but wheres here i said you mean you dont know where you are again eric exclaimed incredulously i closed my eyes again and moaned he went on and you accuse me of forgetting things ha look you bloody madman i screamed into the green plastic as i gripped it hard and sent spears of pain up my right arm and felt my face contort im getting fed up with you calling me up here and being deliberately awkward stop playing games i gasped for breath you know damn well what i mean when i ask where here is i mean where the hell are you i know where i am and you know where i am just stop trying to mess me about ok hm sure frank eric said sounding uninterested sorry if i was rubbing you up the wrong way well i started to shout again then controlled myself and quieted down breathing hard well just just dont do that to me i was only asking where you are yeah thats ok frank i understand eric said evenly but i cant actually tell you where i am or somebody might overhear surely you can see that cant you all right all right i said but youre not in a callbox are you well of course im not in a callbox he said with a bit of an edge in his voice again then i heard him control his tone yeah thats right im in somebodys house well a cottage actually what i said who whose i dont know he replied and i could almost hear him shrug i suppose i could find out if youre really that interested are you really that interested what no yes i mean no what does it matter but where i mean how i mean who do you look frank eric said tiredly its just somebodys little holiday cottage or weekend retreat or something right i dont know whose it is but as you so perceptively put it it doesnt matter all right you mean youve broken in to someobdys home i said yeah so what i didnt even have to break in in fact i found the key to the back door in the guttering whats wrong its a very nice little place arent you frightened of getting caught not much im sitting here in the front room looking down the drive and i can see way down the road no problem ive got food and theres a bath and theres a phone and theres a freezer christ you could fit an alsatian in there and a bed and everything luxury an alsatian i screeched well yes if i had one i dont but if i did i could have kept that in there as it is dont i interrupted closing my eyes yet again and holding up my hand as though he was there in the house with me dont tell me ok well i just thought id ring you and tell you im all right and see how you are im fine are you sure youre ok too yeah never felt better feeling great i think its my diet all listen i broke in desperately feeling my eyes widen as i thought of what i wanted to ask him you didnt feel anything this morning did you about dawn anything i mean anything at all nothing inside you ah you didnt feel anything did you feel anything what are you gibbering about eric said slightly angrily did you feel anything this morning very early what on earth do you mean feel anything i mean did you experience anything anything at all about dawn this morning well eric said in measured tones and slowly funny you should say that yes yes i said excitedly pressing the receiver so close to my mouth that my teeth clattered off the mouthpiece not a damn thing this morning was one of the few i can honestly say i experienced not a thing eric informed me urbanely i was asleep but you said you didnt sleep i said furiously christ frank nobodys perfect i could hear him start to laugh but i started i closed my mouth and gritted my teeth once more i closed my eyes he said anyway frank old sport to be quite honest this is getting boring i might call you again but either way ill see you soon ta ta before i could say anything the line went dead and i was left fuming and belligerent holding the telephone and glaring at it like it was to blame i considered hitting something with it but decided that would be too much like a bad joke so i slammed it down on the cradle instead it chimed once in response and i gave it another glare then turned my back on it and stamped downstairs threw myself into an easy chair and punched the buttons on the remote control for the television repeatedly through channel after channel time after time for about ten minutes at the end of that period i realised that i had got just as much out of watching three programmes simultaneously the news yet another awful american crime series and a programme on archaeology as i ever got from watching the damn things separately i hurled the control unit away in disgust and stormed outside in the fading light to go and throw a few stones at the waves what happened to eric i slept fairly late for me my father had arrived back at the house just as i returned from the beach and i had gone to bed at once so i had a good long sleep in the morning i called jamie got his mother and found out he had gone to the doctors but would be straight back i packed my daypack and told my father id be back in the early evening then set off for the town jamie was in when i got to his house we drank a couple of cans of the old red death and chatted away then after sharing in elevenses and some of his mothers homemade cakes i left and made my way out of town for the hills behind high on a heathered summit a gentle slope of rock and earth above the forestry commissions tree line i sat on a big rock and ate my lunch i looked out over the heathazed distance over porteneil the pastureland dotted white with sheep the dunes the dump the island not that you could see it as such it looked like part of the land the sands and the sea the sky held a few small clouds it beat blue over the view fading to paleness towards the horizon and the calm expanse of firth and sea larks sung in the air above me and i watched a buzzard hover as it looked for movement in the grass and heather broom and whin beneath insects buzzed and danced and i waved a fan of fern in front of my face to keep them away as i ate my sandwiches and drank my orange juice to my left the mounting peaks of the hills marched off northward growing gradually higher as they went and fading into grey and blue shimmering with distance i watched the town beneath me through the binoculars saw trucks and cars make their way along the main road and followed a train as it headed south stopping in the town then going on again snaking across the level ground before the sea i like to get away from the island now and again not too far i still like to be able to see it if possible but it is good to remove oneself sometimes and get a sense of perspective from a little farther away of course i know how small a piece of land it is im not a fool i know the size of the planet and just how minuscule is that part of it i know ive watched too much television and seen too many nature and travel programmes not to appreciate how limited my own knowledge is in terms of firsthand experience of other places but i dont want to go farther afield i dont need to travel or see foreign climes or know different people i know who i am and i know my limitations i restrict my horizons for my own good reasons fear oh yes i admit it and a need for reassurance and safety in a world which just so happened to treat me very cruelly at an age before i had any real chance of affecting it also i have the lesson of eric eric went away eric with all his brightness all his intelligence and sensitivity and promise left the island and tried to make his way chose a path and followed it that path led to the destruction of most of what he was changed him into a quite different person in whom the similarities to the sane young man he had been before only appeared obscene but he was my brother and i still loved him in a way i loved him despite his alteration the way i suppose he had loved me despite my disability that feeling of wanting to protect i suppose which women are supposed to feel for the young and men are meant to feel for women eric left the island before i was even born only coming back for holidays but i think that spiritually he was always there and when he did return properly a year after my little accident when my father thought we both old enough for him to be able to look after the two of us i didnt resent him being there at all on the contrary we got on well from the start and im sure i must have embarrassed him with my slavish following around and copying though being eric he was too sensitive to other peoples feelings to tell me so and risk hurting me when he was sent off to private schools i pined when he came back on holidays i enthused i jumped and bubbled and got excited summer after summer we spent on the island flying kites making models from wood and plastic lego and meccano and anything else we found lying about building dams and constructing huts and trenches we flew model airplanes sailed model yachts built sandyachts with sails and invented secret societies codes and languages he told me stories inventing them as he went along we played some stories out brave soldiers in the dunes and fighting winning and fighting and fighting and sometimes dying those were the only times he deliberately hurt me when his stories required his own heroic death and i would take it all too seriously as he lay expiring on the grass or the sands having just blown up the bridge or the dam or the enemy convoy and like as not saved me from death too i would choke back tears and punch him lightly as i tried to change the story myself and he refused slipping away from me and dying too often dying when he had his migraines sometimes lasting days i lived on edge taking cool drinks and some food up to the darkened room on the second floor creeping in standing and shaking sometimes if he moaned and shifted on the bed i was wretched while he suffered and nothing meant anything the games and the stories seemed stupid and pointless and only throwing stones at bottles or seagulls made much sense i went out fishing for gulls determined things other than eric should suffer when he recovered it was like him coming back for the summer allover again and i was irrepressible finally though that outward urge consumed him as it does any real man and it took him away from me to the outside world with all its fabulous opportunities and awful dangers eric decided to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a doctor he told me then that nothing much would change he would still have most of the summer off even if he would have to stay down in glasgow to do hospital work or go around with doctors when they visited people he told me that we would still be the same when we were together but i knew it wasnt true and i could see that in his heart he knew it too it was there in his eyes and his words he was leaving the island leaving me i couldnt blame him even then when i felt it hardest he was eric he was my brother he was doing what he had to do just like the brave soldier who died for the cause or for me how could i doubt or blame him when he had never even started to suggest that he doubted or blamed me my god all those murders those three young children killed one a fratricide and he simply could not have entertained the idea that i had had a hand in even one of them i would have known he couldnt have looked me in the face if he had suspected he was so incapable of deceit so south he went first one year carried there earlier than most by his brilliant examination results then another the summer in between he came back but he was changed he still tried to get along with me the way he always had but i could feel it was forced he was away from me his heart was no longer on the island it was with the people he knew in the university with his studies which he loved it was in all the rest of the world perhaps but it was no longer on the island no longer with me we went out we flew kites built dams and so on but it wasnt the same he was an adult helping me to enjoy myself not another boy sharing his own joy it wasnt a bad time and i was still glad he was there but he was relieved to go after a month to join some of his student friends on a holiday in the south of france i mourned what i knew was the passing of the friend and brother i had known and felt more keenly than at any other time my injury that thing which i knew would keep me in my adolescent state for ever would never let me grow up and be a real man able to make my own way in the world i threw that feeling off quickly i had the skull i had the factory and i had a vicarious feeling of manly satisfaction in the brilliant performance of eric on the outside as for my part i slowly made myself unchallenged lord of the island and the lands about it eric wrote me letters telling me how he was getting on he called up and spoke to me and my father and he would make me laugh then on the phone the way a clever adult can even though you might not want to let them he never let me feel that he had totally abandoned me or the island then he had his unfortunate experience which unknown to me and my father came on top of other things and it was enough to kill even the altered person i knew it was to send eric flying back and out to something else an amalgam of both his earlier self but satanically reversed and a more worldywise man an adult damaged and dangerous confused and pathetic and manic all at once he reminded me of a hologram shattered with the whole image contained within one spearlike shard at once splinter and entirety it was during that second year when he was helping out in a big teaching hospital that it happened he didnt even have to be there at the time down in the guts of the hospital with human rejects he was helping out in his spare time later my father and i heard that eric had had problems he hadnt told us about hed fallen for some girl and it had ended badly with her telling him she didnt love him after all and going off with somebody else his migraines had been particularly bad for a while and had interfered with his work it was because of that as well as the girl that he had been working unofficially in the hospital near the university helping the nurses on late shifts sitting in the darkness of the wards with his books while the old and the young and the sick moaned and coughed he was doing that the night he had his unpleasant experience the ward was one where they kept babies and young children so badly deformed they were sure to die outside hospital and not last much longer even inside we got a letter explaining most of what had happened from a nurse who had been friendly with my brother and from the tone of her letter she thought it was wrong to keep some of the children alive apparently they were little else than exhibits to be shown to students by the doctors and consultants it was a hot close night in july and eric was down in this ghoulish place near the hospital boiler room and store rooms hed had a sore head all day and while he was in the ward it had worsened into a bad migraine the ventilation in the place had been faulty for the past couple of weeks and engineers had been working on the system that night it was hot and stuffy and erics migraines have always been bad in those conditions somebody was coming to replace him in an hour or so or i suppose even eric would have admitted defeat and left to go back to his hall of residence and lie down as it was he was going round the ward changing nappies and quieting mewling babies and changing dressings and drips or whatever his head feeling as though it was splitting and his vision distorted with lights and lines the child he was attending to when it happened was more or less a vegetable amongst its other defects it was totally incontinent unable to make any other noise apart from a gurgle couldnt control its muscles properly even its head had to be supported by a brace and it wore a metal plate over its head because the bones which should have made up its skull never did grow together and even the skin over its brain was paper thin it had to be fed every few hours with some special mixture and eric was doing that when it happened he had noticed that the child was a little quieter than usual just sitting there slackly in its chair and staring straight ahead breathing lightly eyes glazed and an almost peaceful expression on its usually vacant face it seemed to be incapable of taking its food though one of the few activities that normally it was able to appreciate and even join in eric was patient and held the spoon in front of its unfocused eyes he put it to its lips where normally the child would have put its tongue out or try to lean forward and take the spoon into its mouth but that night it just sat there not gurgling not shaking its head or shifting or flapping its arms or rolling its eyes but staring and staring that curious look on its face which might have been mistaken for happiness eric persevered sitting closer trying to ignore the pressing pain in his own head as the migraine got gradually worse he spoke gently to the child something that would normally get it to swivel its eyes and shift its head towards the source of the noise but which that night had no effect at all eric checked the sheet of paper by the chair to see if the child had been given any extra medication but everything appeared normal he edged closer crooning waving the spoon fighting the waves of pain inside his skull then he saw something something like a movement just a tiny little movement barely visible on the shaved head of the slightly smiling child whatever it was was small and slow eric blinked shook his head to try to dislodge the quivering lights of the migraine building inside he stood up still holding the spoon with the mushy food on it he bent closer to the skull of the child looking closer he couldnt see anything but he looked round the edge of the metal skullcap the child wore thought he saw something under it and lifted it easily from the head of the infant to see if there was anything wrong a boilerroom worker heard eric screaming and rushed into the ward brandishing a big spanner he found eric crammed into a corner howling as hard as he could at the floor his head down between his knees as he halfknelt halflay foetal on the tiles the chair the child was in had been tipped over and it and the strappedin child who was still smiling lay on the floor a few yards away the man from the boilerroom shook eric but got no response then he looked at the child on the chair and went over to it perhaps to right its chair he got within a couple of feet then rushed to the door throwing up before he got there a ward sister from the floor above found the man in the corridor still fighting his dry heaves when she came down to see what all the fuss was about eric had stopped screaming by that time and gone quiet the child was still smiling the sister righted the childs chair whether she choked back any of her own sickness or felt dizzy or whether she had seen as bad or worse before and treated it as just something to be coped with i dont know but she finally pulled things together calling for help on the telephone and getting eric stiffly out of his corner she put him in a seat covered the childs head with a towel and comforted the workman she had removed the spoon from the open skull of the smiling infant eric had stuck it there perhaps thinking in that first instant of his mania to spoon out what he saw flies had got into the ward presumably when the airconditioning had been faulty earlier they had got underneath the stainless steel of the childs skullcap and deposited their eggs there what eric saw when he lifted that plate up what he saw with all that weight of human suffering above with all that mighty spread of closedin heatstruck darkened city all around what he saw with his own skull splitting was a slowly writhing nest of fat maggots swimming in their combined digestive juices as they consumed the brain of the child in fact eric appeared to recover from what happened he was sedated he spent a couple of nights in the hospital as a patient then a few days resting in his room in the residence he went back to his studies within the week and attended classes as normal a few people knew something had happened and they saw that eric was quieter but that was all my father and i didnt know anything except that hed been off from his classes for a short while because of a migraine later we heard eric started drinking a lot missing classes turning up at the wrong ones shouting in his sleep and waking other people on his floor of the residence taking drugs missing exams and practical classes in the end the university had to suggest he took the rest of the year off because he had missed so much work eric took it badly he got all his books and piled them up in the corridor outside his tutors room and set light to them he was lucky they didnt prosecute him but the university authorities took a lenient view of the smoke and the slight damage to their ancient wood panelling and eric came back to the island but not to me he refused to have anything to do with me and kept himself locked in his room listening to his records very loudly and hardly ever going out except to the town where he was quickly banned from all four pubs for starting fights and shouting and swearing at people when he did notice me he would stare at me with his huge eyes or tap his nose and wink slyly his eyes had grown darkset and were underlined by bags and his nose seemed to twitch a lot too once he picked me up and gave me a kiss on the lips which really made me frightened my father grew almost as uncommunicative as eric he settled into a morose existence of long walks and dour introspective silences he started smoking cigarettes virtually chainsmoking for a while for a month or so the house was hell to be in and i went out a lot or stayed in my room and watched television then eric took to frightening small boys from the town first by throwing worms at them then by stuffing worms down their shirts as they came back from school some of the parents a teacher and diggs came to the island to see my father once eric started trying to force the kids to eat the worms and handfuls of maggots i sat sweating in my room while they met in the lounge underneath the parents shouting at my father eric was talked to by the doctor by diggs even by a social worker from inverness but he didnt say much he just sat smiling and sometimes mentioned how much protein there was in worms once he came back to the house all battered and bleeding and my father and i assumed some of the bigger boys or a few of the parents had caught him and beaten him apparently dogs had been disappearing from the town for a couple of weeks before some children saw my brother pouring a can of petrol over a little yorkshire terrier and setting fire to it their parents believed them and went looking for eric to find him doing the same thing with an old mongrel he had tempted with aniseed balls sweeties and caught they chased him through the woods behind the town but lost him diggs came to the island again that evening to tell us he had come to arrest eric for disturbing the peace he waited until quite late only accepting a couple of the whiskies my father offered him but eric did not return diggs left and my father waited up but still eric didnt show it was three days and five dogs later before he came back haggard and unwashed and smelling of petrol and smoke his clothes all torn and his face lean and filthy my father heard him come in early in the morning raid the fridge gulp down several meals at once and stamp upstairs to bed my father crept down to the phone and called diggs who arrived before breakfast eric must have heard or seen something though because he went out through his room window and down the drainpipe to the ground and made off with diggss bike it was another week and two more dogs before he was finally caught siphoning petrol from somebodys car in the street they broke his jaw in the process of making their citizens arrest and this time eric didnt get away a few months later he was certified insane he had had all sorts of tests tried to escape countless times assaulted male nurses and social workers and doctors and threatened all of them with legal action and assassination he was moved to gradually more and more longterm and secure institutions as his tests and threats and struggles continued my father and i heard that he quieted down a lot once he settled into the hospital to the south of glasgow and no longer made his escape attempts but looking back he was probably just trying successfully it would seem to lull his keepers into a false sense of security and now he was making his way back to see us i swept my binoculars slowly across the land in front and beneath me from north to south from haze to haze across the town and the roads and the railway and the fields and the sands and i wondered if under my gaze at any point came the place where eric was now if he had got this far already i felt he was close i didnt have any good reason but he had had the time the call of last night sounded clearer than the others he had made and i just felt it he might be here now lying up waiting for night before he moved or skulking through the woods or through the whin bushes or within the hollows of the dunes heading for the house or looking for dogs i walked along the ridge of hills then came down a few miles south of the town down through the ranks of conifers where distant buzzsaws sounded and the dark masses of the trees were shady and quiet i went across the railway line and over a few fields of swaying barley across the road and over the rough sheeppasture to the sands my feet were sore and my legs ached slightly as i walked along the line of hard sand on the beach a slight wind had come up off the sea and i was glad of it because the clouds had all gone and the sun though sinking gradually was still powerful i came to a river i had already crossed once in the hills and crossed it again near the sea going up into the dunes a way to where i knew there was a wire bridge sheep scattered in front of me some shorn some still shaggy bouncing away with their fracturedsounding baas then stopping once they thought they were safe and dipping their heads or kneeling to resume cropping the flowerscattered grass i remember i used to despise sheep for being so profoundly stupid id seen them eat and eat and eat id watched dogs outsmart whole flocks of them id chased them and laughed at the way they ran watched them get themselves into all sorts of stupid tangled situations and id thought they quite deserved to end up as mutton and that being used as woolmaking machines was too good for them it was years and a long slow process before i eventually realised just what sheep really represented not their own stupidity but our power our avarice and egotism after id come to understand evolution and know a little about history and farming i saw that the thick white animals i laughed at for following each other around and getting caught in bushes were the product of generations of farmers as much as generations of sheep we made them we moulded them from the wild smart survivors that were their ancestors so that they would become docile frightened stupid tasty woolproducers we didnt want them to be smart and to some extent their aggression and their intelligence went together of course the rams are brighter but even they are demeaned by the idiotic females they have to associate with and inseminate the same principle applies to chickens and cows and almost anything weve been able to get our greedy hungry hands on for long enough it occasionally occurs to me that something the same might have happened to women but attractive though the theory might be i suspect im wrong home in time for dinner i wolfed down my eggs steak chips and beans and spent the rest of the evening watching television and picking bits of dead cow out of my mouth with a match running dog it always annoyed me that eric went crazy although it wasnt an onoff thing sane one minute mad the next i dont think there is much doubt that the incident with the smiling child triggered something in eric that led almost inevitably to his fall something in him could not accept what had happened could not fit in what he had seen with the way he thought things ought to be maybe some deep part of him buried under layers of time and growth like the roman remains of a modem city still believed in god and could not suffer the realisation that if such an unlikely being did exist it could suffer that to happen to any of the creatures it had supposedly fashioned in its own image whatever it was that disintegrated in eric then it was a weakness a fundamental flaw that a real man should not have had women i know from watching hundreds maybe thousands of films and television programmes cannot withstand really major things happening to them they get raped or their loved one dies and they go to pieces go crazy and commit suicide or just pine away until they die of course i realise that not all of them will react that way but obviously its the rule and the ones who dont obey it are in the minority there must be a few strong women women with more man in their character than most and i suspect that eric was the victim of a self with just a little too much of the woman in it that sensitivity that desire not to hurt people that delicate mindful brilliance these things were his partly because he thought too much like a woman up until his nasty experience it never really bothered him but just at that moment in that extremity of circumstance it was enough to break him i blame my father not to mention whatever stupid bitch it was threw him over for another man my father must take the blame in part at least because of that nonsense in erics early years letting him dress as he wanted and giving him the choice of dresses and trousers harmsworth and morag stove were quite right to be worried about the way their nephew was being brought up and did the proper thing in offering to look after him everything might have been different if my father hadnt had those daft ideas if my mother hadnt resented eric if the stoves had taken him away earlier but it happened the way it did and as such i hope my father blames himself as much as i blame him i want him to feel the weight of that guilt upon him all the time and have sleepless nights because of it and bad dreams that wake him up in a sweat on cool nights once he does get to sleep he deserves it eric didnt ring that night after my walk in the hills i went to bed fairly early but i know id have heard the phone if it had gone and i slept without a break tired after my long trek the next day i was up at the normal time went out for a walk along the sands in the coolness of the morning and came back in time for a good big cooked breakfast i felt restless my father was quieter than usual and the heat built quickly making the house very stuffy even with the windows open i wandered about the rooms looking out through those opened spaces leaning on ledges scouring the land with closedup eyes eventually with my father dozing in a deckchair i went to my own room changed to a tshirt and my light waistcoat with the pockets filled them up with useful things slung my daypack over one shoulder and set off to have a good look round the approaches to the island and maybe take in the dump too if there werent too many flies i put my sunglasses on and the brown polaroids made the colours more vivid i started to sweat as soon as i stepped out of the door a warm breeze hardly cooling at all swirled uncertainly from a few directions brought smells of grass and flowers i walked steadily up the path over the bridge down the mainland line of the creek and the stream following the course of the burn and jumping its small offshoots and tributaries down to the dambuilding area i turned north then going up the line of the seafacing dunes taking them by their sandy summits despite the heat and the exertion of climbing their southern faces so that i could gain the benefit of the views they offered everything shimmered in that heat became uncertain and shifting the sand was hot when i touched it and insects of all sorts and sizes buzzed and whirred about me i waved them away now and again i used the binoculars wiping the sweat from my brows and lifting the glasses to my eyes inspecting the distance through the heatthick quivering air my scalp crawled with perspiration and my crotch itched i checked the things i had brought with me more often than i usually did absently weighing the small cloth bag of steelies touching the bowie knife and catapult on my belt making sure i still had my lighter wallet comb mirror pen and paper i drank from the small flask of water that i had though it was warm and tasted stale already i could see some interestinglooking pieces of flotsam and jetsam when i looked over the sands and the lapping sea but i stayed on the dunes taking the higher ones when i had to going far north over streams and through small marshes past the bomb circle and the place i had never really named where esmerelda took off i only thought of them after i had passed them after an hour or so i turned inland then south along the last of the mainland dunes looking out over the scrubby pasture where the sheep moved slow like maggots over the land eating once i stood a while and watched a great bird high up against the unbroken blue wheeling and spiralling on the thermals turning this way and that below it a few gulls shifted their wings outstretched and their white necks pointing about as they searched for something i found a dead frog high on a dune dried and bloody on its back and stuck with sand and wondered how it had got up there probably dropped by a bird i put on my little green cap eventually shielding my eyes from the glare i swung down over the path level with the island and the house i kept going still stopping now and again to use the binoculars cars and trucks glinted through the trees a mile or so away on the road a helicopter flew over once most likely heading for one of the rig yards or a pipeline i reached the dump just after noon coming through some small trees to it i sat down in the shade of one tree and inspected the place with the glasses some gulls were there but no people a little smoke drifted up from a fire near its centre and spread around it was all the debris from the town and its area cardboard and black plastic bags and the gleaming battered whiteness of old washing machines cookers and fridges papers picked themselves up and went round in a circle for a minute or so as a tiny whirlwind started then dropped again i picked my way through the dump savouring its rotten slightly sweet smell i kicked at some of the rubbish turned a few interesting things over with one booted foot but could see nothing worthwhile one of the things i had come to like about the dump over the years was the way that it never stayed the same it moved like something huge and alive spreading like an immense amoeba as it absorbed the healthy land and the collective waste but this day it looked tired and boring i felt impatient with it almost angry i threw a couple of aerosol cans into the weak fire bumming in the middle but even they provided little diversion popping effetely inside the pale flames i left the dump and headed south again near a small stream about a kilometre from the dump there was a large bungalow a holiday home looking out over the sea it was closed up and deserted and there were no fresh tracks on the bumpy trail leading down to it and past it to the beach it was down that track that willie one of jamies other friends had driven us in his old mini van to race along the sands and skid about i looked through the windows at the empty rooms the old unmatching furniture sitting in the shadows looking dusty and neglected an old magazine lay on a table one corner yellowed with sunlight in the shade of the gable end of the house i sat down and finished my water took off my cap and wiped my forehead with my handkerchief in the distance i could hear muffled explosions from the range farther down the coast and once a jet came tearing in over the calm sea heading due west away from the house a ridge of low hills started topped with whin and stunted trees shaped by the wind i trained the binoculars on them waving flies away my head starting to ache just a little and my tongue dry despite the warm water i had just drunk when i lowered the glasses and put the polaroids back down i heard it something howled some animal my god i hoped it wasnt a human making that noise screamed in torment it was a rising anguished wail the note produced only by an animal in extremis the noise you hope no living thing ever has to make i sat with the sweat dripping off me parched and aching with the baking heat but i shivered i shook with a wave of cold like a dog shaking itself dry from one end to the other the hair on the back of my neck unstuck itself from the sweat stood i got up quickly hands scrabbling on the warm wood of the house wall binoculars bumping on my chest the scream came from the ridge i pushed the polaroids back up used the glasses again bashing them on the bones above my eyes as i fought with the focusingwheel my hands shook a black shape shot out of the whins trailing smoke it raced down the slope over the yellowspangled grass under a fence my hands bounced the view around as i tried to pan the binoculars to follow it the keen wail sounded over the air thin and terrible i lost the thing behind some bushes then saw it again burning as it ran and jumped over grass and reed raising spray my mouth dried completely i couldnt swallow i was choking but i tracked the animal as it skidded and turned yelping high bounding into the air falling seeming to leap on the spot then it disappeared a few hundred metres from me and about as much down from the ridge of the hill i swept the glasses quickly back up to look at the top of the ridge again scanned along it back down back up along again stopped to stare intently at a bush shook my head scanned the length again some irrelevant part of my brain thought about how in films when people look through binoculars and you see what they are supposed to be seeing its always a sort of figureofeight on its side that you see but whenever i look through them i see more or less a perfect circle i brought the glasses down looked about quickly saw nobody then i sprinted out of the shadow of the house leaped the small wire fence that marked the garden and ran towards the ridge on the ridge i stood for a moment head down to my knees gasping for breath letting the perspiration drip off my hair and on to the bright grass at my feet my tshirt stuck to me i put my hands on my knees and lifted my head straining my eyes to look along the line of whin and trees on the ridges top i looked down the far side and over the fields beyond to the next line of whin which marked the cutting the railway line ran through i jogged along the ridge head sweeping to and fro until i found a little patch of burning grass i stamped it out looked for tracks and found them i ran faster despite my protesting throat and lungs found some more burning grass and a whin bush just catching i beat them out went on down in a small hollow on the land side of the ridge some trees had grown almost normally only their tops sticking out over the lee of the line of small hills leaned out from the sea twisted by the wind i ran into the grassy hollow into the moving pattern of shade provided by the slowly swaying leaves and branches there was a circle of stones around a blackened centre i looked around saw a piece of flattened grass i stopped calmed myself looked around again at the trees and the grass and the ferns but could see nothing else i went to the stones felt them and the ashes in their circle they were hot too hot to keep my hands on them though they were in shade i could smell petrol i climbed out of the hollow and up a tree steadied myself and slowly inspected the whole area using my binoculars when i had to nothing i climbed down stood for a second then took a deep breath and ran down the seafacing side of the hills heading across diagonally to where i knew the animal had been i changed course once to beat out another small fire i surprised a cropping sheep jumped right over it as it startled and bounced away baaing the dog lay in the stream leading out of the marsh it was still alive but most of its black coat was gone and the skin underneath was livid and seeping it quivered in the water making me shiver too i stood on the bank and looked at it it could only see with one unburned eye as it raised its shaking head out of the water in the little pool around it floated bits of clotted halfburned fur i caught a hint of the smell of burned meat and felt a weight settle in my neck just below my adams apple i took out my bag of steelies brought one to the sling of the catapult as i unhooked it from my belt stretched my arms out one hand by my face where it was wetted by sweat then released the dogs head jerked out of the water splashing down then up sending the animal away from me and over on one side it floated downstream a little then bumped caught by the bank some blood flowed from the hole where that one eye had been frankll get you i whispered i dragged the dog out and dug a hole in the peaty ground upstream with my knife gagging now and again on the smell of the corpse i buried the animal looked round again then after judging the slightly stiffened breeze walked away a bit and set fire to the grass the blaze swept over the last bits of the dogs fiery trail and over its grave it stopped at the stream where i had thought it would and i stamped out a few patches of stray fire on the far bank where a couple of embers had blown when it was over and the dog buried i turned for home and ran i got back to the house without incident downed two pints of water and tried to relax in a cool bath with a carton of orange juice balanced on the side i was still shaking and spent a time washing the smell of burning out of my hair vegetarian cooking smells came up from the kitchen where my father was preparing a meal i was sure i had almost seen my brother that wasnt where he was camped i decided but he had been there and i had just missed him in a way i was relieved and that was difficult to accept but it was the truth i sank back let the water wash over me i came down to the kitchen with my dressinggown on my father was sitting at the table with a vest and shorts on elbows on the table staring at the inverness courier i put the carton of orange juice back in the fridge and lifted the lid of the pot where a curry was cooling bowls of salad to accompany it lay on the table my father turned the pages of the paper ignoring me hot isnt it i said for want of anything else hnnh i sat down at the other end of the table my father turned another page head down i cleared my throat there was a fire down by the new house i saw it i went and put it out i said to cover myself its the weather for it my father said without looking up i nodded to myself scratching my crotch quietly through the towelling of the dressinggown i saw from the forecast its supposed to break tomorrow late sometime i shrugged so they said well well see my father said turning the paper back to the front page as he got up to have a look at the curry i nodded to myself again toying with the end of the belt of the dressinggown looking casually at the paper my father bent to sniff the mixture in the pot i stared i looked at him got up went round to the chair he had been sitting in stood as though i was looking out of the door but in fact with my eyes slanted towards the paper mystery blaze in holiday cottage said the bottom eighth of the front page on the lefthand side a holiday home just south of inverness had gone up in flames shortly before the paper went to press the police were still investigating i went back to the other end of the table sat down we eventually had the curry and the salad and i started sweating again i used to think that i was weird because i found that the morning after i had eaten a curry my armpits smelled of the stuff but i have since found that jamie has experienced the same effect so i dont feel so bad i ate the curry and had a banana and some yoghurt along with it but it was still too hot and my father who has always had a rather masochistic approach to the dish left almost half of his i was still in my dressinggown sitting watching the television in the lounge when the phone went i started for the door but heard my father go from his study to answe it so i stayed by the door to listen i couldnt hear much but then footsteps came down the stairs and i ran back to my chair flopped into it and put my head over on one side eyes closed and mouth open my father opened the door frank its for you hm i said slowly opening my eyes gummily looking at the television then getting up a little unsteadily my father left the door open for me and retreated to his study i went to the phone mm hello allahoh zet frenk said a very english voice yes hello i said puzzled hehheh frankie boy eric shouted well here i am in your thorax of the woods and still eating the old hot dogs ho ho so how are ye me young bucko stars going ok for you are they what sign are you anyway i forget canis woof really yeah what sign are you i

their headlights are too close together are ye well frankie eric to bed to sleep perchance to masturbate ah theres the rub ho ho ho eric i said looking round and up the stairs to make sure my father was nowhere in evidence will you shut up what eric said in a small hurt voice the dog i hissed i saw that dog today the one down by the new house i was there i saw it what dog eric said sounding perplexed i could hear him sigh heavily and something clattered in the background dont try to mess me around eric i saw it i want you to stop understand no more dogs can you hear me do you get it well what what dogs you heard youre too close no more dogs leave them alone and no kids either no worms just forget about it come and see us if you want to thatd be nice but no worms no burning dogs im serious eric youd better believe it believe what what are you talking about he said in a plaintive voice you heard i said and put the phone down i stood by the telephone looking upstairs in a few seconds it rang again i picked it up heard pips go and replaced it on the cradle i stayed there for a few more minutes but nothing else happened as i started to go back to the lounge my father came along from the study wiping his hands on a cloth followed by odd smells his eyes wide who was that just jamie i said putting on a funny voice hnnh he said apparently relieved and went back apart from his curry repeating on him my father was very quiet when the evening started to cool i went out just once round the island clouds were coming in off the sea closing the sky like a door and trapping the days heat over the island thunder rumbled on the other side of the hills without light i slept fitfully lying sweating and tossing and turning on my bed until a bloodshot dawn rose over the sands of the island the prodigal i woke from my last bout of restless sleep with the duvet on the floor beside the bed nevertheless i was sweating i got up had a shower shaved carefully and climbed into the loft before the heat up there got too severe in the loft it was very stuffy i opened the skylights and stuck my head out surveying the land behind and the sea in front with my binoculars it was still overcast the light seemed tired and the breeze tasted stale i tinkered with the factory a bit feeding the ants and the spider and the venus checking wires dusting the glass over the face testing batteries and oiling doors and other mechanisms all more to reassure myself than anything else i dusted the altar as well as arranged everything on it carefully using a ruler to make sure all the little jars and other pieces were arranged perfectly symmetrically on it i was sweating again by the time i came down but couldnt be bothered having another shower my father was up and made breakfast while i watched some saturdaymorning television we ate in silence i took a tour round the island in the morning going to the bunker and getting the head bag so i could do any necessary repair work to the poles as i made my way round it took me longer than usual to complete the circuit because i kept stopping and going to the top of the nearest tall dune to look out over the approaches i never did see anything the heads on the sacrifice poles were in fairly good repair i had to replace a couple of mice heads but that was about all the other heads and the streamers were intact i found a dead gull lying on the mainland face of a dune opposite the islands centre i took the head and buried the rest near a pole i put the head which was starting to smell in a plastic bag and stuffed it in the head bag with the dried ones i heard then saw the birds go up as somebody came along the path but i knew it was only mrs clamp i climbed a dune to watch and saw her pedalling over the bridge with her ancient deliverybike i took another look over the pasture land and dunes beyond once she had disappeared round the dune before the house but there was nothing just sheep and gulls smoke came from the dump and i could just hear the steady grumble of an old diesel on the railway line the sky stayed overcast but bright and the wind sticky and uncertain out to sea i could make out golden slivers near the horizon where the water glittered under breaks in the cloud but they were far far out i completed my round of the sacrifice poles then spent half an hour near the old winch indulging in a bit of target practice i set up a few cans on the rusty iron of the drum housing went back thirty metres and brought them all down with my catapult using only three extra steelies for the six cans i set them up again once i had recovered all but one of the big ballbearings went back to the same position and threw pebbles at the cans this time taking fourteen shots before all the cans were down i ended up throwing the knife at a tree by the old sheeppen a few times and was pleased to find i was judging the number of tumbles well the blade whacking into the muchcut bark straight each time back in the house i washed changed my shirt and then appeared in the kitchen in time for mrs clamp serving up the first course which for some reason was pipinghot broth i waved a slice of soft smelly white bread over it while mrs clamp bent to the bowl and slurped noisily and my father crumbled wholemeal bread which appeared to have wood shavings in it over his plate and how are you mrs clamp i asked pleasantly oh im all right mrs clamp said drawing her brows together like a snagged end of wool being unravelled from a sock she completed the frown and directed it at the dripping spoon just under her chin telling it oh yes im all right isnt it hot i said and hummed i went on flapping the bread over my soup while my father looked at me darkly its summer mrs clamp explained oh yes i said id forgotten frank my father said rather unclearly his mouth full of vegetables and wood shavings i dont suppose you recall the capacity of these spoons do you a quartergill i suggested innocently he glowered and sipped some more soup i kept on flapping stopping only to disturb the brown skin that was forming over the surface of my broth mrs clamp sipped again and how are things in the town mrs clamp i asked very well as far as i know mrs clamp informed her soup i nodded my father was blowing at his spoon the mackies dog has gone missing or so i was told mrs clamp added i raised my brows slightly and smiled in a concerned way my father stopped and stared and the noise of his soup dribbling off his spoon the end of which had started to drop slightly just after mrs clamps sentence echoed round the room like piss going into a toilet bowl really i said keeping on flapping what a shame just as well my brothers not around or hed be getting the blame of it i smiled glanced at my father then back at mrs clamp who was watching me with narrowed eyes through the rising steam from her soup dough fatigue set into the piece of bread i was using to fan the soup and it fell apart i caught the falling end smartly with my free hand and returned it to my side plate raising my spoon and taking a tentative sip from the surface of the broth hm mrs clamp said mrs clamp couldnt get your beefburgers today my father said clearing his throat on the first syllable of couldnt so she got you mince instead unions mrs clamp muttered darkly spitting into her soup i put one elbow on the table rested my cheek on a fist and looked puzzledly at her to no avail she didnt look up and eventually i shrugged to myself and carried on sipping my father had put his spoon down wiping his brow with one sleeve and using a fingernail in an attempt to remove a piece of what i assumed to be wood shaving from between two upper teeth there was a wee fire down by the new house yesterday mrs clamp i put it out you know i was down there and i saw it and i put it out i said dont boast boy my father said mrs clamp held her tongue well i did i smiled im sure mrs clamp isnt interested oh i wouldnt say that mrs clamp said nodding her head in slightly confusing emphasis there you see i said humming as i looked at my father and nodded towards mrs clamp who slurped noisily i kept quiet through the main course which was a stew and only noted during the rhubarb and custard that it had a novel addition to the medley of flavours when in fact the milk it had been made from had obviously been most profoundly off i smiled my father growled and mrs clamp slurped her custard and spat her stumps of rhubarb out on to her napkin to be fair it was a little undercooked dinner cheered me up immensely and although the afternoon was hotter than the morning i felt more energetic there were no slits of distant brightness out over the sea and there was a thickness about the light coming through the clouds that went with the charge in the air and the slack wind i went out going once round the island at a brisk jog i watched mrs clamp depart for the town then i walked out in the same direction to sit on top of a tall dune a few hundred metres into the mainland and sweep the sweltering land with my binoculars sweat rolled off me as soon as i stopped moving and i could feel a slight ache start in my head i had taken a little water with me so i drank it then refilled the can from the nearest stream my father was doubtless right that sheep shat in the streams but i was sure i had long since grown immune to anything i could catch from the local burns having drunk from them for years while i had been damming them i drank more water than i really felt like and returned to the top of the dune in the distance the sheep were still lying on the grass even the gulls were absent and only the flies were still active the smoke from the dump still drifted and another line of hazy blue rose from the plantations in the hills coming up from the edge of a clearing where they were harvesting the trees for the pulp mill farther up the shore of the firth i strained to hear the sound of the saws but couldnt i was scanning the binoculars over that view to the south when i saw my father i went over him then jerked back he disappeared then reappeared he was on the path heading for the town i was looking over to where the jump was and saw him climb the side of the dune i liked to power the bike down i had first caught sight of him as he had crested the jump itself as i watched he seemed to stumble on the path just before the summit of the hill but recovered and kept going his cap vanished over the far side of the dune i thought he looked unsteady as though he was drunk i put the glasses down and rubbed my slightly scratchy chin this was unusual too he hadnt said anything about going into the town i wondered what he was up to i ran down the dune leaped the stream and went back to the house at a fast cruise i could smell whisky when i went through the back door i thought back to how long ago we had eaten and mrs clamp had left about an hour an hour and a half i went into the kitchen where the smell of whisky was stronger and there on the table lay an empty halfbottle of malt one glass on its side nearby i looked in the sink for another glass but there were only dirty dishes lying in it i frowned it was unlike my father to leave things unwashed i picked up the whiskybottle and looked for a black biro mark on the label but there was nothing that might mean it had been a fresh bottle i shook my head to myself wiped my forehead with a dishcloth i took off my pocketed waistcoat and laid it over a chair i went out into the hall as soon as i looked upstairs i saw that the phone was off the hook lying by the side of the set i went up to it quickly picked it up it was making an odd noise i replaced it on the cradle waited a few seconds picked it up again and got the usual dialling tone i threw it down and sprinted upstairs to the study twisting the handle and throwing my weight against it it was solid shit i said i could guess what had happened and i had hoped my father might have left the study unlocked eric must have called dad gets the call is shocked gets drunk probably heading for the town to get more drink gone to the offlicence or i glanced at my watch was this the weekend the rob roys allday licence started i shook my head it didnt matter eric must have called my father was drunk he was probably going to town to get more drunk or to see diggs or maybe eric had arranged a rendezvous no that wasnt likely surely he would contact me first i ran upstairs went up into the close heat of the loft opened the landside skylight again and surveyed the approaches through the glasses i came back down locked the house and went back out jogging to the bridge and up the path making detours for all the tall dunes once more everything looked normal i stopped at the place i had last seen my father just on the crest of the hill leading down to the jump i scratched my crotch in exasperation wondering what was the best thing to do i didnt feel right about leaving the island but i had a suspicion that it was in or near the town that things might start happening i thought of calling jamie up but he probably wasnt in the best condition to go traipsing round porteneil looking for father or keeping his nostrils open for the smell of burning dog i sat down on the path and tried to think what would erics next move be he might wait for night to approach i was sure he would approach he wouldnt come all this way just to turn away at the last moment would he or he might have risked enough already in telephoning and consider he had little left to lose by heading for the house right away but of course he might as well have done that yesterday so what was keeping him he was planning something or maybe i had been too abrupt with him on the phone why had i hung up on him idiot perhaps he was going to give himself up or turn tail all because i had rejected him his own brother i shook my head angrily and stood up none of this was getting me anywhere i had to assume that eric was going to get in touch that meant that i had to go back to the house where either he would phone me or he would arrive sooner or later besides it was the centre of my power and strength and also the place i had the most need to protect thus resolved heart lightened now that i had a definite plan even if it was more a plan of inaction than anything else i turned for the house and jogged back the house had grown still more stuffy while i had been away i plonked myself down in a chair in the kitchen then got up to wash the glass and dispose of the whiskybottle i had a long drink of orange juice then filled a pitcher full of juice and ice took a couple of apples half a loaf of bread and some cheese and transported the lot up into the attic i got the chair which normally sits in the factory and propped it up on a platform of ancient encyclopedias swung the skylight facing the mainland right back and made a cushion from some old faded curtains i settled into my little throne and started watching through the binoculars after a while i fished out the old bakeliteandvalves radio from the back of a box of toys and plugged it into the second light fixture with an adaptor i turned on radio three which was playing a wagner opera just the thing to put me in the mood i thought i went back to the skylight holes had broken in the cloudcover in a few places they moved slowly putting patches of land into a brassy glaring sunlight sometimes the light shone on the house i watched the shadow of my shed move slowly round as the late afternoon became early evening and the sun moved round above the frayed clouds a slow pattern of reflecting windows glinted from the new housing estate in the trees slightly above the old part of the town gradually one set of windows stopped reflecting gradually others took their place all punctuated by occasional stabs as windows were shut or opened or cars moved in the council streets i drank some of the juice held ice cubes in my mouth while the hot breath of the house wafted out around me i kept the binoculars on their steady sweepings scanning as far to the north and south as i could without falling out of the skylight the opera ended was replaced by some awful modern music for what sounded like hereticonarack and burning dog which i let play because it was stopping me from getting sleepy just after halfpast six the phone rang i leaped out of the chair dived down the door out of the loft and skidded down the stairs flicking the phone off the cradle and up to my mouth in one clean movement i felt a buzz of excitement at how well coordinated i was today and said quite calmly yes frang my fathers voice said slow and slurred frang iss at you i let the contempt i felt creep into my voice yes dad its me what is it m in the town son he said quietly as though he was about to start crying i heard him take a deep breath frang you know ve always loved you m m callin callin from the town son want you to come here son want you to come come here theyve caught eric son i froze i stared at the wallpaper above the little table in the corner of the turn of the stairs where the phone sat the wallpaper was a leafy pattern green on white with a sort of trelliswork peeping through the greenery in places it was slightly squint i hadnt really noticed that wallpaper for years certainly not in all the years i had been answering the phone it was horrible my father was a fool to have chosen it frang he cleared his throat frank son he said almost clearly then relapsed frang ari therr say somin son s me say somin son ah said they caugh eric ji hear son frang istill therr i my dry mouth tripped me and the sentence died i cleared my throat carefully began again i heard you dad theyve caught eric i heard ill be right in wherell i meet you at the police station naw naw son naw mee me ouside the ouside the libary yeah the libary mee me therr the library i said why there righ see y son mon hurry up eh i heard him clatter the receiver for a few seconds then the line went quiet i put the phone down slowly feeling a sharpness in my lungs a steely sensation that went with the thudding of my heart and my lightened head i stood for a while then went back up the stairs to the loft to close the skylight and turn the radio off my legs were a little sore and tired i realised perhaps i had been overdoing things a bit recently the breaks in the cloud overhead were moving slowly inland as i walked back up the path towards the town it was dark for halfseven a summery gloom of soft light everywhere over the dry land a few birds stirred themselves lethargically as i went past quite a few were perching on the wires of the telephone line snaking its way to the island on skinny poles sheep made their ugly broken noises little lambs bleated back birds sat on barbedwire fences farther on where the snagged tufts of dirty wool showed the sheep trails underneath despite all the water i had drunk during the day my head was starting to ache dully again i sighed and kept on walking through the slowly diminishing dunes and past the rough fields and straggly pastureland i sat down back against sand just before i left the dunes entirely and wiped my brow i flicked a little sweat from my fingers looked out over the static sheep and the perched birds in the town i could hear bells probably from the catholic chapel or maybe the word had spread their bloody dogs were safe i sneered snorted through my nose in a sort of halflaugh and looked over the grass and scrub and weed to the steeple of the church of scotland i could almost see the library from here i felt my feet complain and knew that i shouldnt have sat down theyd be sore when i started walking again i knew damn well that i was just delaying getting to the town just as i had delayed leaving the house after my father had telephoned i looked back at the birds strung like notes along the same wires which had brought the news they were avoiding one section i noticed i frowned looked closer frowned again i felt for my binoculars but i touched my own chest i had left them back at the house i got up and started walking across the rough ground away from the path then i jogged then i ran finally sprinting across the weeds and rushes vaulting a fence on to the pasture where the sheep rose and scattered cackling plaintively i was breathless by the time i got to the telephone line and it was down the freshly cut wire hung against the wood of the landside pole i looked up made sure i wasnt seeing things a few of the birds nearby had flown off and they circled calling in their dark voices through the almost still air over the parched grass i ran down to the islandside pole on the other side of the break an ear covered in short white and black fur and still bleeding was nailed to the wood i touched it and i smiled i looked round wildly then calmed myself again i set my face to the town where the steeple pointed like a finger accusatory you lying bastard i breathed then took off for the island again gathering pace as i went hitting the path and letting rip pounding down its beaten surface careering down to the jump and sailing over it i shouted and whooped then i shut up and kept my precious breath for running i got back to the house yet again and raced up lathered in sweat to the loft stopping briefly at the telephone to check it sure enough it was quite dead i ran on upstairs back to the loft and the skylight took a quick look round with the glasses then got myself together arming and checking i settled back into the chair switched the radio back on and kept looking he was out there somewhere thank god for the birds my stomach thrilled sending a wave of gutjoy through me making me shiver despite the heat that lying old shit trying to lure me away from the house just because he was too frightened to face eric my god i had been stupid not to hear the sheer mendacity in his sodden voice and he had the nerve to shout at me for drinking at least i did it when i knew i could afford to not when i knew id need all my faculties at their peak to deal with a crisis the shit call himself a man i had a few more drinks from the still cool jug of orange ate an apple and some bread and cheese went on scanning the evening darkened quickly as the sun dipped and the cloud closed up the thermals which had opened the holes over the land were dying and the blanket hanging over the hills and the plain reasserted itself grey and featureless after a while i heard thunder again and something in the air turned sharp and threatening i was keyed up and couldnt help waiting for the phone to ring though i knew that it wouldnt how long would it take for my father to realise i was late had he expected me to come by bike had he fallen down in a gutter somewhere or was he already staggering at the head of some posse of townies heading for the island with burning torches to apprehend the dog killer no matter i would see anybody coming even in this light and could go out to welcome my brother or escape the house to hide out on the island if the vigilantes appeared i turned the radio off so i could hear any shouts from the mainland and strained my eyes to search through the fading light after a while i raced down to the kitchen and got a small packed meal together and stuffed it into a canvas bag in the loft it was just in case i did have to leave the house and did meet eric he might be hungry i settled into the seat scanning the shadows over the darkening land in the far distance at the base of the hills lights moved on the road glittering in the dusk flashing like irregular lighthouses through the trees round corners over hills i rubbed my eyes and stretched trying to get the weariness out of my system i thought ahead added some painkillers to the bag i would take out of the house if i had to this sort of weather might bring on erics migraine and he might need some relief i hoped he didnt have one i yawned widened my eyes ate another apple the vague shadows under the clouds turned darker i woke up it was dark i was still in the chair arms crossed under my head resting on the metal surround of the skylight and something a noise inside the house had woken me i sat for a second feeling my heart race feeling my back complain about the position it had been in for so long blood made its painful way into the parts of my arms the weight of my head had restricted the supply to i spun round in the chair quickly and quietly the loft was black but i didnt sense anything i touched a button on my watch discovered it was after eleven i had slept for hours idiot then i heard somebody moving about downstairs indistinct footsteps a door closing other noises glass smashed i felt the hair on the back of my neck go up the second time in one week i clenched my jaw told myself to stop taking fright and do something it might be eric or it might be my father i would go down and find out to be safe i would take my knife i got off the seat went carefully to where the door was feeling my way round the roughness of the chimney bricks i stopped there took the tail of my shirt out and let it hang over my cords concealing the knife where it hung from my belt i eased myself silently down into the dark landing a light was on in the hall right at the bottom and it cast strange sets of shadows yellow and dim up over the landing walls i went along to the banisters looked over the rail i couldnt see anything the noises had stopped i sniffed the air i could smell the smoky pubby smell of drink it must be my father i felt relieved just then i heard him come out of the lounge a noise washed out behind him like an ocean roaring i came away from the rail and stood listening he was staggering bumping off the walls and tripping on the stairs i heard him breathing heavily and muttering something i listened let the smell and sound come up i stood and gradually i calmed myself i heard my father get to the first landing where the phone was then unsteady footsteps frang he shouted i kept still said nothing just instinct i suppose or habit born of all the times ive pretended not to be where i really am and listened to people when they have thought they were alone i breathed slowly frang he yelled i got ready to go back up to the loft shifting back on tiptoe avoiding the places where i knew the floor creaked my father hammered on the door of the firstfloor toilet then cursed when he discovered it was open i heard him start up the stairs towards me his steps pattered irregular and he grunted as he stumbled and hit a wall i went quietly up the ladder swung up and on to the bare wood floor of the loft lay there with my head a metre or so from the hole my hands on the brickwork ready to duck behind the flue if my father attempted to look into the loft from the hole i blinked my father hammered on my room door he opened it frang he shouted again then ah fuck my heart leaped as i lay there i had never heard him swear before it sounded obscene in his mouth not like the casual way eric or jamie said it i heard him breathing under the hole the smell of him coming up through it to me whisky and tobacco the steps again unsteady down the landing then his door and it slamming shut i breathed again only then realising that i had been holding my breath my heart was pounding fit to burst and i was almost surprised my father hadnt been able to hear it booming through the floorboards above him i waited for a while but there were no more noises just that distant white sound from the lounge it sounded as though he had left the television on between channels i lay there gave him five minutes then i got up slowly brushed myself down tucked my shirt in picked up the bag in the darkness attached my catapult to my belt felt around for my waistcoat and found it then with all my gear on crept down the ladder and on to the landing then along it and softly downstairs in the lounge the television sparkled its colourful hiss to an empty room i went to it clicked it off i turned to go and saw my fathers tweed jacket lying crumpled in a chair i picked it up and it jingled i felt through the pockets as i wrinkled my nose at the stench of drink and smoke coming off it my hand closed around a bunch of keys i brought them out and stared at them there was the frontdoor key the backdoor key the cellar key shed key a couple of smaller ones i didnt recognise and another key a key to one of the rooms in the house like the key for my room but a different cut i felt my mouth start to dry up and saw my hand start to shake in front of me sweat sparkled on it beading suddenly in the lines of the palm it might be his bedroom key or i ran upstairs three at a time only breaking rhythm for the noisy ones i went up past the study up to my fathers bedroom the door was ajar its key was in the lock i could hear my father snoring i closed the door gently and ran back down to the study i put the key in the lock and it turned with welloiled ease i stood there for a second or two then turned the handle opened the door i put the light on the study it was cluttered and full stuffy and warm the light in the centre of the ceiling had no shade and was very bright there were two desks a bureau and a camp bed with a mess of sheets lying twisted on it there was a bookcase two large tables standing together covered with various bottles and pieces of chemical apparatus test tubes and bottles and a condenser linked to a sink in the corner the place smelled of something like ammonia i turned stuck my head out of the door into the hall listened heard very distant snoring then took the key and closed the door locking myself in and leaving the key in the door it was as i turned away from the door that i saw it a specimenjar standing on top of the bureau which was placed just to the side of the door and would be hidden from the hall outside by the door when it was open in the jar was clear liquid alcohol i assumed in the alcohol was a tiny torn set of male genitalia i looked at it my hand still on the key i had been turning and my eyes filled i felt something in my throat something from deep in me and my eyes and nose seemed to fill and quickly burst i stood and i cried letting the tears trickle down my cheeks and into my mouth salting it my nose ran and i sniffed and snorted and i felt my chest heave and a muscle in my jaw tremored uncontrollably i forgot all about eric about my father about everything except me and my loss it took me some time to pull myself together and i didnt do it by being angry at myself or telling myself not to act like some stupid girl but i just calmed down naturally and evenly and some sort of weight left my head and settled in my stomach i wiped my face on my shirt and blew my nose quietly then started searching the room methodically ignoring the jar on the bureau maybe that was all the secret there was but i wanted to be sure most of it was junk junk and chemicals the drawers of the desk and the bureau were filled with ancient photographs and papers there were old letters old bills and notes deeds and forms and insurance policies none for me and all expired long since anyway pages from a short story or novel somebody had been writing on a cheap typewriter covered in corrections and still awful something about hippies in a commune in the desert somewhere making contact with aliens there were glass paperweights gloves psychedelic badges some old beatles singles a few copies of oz and it some dry pens and broken pencils rubbish all rubbish then i came to part of the bureau which was locked one section under the rolltop hinged at the bottom with a keyhole in the top edge i got the keys from the door and sure enough one of the small ones fitted the flap hinged down and i took out the four small drawers set behind it and set them on the workingsurface of the bureau i stared at their contents until my legs got shaky and i had to sit down on the rickety little chair which had been halfundemeath the bureau i put my head in my hands and i was shaking again how much was i going to have to go through this night i put my hands into one of the little drawers and took out the blue box of tampons shaking fingers brought out the other box from the drawer it was labelled hormones male inside it were smaller boxes neatly numbered in black biro with dates going about six months into the future another box from a different drawer said kbr which rang a bell somewhere in my mind but only at the very back of it the remaining two drawers contained tightly rolled bundles of five and tenpound notes and cellophane bags with little squares of paper inside i had no spare capacity for trying to work out what any of that other stuff was though my mind was racing with an awful idea it had just formed i sat there staring mouth open and i thought i didnt look up at the jar i thought of that delicate face those lightly haired arms i tried to think of one time i had seen my father naked to the waist but for the life of me i couldnt the secret it couldnt be i shook my head but i couldnt let go of the idea angus agnes i only had his word for anything that had happened i had no idea at all how much mrs clamp could be trusted no idea what sort of hold either of them might have over the other but it couldnt be it was just so monstrous so appalling i stood up quickly letting the chair fall back and whack on the wood of the uncovered boards i grabbed the box of tampons and the hormones took the keys unlocked the door and charged out upstairs stuffing the keys into one pocket and drawing my knife from its sheath frankll get you i hissed to myself i stormed into my fathers room and swtiched on the light he was lying on the bed with his clothes on one shoe was off it lay on the floor under his foot which dangled over the side of the bed he was on his back snoring he stirred and flung one arm over his face turning away from the light i went over to him took the arm away and slapped his face twice hard his head shook and he cried out one eye then the other opened i put the knife up to his eyes watching them focus on it with drunken imprecision the smell of drink off him was foul frang he said weakly i jabbed the knife at him just stopping short of the bridge of his nose you bastard i spat at him what the hell are these i brandished the tampons and the hormones box in front of him with my other hand he groaned and closed his eyes tell me i screamed and slapped him again using the back of the hand holding the knife he tried to roll away from me across the bed under the open window but i pulled him back from the hot still night no frang no he said shaking his head and trying to push my hands away i let the boxes go and got hold of him by one arm tightly i drew him near to me pointed the knife at his throat youre going to tell me or by god i let the words hang i let go of his arm and moved my hand down to his trousers i slipped his belt out of the little guides round the waist he tried to stop me in a fumbling way but i slapped his hands back and prodded him in the throat with the knife i undid the belt and pulled the zip down watching him all the time trying not to imagine what i might find what i might not find i undid the button at the top of the zip i pulled his trousers open pulled his shirt up and out he looked at me lying on the bed with his eyes red and gleaming and he shook his head wha you goin tdo frangie am sorry am really really sorry was an experimen sall juss an experimen don do anything tme please frangie please you bitch you bitch i said feeling my eyes start to blur and my voice shake i pulled hisher underpants down with a vicious tug something screamed outside in the night beyond the window i stood staring at my fathers darkhaired large rather greasylooking cock and balls and something animal out there on the landscape of the island screamed my fathers legs were quivering then came a light orange and wavering where no light should be out there over the dunes and more screams bleatings and baas and screams everywhere screams jesus christ whats that my father breathed turning a shaking head towards the window i stood back then went past the bottom of the bed looking out of the window the awful noises and the light on the far side of the dunes seemed to be coming closer the light was in a halo over the big dune behind the house where the skull grounds were it was flickering yellow with smoketrails in it the noise was like that the burning dog had made but magnified repeated and repeated and with another edge to it the light grew stronger and something came running over the top of the big dune something burning and screaming and running down over the seaface of the skull grounds dune it was a sheep and it was followed by more first another two then half a dozen animals came charging over the grass and the sand in seconds the hillside was covered with burning sheep their wool in flames bleating wildly and running down the hill lighting up the sandy grass and weeds and leaving them burning in their fiery wake and then i saw eric my father came shakily up by my side but i ignored him and watched the skinny dancing leaping figure on the very top of the dune eric was waving a huge burning torch in one hand and an axe in the other he was screaming too oh my god no my father said i turned to him he was pulling his trousers up i pushed past him and ran to the door come on i shouted at him i went out ran downstairs not waiting to see if he was following i could see flames through every window hear the wails of the tortured sheep all around the house i got to the kitchen considered getting some water as i ran through but decided it was pointless i ran out through the porch and into the garden a sheep burning only above its back legs nearly collided with me running through the already blazing garden and swerving at the last second from the door with a terrified baaing then jumping over the low fence into the front garden i ran round the back of the house looking for eric sheep were everywhere fire was all about the grass over the skull grounds was ablaze flames leaped from the shed and the bushes and the plants and flowers in the garden and dead burning sheep lay in pools of livid fire while others ran and jumped about moaning and howling in their guttural broken voices eric was down the steps leading to the cellar i saw the torch he had been holding flickering flame against the wall of the house beneath the window to the downstairs toilet he was attacking the door to the cellar with the axe eric no i screamed i started forward then turned grabbed the edge of the house and stuck my head round the corner to look at the open door of the porch dad get out of the house dad i could hear the sound of splintering wood behind me i turned and ran for eric i jumped over the smouldering carcass of a sheep just before the cellar steps eric turned round and swung the axe at me i ducked and rolled i landed and jumped up ready to spring away but he was back smashing the axe into the door again screaming with each massive blow as though he was the door the axe head disappeared through the wood became stuck he wriggled it mightily and got it out glanced back at me and then heaved the axe at the door again the flames from the torch threw his shadow at me the torch lay propped against the side of the door and i could see the new paint had started burning already i got my catapult out eric had the door almost down my father still hadnt shown eric glanced back at me again then smashed the axe into the door a sheep cried out behind us as i fumbled for a steelie i could hear the crackling of fires on all sides and smell roasted meat the metal sphere fitted into the leather and i pulled eric i yelled as the door gave way he held the axe with one hand picked up the torch with the other he kicked the door and it fell i tensed the catapult one final centimetre i gazed at him through the y of the catapults arms he looked at me his face was bearded dirty like an animal mask it was the boy the man i had known and it was another person entirely that face was grinning and leering and sweating and it beat to and fro as his chest heaved in and out and the flames pulsed he held the axe and the burning brand and the cellar door lay in a wreck behind him i thought i could just make out the bales of cordite darkly orange in the thick and shivering light from the fires around us and the torch my brother held he shook his head looking expectant and confused i shook my head slowly he laughed and nodded halfdropped halfthrew the torch into the cellar and ran at me i almost released the steelie as i saw him come at me through the catapult but just in the last second before my fingers opened i saw he had dropped the axe it clattered off the steps to the cellar as eric dodged past me and i dropped and ducked to one side i rolled saw eric haring away over the garden heading south down the island i dropped the catapult ran down the steps and picked the torch up it was a metre into the cellar nowhere near the bales i threw it outside quickly as the bombs in the blazing shed started to go off the noise was deafening shrapnel whizzed over my head windows in the house blew in and the shed was totally demolished a couple of bombs were blown out of the shed and exploded in other parts of the garden but luckily none came near me by the time it was safe for me to raise my head the shed no longer existed all the sheep were dead or gone and eric had vanished my father was in the kitchen holding a pail of water and a carvingknife i came in and he put the knife down on the table he looked about a hundred years old on the table was the specimenjar i sat down at the head of the table collapsing into the chair i looked at him that was eric at the door dad i said and laughed my ears were still ringing from the explosions in the shed my father stood looking old and stupid and his eyes were bleary and wet and his hands shook i felt myself calm down gradually wha he began then cleared his throat what what happened he sounded almost sober he tried to get into the cellar i think he was going to blow us all up hes run off now ive put the door back up as best i can most of the fires are out you wont need that i nodded at the pail of water he held instead id like you to sit down and tell me one or two things id like to know i sat back in my chair he looked at me for a second then he picked up the specimenjar but it slipped from his fingers fell to the floor and smashed he gave a nervous laugh bent and stood back up holding what had been inside the jar he held it out for me to see but i was looking into his face he closed his hand then opened it again like a magician he was holding a pink ball not a testicle a pink ball like a lump of plasticine or wax i stared back into his eyes tell me i said so he told me what happened to me once far south past even the new house i went to build some dams amongst the sand and the rock pools on that part of the coast it was a perfect calm luminous day there was no line between the sea and the sky and any smoke rose straight the sea was flat on the land in the distance there were some fields set on to a mildly sloping hillside in one field there were some cows and two big brown horses while i was building a lorry came down a track by the field it stopped by the gate reversed and turned so that its rear was facing me i watched through the binoculars as this went on about half a mile away two men got out they opened the back of the truck so that a ramp was formed into its interior wooden slatted sides being folded out to make fences on either side of the ramp the two horses came to watch i stood in a rock pool water round my wellingtons and i cast a watery shadow the men went into the field and led one of the horses out a rope round its neck it went out with no complaint but when the men tried to get it to go into the truck up the tailboard between the skewed slatted sides it shied and refused leaned backwards its mate pressed against the fence beside it i heard its cries seconds late through the still air the horse would not go in some cows in the field looked on then continued munching tiny waves clear folds of light consumed the sand rock weed and shell beside me lapping quietly a bird called in the calmness the men moved the truck away led the horse after it down the track and along an offshoot of it the horse in the field cried out and ran in pointless circles my arms and eyes grew tired and i looked away at the line of hills and mountains marching into the glowing light of the north when i looked back they had the horse inside the truck the truck moved off wheels spinning briefly the lone horse confused again ran from gate to fence and back again first following the truck then not one of the men had stayed behind in the field with it and as the truck disappeared over the brow of the hill he calmed the animal later on my way back home i passed the field with the horse in it and it was quietly cropping the grass i am sitting on the dune above the bunker now in this fresh breezy sunday morning and i am remembering dreaming about that horse last night after my father told me what he had to tell me and i passed through disbelief and fury to stunned acceptance and after we had a look round the outskirts of the garden calling for eric cleaning up the mess the best we could and putting out the remaining small fires after we barricaded the cellar door and went back to the house and he told me why he had done what he had we went to bed i locked my bedroom door and im pretty sure he locked his i slept had a dream in which i relived that evening of the horses then woke early and went out looking for eric i saw diggs coming down the path as i left my father had a lot of talking to do i left them to it the weather had cleared no storm no thunder and lightning just a wind out of the west sweeping all the cloud away out to sea and the worst of the heat with it like a miracle though more likely just an anticyclone over norway so it was bright and clear and cool i found eric lying asleep on the dune above the bunker head in the swaying grass curled up like a little child i went up to him and sat beside him for a while then spoke his name nudged his shoulder he woke up looked at me and smiled hello eric i said he held out one hand and i clasped it he nodded still smiling then he shifted put his curly head on my lap closed his eyes and went to sleep im not francis leslie cauldhame im frances lesley cauldhame thats what it boils down to the tampons and the hormones were for me my father dressing eric up as a girl was just as it turned out a rehearsal for me when old saul savaged me my father saw it as an ideal opportunity for a little experiment and a way of lessening perhaps removing entirely the influence of the female around him as i grew up so he started dosing me with male hormones and has been ever since thats why hes always made the meals thats why what ive always thought was the stump of a penis is really an enlarged clitoris hence the beard no periods and all the rest but he has kept tampons for the last few years just in case my own hormones got the better of the ones he had been pumping me with he had the bromide to stop the added androgen making me feel randy he made a fake set of male genitals from the same wax kit i found under the stairs and made my candles from he was going to confront me with the specimenjar if i ever started to query whether i really was castrated more proof more lies even the stuff about farting was a cheat hes been friends with duncan the barman for years and buys him drinks in return for an informative phone call after ive been drinking in the arms even now i cant be sure hes told me everything though he did seem to be gripped by the urge to confess all and tears were in his eyes last night thinking about it i feel a knot of anger building in my stomach again but i fight it i wanted to kill him there and then in the kitchen after he told me and convinced me part of me still wants to believe its just his latest lie but really i know its the truth im a woman scarred thighs outer labia a bit chewed up and ill never be attractive but according to dad a normal female capable of intercourse and giving birth i shiver at the thought of either i look out at the glittering sea while erics head rests on my lap and i think again of that poor horse i dont know what im going to do i cant stay here and im frightened of everywhere else but i suppose ill have to go what a bummer maybe id consider suicide if some of my relatives hadnt produced such difficult acts to follow i look down at erics head quiet dirty asleep his face is calm he feels no pain i watched the small waves fall on the beach for a while on the sea on that lens of water twicebulged and wobbling and rolling around the earth i am looking at a rippled desert and i have seen it as flat as a salt lake elsewhere the geography is different the sea undulates sways and swells folds into rolling downs under freshening breezes piles into foothills beneath the stiffening trades and finally rears whitetopped and blizzardstreaked in circling mountain ranges rammed by the stormforced wind and where i am where we sit and lie and sleep and look on this warm summers day the snow will fall in a halfyears time the ice and frost the rime and hoar the howling gale born in siberia pushed over scandinavia and swept across the north sea the worlds grey waters and the airs dun skies will lay their cold determined hands on this place make it theirs for a while i want to laugh or cry or both as i sit here thinking about my one life my three deaths four deaths now in a way now that my fathers truth has murdered what i was but i iami still me i iami the same person with the same memories and the same deeds done the same small achievements the same appalling crimes to imyi name why ihowi could i have done those things perhaps it was because i thought i had had all that really mattered in the world the whole reason and means for our continuance as a species stolen from me before i even knew its value perhaps i murdered for revenge in each case jealously exacting through the only potency at my command a toll from those who passed within my range my peers who each would otherwise have grown into the one thing i could never become an adult lacking as one might say one will i forged another to lick my own wound i cut ithemi off reciprocating in my angry innocence the emasculation i could not then fully appreciate but somehow through the attitudes of others perhaps sensed as an unfair irrecoverable loss having no purpose in life or procreation i invested all my worth in that grim opposite and so found a negative and negation of the fecundity only others could lay claim to i believe that i decided if i could never become a man i the unmanned would outman those around me and so i became the killer a small image of the ruthless soldierhero almost all ive ever seen or read seems to pay strict homage to i would find or make my own weapons and my victims would be those most recently produced by the one act i was incapable of my equals in that while they possessed the potential for generation they were at that point no more able to perform the required act than i was talk about penis envy now it all turns out to have been for nothing there was no revenge that needed taking only a lie a trick that should have been exposed a disguise which even from the inside i should have seen through but in the end did not want to i was proud eunuch but unique a fierce and noble presence in my lands a crippled warrior fallen prince now i find i was the fool all along believing in my great hurt my literal cutting off from societys mainland it seems to me that i took life in a sense too seriously and the lives of others for the same reason too lightly the murders were my own conception my sex the factory was my attempt to construct life to replace the involvement which otherwise i did not want well it is always easier to succeed at death inside this greater machine things are not quite so cut and dried or cut and pickled as they have appeared in my experience each of us in our own personal factory may believe we have stumbled down one corridor and that our fate is sealed and certain dream or nightmare humdrum or bizarre good or bad but a word a glance a slip anything can change that alter it entirely and our marble hall becomes a gutter or our ratmaze a golden path our destination is the same in the end but our journey part chosen part determined is different for us all and changes even as we live and grow i thought one door had snicked shut behind me years ago in fact i was still crawling about the face now the door closes and my journey begins i look down at eric again and smile nod to myself in the breeze while the waves break and the wind moves spray and grass and a few birds call i suppose ill have to tell him whats happened to me poor eric came home to see his brother only to find zap pow dams burst bombs go off wasps fry ttssss hes got a sister end
