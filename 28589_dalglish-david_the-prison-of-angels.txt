david dalglish the prison of angels prologue the entire town of norstrom gathered around the rapist yet they could do nothing three of the elders shouted in vain to keep the crowd calm a fourth stood beside colton doing his best to console him they know whats right the old man said rubbing his crooked nose lockes too far gone theyll kill him quick and painless colton glared at the bound fiend the man had been forced to his knees his arms tied behind his back and a rope strung around his neck colton tied the rope himself hoping no one would notice how tightly hed been looping it until it was too late they did notice and locke continued breathing awaiting the mockery to come whats right sure colton said but what about whats best are they not the same colton shook his head right now theyre as far apart as the abyss from the golden eternity the signal had been given from the golden scepter so it would not be long now together townsfolk and rapist waited for the angel to arrive im sorry locke kept crying his words shouted down by the hundred others in attendance all so colton would not hear but he heard anyway and the words put a knife in his gut his poor krista two years old two fucking years old the angel and his executioners blade couldnt arrive fast enough colton he turned saw his wife lily pushing through the crowd to join him she held krista in her arms the childs face pressed against her bosom kristas eyes were shut and she shook as if nightmare hounds howled for her blood reaching him lily leaned in close so she might be heard without shouting come with me she said please colton you dont need to be here you dont need to watch but he did need to watch he had to make sure justice true justice was served im sorry he said he reached out for krista stopping when she flinched her innocence was gone her trust brutalized out of her nothing could describe coltons rage nothing and he turned once more to where the man lay tied in coltons pocket was a slender knife and he clutched it tightly here at last said the elder tugging on coltons sleeve while pointing to the sky flying through the blue came the angel his white wings the same color as the clouds he soared beneath his golden armor shone and when he dove for the town colton felt his breath catch in his throat despite his fury despite the sickening nature of what was to transpire he still felt himself swept with awe even though they had become increasingly commonplace it did not diminish the awesome presence of an angel of ashhur the angel landed just outside the town center and the people quickly gave way so he might approach his hair was a deep white his eyes a sparkling bronze from his hip swung a long blade with a golden hilt i am ezekai and i bring the blessings of ashhur the angel said his voice was deep authoritative the tone of a soldier i saw the signal in the sky and have come what matter requires my aid it was tradition newly begun that elders would describe the crimes but colton would have none of that he pushed to the front determined to hide how much he feared the celestial being before him we have no need of your aid just your sword he said i found this man in my barn atop my daughter still attempting to remove his trousers cut his head off his shoulders and let this be done with ezekais bronze eyes glanced to the bound locke then over coltons shoulders to where his wife and daughter stood your family ezekai asked colton nodded the angel approached and his delicate features softened you have felt a darkness no woman should ever feel he told krista reaching out his hand she flinched but it seemed not to bother ezekai especially so young so very young his hand brushed against her face colton felt a lump grow in his throat as he watched krista immediately relax her grip on lilys neck loosened and then unbelievably she smiled no nightmares will follow you ezekai said softly you will be happy and you will know joy praise be to ashhur said a man beside lily and many others echoed the call colton felt his hands shake and he fought to keep his rage strong he told himself it didnt matter if shed been purged of the awful memories what happened next did ezekai dipped his head in respect to lily then turned his attention to locke the rapist groveled on his knees his face pushed into the ground snot dripped from his nose mixing with the dirt is it true what they say of you the angel asked know that by your words i will judge you and that with my gods blessing i will detect any lie yes locke said ashhur forgive me yes it is coltons jaw trembled ezekai knelt before locke and lifted his chin so they might stare eye to eye locke was an older man rail thin with a hawkish look to him hed never fit in well with the townsfolk and now they all knew why do you understand the sin youve committed ezekai asked i do im sorry please im sorry i cant help it ive tried ive tried please the angel stood locke do you repent of your crime yes yes i do do you seek the grace and mercy of ashhur your god yes locke said sobbing now ezekai looked to the town all eyes were upon him lilys hand slipped into coltons and he squeezed it he speaks with truth and sincerity the angel said at last and it was like a wind blew through the town locke i forgive you of your crimes go and live your life without sin no colton said pulling away from his wife and forcing his way to the front of the crowd that wont work not this time hes sick hes a danger to us to our children shes only two gods damn it and still he tried to take her this is the law we live under the law of ashhur ezekai said colton hated the way the angel looked down at him like he was an ant or a child lockes repentance is real his sorrow genuine of course it is a man would say anything do anything to save his life he doesnt mean it that sorry sack of shit cries only for himself i would know if that were true the angel said shaking his head colton spun addressing the crowd almost daring them to look him in the eye do all of you accept that he asked them do you feel weve seen whats right do you think weve had justice with the decree given the men holding locke released him for fear of the angels wrath the man staggered to his feet still tugging at the ropes around his wrists please colton i beg of you locke said reaching out his hands for coltons shirt forg before any could stop him before any could even think of what he meant to do colton pulled the knife from his pocket and thrust it through lockes right eye it had to be quick he knew had to be fast lest the angel heal him deeper and deeper he shoved the blade and all around he heard screaming men tackled him but he let out a laugh for it was far too late lockes body lay in the dirt arms and legs convulsing you damn fool someone whispered into coltons ear but he didnt know who there was too much commotion too much fear strong men lifted him to his feet men he worked with in the fields and shared stories with at the tavern as they guzzled down ugly betts ale when colton looked up he saw the angel towering over him his bronze eyes stared at the blood on coltons hand he showed no sign of anger or frustration only sorrow i will not ask of your guilt for the blood on you is free for all to see ezekai said before i execute you tell me colton do you repent your crime will you kneel and ask for ashhurs mercy and grace a bitter smile tugged at coltons lips as he struggled against the men holding him repent he asked no not now not ever he heard lily cry out but his heart was pumping too fast his mind lost in a whirl of exhilaration and terror too deep to feel regret locke deserved to die it was the one thing he knew the one thing he firmly believed with every shred of his soul looking upon the angel he would not lie would not disgrace himself with such pathetic sniveling you speak your truth ezekai said as he drew his sword and it saddens me greatly you were a good man colton let there be no doubt the gathered crowd which had fallen deathly silent let out a sudden roar coltons smile grew as he heard it in his mind he heard the chant multiplying felt the anger spreading across mordan like a wave righteous men and women fists to the air crying out against their prison of angels he would be the spark he thought the flame that set the land ablaze stand away ezekai cried and his golden blade circled over his head colton saw the people step back obeying despite their anger just a dream of change thought colton but he clung to it anyway he couldnt think of lily couldnt think of krista growing up without him what hed done was right was best up came the blade youre killing the wrong man colton said his voice rising the wrong man you hear me the wrong man the down came the blade and though it ended his cry it still echoed on and on through villages miles beyond are you sure we have to do this harruq asked as aurelia looked over his armor for what felt like the hundredth time her fingers brushed away dust noticeable only by the sharpest of elven eyes itd look bad his wife said frowning as she adjusted the long red cloak that had been tailored just for the occasion i dont mind looking bad i think i prefer it for antonil harruq grabbed aurelias hands and when she glared up at him he smiled slowly she relaxed leaning her head against his dark leather armor you mean something to them she said as he held her close to all of them and right now antonil needs every bit of love from the crowds he can get harruq let out a defeated sigh i know he said so do i pass inspection close enough for human eyes what of me she twirled in her beautiful elvenstyled dress laced with gold her hair was looped into an intricate design the braids across her forehead looking like a circlet seven emeralds hung from silver thread curled into the braids on either side of her face and each time she twirled they sparkled with magic whyd you marry me again he asked stupidity now lets go we cant keep them waiting forever he extended his arm she took it and together they stepped out from behind the curtain then hooked left down the crimson carpet standing about were dozens of guards in glimmering armor between them stood king antonil copernus large smiles antonil said and the amusement in his eyes made harruq want to smack him royalty or not you owe me harruq muttered the way antonil laughed made the halforc worry greatly that i do the king said youll find out how much soon enough before harruq could enquire further aurelia pulled him along across the last of the crimson carpet over white marble stones and emerged into the roar of the gathered crowds beyond the doors of the great castle of mordeina thousands of people lined either side of the road that led down to the twin walls of the city harruq felt his throat constrict and he forced himself to breathe so many people walk aurelia whispered into his ear hiding the command with a pleased smile harruq forced one foot forward then the other and at last the spell brought on by the crowd broke he grinned feeling like a goof with his free hand he waved to the people guessing it the proper thing to do aurelia kept both her hands on his arm as they walked looking as elegant as a princess down the steps they traveled people hailing him a hero cheering for the mighty godslayer the children in particular pushed hardest to the front crawling if need be to see through the line of soldiers that held back the masses they gawked at his armor and he saw several making motions with their hands knowing what they wanted he chuckled drew condemnation from its sheath and held the black blade above his head to even greater cheers i thought you didnt want to do this aurelia said still smiling i dont harruq said but i might as well enjoy it if you must aurelia said but control your eyes some of the younger girls seem to have problems keeping their blouses on to this harruq sheathed his sword kissed aurelia on the mouth and then hurried on a second roar began and he glanced back to see king antonil exiting the castle flanked by his handpicked guard at first he felt pride knowing his cheer had been louder but worry quickly washed away that feeling it hadnt been just a little louderthe cheer for antonil was weak and fading fast you werent kidding harruq muttered i didnt think it was this bad the farther from the castle they went the rowdier the crowd became and the peoples shouts werent always so joyful catcalls mixed with the cheers and as antonil neared harruq heard them grow stronger traitor someone shouted coward murderer foreigner the worst though the one that echoed throughout the crowd was the title that had haunted antonils reign since his second year all hail the missing king at the very bottom of the hill where the road met the first wall mordans army gathered thirty thousand men all enlisted to retake the east from the horde of orcs that had gone unchecked since the end of the gods war the parade was for their departure the launching of antonils second campaign to retake his homeland much of the celebration was bittersweet but still the underlying anger surprised him was it because of how terrible antonils first attempt at freeing the east from the orcs had gone or was there something more when harruq and aurelia arrived the soldiers drew their swords and raised them high he passed below them a roof of steel above at antonils arrival the blades lifted higher and they let out their cry long live the king echoed by the voices of thirty thousand the words gave harruq chills he felt aurelia squeeze his arm showing she felt it too in the center of the soldiers a wooden platform had been hastily constructed on it were two seats one was empty waiting for antonil to take his place in the other sat susan copernus his wife of five years she was young and slender her milky skin powdered into an almost ghostly white her brown hair was looped similarly to aurelias only with less intricacy and more jewels up the stairs of the platform they stepped the two taking their designated spot beside the queen were you lonely waiting for us harruq asked her as antonil climbed the steps i daily count the hours until you grace my presence she said her voice was deathly serious but he could see the laugh shimmering in her eyes its all right said tarlak eschaton standing on the other side of the thrones i kept her entertained until your arrival harruq grinned at the yellowrobed wizard his red hair and beard were neatly trimmed but age lines had started to show across his cheeks and beneath his eyes still his smile was youthful and his hat pointy as ever you got roped into this as well harruq asked roped nonsense you brute i volunteered to spare the queen the indignity of begging for my presence come now susan said i love you both equally though i fear i do not love you as much as the commoners do a shame you had to land the killing blow on the war god antonil said to harruq having heard them he reached out his hand and his wife stood to accept it my life would be much easier had it been me you slew a dragon harruq said whats a dragon compared to a god enough susan said kissing antonils cheek do not belittle your accomplishments im not the one belittling them antonil said and the kings words were tinged with frustration despite it he turned to the crowd lifted his arms and smiled his best smile the crowd cheered but not long the procession was not quite complete directly above the wooden platform high amid the clouds floated the golden city of avlimar from its tall arches its silver buildings and its thin lengthy bridges descended hundreds of angels their white wings filling the sky they flung petals of flowers as they crisscrossed about which fell upon the crowds like rain as the pinks and violets landed atop his hair and shoulders harruq held out a hand little much isnt it he asked as petals gathered in his palm aurelia leaned close antonils not the only one trying to win people over she whispered all along the walls of the city the angels landed keeping their wings stretched to their fullest extent their skin was of all colors their hair shining the whiteness of their robes matched only by the feathers of their wings a low moan came from their throats a deep chant that reverberated throughout the city louder and louder it grew and as one they drew their swords and shouted the name of their god ashhur the force it nearly knocked harruq off his feet he shook his head as many others hurried back to standing thats one way to make an entrance he muttered the leader of the angels landed before them just beyond the platform he did not need its height to stare at them eye to eye for he was a giant of an angel his golden armor gleaming his name was ahaesarus and it was at his side that harruq and aurelia had fought to slay the war god thulos preventing him from conquering the world of dezrel beside ahaesarus landed his war general judarius and his high priest azariah the two were eerily similar with green eyes tinged with gold and their brown hair cut short around their necks but where judarius wore armor and carried an enormous mace upon his back azariah had only his robes and his soft hands skilled at clerical magic together the three bowed to antonil who stood and bowed in return harruq dipped his head in respect heroes of mankind king and queen of mordan i greet you said ahaesarus his voice was deep befitting one so giant this day you march against blasphemous beings know that ashhur gives you his blessing and with loving eyes he will watch over your homeland in your absence you will always have a safe home to return to king antonil copernus and the arms of friends ready to embrace you ahaesarus drew his sword a masterful construction of steel gold and diamond that was as tall as harruq he held it with both hands above his head and he cried out his words repeated by the rest of the angels ashhur bless the king they cried ashhur bless the king that was it the last of the ceremony so far as harruq knew he let out a sigh glad he hadnt screwed anything up but antonil stood and he looked far from relaxed ahaesarus bowed to him then stepped away so the crowd might see their king harruq shot aurelia a glance but his wife only shrugged tomorrow we march antonil said at first it was hard to hear him but a quick twitch of tarlaks fingers and his voice strengthened magically carrying throughout the city with me march your sons your husbands your lovers and protectors i swear to protect them honor them and let not a single life lost be in vain in my absence my beautiful wife rulesat least she would if circumstances were different susan smiled and that smile filled harruq with terror he knew that smile that glow not good he thought antonil you bastard you better not be doing what i think youre about to my wife carries my second child antonil told the crowd scattered applause accompanied his words and i would not burden her further during such a time so now before you all i appoint my steward he is a man well known to you whose bravery is unquestioned and whose strength none would dare challenge he will guard my throne in my absence administering the kings justice harruq felt ready to explode the godslayer harruq tun antonil announced over the roar of the crowd harruq come stand before me he felt aurelia squeeze his hand and he fought to remain calm the eyes of the kingdom were upon him the thought of messing up terrified him as did ruling as a steward but to reject antonil publicly would be an insult the kings fragile reputation could not endure so he stepped before antonil doing his best to hide his glare from hundreds of onlookers kneel antonil said and harruq did harruq tun i declare you steward of mordan and protector of the realm rise and rule in my absence harruq stood and he leaned forward so he could speak just to the king im going to murder you he said you have no need to repay me antonil responded for there is no debt to repay just rule well as i know you will at first harruq was confused by his words but the spell was still on antonil and the kings voice carried throughout the city the halforc shook his head sly devil hed murder antonil twice now for this a fine choice azariah said putting a hand on harruqs shoulder if there is anything you need any question my knowledge is open to you thanks harruq said glancing around with wide eyes he felt like a trapped deer with a crown placed upon his head by a pack of wolves unsure what else to do he waved to the crowd they cheered back and he prayed he might live up to their jubilation did they really think hed do any better than antonil that was it then the last of the procession the soldiers were dismissed to spend the night with their loved ones or get drunk one last time with friends they scattered among the people who hurried to one of dozens of carnivals set up as part of the celebration the angels took wing with only the ruling three remaining behind i hope authority doesnt make you grow fat and lazy judarius said smiling at him you still owe me a sparring match or three i have bigger fears than that harruq said spinning on antonil have you lost your damn mind me steward why not place a donkey in charge for all the good ill do he makes a good point tarlak said either way wed have an ass sitting on the throne dont panic susan said leaving her seat so she might kiss harruq on the cheek ill be here the whole time you wont be left to hang harruq rubbed his neck a hanging sounded more preferable than sitting on antonils throne and listening to hours and hours of complaints pleadings and accusations antonil a word with you if i may ahaesarus asked and antonil nodded harruq come with us the king said ahaesarus up to that wall if youd please the angel grabbed each by an arm and with a flutter of his wings they soared into the air moments later they landed atop the inner wall of the city which was now completely empty suddenly free of the crowd harruq felt his stomach unclench for the first time in an hour much better harruq said turning on antonil now care to tell me what just happened down there im sorry harruq i thought youd say no if i asked you any other way antonil you know my place is with you and your army i kill things with swords thats what i do just because your wife is pregnant doesnt mean i should but shes not pregnant ahaesarus said crossing his arms and frowning at antonil is she harruqs jaw dropped antonil shook his head no he said its just a ruse to justify harruqs appointment as steward two deaths wasnt enough harruq decided now it was up to three you tread dangerous ground the angel said you made us complicit in your lie and neither i nor my angels appreciate this in the slightest what he said harruq grumbled i have my reasons antonil insisted harruq please listen to me not as your king but as your friend the halforc sighed nodding at antonil fine he said im all ears antonil turned and from the wall he gestured to the grand city of mordeina and its castle upon the hill this isnt my home he said i hoped otherwise but nothing has changed over the past five years my home my heart and my kingdom are all in the east ruled by tribes of orcs the people know this and because of that they resent me youre not a fool youre not deaf surely you hear their rumblings better than i harruq crossed his arms and refused to look him in the eye of course you hear it antonil said and he let out a groan too many resent my power as do they resent the angels this is the chance my enemies have been waiting for i cannot leave susan alone i wont risk her life not now so be the figurehead i need you to be susan will run all the important matters and truth be told thats not much different than how it has been but i wont let her be intimidated i wont let others think she can be bullied or usurped the people love you respect you even fear you you want me to take the danger while your wife rules in secret harruq said is that what youre asking will you deny it harruq who has less to fear from an assassins dagger you or my wife who in my kingdom has the presence to intimidate you and what of my family harruq asked what of my daughter only a madman would dare harm the child of harruq and aurelia tun antonil said and he smiled to hide his discomfort at the notion but your daughter will be with my son theyll be guarded together protected together im putting everything in your hands harruqmy family my son my entire kingdom can i trust you well be here watching ahaesarus said trying to comfort the halforc avlimar is close and if you are in need we will always be at your side you have nothing to fear harruq glanced back and forth between them then hung his head in surrender if im a steward he asked does that mean i have to wear a stupid crown nonsense antonil said smiling youre in charge now youll wear what you like or at least what aurelia will let you harruq laughed a crown it is he said now fly me down im not ruling just yet and until i am i plan on finding out how much of your alcohol i can drink before passing out the ax came down with a thunk easily splitting the log in half qurrah tun wiped a bit of sweat from his brow he prespired not from exertion but from the heat controlling the undead being with the ax required little effort on his part with a slow but steady motion his undead servant pushed the split wood to the side bent down for another log and set it before him on the heavy stump qurrah the halforc looked up from where he sat leaning against a tree with a book in his lap yes tess tessanna came around the side of their cabin as the ax fell splitting another log her long black hair ran all the way down to her waist a single braid looped around her forehead pulling her bangs away from her face despite her plain brown dress she looked like a goddess to qurrah with her pale skin slender body and eyes so black only a hint of white showed at the edges the only mar upon her perfection were her arms laced with dozens of scars most of them selfinflicted someones coming she said well then lets meet him at the road he said putting his book away hes not using the road qurrah let out a sigh the arrival of an angel may not always bring bad news but it did mean complications they were stretched too thin across mordan to dally with trivial things then let him come to us he said taking her hand you arent nervous are you tessanna smirked at him with the two of us together it would take many many more angels to make me nervousand only if i had a reason do we have a reason to be nervous it could be sad news perhaps a death in the family id know before they qurrah took her hand and together they walked to the front of their cabin he believed her shed always had a strange connection to his family especially since the tragedy with aullienna the thought stung him and he forced his mind to think of other things if something bad had happened to harruq aurelia or especially his daughter aubrienna hed have heard of it long before an angel could make the flight from mordeina mind distracted he almost missed the landing of the angel who softly curled about in the air so his feet touched ground with nary a sound his hair was short brown and his green eyes sparkled with gold welcome to our meager home azariah qurrah said you risk much coming to me your kind isnt welcome within kers borders i come as an ambassador not an enforcer azariah said besides when i am in the sky who in dezrel might harm me i could if i still had my wings tessanna said picking at the hem of her dress but i dont need them anymore at least i hope not no angel would dare pretend to know the goddesss intentions azariah said turning to her but your power may have waned for a reason and it might return with equal reason celestia would not leave you helpless should a need arise she smiled at him so beautifully but qurrah sensed the daggers hiding behind it helpless she said and a brief flicker of flame passed from her palm across her knuckles and back into her fingers where she snuffed it i have forfeited my wings and the power of a goddess is no longer mine but do not think me helpless angel it would be poor sport watching you try to fly with your wings ablaze qurrah put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed as azariah dipped his head low to show he meant no disrespect it is wrong of me to be so careless with my words the angel said especially since you and i are in such similar situations qurrah heard the thunk of an ax and he turned around to see his pet flailing at the log which hed failed to fully split frowning he waved a hand at it ceasing all functions until he could deal with it later when he turned back he caught azariah frowning at him your power still wanes qurrah asked trying to prevent a conversation he had no patience for it does azariah said walking toward their cabin it is strange for i cannot decipher the reason not all of our kind suffer like i the warriors and enforcers still retain their abilities limited as they are we can still calm troubled minds and sense truth from lie but more and more our priests struggle to have our prayers answered it is a humbling thing qurrah to go from the mightiest priest of our lord to a mere winged man who even the lowliest scoundrel could pierce with his sword humility in an angel qurrah said smiling at azariah and to think you act like the age of miracles has passed it is with humility i can accept the coming changes and prepare for them my priestly spells vanish perhaps it is our descent to this world our proximity to its sin and corruption perhaps ashhur slumbers or celestias control over him has increased in response to the war that sundered her land none of these things can i change he opened the door to their cabin holding it so the two might enter first tessanna took qurrahs arm hovering close beside him as if she were afraid normally qurrah would think it an act but there was never any knowing with tessanna her mind while worlds better than when he first met her was still a fragile thing and rarely predictable inside the cabin was their bed a small table and a dormant fireplace it wasnt much especially compared to the splendor his brother now lived in but it was theirs given how he and tessanna had nearly destroyed all of dezrel it felt like luxury enough how fares my brother he asked as he thought of harruq he sat in a chair beside the table and tessanna sat next to him her head leaning against his shoulder i will speak of him soon enough azariah said flashing an indecipherable smile he is the reason i came but i would first make a request before i lose my courage i cannot change the loss of my power but i can adapt i can embrace this new world we are to rule qurrahcan you share with me your knowledge of the arcane arts it took a moment before qurrah could compose his thoughts you want meto teach you is it so strange azariah asked my hands were not meant to hold a blade tell me could you take up your brothers swords with any degree of skill well no then why should others expect the same of me i once wielded great power i would do so again he would be the perfect pupil tessanna whispered into his ear he is an angel after all her giggle showed her true opinion on the matter however there must be better teachers than i qurrah said what about tarlak he even lives in mordeina he travels with king antonil on their campaign to retake the east and i cannot afford to be away for such a lengthy time qurrahs brain scrambled for other alternatives the council of mages he said what of them azariah shook his head if you think ker carries a distrust of my kind you should hear the opinions of the council no they will not teach me neither will the elves for those who still bear the gift of magic in their blood are closely guarded and are not prone to sharing not all of them qurrah insisted im sure aurelia would be willing to you must understand something azariah interrupted i hold a position of great respect should mortals hear of my training i would be mocked or doubted there are many of my own kind who distrust the learning of magical spellcasting even a few who would declare it blasphemous that you are here acting the recluse helps put my mind at ease concerning this matter i could teach you tessanna said wait a moment qurrah said wait from what i know of you i fear i would not be an appropriate student azariah said magic comes to you easily and its very nature is unpredictable but i will acceptshould your husband have no objections their eyes turned on qurrah and he felt like a caged animal tessannas fingers played with the neckline of his shirt and the tension in her shoulders told him she feared his rejection letting out a sigh he kissed the top of her head we will both teach you as best we can he said though i fear you will have a lengthy flight between every lesson perhaps not azariah said but speaking of lengthy flights do you have something i might drink tessanna retrieved a woodcarved cup from a cupboard filled it with water from a pitcher and then dipped her finger inside wine she said handing it over dont worry it is very weak many thanks azariah said putting the cup to his lips he drank until it was gone much better he said setting it down now about your brother and our training ive come to ask you to return to mordeina you dont need to live next to him if you would prefer some separation but i think it would be helpful to have you two nearby in case something goes wrong is aubrienna in danger tessanna asked a bit of life leapt into her wide gaze i do not know azariah said and it pains me greatly to admit even that the shadow of avlimar should be a safe place but mordeina still bears many sinful hearts but why qurrah asked what has he done to earn himself enemies the feathers in azariahs wings ruffled antonil appointed harruq steward over the kingdom in his absence the angel said with a sigh the king is not beloved and those scheming against him will turn those schemes upon your brother i fear his life will soon be in danger before qurrah knew it tessannas hand had slipped into his he squeezed it tight then met azariahs green eyes with his own we will need time to decide he said and time you will have azariah said pushing back open the door to their cabin ill be flying northeast to meet with the paladins though i wont be staying long when my business with them concludes i will return here for your answer qurrah nodded but he did not stand for the angels exit another dip of his head in respect and then azariah left the cabin with a heavy gust of air the angel soared skyward leaving them once more alone in their cabin the tranquility theyd had before though was shattered qurrah said nothing only sat at the table frowning as he tried to make sense of his jumbled thoughts knowing his brother might be in danger brought out the strong instinct in him to go to his aid but things were just not that simple when the great betrayer of veldaren traveled somewhere he did not go unnoticed you want to go dont you tessanna asked him as she stood from the table but youre also afraid i am tessanna stood before their bed and crossed her arms over her chest she glanced over her shoulder let her hair fall over her face would you like to have me she asked help clear your mind he rubbed his eyes then blinked as she tossed off her dress sure he said why not it did indeed help clear his mind afterward they lay naked together the light of the cabin dwindling as the sun descended below the tree line tessannas hands traced unseen runes across his chest her eyes staring into nowhere if you want to go we should go she said if that oafs a steward then all of mordan balances on a precarious peace he said our arrival might do more harm than good you dont know that tessanna said her fingers pinching the skin of his chest the angels forgave you everyone knows you slew karaks prophet and what of your stand at the bridges you gave your life for them for all of them no one survived to tell the tale you and i survived all the more reason not to tell stories they wont believe it and they wont care im the man who helped burn veldaren to the ground i helped open the portal to let the demons in to come to mordeina and insist on aiding harruq would be disastrous my very presence will contaminate him im the one who let in the war god tessanna said im the one who pushed you to velixar do i contaminate you qurrah would you go alone leave me here to protect the cabin from the forests encroach he fell silent trying to decide the right words to say you are my everything he told her if we go we go together but the angels forgiveness means nothing not to the people i know they hate me and they have every reason to thats why we came here tess is that why to hide to make a new life to start over she sat up the blanket falling away to expose her thin body her spine faintly visible in the dying light her arms crossed holding herself as if she were cold if that is why were here then its not a new life she said her head dipping low her eyes downcast its a prison i ask you againdo you want to help harruq yes he said i do then were going old sins and angry peasants be damned were not the enemy not anymore he took her in his arms and pulled her back down to the bed if were not then who is he asked her as he held her close what if there isnt one the people must always have a villain she curled around so they lay face to face if they must then theyll find another and another the orcs the elves the people of ker the angels her dark eyes stared into his then harruq needs our help all the more i have watched him suffer enough he wont again and not for that not for aubrienna even if all the realm crumbles she must live she must she slipped free of their bed and naked she left the cabin qurrah lay there for a moment almost giving her the privacy she wanted but what if that wasnt what she wanted he didnt know he never knew tossing aside the blanket he went to the door and peered out the sight stole away his breath and he was fearful of revealing his presence sorrow tugged at his heart and he felt painfully helpless tessanna stood in the glimmer of the rising moon her arms were raised heavenward her head tilted back as if she might drink in the light of the stars a soft wind encircled her coming from nowhere and everywhere words of magic flowed from her lips gathering shadows for the briefest moment she lifted up the grass touching just the tips of her toes and then she fell so softly so gently back down to the ground no tears ran from her eyes but the sorrow was there as easy to see as her stark black hair qurrah turned away feeling like an intruder into the cabin he went shutting the door behind him his lower lip trembled in his head he kept seeing it the image of her rising rising as if she were still the goddess rising as if she still had her wings lathaar was in his study when someone knocked twice on the door before pushing it open is he here he asked as jerico platemail armor finely polished and shield slung over his back stepped inside well its a flying visitor jerico said but not dieredon hurry id hate to keep an angel waiting lathaar let out a sigh grabbing his swords he followed jerico down a single flight of stairs into the main foyer and then out the large wooden double doors of the rebuilt citadel in the buildings shadow the two paladins stood and looked to the western sky far away looking barely bigger than a bird lathaar saw the angel where are the students he asked ive got them around back sparring figured the distraction would do them good in case any noticed the angels arrival id like to hold a conversation without fifteen hundred questions interrupting it discipline jerico we need to teach them discipline that you fear them acting unruly is a poor sign jerico laughed its because they are an unruly bunch take heart though i dont think we were so much better back when we were in the citadel lathaar grinned speak for yourself i was a model pupil no wonder youre so bland the angel neared and now those white wings were greater than any bird that had ever lived he wore no armor just a robe tightly cinched due to the constant force of the wind after a quick loop above the citadel he banked downward coming to a gentle stop before the two paladins they both bowed low humbled by a visit from the high priest of the angels it has been too long azariah lathaar said you havent graced us with your presence since the day the last brick was put into the citadel azariah smiled at him indeed and i was hardly needed then you two had the energy of children you were so excited good thing too jerico said because the children we took in had far more energy than us lathaar ran a hand through his brown hair trying to hide his nervousness something about azariah felt unsettling as if the angel were terribly uncomfortable but why do you come bearing news he asked hoping to pry out the reason the best we receive here are rumors from traders and theyre as consistent as the direction of the wind no news that would concern you azariah said as he began walking toward the back of the citadel where the young paladinstobe sparred the two followed and a glance showed lathaar that his friend also felt similarly confused by the visit just the usual politics in the capitol antonil has launched another campaign to retake the east but im sure you already know of that just that it was being planned jerico said i was hoping hed delay for a few more years id love some of our students to be old enough to accompany the campaign paladins would do well to lead the troops on the battlefield but it seems antonil could not be persuaded otherwise hrm are these your students before them were thirty children all fairly close in age the youngest were twelve the oldest sixteen jerico had grouped them by age and they sparred with a variety of wooden swords and daggers a few also held thin sheets of tin to use as shields at sight of the angel many stopped and turned several wise enough to also bow jerico clapped his hands at them ushering them back to their practice i should get to instructing jerico said tipping his head to azariah if there is nothing else no go the infants in ashhur are most precious to our future as is their need for discipline jerico shot lathaar a look then went to the circle with the youngest children pointing out the flaws in their stance as they ran their drills lathaar watched him for a moment then noticed azariah surveying the students have you come to inspect our recruits lathaar asked him more out of curiosity than anything azariah said you drill them strongly in marshal matters though i wonder if their faith is given the same testing of mettle lathaar let out a sigh itd been something hed discussed repeatedly with jerico and over the years theyd not come to any sort of satisfactory answer we try he said figuring if there was anyone who might help them in this it was azariah we teach them the prayers the lessons beat into their heads the ferocious need for prayer but this world we live inits not the same is it how do i teach them matters of faith when ashhurs angels soar through the clouds how do i teach them to remain on guard against enemies when karak has been defeated and his followers scattered to the wind how do i convince them they are beacons of light amid the darkness when there is no darkness but there is darkness azariah assured him the world has not ended it still moves on filled with sickness death and despair i tell them lathaar said shaking his head i tell them and i dont think they believe me their faith is hollow azariah i know it i feel it in my gut so few of them carry any true love for ashhur when they hold their weapons only the slightest hint of blue shines and if they were to be tested truly tested ashhur save us if someone like velixar should get their hands on them when jerico and i were in the citadel we were outnumbered we were seen as a dying order soon to be overwhelmed by karaks forces in every prayer every day of training we knew deep down in our hearts that we were the last hope for a troubled world the last stand against an encroaching evil but we arent anymore he looked to azariah you are this took the angel back and he paused you give us a role we cannot have azariah said after a moment of watching the students train your paladins are what men must aspire to be they are to be the light of our god manifested in mortal men to show humanitys full potential by embracing ashhurs commands we angels cannot be that we are not men and mankind will never believe us never understand us until they themselves enter the golden eternity a sickness runs through this land and it must be cured convince them lathaar convince them their need is not yet over lathaar nodded and he felt a little better hearing those words perhaps hed been looking at things the wrong way rebuilding the citadel had been a mark of honor for him and jerico theyd begged for every scrap of coin with their close relationship to harruq the kings advisor tarlak and the angels it should have been easy getting aid but all of mordan had been devastated and the first year in particular had been one of frantic rebuilding and political upheaval through it all theyd fought determined to have their home rebuilt in defiance to karaks past evil but theyd rebuilt the citadel simply to rebuild it and now pressed with the functions the responsibility he and jerico were struggling had their own aimlessness poisoned their students youve given me much to think over he said thank you i am glad i could be of some help and do not be too difficult on yourself i sense the faith of those here and there are many who are stronger than you believe to help ease your mind i will show you azariah stepped into the training arena and lifted his hands immediately all eyes were upon him lathaar watched arms crossed curious as to what the angel planned his robe shimmered white and from his mouth issued words of a prayer too soft for lathaar to hear come to me children azariah said afterward come to me faithful i would see your hearts naked before the eyes of your god from the tips of his fingers flared a sudden brightness coalescing into a shining ball of white like a miniature sun hovering above his palms it pulsed and with each pulse a wave of light washed over the paladins and students the force of it knocked them to their knees even jerico fell to one knee and lathaar did the same in his mind he felt a sudden closeness to ashhur a presence hed not known since the last days of the gods war before it he felt naked and afraid the light grew brighter and he opened his mouth to speak to cry out all around the world had vanished so that he saw only darkness where the grass and the rivers should have been piercing that darkness was azariah a being so unearthly that it filled lathaar with awe before a cry escaped his lips he saw a light burning from within his chest where his heart should be the bluishwhite glow was strong and as he knelt it continued to grow so that it nearly enveloped him a thought struck him he reached for his sword and as he drew it the glow from his chest swirled down his arm and into the blade manifesting itself again looking around he saw his students all kneeling and from their chests emerged similar glows just as azariah said many were strong bright filled with life and devotion jerico in particular was nearly blinding to look upon but also he saw dimness in many emptiness it hurt him seeing it and he could not help but feel responsible the darkness broke and the light vanished it happened so suddenly lathaar let out a gasp how long had it been he didnt know what had felt like minutes may have only been seconds so strangely that vision had distorted time colors rushed back into his eyes the green of the surrounding hills the gentle blue of the rigon river rolling beside the citadel the students rose to their feet one by one some muttering to themselves others praying jerico shot him a look but what it meant he couldnt decipher and then he saw azariah the angel knelt on his hands and knees gasping for air his wings shivered and feathers fell like leaves in an autumn wind lathaar reached down for him but his offered hand went ignored with a loud groan azariah pushed himself to stand his bearing was unsteady but with each passing moment the color returned to his face and the firmness returned to his voice i hope you gained what you needed azariah said turning to go wait lathaar said hurrying after him is something wrong you look i am fine azariah said interrupting him ino lathaar you do not deserve such harshness ashhurs power is fading from me fading from all of us when did you last talk to one of your priests lathaar frowned high priest keziel stayed here a few months before returning to the sanctuary but that was not long after we first rebuilt the citadel a few have traveled here from time to time but not recently no they suffer same as i the world of dezrel is fading paladin and the celestial magic i once possessed fades with it forgive me but i came here to see if your kind felt it as well but it appears the glow of your blades remains strong praise ashhur for that lathaar said the angel fell silent deep in thought lathaar stood there giving him time shifting his weight side to side he glanced up at the sky then chuckled it seems youre not our only winged visitor today he said they both looked upward to where an elf in dark green camouflage rode atop the back of a beautiful winged horse her white wings the only thing that could match the splendor of the angels the elf circled twice then dove low landing just before the two with inhuman grace he leapt from the horses back and in unison the creature and master bowed the elfs hair was long and brown carefully tied so it would not interfere with his vision or movements from his back hung a wicked looking bow attached to leather straps that wrapped about his chest and shoulders greetings said dieredon scoutmaster of the quellan elves i come as requested though forgive me for the delay the vile wedge has gotten far wilder in the past few years im just glad youre safe lathaar said bowing in return he glanced at azariah noticed a hardness in the angels eyes that worried him i must be leaving said azariah i still have much to do trust your students lathaar and have faith in them should ashhur be kind they will repay that faith tenfold with a curt nod to dieredon azariah spread his wings and then leapt into the air lathaar watched him go careful to reveal nothing to his elven guest have i done something to offend dieredon asked lathaar shook his head no it just seems that even angels can have a long day but lets not think on that im glad youre here dieredon im in need and youre the best person imaginable to help me ask and i will do what i can my friend lathaar led him back around the citadel to where the students had resumed training they passed through the various age groups gathered together in small circles most wielded swords and shields trading blows as they searched for openings in their sparring partners defenses further back they passed a few who wielded swords in each hand and many others wielding maces like their trainer jerico but at the very far end sat a young lady her chestnut hair cut at the shoulders and then pulled into a ponytail unlike the others she wore soft leather gloves and in her lap was a bow jessilynn lathaar said drawing her attention upward she smiled until she saw the elf and then the smile fled her face immediately she leapt to her feet fumbling through a bow at sixteen she was one of the oldest students at the citadel but to dieredon she was but a child nothing compared to his centuries of life you must be dieredon jessilynn said her eyes staring at the dirt jerico and lathaar have told me so much about you consider me honored to be in your presence wellspoken dieredon said crossing his arms though i fear your teachers stories paladins may not lie but i still believe they are prone to exaggeration nothing of the sort lathaar said grinning jessilynn fire a few arrows at a target dont be nervous either jessilynn nodded and without looking at either of them she grabbed her bow and turned around thirty yards away was a bale of hay and leaning in front of it were several planks of wood that served as targets for a moment jessilynn dipped her head closed her eyes and began to pray she was part of our inaugural class lathaar whispered to dieredon it was a big stink too our very first female paladin plenty of the priests were furious but azariah declared it good and that ended the grumblings our younger classes have more now and it isnt the trouble or difficult matter we thought itd be as for jessilynn to be honest her skills with a sword arent very impressive and neither can she wield a shield with any sort of grace but the bow lying at her feet were a pile of arrows and with her prayer finished jessilynn leaned down to grab one pressing it against the string she pulled it taut then hesitated as she did a soft blue began to glow from the arrowhead then she let it fly it arced through the air leaving behind it a bluewhite trail the arrow missed the wooden targets instead vanishing into the hay with a brief flicker of light dieredon looked at lathaar an eyebrow raised in response lathaar just shook his head it gets crazier he said jessilynn another she grabbed a second arrow and this time she looked far less tight as she nocked it for flight after another moment of hesitation she let it fly its aim was true striking a thin board in the center of the hay bale upon contact the wood shattered as if blasted by an enormous hammer onward the arrow continued vanishing into the hay seeing the explosion jessilynn hopped once in the air her ponytail bouncing now both of dieredons eyebrows were raised and his mouth dropped open a little jessilynn spun around to bow and she was unable to hold back her pleased smile but at least she tried i hope my demonstration was sufficient she said jericos shield gives us some precedence in dealing with this lathaar said the problem is neither of us knows what were doing with longbows ive only shown her the most rudimentary basics and even those might have been wrong basically shes selftaught of that there is little doubt said dieredon her stance is too narrow she sights down the arrow while gripping it too tightly her followthrough is incorrect and i cannot believe i must say this but she even nocks the arrow incorrectly each critique made jessilynn wince as if she were being stabbed with a dagger but she remained quiet her attention undivided thats great and all but can you train her lathaar asked stepping away from jessilynn and dropping his voice we cant help her and youve seen what shes already capable of untrained we cant let such a unique talent go wasted she could take down a bull with a single shot what she needs more than anything is a teacher thats why i sent for you dieredon who else is better with a bow than you flattery wont help you here dieredon insisted i cant train her the amount of time it would take to make her even proficient would be too much of a sacrifice the vile wedge stirs lathaar and orc armies surround our forests at all times take her with you then dieredon rubbed his eyes with his fingertips what of her lessons here he asked lathaar thought of what azariah had said as well as his own beliefs on the matter his students had been coddled they were out of the darkness of the world living in safety and comfort she knows the prayers the lessons the verses he said everything else shell learn on her own or from you please dieredon shes quiet focused and will take to your lessons well i promise ive talked with jerico and weve both prayed about this for months this is the right thing to do im sure of it the elf let out a sigh six months he said thats all i guarantee and shell learn everything i teach her not just about the bow shell wear the armor i tell her to move silently as needed learn to forage to craft her own arrows anything and everything to survive out there with me she wont be a paladin when she returns not in discipline or tactics shell be a ranger can you accept that lathaar turned to jessilynn knowing without a doubt shed been listening in can you he asked her jessilynns green eyes sparkled and she clutched her bow tight will i learn to shoot like you she asked in six months dieredon laughed good gods you humans by the end of six months my hope is youll know how to hold your bow without hurting yourself now do you accept know that we will soar to many places on my horse sonowin so if you fear heights you should remain here and accept a more appropriate teacher a human teacher lathaar watched as jessilynns grin spread ear to ear i get to ride sonowin she asked i accept of course i accept and then she was off calling out to her friends while rushing around the citadel to where sonowin waited patiently lathaar watched her go and when he caught dieredon glaring at him he smiled i did say she was focused he said and laughed at dieredons exasperation the crowd was twice the size it had been a week before and ten times larger than the week before that kevin maryll did well to hide his satisfaction by leaving antonil had done more to undermine his own rule than anyone else over his five year reign any other human at least but what do we say to these angels he cried his hands shaking to convey the sheer depth of rage boiling within him what do we say when they declare us liars thieves adulterers do they give us proof no the crowd shouted do they give us witnesses no they cried again thats right nothing they give us nothing but their word they give us nothing then take from us everything our land our possessions our very lives and what do we say what can we say when their word is the only law that matters a chorus of denials washed over him varied in wording but similar in tone kevin drank it all in at last letting himself relax these were the fruits of his labor hardfought and long won for years he had spoken out against the rule of angels when the gods war first ended his cries had fallen on deaf ears no one would listen for surely he was mad to say they should not trust the saviors of dezrel but patience and time had proven him right now over a hundred men and women surrounded him in the streets of mordeina blocking off a large portion of trade just so they might hear his truth the gods started this war the gods and their followers tore this land asunder filling its rivers with blood and its fields with corpses yet now the puppets of the victor these enforcers these socalled angels would lord over us who will protect us from them who will stand tall when they execute an accused thief yet let a confessed murderer go free who will represent us who will be our voice to the heavens to shout in a loud and clear voice that we will rule mankind not them the king will a man shouted from somewhere in the back perfectly on cue easily worth the three copper hed paid him the king kevin asked the king will protect us the king will speak for us aye a good king that is my friend so bring him to me show me tell me his name where is our king all of you i ask i beg tell me where is our king missing the crowd shouted and the chant soon was on the lips of all hundred the missing king all hail the missing king to him i go kevin shouted to them let the castle hear my words let the throne be painted with the truth i will not walk to my death across a bed of angel feathers nor bare my neck to gilded blades whose gold hides metal long stained red with blood my fellow man we will have a voice one that will be heard their cheers urged him on and as he walked down the street dozens flanked either side of him just before the hill he looked up to the floating city of avlimar several angels circled the clouds watching waiting protecting they claimed do you see me kevin whispered to the sky do you still think you can stand in my way up the hill to the castle gates he went knowing they would not could not stop him any longer harruq slammed the door shut flung his back against it and let out the most heartfelt groan his tired body was capable of how he said how does antonil not go mad aurelia looked up from where she sat on the floor they were in a small room adjacent to the throne room the furnishings were few the windows slender and tall the floor was carpeted though and harruq flung his boots off so he could feel its softness on his toes before he could complain further he heard his daughter call out to him using the name he was most proud of daddy she raced barefoot across the room instinctively weaving through the mess of woodcarved toys without slowing she slammed into his leg hugging his thigh hey aubby harruq said rubbing the top of her head and making a mess of her long brown hair give daddy a chance to breathe she squeezed tighter then returned to her toys without bothering to find a seat harruq slumped to the carpet still leaning against the door he didnt want to say anything do anything just sit there things havent gotten easier aurelia asked him as she absently made one of the toys a cat painted blue spin and dance through the air as if on invisible strings aubrienna watched delighted telling her mother to wait she grabbed another toy that of a dog and began having it chase after easier harruq said rubbing his temples dealing with velixar was easier these people are insane six hours i listened to them grumble they want land they want food they want soldiers bandits are here demons are there and each person acts as if our entire army didnt just leave for the other side of the continent and they were the reasonable ones im beginning to think the castle guards hate me because they didnt turn anyone away for karaks sake i had one woman ask if id touch her hands to cure her arthritis who do they think i am aubrienna looked his way and he could see the vague worry in her beautiful brown eyes daddydaddys upset because he had to listen to people she said to aurelia who kissed her on the nose thats right aurelia said and people can be silly sometimes she turned her attention back to harruq how many requests did you turn down harruq rolled his eyes fivemaybe six if i count the hand lady his wife laughed youll have the kingdom bankrupt within a week im not made for this harruq insisted not seeing the humor in the situation that his wife did some old woman comes up saying she needs money to feed her grandbabies but the money lenders wont help now what do i say to that im not a big enough bastard for this job aurry they should have picked qurrah instead hed know a clever way to tell these people to go home and leave him be not me oh no i justi just couldnt sit out there anymore i couldnt listen to another word are any still waiting harruq felt his neck flush i may have left a few standing out there he muttered aurelia shook her head get over here she said he got up with a groan then sat down beside his wife as she cuddled against him she lifted her free hand sending more of the toys dancing aubrienna frowned for they were moving too fast for her to catch mommy slow down she said holding up her toy my puppy cant reach them the whirlwind of cats trees horses and soldiers settled and one by one aubrienna began knocking them from the air with her toy ruling isnt easy aurelia said watching their daughter play you need to stay calm and know when youre reaching your limits when it comes to your decisions remember everything is a balancing act help those who need it and encourage those who would falter but not so much that they depend on you when they should instead depend on themselves figures an elf would mention something about balance harruq said are you saying im wrong he turned and kissed her im saying im tired and cant think straight just ignore me the door cracked open harruq felt a surge of panic they wouldnt follow him in there would they a paranoid delusion of beggars petitioners and politicians trailing around his bed day and night filled him and if it had been anyone else than queen susan who stepped through the doorway hed have screamed am i interrupting she asked when he shook his head she opened the door wider and in rushed little gregory copernus heir to the throne of mordan he was six months younger than aubrienna and a good three inches shorter his hair was short and blonde neatly trimmed like the little lord he was every time harruq saw gregory and aubby together he kept thinking how tall his little girl would grow up to be orcish blood he thought at least it had some benefits i thought the two might play for a time susan said gregory was immediately at aubriennas side here she said handing over the blue dog after an intense period of mental debate you can have this ill play with the kitty she grabbed a purple kitten from the floor meowing with it gregory began barking and in no time they had chased each other into a corner harruq watched with a smile on his face but the smile couldnt last susan remained standing and he sensed shed not come just so their children could play how are things out there he asked glancing up at her susan carefully shut the door then crossed her arms her skin wasnt nearly so pale as during the parade and with her straight hair falling free about her face she looked far more pleasant than when dolled up with jewels and dresses antonil was a lucky man he thought shame he didnt have the brains to stay home instead of constantly fighting wars against orcs i listened to a few more then sent the rest away she said as you can do at any time harruq if you feel overwhelmed please call for me or send the petitioners home youre the steward they will wait for you even coming into your presence is a gift they have no right to demand i know he said but i should be able to handle this im sitting on a stuffed chair halfdrunk making arbitrary decisions this isnt hard i can do it youre wrong harruq susan said her voice firm it is hard and the more you convince yourself otherwise the more frustrated youll become you didnt grow up with this didnt train for this youre more at home with a sword than a scepter there were several i did want to hit with a sword he admitted safe assumption thats not an acceptable diplomatic response susan laughed when it is i will let you know she promised a knocking came from the other side of the door susan cracked it back open and leaned out harruq heard muffled talking then saw the queens shoulders visibly sink harruq she said pulling back inside theres one more guest that refuses to leave his left eyebrow lifted hit him with a sword susans smile didnt reach her eyes its my brother she said harruq held back his groan all right he said pushing himself to his feet i guess we cant be rude aurry ill be fine aurelia said standing as well but im not staying cooped up in here aubby greg lets go to the gardens with a quick motion of her hands she ripped open a swirling blue portal kissed harruq on the cheek and then pushed the children through after she stepped inside the portal vanished leaving harruq and susan alone lead on he said and the queen did back into the throne room they went harruq plopping into a seat he had already grown to hate the long hall before the throne was empty but for a single man who entered through the double doors without waiting for approval harruq reminded himself to yell at the guards welcome harruq said his voice anything but yes welcome susan said having waited to speak as a sign of respect she opened her arms and smiled kevin maryll accepted the embrace then kissed his sister on the cheek he had the same soft face as his sister but his eyes were hard his hair was dark cut short as was his beard my dear susan he said my sympathies for what you must yet again endure the castle is not so empty that i will suffer she said then stepped back so she might gesture to harruq besides i have a steward to train and he does much to keep me entertained harruq opened his mouth then closed it for once he really didnt know what to say ah yes the godslayer kevin said he walked to the foot of the throne and then bowed to one knee consider me honored to be in your presence harruq bit his tongue hed met kevin several times and each meeting had been painful filled with awkward moments due to kevins inability to discuss anything other than what was most pressing to him and since the gods war that had been one thing and one thing only i hear the city has taken a restless turn said susan trying to draw his attention back to her i pray your travel here was uneventful oh far from kevin said his eyes never leaving harruqs but for my safety i trust my sword not prayers men surrounded me from the moment i stepped into these streets everywhere i went i heard their shouts unrest fury distrust and betrayal all about me as i made my way to the castle what did they want harruq asked kevin gave him a look a combination of condescension and inflated selfworth that nearly ignited his temper why for me to continue talking of course kevin said for at last i was telling them the truth theyve been aching to hear and that was it of course harruq tried and failed to hide his annoyance of all the opponents to the angels new role in society none were more vocal and more popular than kevin maryll the fact that he was the queens brother gave him a freedom to speak and act that many others could not or dare not use so blatantly the angels are here to help harruq said and its only because of them were not bowing to karak and so instead we bow to ashhur and give thanks for being spared such a horrific fate we bow even as they raise their executioners blade enough please susan interrupted i will have no bickering kevin let me fetch you a servant there are dozens of rooms here in the castle and they are all available to you during your stay kevin took his sisters hand and kissed it i have places to be and goals to accomplish he said and sadly i cannot do either cooped up in the castle i merely wished to ensure my little baby sister was doing well in her husbands unnecessary absence harruq swallowed hard every sentence had a jab to it hidden or otherwise as with the angels none were more outspoken against king antonils rule than kevin with the army marching east for another war it took little for kevin to draw an audience for his grumblings but how many listened harruq didnt know that type of politics was beyond him he had a sword and he smacked things with it really good now if only he could do the same to kevin my lord and husbands absence is for the good of mordan and for all dezrel susan said a bit of fire leaking into her voice of course it is kevin said all smiles he bowed low winked at harruq and then turned to leave harruq watched until he was gone the guards shutting the doors behind him with a heavy thud and then smacked the arm of his chair with his fist the outburst seemed unusually loud and he immediately felt childish when he saw susan watching him do you remember when i said id let you know when striking someone with a sword was an appropriate diplomatic response she asked harruq lifted an eyebrow sometimes i wish we didnt have to act so appropriately harruq laughed it felt good to do so come on he said standing i dont want to sit here fuming about your idiot brother lets find where aurrys taken our kids i have other duties i must attend susan said offering him a curtsey go be with your family is it anything i should know about he asked not liking the worry she hid behind her eyes if kevin is rallying people giving speechesi despise the need but he must be watched let me handle this matter harruq he is still family despite how much he might hate my husband whoever you have watch him make sure its not an angel harruq grinned but the humor fell flat there was too much worry too much truth to the joke to laugh on impulse he took her hand and kissed it much like kevin had youll do fine he said well all be fine no matter how many speeches your brother gives theres only so much he can accomplish were guarded by angels susan its not like he can start a war and if he does well youll have the nastiest bodyguard around ive killed a god before did you know that ive heard rumors she pulled free her hand rubbed it with her other take care harruq and pray the time passes swiftly antonil will be gone for so long and in my nightmares i see him returning to a kingdom of ash no harruq said shaking his head as he headed for the door i gave everything to save this city this land it wont be ash susan no matter how hard anyone might try and if someone does try he heard her ask he looked over his shoulder flashed his best smile then ill act inappropriately as tessanna prepared the last of her things qurrah went out behind their cabin to where his undead servant patiently waited the body was that of a stout man no doubt a hardy fellow when hed still drawn breath qurrah ran a hand down the side of his face feeling the necrotic energy still flowing through it king bram had given them the land in honor of their desire to be free of both angels and men in the wake of the gods war it had been abandoned for many years left for the forest to slowly reclaim it theyd chased away the weeds cleared away the animals and in doing so discovered the old family grave hed been dead for at least ten years but that hardly mattered to qurrah from the ground hed summoned the skeleton and with tessannas help slowly applied a false flesh to hide the bones and rot no soul remained in it for qurrah would not subject anyone to that punishment not ever again the thing was a useful tool nothing more theyd not bothered to name him just like qurrah had never named his robes or the burning whip he still kept coiled around his arms when he felt afraid you have been good to us qurrah said hand still touching the things face rest now and return to the dust we have need of you no more he pulled in his strength through the contact the powerful magic returning to him the servant collapsed the false flesh becoming a gray powder that hovered in the air like a fog the bones thudded dully covered by worn clothes and a bit of hair qurrah looked at it feeling a bit sad it was definitely good he had not named the mindless thing hed grown attached to it as it was from the ground he looked up forcing his attention to the forest around them in the past few years hed developed a greater appreciation for the wilderness for the song of the birds and the rustle of the leaves as the wind blew through them in it he sensed a peace that would forever elude him but at least it was a peace he could be close to at least he could try to steal its comfort like the leech he often was in life qurrah tessanna called stepping out from the cabin the halforc glanced her way here he said she placed a small bag beside the door of the cabin and then joined his side looping her arms around his elbow leaning against him she looked to the pile of bones and clothes he was a good servant she said true always quiet never intruded when he wasnt wanted tessanna laughed we should have brought him with us to mordeina he could have carried our things qurrah tried to match tessannas mirth but could not id prefer we travel unknown he said having a dead man attending our needs would not help in that regard she kissed his cheek you worry too much what does it matter if we draw attention they can do nothing to us qurrah went to the cabin and picked up his own satchel stuffed full of books spare clothes and coiled at the very bottom his whip slinging it over his shoulder he rejoined tessanna who waited patiently on the edge of the road leading out of the forest azariah had said he would return for their answer but qurrah had no intention of waiting better they leave now before any sort of preparations might be made for their arrival when the angel returned to the cabin and found it empty he trusted azariah to know what their choice had been how far she asked him as he looked one last time at their home just shy of the border he told her azariah said that the people of mordan are threatening to turn on antonil i would hear their whispers for myself perhaps outside the city walls i may help my brother more than at his side tessanna nodded then closed her eyes lifting her arms she whispered words of magic her slender fingers clenched the fabric of reality tore a swirling black portal ripping open before them with a sudden gust of air its substance was shadow and in its depths was the faint swirling of stars without hesitation qurrah stepped inside felt the familiar sense of vertigo and then stepped out many miles away tessanna followed from the corner of his eye he saw her stumble and dropping his satchel he turned to catch her as she heaved bloody vomit spilled from her mouth splattering on the grass below and her arms clutched him with terrified strength its nothing she said when she was able to breathe nothing but it wasnt qurrah knew the old tess could have sent them halfway around the world without batting an eye she sensed his unease though and pushed him away were here she said wiping her mouth so lead on dear husband he retrieved his satchel biting his tongue to prevent a fight to force his mind off her he looked about to see where exactly shed taken them they were in the shadows of a forest the tree trunks slender the bark a pale brown the area around them was flat and covered with kneehigh grass so that despite the distance they could still see the river flowing a quartermile ahead that way tessanna said gesturing northeast the bridge shouldnt be far her voice was already growing stronger and it helped put qurrahs mind at ease taking her hand in his they began walking the tall grass annoyed him and he thought of the ticks and chiggers that might be crawling up his robes with a thought he made his feet trail a dark cloud wherever he stepped the grass wilted any insects unable to flee in time falling to their backs and dying i thought we werent to attract attention tessanna said were not in civilization yet the immediate area around the river was rocky left barren and muddy from the spring rains the two followed alongside it and as the day crawled along they saw their first sign of the bridge in the distance the bloodbrick correct qurrah asked you said you wanted to be at the border so here we are the corinth river formed the barrier between the two nations of ker and mordan with the bloodbrick as the only significant crossing in times past it had been left unguarded with ker nothing more than a puppet of the other kingdom but then the gods war had come and in return for bram overthrowing his demon rulers antonil had severed all ties between the two nations more importantly hed vowed to keep ker fully independent of avlimar and her angels so when qurrah saw the army massed at the southern side of the bloodbrick he was far from surprised such paranoia qurrah said as they walked through the thin mud is it tessanna asked azariah implied the people were ready to rebel and he did not say it but what if they seek to rebel against the angels as well bram may have good reason to fear qurrah shrugged bram had always come across as a man ready to believe the worst in anything though that hardly made him a defeatist no it just made him that much more prepared for when trouble did arrive of the four nations neldar and omn had been thoroughly destroyed and overtaken by orcs mordans capital had been ravaged by battle and her countryside left in shambles from rebellion but ker howeverker had thrived left nearly untouched by the devastation and so her power had grown as had the arrogance of her king should we disguise ourselves he asked as the bridge neared no tessanna said and her tone left no room for argument i tire of hiding if we are recognized we are recognized i walked at the side of gods and prophets i will fear no lowly border guard thats more than a border guard qurrah said frowning by his best guess at least ten thousand men gathered in various camps the idea that bram might be planning an invasion was preposterous but then why such a strong show of force he didnt like it and with that many eyes there were bound to be a few whod recognize them neither were particularly inconspicuous looking him with his gray skin orcish face and curved ears and tessanna with the body of a goddess long black hair and those solid black eyes he longed to use a disguise but tessanna had made her opinion clear and he would not challenge her not on this at least the scars beneath his eyes were gone having fallen away when azariah returned life to his dead flesh after the demon gods death i need no magic to sense your fear she said holding his hand as they approached the army weve come to help your brother yes then perhaps we may do some good here for i doubt an army gathering at his southern doorstep is there without reason they veered farther from the river so they might travel along the road before they reached the army protecting the bridge the nearer they came the stranger the sight they werent even checking those who traveled into the nation only out qurrah squeezed tessannas hand tight as they approached the first dozen tents they dont even look for spies he said quietly to her perhaps they only fear the spies that fly through the air he shrugged then why did azariah not mention it to us perhaps he didnt know it to mention the soldiers milled about some gambling some singing and playing simple instruments while a good many drank only a few kept their attention on the road and they had the bored look of someone forced into duty stay on the path one said as they passed no gawking no begging no selling wares not even these wares tessanna said tilting her head back a little to better show her breasts qurrah pulled her along before the soldier could respond are you out of your mind he hissed do you know of a better way to learn information than from a mans bed whores learn secrets spies cannot she returned his look with a dull gaze then giggled as if she were a little girl youre cute when youre jealous she said letting the matter drop the concentration of soldiers thickened the closer they moved to the bridge ahead of them rode a large group an apparent family traveling north with all their possessions their single wagon was loaded with belongings and at the first stone of the bloodbrick they were stopped and lazily searched over by two men holding halberds a third guard stepped in front of qurrah and tessanna and lifted his hand hold up he said offering no other words than that he glanced back watching the others search the wagon qurrah bit his tongue and in the very center of the encampment he waited trying not to look nervous he felt stupid for being nervous in the first place but itd been five years since hed been around people in general let alone a large army tessanna was righthe really had been hiding from society in their cabin of course standing in the middle of ten thousand men felt like a horrible time to realize it is there something they search for qurrah asked thinking he might try to learn something instead of standing there shuffling his weight from foot to foot keep your tongue behind your teeth the soldier said barely giving him a glance im not here for questions just wait your turn you made the man mad tessanna said still seeming terribly amused by everything mad the soldier asked actually turning to face them girl you havent he stopped and stood perfectly still his jaw hanging open the tiniest bit there was no mistaking his gaze which focused on her strange eyes your name the soldier said i thought you werent here for questions qurrah said feeling his heart speed up ignoring him the soldier drew the sword at his hip your name he said again so far he kept the blade tip pointed downward but he seemed about to jump at any second tessanna smiled at him long hair flowing down the sides of her face tessanna she said at last the soldier looked ready to shit himselfwhether from fear or surprise qurrah couldnt say he took a fresh look at qurrah and his face paled showing he knew exactly who stood before him james he shouted get the fuck over here right now the two guards at the wagon turned around others around the camp heard the shouting and seeing the drawn blade they rushed over qurrah held his arms out at his sides hoping to show he posed no danger tessanna remained perfectly still her sly smile receding inward becoming a calm look of apathy qurrah envied her i only travel to meet my brother qurrah said hoping someone in charge might hear and listen we are no threat no quiet said an older man who pushed to the front of the gathering crowd you are you the betrayer qurrah glared at him even as a wall of swords encased him and tess as if they could stop him he thought i doubt i am the first nor the last to have ever committed that particular sin he said in answer apparently that was enough for the soldier though for he turned his attention to tessanna you said your name was tessanna he said the prophets bride i was she said her voice nearly toneless but that fiend lives no longer as will you if you touch a hair on my head she was never his bride qurrah said unable to help himself he hated the title given to her formed by the twisted story most commonly told around hearths at night only once had qurrah worked up the nerve to ask his brother what the tales said in them qurrah had betrayed veldaren his glorious brother and then the whole world by helping the prophet velixar summon the war god thulos from then on qurrah was seen as the hapless puppet and velixar the true evil tessanna was velixars bride his dark angel and if the age of the audience permitted many storytellers liked to embellish the sick perverted love that had supposedly gone on between them so she wasnt was she the soldier asked his glare showing he was an inch away from striking the halforc lets see what bram has to say about that qurrah sighed would it matter telling them bram knew where they lived had known for the past five years since he himself had overseen the deeding of the land to them yes he said let us see but put away your swords for all our sakes you never know when one might cut a piece of hair by accident escorted by over thirty men they walked into the center of the camp neither were restrained in any way and qurrah sensed the men were too afraid to try such a thing in many corners of the world qurrah and tessanna had become the boogeyman of campfire stories he could only guess what some of them thought he might do if they laid a rough hand upon him the way they held their naked blades it seemed more like they escorted wild bears than a frail halforc and a short slender woman if not for the inherent risk in it qurrah felt tempted to growl at them his brother would have he thought and it put a wry smile on his face hed growl and wave his arms about like an idiot just to show he was unafraid of their numbers sometimes he wished he was more like his brother at one of many fires they stopped and the men encircling them gave way lord bram henley stood waiting arms crossed over his chest his hair was long and black falling down to his broad shoulders from his right eye down to his chin was a thin straight scar selfinflicted in the tradition of his family line if he was surprised to see qurrah and tessanna he did not show it well now bram asked what have you two been doing to stir my camp in such a way existing tessanna said her voice flat the rest of the soldiers tensed but bram only shook his head and chuckled of course he said turning to his solders leave us they are not enemies of ker none appeared foolhardy enough to argue with their king so away they went leaving qurrah and tessanna standing before a man they hadnt seen in several years to qurrahs eyes he looked older far older than he should have given the relatively short amount of time that had passed perhaps being a king aged a man faster or maybe it was just the stress of always checking the skies for white feathers im glad youre here bram said sitting back down before the fire in a wooden chair hardly three days ago i sent riders to your cabin though i didnt expect them to return with you in time that you come to me well id say it was fate if i believed in that sort of thing if not fate then coincidence qurrah agreed but what have we come in time for the halforc looked about but saw no other chairs shrugging he sat on his knees before the fire tessanna sat next to him leaning her head on his shoulder so far she appeared bored withdrawn it was a mood shed fallen into less often over the past few years but coming back into civilization seemed to have reawakened it i assume you receive little news in your isolated cabin bram asked little if any qurrah said neglecting to mention azariahs arrival then ill keep details at a minimum as to not overwhelm you king antonil marches this way with an army intent on another foolish crusade to drive the orcs from his native kingdom within the hour he should arrive to ask permission to travel through my lands how does this involve us qurrah dared ask id have you at my side when i tell him no bram said at least for now in a few days perhaps even a few hours i will let him pass i only desire to see how he reacts trust me i do not desire war forgive me qurrah said but i fear my question was not answered you must realize you mean something bram insisted even with your own brother as ashhurs avatar even with your body made new by the hands of angels you still will not live under their rule you came to me for help for freedom i need your defiance i need the people to see we still have a choice you give us reasons we never had tessanna said before qurrah could speak you tell us our value is in refusing to be puppets then seek to use us as puppets for your own cause if youd stand against mordan stand on your own strength her voice remained eerily calm but qurrah could feel the anger growing beneath it i do not wish to use you at all bram said i only thought you would agree with my efforts to hold back the angels encroachment angels tessanna said the last of her apathy vanishing into a wideeyed look of fury karak took away my lover then gave me back a monster ashhur took that monster and gave me back my lover i do not hide from the angels i do not fear their eyes its men like you i hoped to avoid men who would use me put me on a pedestal and ask others to bow ill take my knife and bleed you all if i must to prevent the prayers at last bram was taken aback and he lifted his hands to show he meant no insult youll be put on no pedestal he said and i assure you no one will bow but antonils army nears and you will accompany me as my guests and if we refuse qurrah asked if you would deny me such generosity then i will deny my generosity to you i will revoke your land and declare you unwelcome in the nation of ker only if i must of course surely i do not ask for much in having you stand silent at my side qurrah looked to tessanna to see how she would react did it truly matter if they were there or not bram wanted them used as figureheads and nothing more they could do this one thing then continue on their way his wife though still appeared furious and she gave no attempt to conceal it i will have no part in this she said standing and neither will qurrah i watched him be velixars puppet he wont now be yours hearing this qurrah expected bram to be furious or to carry out his threat instead he sighed and shook his head youre returning to mordeina for the first time since the war arent you he asked then you dont understand what it is like go then and see you wont understand until you are there if you flee to my borders i promise to protect you so long as you admit your error what do you mean by that qurrah asked as bram started to leave instead of explaining the king gave him a bitter smile pleasant travels he said tessanna stared as he left as if driving nails into his back with her eyes qurrah took her hand and she whirled on him her look that of a crazed animal he wont use us she said i know i wont let him i wont let anyone he kissed her forehead i know so what do we do now before she could answer a trumpet blew from beyond the bridge the soldiers shot into motion grabbing helmets and readying weapons tessannas cold hands wrapped around qurrahs i want to see she said pulling him along many glared at them but none were brave enough to stop them as they headed for the road all along either side gathered brams army banners carried high armor polished to a shine lost amid the chaos the two lovers peered down the road to where king antonils army came riding calm as king antonil seemed tarlak thought he surely must have ice in his blood how else did he remain so composed when staring at the army ten thousand strong that guarded the bloodbrick bridge well tarlak i can see you fidgeting over there antonil said as the two rode at the forefront of their army youre my advisor care to advise me im not sure theres any other way to explain it tarlak said he doesnt plan on letting us cross i outnumber him three to one trying to stop us is madness bram hasnt always struck me as the most rational of men nonsense antonil said hes the most rational man i know thats why hes so frustrating to the rest of us tarlak shrugged however you want to explain it it still worries me is he playing with us or does he really think a war is best for anyone games or madness neither one id want to be involved with could you form a crossing for us if he refuses perhaps farther north tarlak rubbed his chin as he stared at the river damming it wouldnt do much he said rivers too large too deep levitating thirty thousand men over the water isnt going to happen either best i could do is try to freeze the top forming a bridge while letting the river continue to pass beneath itd take a lot of concentration though and id prefer we just walk across the stone bridge the idiot king is guarding duly noted bring me my generals until we see reason otherwise well pretend bram has every intention of letting us cross i dont want to show up brimming for a fight theres thirty thousand of us wearing armor and carrying swords not counting the angels accompanying us tarlak said unless we approach naked well look prepared for a fight but yes keeping everyone calm is probably best tarlak turned his horse about found the nearest general and relayed antonils request for a meeting that done he returned to the front putting himself at the far corner of the vanguard so he could not see or hear the discussion so far the generals had shown significant mistrust of him and his yellow robes given the absolute destruction various spellcasters had rent upon the land during the gods war he didnt blame them much as antonil talked tarlak scanned king brams army ten thousand approximately all appearing wellarmed and welltrained they ran about like ants upon seeing their approach but tarlak sensed they werent there for war the bridge had no defenses placed upon it no barricades or spear walls the same went for the men on the far side they had built no ballista or catapults weapons that could have devastated antonils army while they struggled to cross the bridge no either they planned an ambush or a show of force if it was a show of force it was a hollow one antonil hadnt the slightest desire to invade ker not with his homeland still occupied by orcs if it was an ambush he snapped his fingers and fire sparked from his fingertips if it was an ambush theyd get to see just how much destruction a spellcaster could wreak the king requests your presence one of the fatter generals said disturbing tarlak and his thoughts very well tarlak said nodding his head and then tugging on the reins of his horse the bloodbrick was less than a quarter mile away and despite antonils assurances tarlak felt unease spreading through the men he felt unease as well but for a different reason something about the distant army felt vaguelyfamiliar like a thorn in his mind i want you at my side when we request passage antonil said as tarlak rejoined him i was thinking i presented greater tactical value elsewhere and wheres that tarlak gestured behind him all the way in the back if theres to be a fight id prefer thirty thousand men be between me and it the laughter helped ease their tensions closer and closer loomed the bridge until at last tarlak and antonil rode together toward brams army a token guard on either side of them riding out to meet them was lord bram and his own personal squad of knights banners for either side flying high tarlak held his breath as his liege spoke greetings king bram antonil said my friend my ally once again i march to my homeland to retake what the orcs have desecrated with their presence have you raised an army to join me in this quest bram shook his head laughing after how your last crusade went no antonil i prefer my soldiers alive not dead tarlak noticed neither made mention of crossing the bridge no doubt antonil wanted bram to offer it freely and bram wanted antonil to ask no matter the answer he planned to give the wizard let out a sigh politics he hated it forgive me for my abruptness but my time is short and i have need of your bridge antonil said would you grant my men and i permission to cross no i will not bram answered so smoothly so quickly that tarlak could hardly believe it he grabbed the side of antonils cloak and tugged as the simple answer echoed throughout the camps hes lying tarlak said softly so no one else would hear how do you know behind them antonils army was stirring all of them expecting war or at least some sort of skirmish for such blatant disrespect tarlaks mind whirled hes too pleased with himself tarlak insisted hes testing you he wants to know how youll respond how ill respond so be it antonil drew his sword and he called out to bram we are crossing bram you have no stake in this no right to deny me passage i ride with thirty thousand and if i must i can call forth a legion of angels do you still refuse i have the right of a sovereign lord to protect my borders shouted bram but i see even after all this time you will never consider me as such move quickly through my lands antonil do not consider me friend or ally you war against the orcs on your own bram turned about and barked a command his army shifted so that the road between was clear without another word the king rode over the bridge and vanished into the thick crowd of soldiers not very diplomatic of you tarlak muttered as the generals readied their army to march im sick of this antonil said here back home everywhere posturing and politics and betrayal if he would refuse me then fight me if not then dont waste my time i will not play his game man after my own heart thought tarlak as they rode across the bloodbrick tarlak didnt bother to tell his king that he had played along whether hed wanted to or not bram had his answer knew exactly how antonil viewed his army and his borders and of course he just had to mention the angels stepping off the bridge and into ker tarlak felt the tingling in his mind grow stronger he glanced about unsure of what exactly he was searching for but convinced hed know it if he saw it and then to his left he spotted the large dark eyes that belonged to only one woman in all of dezrel he stiffened atop his horse their eyes met and tarlak felt a shiver run through him as tessanna offered him the slightest of smiles a distant part of his mind realized qurrah stood behind her face downcast unwilling to meet his gaze why are they here tarlak wondered have they turned against the angels after all sadly he knew he would get no answer so onward he rode the hour passing as antonils army slowly crossed into the land of ker bram returned to his tent furious at the series of events though his pride dictated he hide it antonil had done his best to humiliate him prove him the weaker the only way to save face was to pretend the challenge beneath him and showing frustration would only reveal it for the lie it was stepping inside his tent he let out a sigh set down his sword i swear loreina things were simpler when we fought armies of demons he said and men were smarter too rising from the cot her brown hair braided down to her waist was his wife she put her hands around his neck kissed his lips then smiled it dimpled her face making her look as young as she was when he first married her the intelligence in her eyes the fiery ambition was there now as it had always been with the encroachment of the angels it had only gotten brighter so much she demanded to come with him instead of remaining behind in angkar where it was safer i heard antonils words with my own ears she said he would deny your basic right to control your borders he would deny your sovereignty do you believe me now bram swore flung off his pauldrons so they fell in a clattering display loreina stepped back gave him his space to brood they wont invade he said shaking his head stubborn and foolish as antonil is his eyes are only for his former kingdom he is no threat not if we stay out of the way of his hopeless crusades its not antonil i fear loreina said its his replacement it was true of course the whispering winds of politics blew south and they whispered with greater certainty antonils fate his grip on mordan was slipping away with each passing month whether through death in battle betrayal in court or a full blown uprising of nobles his time as king approached its end what more can we do bram asked his army is the greater doubly so if you include his angels open warfare against mordan would destroy us all and that cannot happen if we fall then the last hope of there being a free nation in all of dezrel at least one not ruled by monsters falls with us loreina slipped closer put her hands around his waist patience she said it is not the same as doing nothing we keep our eyes open there will come a time when antonil is weak when the angels no longer fly above him it is in that moment we will refuse to bow our knee it is in that moment we will show the world we will not be mocked or ignored we are a sovereign nation not a footstool she was on her knees now her hands drifting down to his belt and remember she said to him you must remain calm around your men dont worry ill help you with that bram swallowed close his eyes and then mentally swore a hundred times when he heard someone call his name from outside the tent he recognized the voice too it was sir ian millar his most trusted knight and commander of his armies the mans service had been invaluable during the gods war yes bram asked through the fabric of the tent milord i would seek your advice can it wait i fear it cannot bram let out a sigh pushed back his wife later he told her i have duties i must attend she said rising from her knees then much later his mood now even worse bram stormed out of his tent still tightening his belt what is it he asked ian the knight saluted and the worry in his eyes dispelled brams immature mood if you would please follow me while i explain the knight said spinning on his heels and marching toward the bridge has there been trouble with antonils men during the crossing bram asked nothing beyond the ordinary it isnt antonils men im unsure of how to deal with watch your step and then look to the sky brams stomach tightened and he knew what hed see before he ever looked skyward flying in vformations were several dozen angels goldenhued armor glinted in the sunlight and in their hands were the unmistakable shapes of swords shields and spears do they accompany antonils men or are they merely seeing them off bram asked lifting a hand to shade his eyes as he looked so far they have not crossed the border ian said theyre merely circling their current position ive ordered our archers ready just in case in case what you would spark war while antonils army marches through the very center of our camp beside him ian stiffened their kind has been banned from ker he said forgive me if i erred in preparing to enforce your laws we gave antonils army freedom to pass bram said one might consider the angels part of that army then they should have stated as much i do not care what any one person might say what do you say milord bram stared at the angels his stomach continuing to twist it felt like there were stones grinding within him just the sight of the creatures was enough to make him feel a flutter of fear their size their speed their ability to circumvent any standard defensive formation or benefit of terrainthey were so clearly not of dezrel the hairs on his neck lifted if they try to fly over let loose our arrows bram said if they remain as high as they are we wont hit them im counting on it send them a message and make it as clear as the message antonil sent me together they watched as the remainder of antonils army slowly crossed over the bridge through the camp and into the heart of ker a great train of wagons marking the last of their passing it took the greater part of an hour and all the while the angels circled do they ever get tired ian asked still on edge apparently not so far the angels showed no inclination of following antonil into ker as much as bram wanted a chance to save face he felt himself beginning to relax even if they dont pass now they might wait until dark or perhaps fly farther north beforehand ian suggested while rubbing his neck which was no doubt sore from spending so much time staring up at the sky bridges mean nothing to their kind no bram said i know them too well to cross in secret would mean admitting they know what they do is wrong or should be hidden if theyre to spit in the face of my laws theyll do it here now brams words caught in his throat as if they could hear him one of the angel formations suddenly dipped lower curling around to fly directly over the bridge ian saw it immediately began running about shouting orders bram watched their approach did his best to calculate the angle despite his fury for their insolence he felt a sudden spike of panic they were coming in far too low and would fly within the reach of his archers belay that order bram shouted but it was too late the angels were streaking in at inhuman speeds and for the past hour the archers had been given a single specific command if the angels flew over let loose with all they had up into the air sailed hundreds of arrows rising together like an inverse rain the group of angels seven in all flared their wings and tried to rise it didnt matter bram saw the arrows climb saw war ready to spill forth before him news of a dead angel let alone seven would be all itd take for those watching his nation with hungry eyes to put their plans in motion and then a shadow tore open in the air spreading wide like a shield within it were a legion of sixfingered hands their skin shining a translucent purple they batted at the arrows snapping them with a mere touch as above the seven angels beat their wings and lifted higher into the air the other formations circled close and bram could almost taste the tension spreading when the last of the arrows was a cloud of splinters falling back to dezrel the dark collection of hands vanished as if they had never been what in karaks name was that ian asked rejoining his kings side an undeserved gift bram said he nodded to the angels what do they wait for theyre discussing ian said having watched them closely prepare the archers just in case i was a fool but not this time if they swoop in again theyll be coming for blood if were lucky well have them dead before antonils men find out and try to return the favor before ian could carry out the order the angels gathered together into one large formation turned north and flew away bram closed his eyes let out a sigh of relief his armys presence at the bloodbrick was meant as a message a warning the last thing he truly wanted was war where are our two guests he asked ill lead you to them deep within their camp the halforc and his sorceress had been surrounded by his soldiers so far none of his men had drawn blades or made any threatening motion bram understood their confusion the spell theyd cast had countered an order given by their king but bram had also held private conversations with the two prior to antonils arrival ian called for them to make way and realizing their king had arrived they quickly parted your archers have terrible aim qurrah said before bram could open his mouth i dare say you frightened them far more than you intended the halforc was giving him an out and bram gladly took it the fault is mine for not giving proper orders but your magic will frighten them more than my arrows move freely through my lands halforc and know you will always be considered a close ally and friend bram meant it too qurrah had read the circumstances and events correctly and then acted to prevent a war bram himself had admitted he didnt want such a powerful ally he thought if only he could somehow convince the halforc and his strange bride to stay at his side to use their intelligence and power for something greater than themselves your kindness is overwhelming tessanna said her hands were wrapped around qurrahs arm hugging him tightly bram sensed sarcasm in her words there was no way for him to know their reasons for protecting the angels not fully so he let the matter drop instead he tilted his head the tiniest amount to show his respect then marched away what now ian asked him now we plan he said heading for his tent word of what just happened will spread through mordan quickly enough and whatever the aftermath we must be ready he glanced to the sky where the angels were but distant specks their brashness grows war is coming ian whether we want it or not one god has fallen from this land and the other hungers to possess the rest how long until they deem our entire nation full of sinners needing repentance by sword they wont go that far ian quietly insisted i spoke with many angels during the war we fought alongside them and they were selfless allies they cherish life they embrace peace and seek only to protect the innocent that was when we warred against demons bram said shaking his head that was when they knew their purpose five years is a long time ian long enough to forget the past long enough to become all too human bram looked once more to the sky shook his head and turned away it was the happiest day of jessilynns life broken only by momentary terror every time sonowin banked one way or another forcing her to hold dieredon tighter lest she fall given how they flew high enough to pierce the clouds it would be a very very long fall youd catch me right she asked dieredon needing to shout directly into his ear to be heard over the wind that ripped at their hair and clothes she sat bareback atop the winged horse with nothing to hold onto but the elfs waist which she kept in a deathlock if you fell dieredon asked glancing back at her she nodded most likely he said he stared at her then gently tugged on the reins sonowins great wings shifted angle and they dipped lower with a stomachchurning lurch when they leveled out the clouds were far above them is it easier to breathe now he asked meekly jessilynn nodded i didnt want to complain she said and she meant it her excitement was great and she hated to spoil it just because her head felt strangely light or because her stomach seemed ready to empty the little remnants of her breakfast across miles and miles of faded grass the land rolled along as they flew north jessilynn spent a moment with her eyes closed her forehead resting against dieredons back slowly her stomach calmed the world seeming to spin a little bit less rejuvenated she looked out over the land and felt her spirit soar nothing compared to flying like a bird seeing the shifting of the rivers and the entire limits of vast forests carefully she leaned a little to the right to better see past sonowins bobbing head is that it she shouted almost pointing before thinking better of it if you mean the gorge then yes were almost to the bone ditch it was surreal seeing it from such height a place that had been nothing more than a story to her while growing up it was said that when celestia created the orcs she split the land starting at where the rigon flowed out of the northern mountains it was a massive chasm now the rock a faded red the cliff faces sheer at the very bottom the rigon flowed along steady as ever the great span and deadly fall had been one of the most significant protections the eastern land of neldar had against the creatures that had been trapped there but during the gods war the orcs within had been loosed the prophet using his dark magic to aid their crossing what do we do when we arrive jessilynn asked thinking of the bridges the orcs had supposedly constructed over the past few years dieredon gave her a strange look land sonowin banked lower and the growing proximity to the ground increased her sense of speed the great chasm wound below them like a giant snake until what had been a speck in the distance grew and grew and she realized it was the orc bridge crossing the bone ditch there was only one constructed of weatherworn wood and thick ropes bound together with crude knots just thinking about crossing it made jessilynn sick to her stomach sonowin looped around once and then a hundred yards out from the western side they landed on the dull yellow grass of the wedge jessilynn leapt off the winged horse her knees wobbling falling down she clutched the grass as vomit climbed her throat focus on breathing dieredon said standing beside her even elves sometimes feel discomfort from the speed and heights we climb it made jessilynn feel a little better as she puked onto the grass just a little im fine she said forcing herself to a stand she pulled her bow off her back and scanned the bridge looking for any threats she saw none and in her mind she heard no subtle warning of ashhur alerting her to danger either where are they she asked dieredon frowned follow me he said stay silent and stay alert do not look ahead but behind and to the sides trust my eyes for the front yes sir she said dieredon started to walk then stopped sir is a human title he said she immediately blushed im sorry she said i just wanted to show respect what should i call you dieredon cocked his head to the side my name the way he said it made it sound so simple and she felt her blush growing much as she hated it she was not some immature girl her monthlies had begun years before and by all rights she was a woman grown but something about dieredon made her feel so stupid so unsure and unskilled a simple berating by him shouldnt embarrass her especially when it wasnt much of a berating at all begging ashhur to clear her head and nerves she rapidly nodded of course she said lead on good keep your bow at ready and follow behind me at ten paces with a near fanatical obsession she followed his orders and together they made their way to the ramshackle bridge every few moments she glanced behind them where the yellow grass of the wedge stretched on and on for miles no matter how often she looked she saw no signs of life up ahead was just as still and when they reached the first plank of the bridge dieredon beckoned her over look here he said pointing to a faded smear of dirt upon of wood jessilynn looked but whatever he saw she did not its been at least three months since anyone crossed this bridge he explained isnt that a good thing she asked from what she understood having orcs escape their prison was about as bad as it got dieredon glanced across the bridge to the east not if there are no orcs left to cross he said sonowin come his sudden worry made jessilynn nervous as she climbed atop the winged horse without any of his usual attempts for steadiness dieredon tugged on the reins sending them flying over the bone ditch and into the greener lands beyond where are we going she shouted the green castle she dared not ask why she felt intrusive enough as it was for three days theyd camped north of the citadel and hed spent hours fixing her stance showing her the proper way to grip her bow and draw an arrow by the third day she could tell hed grown restless and come the fourth theyd begun their flight northeast hearing the worry in his voice put a seed of guilt in her stomach what if they arrived somewhere too late and it was all because of her training could she even stay with him in good conscience if that were the case they remained low to the ground passing over hilly lands that seemed to go on forever the grass was lush showing the healthy luster of spring slowly the hills evened out and then in the far distance she saw a faint hint of stone that rapidly took the shape of a circular wall built atop a hill jessilynn almost asked dieredon if that was the green castle then realized the stupidity of the question beyond the outer circular walls was a slender tower every facing covered with what she guessed to be vines nearer and nearer they flew the castle took on a more vivid green and even from her distance she could see the large clusters of flowers that speckled the castle dieredon circled twice his eyes scanning the ground his frown deepened but still he ordered sonowin to land just inside the inner walls the winged horse touched ground dieredon leapt off before the beast was still and he offered her a hand whats wrong she asked as she took it its so quiet here this castle belonged to lord sully he was never a friend of elvenkind but he did aid us in keeping the orcs at bay when last i left here his men were patrolling the bone ditch to prevent the construction of any more bridges he gestured about the empty courtyard it shouldnt be quiet there should be servants soldiers children he pulled off his bow then hurried toward the castle jessilynn tugged free her own bow and ran after him her plodding footsteps seemed so loud compared to the elfs silent passage they crossed through the courtyard stopping at the large castle doors they were shut with no visible sign of attack dieredons frown deepened the elf briefly investigated the castle doors tugged once to confirm they were still locked then peered up the castle walls check the outer grounds for any signs of life he said hopping atop of sonowin ill investigate the castle see if i can discover where theyve fled if you find yourself in trouble whistle as loud as you can i will jessilynn said she clutched her bow and tried not to let her nervousness show being alone in the great courtyard made her uneasy something had gone terribly wrong and they both knew it dieredon flew higher and higher until he was even with one of the upper windows of a tower then leapt off sonowins back he vanished into the stone edifice wanting to be useful jessilynn started scanning the area trying to decide what she was even looking for aimlessly she began walking through the courtyard slowly making her way around to the western side the hairs on the back of her neck began to stand as more and more things looked askew she found overturned barrels broken shafts of wood that might have been spears bits of shredded clothing against one wall of the tower she saw a stain and stepping closer she saw the stone was chipped the stain was without a doubt a great smear of blood when her fingers brushed against it she heard a distant sound one she could hardly believe laughter closing her eyes she did her best to listen and sure enough she heard it again from somewhere in the building she decided but where with how large the tower was itd take time for dieredon to find them if he also heard jogging alongside the stone jessilynn looked for an alternate entrance beyond the locked gates rounding the southwest corner she found a small jut built out from the wall just narrow enough for a single man to pass through it was blocked by a single gate a way to flank attackers at the front gate if the situation demanded it she guessed beyond the iron gate was a second wooden door from beyond that she heard another round of muffled laughter dieredon she called out but so pathetic was her cry that she doubted anyone could have heard her she swallowed told herself to be brave she was a paladin of ashhur she was supposed to be a champion of mankind not a girl quaking in fear at a strangers laughter she touched the gate with a grinding squeak it pushed inward it took a moment for her to overcome her surprise shed been convinced it would be locked like the front gates had been of course there was still the wooden doors just beyond stepping into the dark passageway she grabbed the handle and pulled it opened with a dull thud revealing a long unlit hallway offering a prayer to ashhur for safety she pulled an arrow out of her quiver and pressed it against the string of her bow the arrowhead lit up with a soft bluewhite glow and with its light guiding her she stepped into the hallway the echoes of her footfalls made her wince and again she thought of dieredons silent passing jessilynn wore lighter armor than the other paladins a special suit requested by jerico himself from a traveling smith it was heavy leather studded with her chest and shoulders reinforced with a variety of plate and chain she could move far easier than the others in their platemail but it was still heavy and worse noisy each step she took sounded like thunder her fear made the light of her arrow falter until she could barely see five feet before her again she heard laughter this time of two different men their voices were deep boisterous yet muffled too much for her to make out the words they occasionally spoke hello she called out traveling deeper into the green castle is someone there at the sound of her voice the laughter stopped jessilynns heart caught in her throat as she heard movement and the rattle of weaponry she took a step back stumbling as her foot landed atop a heavy stone she flung her elbow to the side to brace herself against the wall except the wall wasnt there she landed on hard dirt the arrow and bow fell from her hands clattered to the ground in the darkness stay calm jessilynn told herself stay calm and dont panic feel along the ground the bow was easy enough to find given its size for another moment she felt for the arrow then realized she had a dozen more in the quiver on her back drawing another she notched it on the string the metal arrowhead brightened surrounded by the glow of her faith and finally able to see she looked about she was in a large tunnel that stretched sharply into the earth for a distance far beyond the reach of her light spinning around she found the broken bricks of the castle wall the gap the size of a large man the panic shed fought against assaulted her at double strength the castle hadnt been taken from outside itd been tunneled into and taken from within she stepped out pointed her arrow down the hall she heard a door open and yellow eyes glinted a mere fifty feet away jessilynn let fly her arrow and as it streaked down the hall she was finally able to see orcs two of them each wearing crude armor and carrying swords the arrow struck the first in the chest blasting him off his feet the other let out a yell screaming in alarm jessilynn flung her bow across her back and ran the exit looked so small yet so bright her heart pounded in her ears as she heard more voices clamoring behind her it sounded like an entire army awakening dieredon she screamed fear giving strength to her legs she blasted through the door and out into the painful daylight dieredon without slowing she raced into the courtyard wanting to put as much distance between her and the castle as possible her lungs burned and when she reached where they had first landed she spun in circles looking for sonowins great wings she didnt see them or the horse they were attached to anywhere from the side entrance orcs burst out rounding the corner with weapons drawn at first there were only a few and they squinted against the light grabbing her bow jessilynn let fly an arrow at the closest it sailed wide bouncing twice off the dirt her eyes widened as the orc closed the distance rusty sword lifted high to strike before she could nock another an arrow flew in from the sky piercing the orcs throat the shaft remained halfway embedded and dark blood poured around it your hand she heard dieredon shout from high above flinging her bow back over her shoulder she turned around and lifted her arms sonowin dove toward her dieredon on her back releasing arrow after arrow they sailed over her head and she heard pained cries from behind each time one found purchase the elf put aside his bow reached down and yanked her onto sonowins back as the winged horse momentarily halted in place then they were moving skyward and the feel of the wind was enough to bring jessilynn to tears she clutched the elf tightly then looked down to the castle in the courtyard swarmed hundreds of orcs they tunneled in she shouted struggling to regain her composure then all is lost in the hillock the orcs have emptied out of the wedge every last one of them thousands upon thousands greater than any army of man sonowins wings steadied and jessilynn loosened her grip on dieredons waist chastising herself for being so afraid what was the point of all those years of training under lathaar and jerico if she would panic against the very first enemy she ever faced still she couldnt chase away the image of the orc falling backward her arrow crushing his chest as if shed struck him with a maul the way the blood had splattered against the walls colored purple by the blue hue of her arrow where do we go now she asked trying to think about anything else the east is theirs and so the west we must protect he said over the past five years ive never received word of any other of the races traveling into neldar isnt that a good thing the door to their cage is open in the east yet they remain behind dieredon shouted shaking his head the question iswhy she could not imagine a reason the wildlands were the elfs expertise not hers she glanced behind her offering a prayer for anyone that might still remain lost or hidden in the great nation of neldar celestias cursed children had taken them as their own and from the laughter she heard deep within the castle the orcs were more than comfortable in their new home im sorry she shouted for what for panicking dieredon lessened his grip on the reins so he might turn about to look at her are you alive he asked her yes and did you act when confronted by your enemy or did you do nothing i killed one she admitted and then i ran for you then you have nothing to apologize for even for a human you are young so do not judge yourself so harshly remember you are with me to learn not to prove you have no need of learning he put his back to her fell silent however he said turning back around a smile was on his face but it quickly vanished you still missed your mark during my descent sonowin take us down somewhere quiet i think jessilynn needs an hour of practice to remind her not to rush her aim sonowin let out a snort and then down they went ezekai circled the town of norstrom debating whether he should land ever since the execution of the farmer colton hed felt uneasy with his duties a strong part of him wished to speak with azariah but the high priest was always so busy that ezekai continued to postpone doing so he knew he had been well within the law colton had brutally murdered a man in front of the entire town in front of his own child but hed also been a good man an honest hardworking man what madness could have driven him into an act so vile was his desire for torment for retribution so much greater than his desire for the salvation of others of course it was ezekai thought that was the failing of man but he wouldnt let it be his failing they just needed to be shown the way and as much as ezekai had been troubled by the events the town continued on as it always had as it perhaps always would he saw the farmers in the fields the shopkeepers selling their wares plain men and women wandering the streets perhaps to work perhaps to shop perhaps to play they had not called for him with their scepter but he landed anyway folding his wings behind him as he glanced up and down the road children stared at him in awe as did many of the adults a few were wary and one older woman continued on down the street as if she never saw him it tugged at ezekais heart always awe always fear and doubt would they ever look upon his arrival with love was their trust so terrible a thing for him to yearn for may i help you an older gentlemen asked having rushed out of his rocking chair at the front of the tavern to greet the angel he walked with a cane his limp painful to watch as he approached ezekai reached out his hand and touched the mans knee be well he said and he felt the magic flowing out of him it took more than hed expected to banish the swelling but then again everything seemed to take more effort lately every angel knew of the priests magic fading away so far ezekai had thought himself unaffected but now he wondered if that assumption was erroneous thank you the old man said flexing the leg while smiling truly a blessing to have you come this day we did not think to use the scepter for just the boy but perhaps ashhurs wisdom has decided otherwise perhaps said ezekai so there is need of me indeed the man said beckoning ezekai was taken to a small home one like thousands of others he had visited before the smell of sickness was strong the moment the door opened ezekai bowed his head to the woman who greeted them her face was pale haggard with her hair pulled back from her face in a knot may i enter ezekai asked ashhur bless you of course the woman said my names maria ashhurs peace be with you maria wings folded behind him ezekai stepped inside then dismissed the older man the angel had to keep his head hunched his height beyond that of normal humans just before him was a fireplace and lying beside it was a young boy about four years of age from what he guessed thats my son kaisen maria said quickly kneeling at the boys side hes been running a fever for four days now and each night his coughs gotten worse and worse i told them to use the scepter to call for someone but they wouldnt they said hed be fine that hedbut that cough he cant even breathe when it hits him she looked near tears ezekai smiled at her wishing to do all he could to comfort her no doubt shed been sleeping little each night worrying more and more for her precious child sitting down on his knees beside kaisen the angel reached out a hand and touched his forehead the heat was immediately apparent the fever burning deep within him ive done what i can to make him drink maria said wormroot also worked on the fever for a day or two but then stopped youve done well ezekai said still focused on the child the sickness radiated out from his lungs and in ezekais mind it shone like a red spot amid a field of white frowning he placed both his hands on kaisens chest and closed his eyes help me ashhur he prayed i know this is beyond me but nothing is beyond you the power flowed from him with a strength that took his breath away his arms shook his head pounded and still he wondered if it would be enough so weak he felt so weak when it came to matters of healing and faith kaisen coughed first wildly then less so maria watched for a moment then was unable to keep herself away she clutched her child her hair coming loose from its knot and falling across the angels hands as ezekai continued to pray smaller and smaller shrank the red sickness until it was gone the fever in the boys flesh beginning to subside ezekai took in a deep breath then slowly stood i doubt he would have lasted the night he said surprised by how much his voice shook four days you say why was i not summoned sooner maria was crying as she held her child i told them to she said not looking at him i told them to but they wouldnt listen they saidthey said it wasnt necessary that hed get better ezekais mouth dropped open hardly able to believe it maria was lying to him he sensed it in his gut with the properties ashhur had bestowed upon all his angels lyingbut why maria he said trying to keep his tone gentle i know you hide something from me why was the scepter not used in your heart you knew kaisen needed my aid someone else denied you tell me why maria sniffed still refusing to look at him theyll be mad at me she said it was no lie who are they she gestured to the door and the village beyond they she said you are under my protection as are all of the people here please she looked up at him with red eyes they didnt want you to see what they did to saul the words the meaning the mystery it all sent a chill down his spine he didnt even know he could feel anger and fear simultaneously like that hed thought it a lost human emotion apparently not where he whispered she told him he knelt down kissed her forehead then her sons stay here he said exiting the home he let his wings stretch wide it felt good but it was the only pleasurable thing he felt with several heavy beats he took to the air then circled around to the northern end of the town there hanging from a pole he found the body of the man who had been saul reid his skin was dry from exposure to the sun with rips in it showing rot the crows had been at the corpse as well further deteriorating it the worst though was where the mans crotch had been all that remained of his genitals was a brutal collection of gore and pus ezekai landed his hand reaching for his sword what has been done here he roared to the village all of you come to me and answer for this slowly they gathered men and women lurking at the edges of homes and beyond not daring to near the pole none spoke again ezekai demanded answers his voice carrying some went running out to the fields with each passing second of silence ezekai felt his anger grow you he said pointing at a brownhaired woman leaning against a nearby home who has done this not my place to say she said ask the men theyre coming another he asked this a boy of twelve my pa said not to say not even to you the child insisted and it was the truth ezekai turned about and looked to the fields a group of thirty men was approaching instruments of their trade slung over their shoulders he sensed no anger in them no danger justcaution next to ezekai the rotting body continued to slowly swing when the group arrived they crossed their arms and kicked their feet into the dirt as if waiting for something ezekai had no patience for any of it i demand an explanation he said he was just like locke said one of the men he was a thin fellow and the dirt on his face looked like it belonged there from the way the others looked to him he appeared to be the one in charge of the most recent events they did stuff together the two of them he admitted as much when we caught him peeping in through my little girls window you tortured this knowledge out of him the men glanced to one another we made him talk another admitted ezekai closed his eyes meaning to pray for calm but the stench of the corpse was too near they had killed the man mutilated him and then hung him up for all to see because of this they nearly let an innocent child die all so they might hide their deed when ezekai opened his eyes he felt fury burning in his blood you tortured mutilated and then murdered a man he said to them without law without justice without proof we heard it from his mouth someone shouted he confessed shouted another under torture ezekai insisted how do you know he spoke truth what of you asked the thin fellow with the dirty face they were closer now starting to surround him how do we know you spoke truth when you forgave locke if he fell on his knees and begged would you have let that monster remain in our village there was no way for ezekai to know and no way to explain when locke had cast himself to the dirt the guilt and sorrow overwhelmed every strand of his soul his yearning for salvation beyond anything ezekai could describe the man hated himself hated his life ezekai had shown him a ray of light had hoped to cure him of the vile desires and then in that light locke had asked for forgiveness from a man hed wronged that man colton had murdered him in cold blood yet now when faced with another similar situation the townspeople chose not to embrace the forgiveness but instead the murderer it was more than ezekai could understand he didnt want to understand it he didnt want to believe it he cherished these people he protected them he loved them even the poor sick saul that hung from a rope ezekai lifted his sword this cannot happen he told them it will not happen not again not ever he turned to cut free the body only to find a wall blocking him the men were gathering together holding their rakes shovels and scythes as weapons against him he hangs said the man in charge we called no angel and were a hundred miles from mordeina what saul did deserved death by every law known to us even yours and we administered that law dont you dare cut him down the law called for you to shred his loins the law said your fear of being caught allows a child to die of sickness move aside now they did not he saw their fear sensed it but they wouldnt move not on their own but ezekai would make them he flung himself forward his blade whirling most of the men turned to flee but a few tried to fight their instruments shattered against his shining blade their worn iron nothing compared to steel forged in the smiths of eternity ezekai shifted pushed doing everything possible to harm not a single man when he cleared the other side he flapped his wings rose into the air and then sliced through the rope sauls body crumpled to the ground ezekai landed before it and met the eyes of those who stood against him bury him he commanded bury him yourself said the dirtyfaced man what are you going to do if we dont kill us ezekais jaw trembled you tread on dangerous ground he said softly you arent above mercy you arent wiser than the heavens he grabbed the rope and flew flew until he found a spot far away from the town landing on the soft grass he jammed his sword into the dirt twisted it to the side and then tore into the ground with his bare hands he dug free the rest his skin was tough but so was the ground and it wasnt long before drops of his scarlet blood mixed with the earth deeper and deeper he dug the grave moving with greater urgency without a word he pushed the corpse into the hole then started filling it at last it was finished and with solemn silence he sat on his knees with his wings he patted down the dirt atop the grave and with his tears he marked the headstone ezekai looked to his sword its shining blade now covered with dirt and remembered the impulse hed felt as the humans challenged him the desire to prove them wrong the desire to end their anger pride and hatred the desire to kill help us ashhur ezekai said curling his body together crumpling his bleeding hands into the loose earth of the grave beneath his chest heavens help us what are we becoming harruq stepped out into the private courtyard still adjusting the straps of his armor his swords swung wildly at his hips the buckle not tightened correctly not that it mattered he didnt march into battle just a spar one he desperately desperately needed i was beginning to think youd changed your mind judarius said an easy smile was on the angels face his enormous mace resting across one shoulder his eyes a mixture of green and gold sparkled im killing antonil the moment he gets back harruq said giving his belt a savage tug to tighten it thought it might be best to confess that now get it all out of the way pressures of running a kingdom pressures of running it badly careful with your swings by the way ive been told these flower pots are rather old judarius looked at the flowers growing in vases of white marble and then shrugged i will do my best he said but if i must i will replace them with vases of pearl and gold from avlimar are you ready halforc harruq drew his swords immediately feeling the tension in his muscles beginning to ease standing there with his blades in his hands made him think to his days training with haern the watcher back then hed relied on strength alone his fighting style the equivalent of a bull running someone over he liked to think he was better now and as judarius raised his mace harruq wondered if haern would be proud of him it was a strange thought a bitter remembrance and it nearly cost him his first hit judariuss mace swung in almost lazy compared to what the mighty warrior was capable of harruq crossed his swords and blocked letting out a grunt as he did whats that judarius asked stepping back and slamming the hilt of the mace toward harruqs gut have you gotten fat already harruq shoved the wood aside twirled salvation in his left hand and then thrust the angels mace was already turning easily shoving the blade high two more hits he tried his swords thudding against the enchanted wood that made up the maces handle more and more as sweat ran down his face and neck harruq felt his stress ease this was what he knew parry dodge thrust counter weapon colliding against weapon strength meeting strength what madness had made antonil think he could handle constant requests for money he did not have justice he did not understand and soldiers he could not give youve slowed judarius said feigning an attack but then assaulting anyway the mace came slamming in and it took all of harruqs strength to stand against it im getting old happens to the best of us you old condemnation swung through the air inches from the angels chestpiece you have elf blood in your veins i think you have a good fifty years more before you can consider yourself worthy of a few gray hairs it was something aurelia had mentioned long before and it still struck harruq as odd it also made him annoyed so he was just out of practice then too lazy and stressed to perform the exercises haern had taught him he thought back to when hed fought the demon god thulos standing against him even when the angels could not he was pretty sure that old harruq would wallop the current one and the aggravation sent him on the offensive a constant assault that judarius still blocked with ease you won last we fought judarius said what happened he finally leapt into the air his great wings flapping to launch him several feet backward he landed beside the wall of the courtyard his wings knocking over two different flower vases they hit with dull thuds but did not break harruq winced anyway i think theyd make me pay for that he said judarius gave him an incredulous look we spar yet all you can think about are flowers perhaps you should have stayed on your throne harruq settled into a stance his swords crossed before him as he struggled to regain his breath you havent scored a hit yet he said trying to keep his temper in check i havent tried if you wont try then youre right i should have stayed on the throne after all id hate to waste my time a bit of disappointment flashed in judariuss eyes his chiseled body tensed and he readied his mace careful he said it isnt wise to taunt an angel harruq smirked nor a halforc judarius used his wings to add to his momentum hurtling across the courtyard with his mace in full swing for a brief moment harruq felt afraid but his pride pushed it away legs tensed mouth pulled into a snarl he flung both his blades in the way of the mighty weapon the shock of the hit stole his breath away and he flew several feet back colliding with a marble pillar built near the outer ring of the garden harruq slumped against it leaning his head back and laughing lost my edge in fighting too he said good to know im now worthless everywhere judarius approached his mace flung over his shoulder there was no joy in his eyes despite his victory youre more troubled than i thought he said is it really so terrible harruq let out a sigh as he closed his eyes i was prepared for it to be tough he said but this is still so much worse than i ever could have believed everyone looks to me as if i wield so much power yet in truth ive never felt more helpless in all my life he waved his hands about gesturing to where servants were watching ready to come to him at a moments notice never alone he said never in need never allowed to go beyond the castle without guards our kings are prisoners judarius no wonder so many turn mad and bitter the angel set the mace down then sat opposite harruq his wings folding behind his back do not feel you are alone in this judarius said he frowned looked away as if embarrassed i once led armies commanding angel legions into battle against the demons of our kind i even faced the mad god testing my might against him yet now what am i who do i command and what enemies do i fight against all i know is war all i have been taught is strategy and conquest and now here in this peace i am lost i am without purpose you protect mankind from themselves the angel said shaking his head our enemies are our friends our friends our enemies there are no battle lines there are no sides if this is a war it is one i fear i am losing i have told ahaesarus that this cannot go on but he insists harruq was surprised to hear that the angels shared such similar concerns for some reason hed thought their opinions would be unanimous but that showed a mindset so many others had that the angels were all one and the same but judarius and azariah both brothers were about as far apart as harruq was to qurrah his mind drifted thinking of what the arguments must be like up in avlimar when the entire angel host gathered milord harruq turned then pushed himself to his feet as he realized the queen stood at the entrance to the garden she wore a soft yellow dress and the sunlight shone off her thin crown im not your lord he told her youre the one in charge here and you of all people should know that a smile tugged at her lips but it vanished far too quickly i she stopped glancing at judarius i fear i bring troubling news what harruq asked its only a rumor but i believe there is truth in it harruqsome villagers were attacked by an angel harruqs mouth dropped open he looked to judarius dreading the angels reaction but so far he remained calm his eyes locked on susan go on judarius said ive yet to hear a consensus as to where but it was a village in the south near the border to ker there was a disagreement over the punishment of a criminal though i cant say the exact nature of it the angel drew his blade against them most say none were hurt but a few are claiming otherwise harruq sheathed his swords keeping his hands on the hilts wishing he could feel the same release of tension as when he first stepped out into the yard if an angel attacked innocent villagers for any reason then the protests would spread susans brother would leap on it immediately spreading word of the tyranny from the heavens and as things spiraled worse and worse both sides would look to him expecting him to fix it expecting him to have the answers he turned to judarius but before he could speak the angel interrupted him i will discover what i can he said we must not let the kingdom be divided over rumors and lies be patient for the truth harruq when everything is known we will decide the fates of all involved judarius dipped his head toward the queen then soared off into the sky heading straight for the distant glimmer that was avlimar harruq watched him go feeling panic creep around the corners of his mind susan took his hand and he flinched as if shocked youll be fine she told him her eyes on avlimar dont worry ill always be here she kissed his cheek before retreating back into the castle i cant do this harruq whispered he looked ever higher you hear me ashhur i cant do this youve got to help me out here because he swallowed felt a chill spreading through his veins because this will all crumble if you dont small squads of brams soldiers had followed them at all times saying nothing only ensuring that as the week passed antonils army never tarried on their way to the eastern side sticking to the roads limited what they could see of ker which disappointed tarlak through their rapid travel he saw a healthy land with not a hint of the wreckage that had waylaid mordan brought forth by both demons and rebellion the rigon river formed the eastern border of ker twice as wide as the corinth its only crossing was via the two fabled gods bridges that connected the rigon delta ashhurs bridge over the western spine karaks bridge over the eastern but as tarlak approached ashhurs bridge alongside antonil it resembled little of what he once remembered in between the arches where thered been worn statues of winged knights there were now rows of barricades the stone floor which had once been rare white marble was now hidden beneath wooden walls and planks it seemed spears poked out in all directions as if the bridge were the back of a porcupine killing lanes walls trenches all built with one purpose in mind protecting ker from the orcs beyond a single soldier rode out to meet them as they approached the bridge greetings king of mordan said the soldier my name is yoric and i control ashhurs bridge ive been informed that your army will pass through without incident my men have stood down and we request you make haste to the other side we will do our best antonil said thank you said yoric so you know the orcs havent touched us in months but i think thats because they figured out weve no intentions of traveling beyond the river be careful in there your highness its a different world even compared to when you last came the reminder of his failed first campaign made antonils face twitch your warning is appreciated he said dryly in tightly packed rows his army marched through the winding pathways built upon the bridge coming out the other side into lands of the delta another few hours and they would cross the second bridge which would dump them out into an area that had once belonged to the nation of omn now only orcs remained with the exception of the distant city of angelport whose walls had helped protect it from the invaders and whose ships kept its people from starving being fairly close to the elven lands didnt hurt much either when the last of the soldiers and wagons were across tarlak finally crossed the bridge himself keep the way back open for us he said tossing yoric a wink just in case we come screaming for our lives a horde of orcs on our tail no orc will cross this bridge yoric said i assure you come your return victorious or otherwise well be here waiting my heroes tarlak said offering an exaggerated bow before snapping his fingers summoning a gust of wind to blow him into the air and back toward the front of the army where antonil marched after crossing into omn tarlak oversaw the setting up of the camp positioning wagons and yelling at men dumb enough to pitch their tents beyond his preset lines it gave the wizard a headache but at least he got to take it out on the rest of the men when hed circled the enormous camp twice and yelled himself hoarse he finally joined antonil to his surprise he found the king sitting alone before his tent a fire burning not far from his feet shouldnt you be surrounded by generals advisors and various bootlickers tarlak asked i sent them away antonil said proof youre a good king or a terrible one tarlak said grabbing one of many empty chairs from the tent and propping it opposite antonil sadly im not sure which well know the answer by the time this campaign ends tarlak took off his hat reached inside and pulled out a longnecked bottle popping the cork with his thumb he took a drink of the wine within so morose today he said when finished whats eating my glorious king nothing i wished to be alone is all something a certain wizard appears incapable of understanding have you ordered me to leave yet no tarlak lifted the bottle in a toast then im staying your highness have a drink if itll help loosen your tongue youre too strong to be eaten by nothing so how about you share what is bothering you antonil reluctantly accepted the bottle he took a sip then frowned at it is there any alcohol in this he asked somewhere in there thats the fruitier blend im saving the hard stuff for after our first battle antonil chuckled and shook his head youre something else he said well aware now talk after a deep drink antonil handed it over wiped his face on his sleeve ive been thinking of the first campaign to retake neldar from the orcs he said aaah tarlak said dwelling on old losses thats not the best for morale your highness in my professional opinion stop it duly noted and ignored did i ever tell you how it happened tarlak scratched at his goatee trying to remember would have been three years ago so hed have been no he said i was helping jerico and lathaar rebuild their citadel the priesthood helped too but youd be surprised how much funding i had to beg steal and borrow to get that place up and running i heard about your return was all anyone could talk about for a few months not that anyone really cared about how it had happened just that you failed i sometimes wonder if the people wanted me to fail antonil said eyes staring off into nowhere snapping out of it he reached over and yanked the bottle from tarlaks hand careful with that tarlak grumbled drink the whole thing and you might get tipsy compared to sergans special brew this is just water antonil said i can handle water what i cant handle is watching men who trust me who expect me to protect them die by the thousands he fell silent and tarlak frowned when it seemed he wouldnt continue he forced the story along figuring it better to get antonil talking about it instead of just brooding so what did happen to your last glorious campaign he asked i was too confident antonil said after all i was antonil the dragonslayer defeater of demons friend of angels for eternitys sake wed even retaken a city from a god what could a couple hundred orcs do against us i had harruq with me too while his wife was away showing their daughter to her distant family in quellassar the two of us together along with eight thousand men strong what could defeat me at least thats what i thought nearly every night was a celebration that army wasnt like this one a lot of them were from neldar had fought with me since our days of fleeing veldaren when karaks forces captured its walls we were coming home we were going to take our swords and shove them down those orcs throats and piece by piece reclaim what was ours he shook his head so foolish so arrogant we didnt clear out any outlying villages we didnt check with angelport or send scouts to ask the elves for information when we were near their forests no we marched straight toward veldaren i dont know why i guess i felt once we retook that city then everything else would fall into place perhaps i thought itd wash away all the blood and death that had happened since i fled abandoning it for karaks prophet like an arrow we shot toward the city but we never made it not even close tarlak thought on what he did know about antonils first campaign itd been cut drastically short his return to mordan coming months earlier than expected there had been only a single battle but from what everyone said it had been a crushing defeat where did the orcs finally attack he asked harruq told me theyd been developing siege weapons antonil said seemingly ignoring his question i didnt listen of course i didnt the orcs were brutes stupid leaderless or so i thought when we were three days ride out from kinamn we encountered the first of the raiding parties they were small quick and knew exactly how to hit us they never let us sleep and they targeted our supplies whenever they could thinking they were based out of kinamn i steered us toward the city with hopes of crushing the bastards where they couldnt flee still the raiders hit us always at night they slipped in wherever fires flickered out cutting the throats of my men while they slept reached a point where many refused to sleep and i had to keep huge portions of my army on constant patrol when the walls of kinamn came in sight they were so welcome the city appeared in ruins its walls vacant but every one of my advisors insisted the orcs hid within the gates were torn open so we thought wed have no issues entering we should have tarlak took the bottle of wine from antonil then gulped down the rest of it how many orcs were inside the city he asked at least five thousand antonil said not looking up they had archers hiding along the walls and all at once they stood and fired hundreds of men crammed into the doorway dying instantly worse were the catapults theyd been aimed at the pathway leading into the city and before the call to retreat had even left my lips they were let loose dozens of boulders landed amid us rolling breaking our lines like we were playthings we expected unprepared cowards hiding from us as we burned out their nest i couldnt have been more disastrously wrong we retreated of course we outnumbered them but with the catapults the archers on the wallswhat could we do several thousand rushed after swarming us as we retreated i tried keeping order to set up a line of defense but the only reason any of us lived was because of harruq gods what a sight he was while everyone else was busy running away he was screaming and hollering for the orcs to come get him even the catapults didnt scare him when harruq met the first wave those around him stood their ground lest they be overwhelmed as well even in the chaos we could see those bloodred swords swinging by the time i halted our retreat and sent men to aid him hed taken down at least thirty on his own it was around him my men rallied and we sent the orcs running back to their city and the safety of their walls antonil shook his head after that we limped back to mordeina of my eight thousand men only three thousand returned we never even stepped foot on neldar soil and when i returned to my castle to my wife and child i discovered i had a new name the missing king they called me the joke is on them of course id have preferred to be gone far longer than i was no id have even stayed in the ruins of veldaren never to return if i had my way you cant talk like that tarlak insisted these are mordan soldiers if they hear you wishing you could abandon your throne theyll what antonil asked turn on me they already have the whole kingdom is watching me waiting for me to fail i first came with eight thousand and now i come with thirty i will free my home taken by the sword and in the rubble raise my child my family and what of mordan the king waved dismissively the angels can have it for all i care they already rule it anyway tarlak stood from his chair and bowed low to his friend this campaign will be different he said you have me to start with but you are a king and you rule lands loyal to you if you do this to expand your kingdom to retake what is yours then i will be here every step of the way but if you think this is your chance to escape everything that is happening in mordan a way to sidestep your responsibilitiesthen i fear i have far more relaxing ways to waste my time antonil swallowed rubbed his eyes with his hands forgive me tar he said i dont mean it i do want to escape but i could never do it ive never fled my responsibilities and i never will thats why im here i was to protect the people of neldar they trusted me and followed me across dezrel and back again because of that trust i will repay it i will free their homes their farmland their cities and forests i may be the missing king but i am still king and will be until my last breath tarlak reached across the fire and smacked antonils shoulder now thats the man i know he said grinning let those orcs try to raid us again let them be all sneaky at night theyve got a nasty surprise waiting for them no one outtricks a mage and when we reach kinamn well see how well those catapults work once ive set them aflame youre a good man tarlak antonil said perhaps i should have brought you with me instead of harruq on that first campaign tarlak laughed you kidding id have teleported myself back to mordeina the second those orc archers popped up on the walls good night antonil he raised his empty bottle attempted a drink from it anyway and then left the man to his thoughts beside her qurrah stirred his mouth opening to let out a soft whimper tessanna leaned in close kissed his lips until they shut they slept not far off the road north and in the light of the moon tessanna let her fingers brush her lovers face her lips slowly drifted their way to his forehead where her fingertips had softly traced an arcane invisible shape upon his skin and then she breathed the nightmares the fear the tormented memories they all came floating out of her lover like a black mist deep into her lungs she inhaled them letting them burn within her squirming in her belly like fire beetles sleep well she whispered as qurrahs body visibly relaxed every night since the angels had healed his corrupted body banishing the undead flesh and returning him whole he had suffered those dreams every night tessanna took them carried them within herself it was the stink of velixar the stink of karak it floated around him demanding death tessannas dark eyes saw it began to water as she bent over qurrahs body and braced her arms her thin pale form shivered as the whispers flooded into her you are mine they hissed mine the promise remains open your arms qurrah come back and embrace me never tessanna said through her tears never again sleep was a long time coming and when it did come she dreamed of fire qurrah was surprised by the amount of travelers they encountered on the road to mordeina hoping to avoid suspicion he kept his questions few and instead let his ears do the work most were traveling north hoping to find work now that so many ablebodied men had left on antonils war against the orcs on their fourth day they came upon an inn qurrahs coin was few but the idea of him and tess sleeping on an actual bed was too tempting tonight we spoil ourselves he said taking her hand and leading her inside well have nothing left when we reach mordeina tessanna pointed out true qurrah said but my brother is steward of the realm i dare say well be fine the inn was crowded and for a moment qurrah worried there would be no room theres still a bed or two left a fat man on the far side of the open kitchen shouted as if reading his mind ginger get over there and get their things a young lad with bright red hair raced through the many tables then quickly bowed before the two i would prefer to carry them on my own qurrah told him just show us to our room the kid nodded beckoning them to follow the room was small barely able to fit the bed within at least they wouldnt be sharing a room with any of the other travelers qurrah thought he looked over the sheets and pushed against the straw as the boy watched expectantly how long until dinner will be served he asked as tessanna stood in the corner looking very tired another hour ginger said very well leave us the kid nodded and shut the door qurrah sighed as tessanna moved to his side lice the halforc murmured and fleas such a charming locale with a wave of his hand a soft cloud floated from his palm down to the bed curling over it like mist upon a lake the cloud was death and though weak enough even a child could go unbothered it was still far more than the parasites could withstand their tiny bodies would remain but at least they wouldnt be crawling all over him biting his flesh eat without me tessanna said kissing his cheek qurrah glanced at her frowning is something wrong he asked you havent looked well for much of our trip no i just want some peace bring me a bit of bread when youre done and ill eat it later qurrah shrugged as you wish he left his room and returned to the commons finding an unused table with only two chairs he sat in one put his feet on the other and beckoned ginger over bread and drink he said dad says you need to pay for your room before you eat the halforc sighed pulled out a handful of coins and settled the bill it left him with just enough to cover the cost of his food and he handed that over as well bring me enough for two he said before the kid could leave ill be taking some to my room finally alone qurrah leaned back and let his ears soak in the conversations it was still somewhat quiet in his corner with the bulk of the men and women gathering near the fire they were laughing talking and their mirth made qurrah feel strangely bitter he wished tessanna had come with him wished he could have flirted with her awhile her mood had slowly soured over the past year though not consistently nothing was ever consistent with tessanna he doubted shed ever tell him why either was it their continuing inability to have a child her lack of purpose since the gods war did she just miss contact with the rest of the world every time he thought he knew something else she said or did contradicted the idea his meal came and qurrah ate it with speed but without any real appreciation sipping at the watery beer ginger brought him he once more tried to listen in one of the louder men at the fire was telling a raunchy tale when the door to the inn burst open and in walked a bearded man with a heavy ax on his back gervis several men shouted lifting their glasses in toast gervis grinned at them in return youll all be buying me a round tonight the big man nearly roared do i have a tale to tell qurrah leaned deeper into his seat narrowed his eyes and hoped it would be of something useful the men at the fire shifted aside making way for gervis to plop down before the flames his ax still on his back trader just came in from the borderlands gervis began accepting an offered cup from one of his friends about a week back they had a hanging at norstrom had hangings before a particularly drunk man shouted and he laughed as if it were the funniest thing we have gervis said guzzling down his own drink but this one was done to a sick fuck who liked to diddle with little boys and girls but that aint the thing that got the traders talking no this one was done without the angels permission by the abyss i dare say it was even done against their permission he had their attention now qurrahs included what happened someone asked once it was clear gervis would wait for some prodding well an angel finally took note of it theyd strung the guy from a pole used his dick as a rope supposedly no one would claim responsibility either drove the angel mad is what theyre saying started hollering waving his sword around the men were laughing now wish i could have seen that nothing like watching them holier than shit angels squirm a little redfaced i bet he was red like a tomato gervis gestured for a refill this is where it stops being funny he said listen close now you know i tell no lies this angel ezekai was his name i believe he demanded they cut down the pervert and bury him well the people of norstrom wanted no part of that and when they refused the angel drew his sword and attacked them the laughing dwindled to chuckles then to silence all around at other tables conversation slowed it was as if a hot wind had blown through the place and gervis grinned knowing all ears were now his no one died he continued but that dont change matters none he drew his sword and started swinging knocking people out of his way just so he could cut down and bury the fucker these were just regular people people like you or me and he was ready to kill every last one of them to get his way and what were these people doing standing up for their rights thats what the laws supposed to be in our hands in mans hands but they dont like that none do they qurrah waved ginger over and requested more to drink the moment it arrived qurrah guzzled it down his mind racing the topic at every table was now the same grumblings and complaints about the angels two men directly beside qurrah were obnoxiously loud and he had little choice in overhearing one told my wife i was cheating on her when he found out one of the men said can you believe that what place is that for him huh like it matters i had a quick roll around with jessie none of their damn business whatd she do the mans friend asked left me took our kid with her too dumb bitch im better without her qurrah struggled to bite his tongue was this what the people really wanted the right to cheat on spouses and dole out brutal justice he thought of azariahs frustration and shook his head other than turning a blind eye to it all what else was there to do but the simmering anger he felt confirmed what tessanna had suggested the people were nearing rebellion against their winged enforcers not there yet not quite so far there was too much acceptance mixed with the anger they were upset by things they felt beyond their control but once they felt they had a choice once they believed they had the numbers and the power to make things different tessanna sat in front of him at the table startling him i thought you were unwell he said tessanna glanced about the common room hunched down closer i didnt want to be alone anymore she said her voice so soft he could barely hear her i did but then i didnt is the food worthwhile qurrah pushed her portion of the bread her way the butters fresh at least he said she ate it nibbling like she was a squirrel qurrah leaned closer and kept his voice down the people are resentful of the angels he told her simply put theyre human and they want to be human with all that entails so long as azariah enforces his higher standard through law theyre going to resent him perhaps your brother can do something tessanna suggested hes steward now surely the angels will listen to him thats if i can make him agree he might not perhaps hell only view these complaints as nothing more than growing pains or labor pains tessanna said glancing about though whether child or monster will be born im not sure even the gods know gerviss overwhelming voice roared again aye i heard crossed the bridge not too long ago no one knows why his brothers the steward maybe hes hoping to get a cushy job a job wiping his brothers ass maybe gervis laughed and everyone laughed with him qurrahs fist curled tight as his whip writhed around his right arm behave tessanna said meeting his eye they know nothing of you nothing of me any of you ever seen that demon girl of his gervis asked firm tits an ass you could bounce coins off of well a man was talking to me just this other day told me something i could hardly believe he lived in veldaren was there when them people were attacked now everyone knows she was sleeping with that prophet but this friend of mine was saying it went way further than that he waited until people began pressuring for greater detail how much further gervis continued well he said she spent the whole damn day and night fucking those demons kept shouting it was her calling like it was some sort of worship thousands of demons i tell you every single one of them each hung like horses if you ever meet tessanna delone youre meeting the absolute biggest whore in the history of dezrel and thats something you should tip your hat in respect to qurrahs fists slammed into the table he lurched from his seat his weight braced against the wood as if his fury overwhelmed his ability to stand the commotion earned him several glances his way and when they saw the fire curling off his hands blackening the table many hurried up from their seats toward the door no fighting the barkeep shouted no magic no swords qurrah felt his arms shaking as he stared down gervis the big oaf had turned his way and he looked dumbfounded as to the reason for qurrahs glare something the matter friend gervis asked his hand had fallen to the handle of his ax which lay by his feet youre telling tales qurrah said feeling an icy calm come over him telling lies hey now im only saying what i heard if you have a problem with he stopped for tessanna had stood as well her face catching the light of the fire if there was anything more recognizable than qurrahs orcish features it was those solid black eyes and that long raven hair but i do have a problem she said sliding around the table and walking their way qurrah watched his fingers tensed the second something went wrong hed be ready with fire and shadows thisthis is a joke right gervis said staring at her a trick no tricks tessanna said her voice almost seductive its me tessanna delone lover of the great traitor qurrah shouldnt you tip your hat gervis paused but he had no hat to tip and he looked like a cornered frightened animal at the mention of qurrahs name his grip on the handle of his ax tightened and around him several of the men backed away their hands also reaching for weaponry they were all keenly aware of him now and the tension in the room increased tenfold do it qurrah said his raspy voice piercing the sudden quiet if you have no hat then bow in respect tessanna stepped closer closer her hips swaying her head tilted to one side a soft smile on her lips i like the sound of that she said her dark eyes sweeping over them all of you kneel from her back shot four long tendrils they were thin black and looked like a sick mockery of butterfly wings they curled around gervis and the three men with him pulling on their arms and sweeping out their feet to force them to the ground others in the tavern started readying for a fight but qurrah pointed his fingers at them his hands consumed by fire his look was clear the first to interfere would die horribly tessanna slowly sank to her knees before gervis who was struggling against the black tendril hard enough to make his face swell red such a good storyteller she whispered yet in the silence qurrah could still hear her such a funny man but what do you know of me nothing in your mind i am what you claim me to be she slid closer putting her lips inches away from his ear so what do you want me to be do you want me to be your whore is that what you want she lovingly rubbed his face and her touch immediately ceased his struggling his eyes were wide and he looked so frightened he might pass out but im not tessanna whispered im not your whore im not your joke the prophet never touched me do you understand never nor the demons nor anyone else since i met my love find your laughs elsewhere little man because if you dont she shifted to the side then kissed his cheek her lips blackened his flesh making it smoke as if she were branding him with a hot iron he screamed but her hand covered his mouth her fingernails digging into his skin after only a moment she pulled back and his screaming ceased if you dont she said and her eyes swept the tavern then ill fuck you like the whore you think i am im fire and well see just how many of you burn the tendrils released retreating into her back the men scattered gervis leading the way others watched waiting to see if anything else would happen nothing did tessanna turned to qurrah and he saw the anger in her eyes slowly fading the fire vanished from his hands and he rushed to her side see were not disturbed he told the innkeeper and based on the fear he saw in everyones eyes he didnt think it too difficult a request back in their room qurrah slammed the door shut punched it with his fist my brother the hero the godslayer the steward qurrah muttered and what are we traitors cowards the great whores he turned to see tessanna sitting on the bed her hands in her lap she looked ashamed i lied down there she said softly qurrah frowned lied about what about touching only you since i met you qurrah closed his eyes told himself not do something stupid shed told him about jerico and their single moment of weakness or had it been strength it was something he never wanted to think about to even remember having happened you know i dont blame you for it he said putting his arms around her id put velixars promises of power above you in my heart and jerico was there for comfort im better than i was then right she looked up at him smiling despite her tears so much better she said kissing him he held her close dont listen to what they say he said theyre ignorant fools but they hate us so much and the stories they tellthey do it to make us less than what we were less human more broken we hurt them and now they want to make us into monsters demonfucking monsters and heartless slavering betrayers but i dont want to be that to them i just want to beme but that will never happen will it nothing i do will ever make them see me any other way thats not true qurrah said we could show them we could help rebuild the world help resolve their ire with the angels its my fault for taking us away into hiding for letting the stories grow unchecked im sorry tess i should have known better she kissed his lips then lay back on the bed qurrah yes tess she smiled sheepishly i think im all right with using a disguise now at least until we reach harruq despite the exhaustion and stress of the day qurrah laughed jessilynn lay before the fire without the strength to sit up her arms and back ached tremendously the result of another lengthy set of hours training while sonowin rested from their flight her fingers felt raw and the idea of pulling back her bowstring even one more time made her queasy staring up at the stars she breathed in deeply then let it out trying to relax her sore muscles i do not understand why you are so upset dieredon said sitting across from her the lazy fire burning between them he picked at the remains of a groundhog hed shot and cooked sometime during the day i was told you were familiar with a bow a few hours of practice should be nothing its not the time jessilynn said doing her best to not sound defensive before it was just me with you its different every shot has to bei dont know how to explain every single one has to be right with you ten arrows with you feel like twenty on my own patience she heard dieredon say that is the reason im teaching you patience giving the bow a greater chance to work on you your body will adjust in time jessilynn closed her eyes and laughed despite herself is this one of those pain is good for you lessons because i hated those whenever jerico gave them dieredon chuckled silence came over them broken occasionally by sonowins nearby rustling as she grazed on the pale yellow grass of the wedge slowly jessilynn shifted so she lay on her back close enough to feel the heat on her face as she stared into the fire she caught dieredon watching her and she felt her heart quicken she had slowly gotten used to the elfs presence but still there were times when she could hardly believe where she was how long ago was it shed been sleeping in a cramped bunk within the cold stone walls of the citadel two weeks three why are you here dieredon asked the abruptness of the question caught jessilynn off guard and she looked up at him dumbfounded to learn she said believing that the safe answer you know i ask for more than that there is something burning in you something driving you beyond others your age i watched you in practice that final hour you were clearly in pain learning little because of your exhaustion yet still you continued not once refusing my demand to loose another arrow a bit of anger bubbled up jessilynns stomach you were testing me she asked of course i am your teacher after all now answer the question what is driving you she looked away preferring to watch the flame consuming the many twigs which dieredon had showed her how to stack as to lengthen the life of the fire her neck blushed and she bit her tongue the answer wasnt hard but she felt embarrassed to admit it still dieredons eyes were upon her and he seemed perfectly content to wait until she gave her answer and if she refused well it wasnt that far a flight for him to dump her off at the citadel i want to be like jerico she blurted out when it seemed his patience was finally wearing thin the following silence was painful as she waited for his response your hair isnt red enough dieredon said she opened her mouth closed it then giggled upon realizing the elf had actually made a joke not just jerico she said feeling herself relax lathaar darius tyrus the first people revere them i hear the stories and all i desire is to do even better i feel jealous even jerico stood before a portal slaughtering waves of war demons not stopping even when a spear pierced his side lathaar defeated the ancient evil darakken tyrus drove the remnants of karaks beasts into the wedge near on his own surviving even though engulfed by thousands and returning a hero darius prevented cyrics madness from overtaking all of mordan every night i went to bed listening to these stories and when i look at jericos shield i think she fell silent speak your mind dieredon insisted you will receive no judgment from me and no mockery jessilynn slowly forced herself into a sitting position her hand fell to the bow that lay beside her in the grass i see the glow on my arrows and believe there has to be a reason she said jericos shield was unlike all others and look at everything hes accomplished now i bear a similar gift a blessing no one in my order has ever received before what will i do with it the demons are gone the ancient evils defeated what can i do to have my name belong next to theirs to allow me to stand beside the heroes of my order and not feel ashamed she bowed her head felt her voice tremble i have such a gift she said im just scared that ill waste it for a long minute she endured dieredons silence this world is not safe jessilynn he told her rising to his feet your angels have done great things but i fear the illusion of safety they have created has been more damaging than they can possibly understand the east has gone wild and within the wedge the beasts are on the move every day my kind patrols the borders of our forests always in fear of orcish fire the ancient evils may be gone but new ones have replaced them he scattered the fire with his foot so they might safely sleep in darkness i do not know what you will accomplish with your life he said his eyes glowing in the starlight if you desire to be a hero you have the necessary strength inside you i can see it clear as the stars in the sky but your heroes didnt become who they were by accident they bled for it they died for it not for themselves but for others before you yearn for glory think of the costs and then he left her so she might sleep they spent much of the next two days in flight landing only to let sonowin rest during those respites dieredon showed her how to light a fire with twigs to hunt game and forage for edible roots and berries he barely let her touch her bow telling her she should let her body rest and instead learn something new moving silently across the grass was the hardest for her and more and more she saw her teacher growing frustrated with the clumsiness of her armor its made for battle not scouting he muttered one late afternoon my arrows glow a bright blue she responded how stealthy do you expect me to be he only shook his head when the fighting begins theyll know your presence its beforehand that matters sometimes you may not want to fight at all it is a hard skill to learn knowing when you are outmatched so you want me to learn to be a coward its not cowardice to adjust the battle more to your favor dieredon said theres a difference between them ten leagues wide what about all the times jerico and lathaar stood their ground when victory was hopeless yet still won havent you done the same she thought she had him but instead he only looked more disappointed with her i dare say they were left with no choice he said thats either bravery or poor forethought depending on who you ask neither is something you should run foolhardily into they took to the air on sonowins back and for the next hour jessilynn sulked upset at her inability to answer a simple question correctly if dieredon noticed he didnt mention it the land passed below them until at last the elf guided them back to the ground landing already jessilynn asked trying to pull herself out of her funk she was being immature and she knew it theres nothing here thats exactly the point the elf crouched low to the ground as he walked eyes scanning his surroundings for what she couldnt begin to guess the more time she spent with him the more she realized she would never possess a fraction of his skills the wilderness spoke to him in a way it never would to her the arrows in his quiver were as familiar to him as his own fingers even the weather couldnt surprise him and twice when it rained hed informed her a good twelve hours beforehand showing her how to build a rudimentary shelter with just sticks and dirt jessilynn waited feeling useless following after when he strayed farther and farther away nothing he said shaking his head after ten minutes had passed and theyd covered a large swathe of area everywhere we go nothing what does it mean she asked it seems the vile wedge is empty dieredon said standing and stretching the muscles in his back i cant even find signs of recent passage thats impossible jessilynn insisted you said only orcs had gone east and our boats patrol the western river as does the wall of towers if thered been such a massive exodus wed have heard of it perhaps dieredon said but he didnt look convinced well continue west for now tens of thousands of monsters dont vanish without leaving a trace theyre somewhere and i will find them jessilynns butt and back ached from such long periods of riding but she said nothing only gritted her teeth as she climbed atop sonowin and wrapped her arms around dieredons waist yet again the miles passed below as the horses wings flapped with a steady rhythm occasionally she glanced down but it was always the same rocky hills and dull grass part of her understood why the creatures so strongly desired to escape living in such a bland infertile land must have worn on them as the years passed not that she regretted it humans living peaceably next to wolfmen and birdmen preposterous she knew well the stories jerico had told of darius and him making their stand against the army of wolfmen that had crossed the gihon and made their way west shed often imagined herself sitting atop one of the homes her bow in hand releasing glowing arrows into the beasts thinning the horde and saving dozens of lives there dieredon said breaking her out of her daydream several hours had passed at a tedious pace he pointed and she followed his gaze it took a few moments before they closed enough distance for her human eyes to see from her vantage point it looked like a blob of darkness atop the yellow landscape it helped none that the sun was beginning to set obscuring it further what is it she had to ask as dieredon ordered sonowin to fly higher a group of hyenamen the elf said why arent we following them dieredon glanced back at her gave her a wink consider it a hunch as you humans might say once they were past the group sonowin dipped lower the land grew closer and she saw more clearly the red stone jutting out from the grass the spattered collections of trees that grew short and thin of leaf dieredon leaned so far off sonowins side she feared hed fall they banked lower lower until the ground was frighteningly close below them jessilynn kept her legs clenched against the horses sides begging ashhur to calm her nerves up ahead the hills grew taller and above them drifted a lazy column of smoke dieredon said something to sonowin in elvish and then the horses wings sharply changed their angle blowing back against the air current they soared upward killing more of their momentum and then with hardly a bump they landed at the foot of the hills jessilynn hopped off sonowins back following dieredon something about the way his body tensed made her uneasy and the mischievous grin on his face helped none either he seemed excited yet all she felt was fear whats beyond the hills she asked keeping her voice a whisper she already felt too loud because of the soft rustling of her chainmail against the studded leather backing thats what were here to find out dieredon said as they continued to climb then why not fly over with sonowin the elf shook his head a gesture jessilynn was becoming all too familiar with seeing the suns not yet set and the sky is clear he said i dont want them to know were here he hurried ahead his excitement growing despite his speed he made not a sound jessilynn bumbled after more and more thinking she needed to make some adjustments to her armor why he hadnt forced her to already was baffling perhaps he was waiting to see if she did it on her own just as he waited to see if she would complain when he pushed her too far in her training when dieredon neared the top of the hill he lay on his stomach and crawled to its peak when he looked beyond she saw a jolt go through him he held his palm open toward her and she dropped to her belly figuring he wanted her to show equal care something in the way he froze there the way his excited grin had fledwhat was beyond the hill what could scare the scoutmaster of the quellan elves elbow over elbow she crawled across the yellow grass until at last she joined the elfs side and overlooked the land below ashhur help us she whispered unable to stop herself the hill ended sharply revealing a wide cleft it looked like a gash rent into the world with many surrounding hills also ending just as steep the space between was wide and flat much of it covered with dry red clay the sparse grass there smashed or dead and in that massive area spread out below them like colonies of ants were the creatures of the vile wedge nearest to her were the wolfmen packs of them gathered around the small fires that dotted the ravine she couldnt even begin to count their number but they were the most numerous of all the species as far as she could tell amid the cacophony of sounds rising up to them it was their growls that were the loudest beside them in the heart of the gulch were the birdmen they sat in circles their feathery arms wrapped around their bodies their colors varied wildly more so than any of the other beasts most were dark black like a raven but others were white blue red even a few pinks and purples among their plumage beyond them were the goblins miniature humans with grotesque heads they were the only ones gathered that wore clothing tattered loin cloths sewn from the yellow grass of the wedge their encampment seemed the most industrious with actual tents scattered about their skin varied in color though not as much as the feathers of the birdmen most were an ugly green with red the secondmost common color also unlike the rest they wielded crude weapons made of wood and stone nearest to the goblin camp were the hyenamen they were the most hyper yipping about and snarling at one another the hunch in their back looked uncomfortable almost obscene unlike the rest their fur was unanimously a dirty shade of spotted orange on the far end of the ravine their forms just barely visible to her eyes were the goatmen shed heard of them rarely their numbers were few they walked about barechested their faces long and horned their arms and hands were like that of a human but their legs were covered with fur their feet ending with hooves as large as a horses she saw them talking but the distance was too great for her to make out any sound between each race were large gaps with what appeared to be poles or spears jutted into the ground to form the borders fire ordered encampments alliances between racesall of it was counter to what shed believed possible the creatures in the wedge were mindless brutal devouring each other like the monsters they were they werent supposed to reason they werent supposed to be more intelligent than any other pack of wild animals from them she heard yips snarls random curses and amid it all were words shouted in the common tongue that she could understand them could listen to their words as they shouted and mocked one another most terrifying though was their number it was beyond counting almost beyond estimating but between them she knew there had to be twenty thousand if not more what is going on jessilynn whispered she almost felt paralyzed as she lay there if any spotted her or even smelled her with their animal noses theyd swarm in an instant sonowin wasnt far down the hill and surely they could reach her before any beasts curled around the sides of the ravine but still that was a race she didnt want to take part in directly below her she watched a wolfman come in from the south entrance of the ravine carrying what looked like the upper half of a cow it flung the corpse before one of the fires and with frightening speed dozens of the beasts tore into the thing grabbing at innards and ripping flesh free with their claws jessilynn watched a chill spreading through her veins a gathering of the subhuman dieredon whispered and over the sounds below he was barely audible of the like ive never seen never even dreamed i dont understand they hate each other dont they he nodded its that hatred that has allowed us to keep them in check but thisthis isnt normal id say it impossible if i didnt see it with my own eyes the entirety of the wedge has been making its way here for months abandoning all former territorial lines we must find out who leads them who is capable of creating such an army perhaps magic is involved maybe even priests or wizards how jessilynn asked how do we find out without them discovering us dieredon stared and the longer the silence lingered the greater her fear grew i dont know he said at last it was the most frightening thing he could have possibly told her it wasnt the stress the position put on her husband that upset aurelia she knew harruq could withstand it no matter how much he might complain otherwise it wasnt the responsibility for she knew his decisions would be the right ones regardless of his doubt no the thing that upset aurelia most about harruqs role as steward was the sheer loneliness it brought about in her mommy look aubrienna called pulling her from her thoughts she sat on the edge of a fountain in one of the castles many gardens aubrienna and gregory played on the far side theyd been chasing each other with wooden weapons gregory wielding a sword aubby a wand but the toys now lay in the grass it seemed a new game had piqued their interests careful of thorns aurelia told them seeing they had begun picking flowers aubrienna was the one taking charge of things as she often did aurelia watched as her daughter began putting the small daisies into gregorys hair the little girl frowning every time they didnt stick gregory mostly let her trusting her implicitly the sight put a smile on aurelias face and she wished harruq could watch as gregory finally grabbed a tulip and yanked it free so he could place it atop of aubriennas head both giggled as it fell off landing on the stone walkway ill get it aubrienna said reaching down and then handing it to gregory thanks gregory said beginning his second attempt to place the flower in her hair now you stay still stay aurelia leaned her chin on her palm her husbands long hours left her alone for being at harruqs side when he made his judgments risked undermining his authority it wasnt as if the people of mordeina mistrusted her she knew that if anything she was beloved more so than the actual queen current fashions in the city had already begun to mimic the dresses she wore becoming more elven in style harruqs popularity hadnt waned either but things had already grown uneasy he needed to convince everyone from lords to beggars that he was competent enough to rule as steward too many knew of susans involvement already if the general populace realized how much of a puppet ruler harruq actually was itd render everything theyd done pointless his public dealings with the people were therefore of the utmost importance so she stayed with her daughter letting aubriennas light and happiness brighten her own dull existence in the city of humans as they passed the hours together until her husband fled the throne for their embrace thats enough aurelia said glancing up to see over a dozen flowers now uprooted and laying about they both looked her way frowns on their faces and she realized how harshly shed reprimanded them she let out a sigh berating herself for taking out her frustrations on the children it simply wasnt fair aubby missed her father just as much as she did we werewe were just playing with the flowers aubrienna said as if explaining it would clear everything up aurelia stood and wandered their way smiling to show she wasnt upset it is all right she said but i dont want you playing with the flowers anymore the gardeners work very hard to make them grow so beautiful aubrienna looked around as if unsure if she were in trouble or not gregory had no such need im sorry he said eyes to the ground whether necessary or not hed decided apologizing was a good way to head off a paddling the castle servants were hesitant to lay a hand on the little kingling but aurelia had no such reservations in her mind the last thing mordan needed was a brat for an heir not that there was any real danger of that gregory was such a sweet child it was aubby who was the real troublemaker aurelia blamed harruq for that naturally its all right she said kneeling down before them so she might look them in the eye how about we go get something to eat hrm i bet merelda has something nice brewing in the kitchen just for you two the promise of sweets sparked their eyes alight and aurelia grinned perhaps a sweetcake might help her own mood she offered them her hands then froze it was as if she had suddenly gone blind but not in her eyes the sense of magic within her the connection with the weave of her goddess that granted her power vanished replacing it was a pulsing emptiness coupled with a vague feeling of unease without thinking she grabbed the arms of both children and yanked them to the ground while ducking her own head two darts plinked into the stone beyond her careened wildly before landing in the grass aurelias eyes widened as she stared at their sharpened points the tips dripping with some sort of cloudy liquid stay down aurelia whispered fear and fury overwhelming her initial surprise there were two entrances to the garden one on the east wall one to the south aurelia had the children ducking behind a white marble ledge its top decorated with dozens of potted flowers they were on the far side nearly equidistant from either entrance she flexed her fingers thinking to summon a portal to escape but the magic didnt come to her it was as if she were underwater trying to gasp for breath gregory began to cry and aubbys face was scrunching up and turning red frightened tears about to release from her as well aurelia lunged for the first thing she could use as a weapon gregorys wooden sword in her hands it was more of a dagger but the wood was solid and she peered over the ledge to scan for their wouldbe assassins there were three of them one at each door plus a third rushing through the garden two glinting daggers in hand all three were dressed in the strangest garb their clothes a mixture of reds and grays their faces were covered with a dark gray cloth revealing only their eyes and hair the one at the door to her right caught her looking and flung another dart aurelia ducked her heart pounding as panic threatened to overwhelm hernot for herself but for gregory and aubrienna if only she had her magic she had her training with harruq from their sparring years ago instilling moderate ability to defend herself with her staff but against skilled assassins wielding only a childs toy what chance did she have preparing herself for the end she swept her eyes over the two children and as she did she caught sight of a strange spherical object not far away from her lying in the grass its surface was made of obsidian and it was heavily cracked from those cracks pulsed a rainbow of colors almost like a heartbeat without thinking without daring to fear for her safety she lunged out into the open for it the nearest assassin was almost upon her and in response to her unexpected motion the man twisted kicked off the ledge shed hidden behind and continued after her aurelia spun in air lashing out with the wooden sword it clipped the mans thrust shoving it harmlessly aside when she landed she grabbed the sphere surprised to discover how light it was with all her strength she hurled it toward the nearest doorway then rolled daggers thudded into the grass coming out of her roll she let out a gasp with the objects removal she felt her magic returning into her like floodwaters rushing through a broken dam feeling more alert more whole she bared her teeth and stretched out her hands toward the leaping assassin lightning shot from her fingers crackling with energy the hit halted him in midair spinning his upper body backward when he landed she struck him again the electricity arcing about his body close your eyes aurelia screamed at the children gregory would see nothing what with his fists pressed against his face but aubrienna had been watching even as she cried praying her daughter would listen aurelia stood summoning an invisible energy shield to block any more darts the assassins might throw but the two men at the doors apparently had new tricks in mind a ball of fire burned through the air aimed straight for aurelias chest it struck her shield and detonated swirling outward in a thin line consuming the nearby plants and blackening the vases aurelia managed to duck beneath the flames just in time only to see the other assassin outstretch his hand twin glowing orbs arced out veering over her cover and slamming through her shield with ease she let out a cry as they struck her chest the pain was intense and she fell back to the ground writhing she bit her tongue in an attempt to focus the two orbs had caused no physical damage they were just trying to keep her down long enough to finish her the bite to her tongue didnt work but hearing the two children crying did the fools wanted a sorcerers duel then so be it shed faced an enraged tessanna stood toetotoe against the prophet these assassins they had picked the wrong target shoving herself to her feet she raised her hands and summoned the most powerful protection spells she knew fire and ice crashed against her shields burning more plants and spreading frost along the ground but nothing could penetrate aurelias fingers danced and she allowed herself a smile you want fire she asked then have it a great stream burst from her gathered palms belching out as if from the belly of a dragon it filled the doorway easily overwhelming the mans attempt at a magical shield when it subsided his body was but blackened ash turning to the other she saw him fleeing not so fast she said through clenched teeth summoning a swirling blue portal its location wasnt far stepping through she reemerged at the end of the hallway the final assassin had attempted to flee down he skidded to a halt his eyes widening behind his mask aurelia gave him no time to react unleashing all her fury she tore bricks free from each side of the castle walls and then slammed them together she heard the assassins bones snap saw his skull crunch inward his body dropped to the floor like a rag doll and it was only then aurelia felt she could breathe she ran back to the garden pausing only momentarily at the door two guards lay slumped outside the entrance thin darts protruding out from their necks aurelia passed them by holding in a shudder checking the other exit she found two more dead guards the waste of life infuriated her as much as it frightened her with the implications mommy aurelia turned felt her heart break upon seeing aubrienna rush out from cover and run toward her her cheeks and neck were red her face a mess of snot and tears aurelia scooped her into her arms then went to gregory she set her daughter down wrapped them both in her arms and tried to calm them hold your ears now she said pulling them closer to her chest turning her head toward one of the doors she gathered magic into her voice guards the sound must have echoed throughout half the castle for within a minute dozens came rushing in cursing at the sight of their dead brethren take them to harruq and make sure they dont leave his side she said to the man in charge i dont care how disruptive they are they dont leave is that clear understood the soldier said scooping gregory up into his arms another pulled off his mailed glove and offered a hand to aubrienna mommy dont go she begged she had started to calm down but was only the slightest push away from breaking again im sorry sweetie aurelia said kissing her forehead go to daddy mommy has people she needs to see she sniffled but managed to keep herself together aurelia felt guilt watching them go but she shoved the feeling away now was not the time as squads of soldiers spread out to scan the castle for any more intrusions or at least discover how the assassins gained entrance in the first place aurelia opened a portal to her and harruqs room from there she grabbed her staff one of her few cherished possessions she still had from their flight from veldaren leaping back through the portal into the garden she approached the rainbow sphere that had given her so much trouble the closer she stepped to it the more she felt her magic fading until when it was at her feet she was powerless once more with a satisfying crack she smashed it with the butt of her staff the sphere broke easily letting out a great puff of smoke and color as it did scooping up the surprisingly cool shards she closed her eyes to create another portal the masks the assassins wore were familiar and that they wielded magic made them doubly rare but there was one man she knew that matched both qualities a man that might either be behind the attack or know who was responsible through the portal she stepped still holding the shards when she exited she was on a distant street in the trade district of mordeina the men and women passing by turned to gawk and for once aurelia wished she might fit in a little better no time for a disguise though so she hurried to the tavern shed been told to go to if she ever sought to make contact it wasnt the tavern itself she needed though but the dark alley beside it a child sat there on a crate looking bored his hair was disheveled his face dirty but there was something of an act to his appearance the alertness of his eyes the healthiness of his skin belied the supposed starvation of a street rat hello aurelia said to the boy dont feel like talking was his response i fear im not as wise as i thought she said as instructed might you help me the boy stared at her then gave a curt nod wait here aurelia stepped into the alley holding her staff in one hand the shards in the other several minutes passed but at least she was out of clear sight of the traffic bored of your life in the castle asked a womans voice from above aurelia glanced up to see veliana peering down from the rooftop of the tavern a smirk lighting up her lone good eye she wore the colors of her new guild dark gray shirt and cloak with black sleeves and pants in her left hand she twirled a dagger her fingers dancing id prefer the boredom over today she said wheres your guildmaster right here deathmask said stepping out of the alleys shadows his arms crossed behind his back his long dark hair curled down around his neck a gray mask covered his mouth and nose but his eyes were sparkling with humor ah aurelia how good it is to see you again your beauty is as stunning as ever such a shame you waste it on that oaf of a halforc you call a husband im in no mood aurelia said tossing the shards at his feet someone tried to kill me and my daughter and antonils son as well i want to know why deathmask lifted an eyebrow interesting and you think i have the answer why all three assassins wore masks similar to yours hardly unique to cover ones face aurelia crossed her arms reminding herself not to take her frustration out on the wily rogue despite how much she wanted to roast him down to ash so hed match the name of his guild they were also proficient with magic she said only one guild in mordeina has members with any magical training that i know of yours and if it wasnt you then you of all men should know who it was no one has a better finger on the pulse of the underworld than you no one since the days of the watcher veliana said laying on her back and continuing to twirl her dagger by the way should i mention how stupid itd be of you to come here if you actually thought we were guilty of the attack but youre not that stupid which means you dont think we were responsible so please lay off the demands and keep the shallow reasoning to yourself hrm fire swarmed around aurelias right hand easy now deathmask said id rather not have anyone die no profit in it aurelia when you arrived you ohsopolitely tossed something at my feet care to tell me what it was it was a sphere before i smashed it aurelia said turning her attention back to deathmask her fist clenched removing the fire the assassins threw it at me just before they attacked somehow it created a hole in the worlds magical weave preventing me from casting any spells finally she saw a bit of interest spark in deathmasks eyes really now he asked kneeling down and picking up one of the shards interesting so please what can you tell me they wore gray and red and all were light of skin if that helps so they even dress similar to me now how interesting are you sure im not the man responsible for the attacks enough coin and even i might rethink my allegiances angels do tend to make life as a rogue difficult we went through too much together for you to turn on us without a chance to rectify things first aurelia said deathmask laughed sentimentality i think you confuse me for someone else elf no the proof you need to know i wasnt behind this is much simpler if it had been my guild making the attempt you wouldnt be out hunting for the party responsible youd be dead he tossed the sphere shard back to the ground what he threw at you is known as a voidsphere rare but not impossible to craft if you know what youre doing as for these assassinsno i cannot tell you who might have hired them nor the name of their organization if any other guild started showing an affinity toward spellcasters i assure you id know about it im sorry but if you need answers youll have to look elsewhere there was no hiding aurelias disappointment she clutched her staff and took a deep breath the city wasnt big enough for a new guild with such power at their disposal to go unnoticed for long someone had to know please she said if you learn anything find me or my husband i will deathmask said winking if the profits right aurelia turned ripped open a portal and vanished veliana watched the elf disappear into the swirling blue then leapt down from her perch atop the tavern you lied she said deathmask shrugged i do that from time to time veliana knelt before the shards of the voidsphere scanning over the intricate detail required to carve the magic into its surface what does it mean she asked games deathmask said leaning against the wall people are playing games and no matter what happens we will benefit nothing can be worse than the way things are now and if they kill gregory do i look like a man who will shed a tear he was grinning she could tell by the way his cheeks pulled upward at his mask you look like a heartless bastard she said standing youre making me blush but no vel until we know everyones aims we keep our mouths shut and our eyes open can you do that i can she said but you still could have told them who was responsible that alone would have been worth a princely reward and ruin all this fun he asked scattering the shards with his foot as he walked toward the street i dare say veliana its like you dont even know me anymore entering mordeina was a far different experience than qurrah expected where are the angels he asked as they stepped through the second of the enormous gates when hed left years ago they had flown about the city like hummingbirds around a flower now though it seemed even the floating city of avlimar was absent of life they hope to guard an entire nation tessanna said pulling on his arm as they jostled through the overcrowded road leading directly up the hill to the castle surely you didnt think theyd all be here i still expected more of a presence qurrah said he caught sight of words scrawled upon the nearby buildings written with a dark red paint of some kind each one effectively said the same thing all hail the missing king azariah was right tessanna said and she pointed to where a man had gathered a crowd about him as he shouted from atop a makeshift pedestal of boxes things are not well here the two made their way closer until they could hear his words the speaker was a man qurrah did not recognize dark of hair clean cut with a soft face his eyes however bespoke madness now they brandish swords against our fellow men the speaker cried now they threaten the blood of the innocent along with the guilty will we still let them lord over us how many years until we are all afraid for our lives how long until the very words i speak now are considered blasphemy that requires their justice he nearly spat out the word their grace their protection where is our voice where is our king ive heard enough tessanna said tugging on his arm qurrah stared at the man letting his face burn into his memory he held such anger it was beyond rationality by that point it was beyond convincing this was a man frighteningly similar to velixar and that he had assembled such a massive crowd surprised him none such was the draw and danger of a man willing to tell others what they wanted to hear feeding them halftruths and exaggerations so they might be angry instead of afraid at the castle doors the two stopped unsure of how to gain entrance they still wore the magical disguises theyd cast upon themselves shifting their features adding color to tessannas eyes and melding qurrahs ears into something human fortunately they had time to think without being noticed for another crowd had gathered at the gate harassing the guards the steward is seeing no more petitioners today the guards shouted but the annoyed looks on their faces showed they knew itd do little to make them disperse whats that orcish bastard going to do about the angels the man beside qurrah yelled nothing said another shouting loud enough to ensure all others heard him hes too busy sucking an angels dick how else you think he got on that throne qurrahs fists clenched as the crowd laughed hed never considered himself all that protective of his brother and was surprised to find just how furious these disrespectful comments made him pushing to the front he stepped before one of the guards who tensed he didnt lift his weapon just yet but it was clear he was ready to if needed i must speak with harruq he told the guard you deaf hes not taking petitioners now get back before i make you im not deaf qurrah said banishing his disguise with a thought im his brother tell him qurrah and tess have come to visit i guarantee you hell grant us access the guard froze and he glanced to the man beside him for any indication of what he should do the other guard just shook his head go tell him he said i dont want my head on a spit just because i turned away the stewards brother what about them he gestured to the mob and qurrah understood his fear so far they seemed content to mock yell and insult but at any moment their thirst for blood might rise such was the nature of a mob qurrah beckoned tessanna closer the moment she took her first step her disguise vanished lengthening her hair returning the blackness of her eyes and the paleness of her skin several beside her let out gasps upon seeing the change for her part tessanna looked simply bored yes she asked qurrah the guards are afraid things might turn violent theyre right to be qurrah chuckled never mind then i will handle them myself he stepped into the space between the guards and the mob he felt their eyes upon him a couple had overheard his discussion with the guards and like lightning his name spread he let them look let them see the true face of the fairytale monster theyd made him into did you not hear he asked them the steward is not seeing any more petitioners qurrah dropped to one knee slamming his palm to the ground a thin wall of shadows burst from the dirt climbing over ten feet into the air it formed a semicircle sealing the door and the guards within its translucent protection from the other side people yelled and a few hurled stones that bounced off with a highpitched twang that will last an hour qurrah said turning back to the guards long enough for one of you to find my brother the first guard nodded looking frightened but doing a fine job of trying to hide it turning he banged on the giant doors twice when they opened he slipped inside just before they reclosed where are the rest of the guards tessanna asked eyeing the castle curiously it seems odd you would be alone is the threat not out here among the angry people the remaining guard opened and closed his mouth confirming qurrahs suspicions that something more was amiss i cannot say the reason the guard said at last forgive me but until milord gives me permission i can say nothing qurrah and tess shared a look very well he said well leave you be a few minutes later the great doors reopened a guard stepped out and beckoned to them follow me he said they did and it was only when the doors shut behind them were they finally free of the angry shouts of the people down the carpeted hall they walked until the guard veered to the right leading them into a small but wellfurnished room it had several chairs a table already set with food and a hearth that was currently empty given the warmth of the day tessanna grabbed an apple took a bite wait here was all the guard said before exiting the door slammed shut and from the outside they heard the lock slide into place trusting fellow qurrah said while he was watching you changed your appearance and then summoned a wall of darkness tessanna said rolling the apple from hand to hand that he left us alone at all seems pretty trusting to me qurrah chuckled since when did you become so understanding he asked how else would i have stayed with you so long she laughed at him her eyes sparkling with humor and qurrah laughed with her she seemed so happy so content sonormal it wouldnt last long he knew it never did but hed appreciate it while it was there are you nervous she asked after taking another bite a bit how long ago did he visit our cottage surely a year now if not longer aubrienna will be twice the size she was when we last saw her his nieces name was like a trigger and immediately tessanna ceased eating her apple she lowered her head shoulders curling inward nervous shy regressing qurrah put a hand on her shoulder kissed the top of her head youve been forgiven he said to her dont forget that youre her aunt thats all she knows you as her crazy crazy aunt tess said peering up at him through her long bangs but despite her obvious discomfort she smiled qurrah kissed her again then held her against him as he tried to ignore his own nervousness it had been a long while since hed seen his brother perhaps hed be unwanted after all he was a living memory of all the agony his brother had suffered a specter from a far darker past harruqs life had become so grand now exotic wife beautiful daughter friend of kings and steward of a kingdom would he in his poor existence and plain robe be just an unwanted reminder of childhood days stealing food and scrambling to find shelter when the weather turned sour a heavy fist knocked on the door twice before it barged open qurrah lurched to his feet feeling like hed somehow been caught standing there was his brother wearing that same old leather armor velixar had given them ages ago their eyes met and all of qurrahs fear and nervousness went flying out the castle and into the heavens qurrah harruq exclaimed wrapping him in a bear hug why didnt you tell me you were coming because then you wouldnt have the chance to tell us not to qurrah said and he smiled at his brother i hear youve become a man of importance what fool did you con to get that stupid crown on your head the only fool here is the one wearing the crown harruq said his grin spreading he let go of qurrah returned to the door guards stood before it their weapons at the ready its all right harruq said bring them in one of the guards shifted and in rushed two children the boy was unfamiliar but qurrah easily recognized the little brownhaired girl with her fathers height and her mothers sparkling eyes qurrah knelt opened his arms and she quickly rushed his way hi uncle she said curling into him and qurrah was stunned by the familiarity she seemed to display itd been a year after all and harruq had only brought her down to see them a handful of times she acted like she felt safe in his arms though and that made it easy to ignore his own surprise and clumsiness he closed his eyes remembering a similar life he had robbed from all of dezrel some day he prayed he might not have that pain and guilt haunt him someday he just wanted to hold aubrienna and be happy shes quiet today qurrah said as aubrienna continued to snuggle deeper into his robes meanwhile the boy went and sat in one of the chairs seemingly content to be alone and play with the toy soldier he carried they both looked sullen maybe even upset depending on how he interpreted their silence and averted stares harruqs smile wavered and he turned to the guards give us some space he said before shutting the door when he turned around qurrah was floored by the rage in his brothers eyes had he ever seen him angrier just once he thought just once whats wrong qurrah asked assassins harruq said aurelias out looking into it while i was sitting on that damn throne three men attacked aurelia and the kids as they were playing in one of the castles gardens who would dare tessanna said turning both their attentions to her shed remained quiet lurking in the background when the children came inside who would try to kill aubrienna tell me harruq bring me to him if he lives and i will make him suffer harruq swallowed theyre dead he said aurelia killed them during the attempt qurrah saw the rage and fear in his lovers eyes nearly rivaling that in his brothers she looked at aubrienna went to speak then stopped qurrah knew she sought aubriennas embrace but she feared what her very presence might do to the child that she also loved her beyond words that she saw her as the child she could never have seemed a cruel fate for her unstable mind to struggle with do you want to go to your aunt he asked aubrienna all right she said sliding down from qurrahs lap tessanna dropped to her knees and when aubrienna came to her tess wrapped her tightly in her arms eyes closed she pressed her cheek against the top of aubriennas head no one will hurt you tessanna whispered as she rocked back and forth no one i promise i promise qurrah turned to harruq and he felt his own anger rising someone had struck at his family do you know why they attacked he asked harruq shrugged popular as i am ive got plenty of enemies and antonil has more they may not have wanted aurelia or aubby gregory might have been the real target gregory harruq gestured to the quiet child gregory copernus as in gregory heir to the throne of mordan from outside the door they heard another set of knocks harruq opened the door and in walked a tired disheveled aurelia deathmask knows nothing aurelia said wrapping her arms around harruq and leaning her head against his chest her eyes flicked in the direction of qurrah and tessanna but if she was surprised by her guests she didnt show it then were already out of ideas harruq said shame you couldnt leave one of them alive sorry honey but youre not the only one with a temper when someone threatens our child qurrah coughed to steal their attention perhaps youve forgotten he said but the dead talk to me just as fine as the living thankfully theyd left the bodies intact at least the two aurelia hadnt burned to cinders the guard in charge said theyd hoped their clothing or faces could be identified qurrah doubted either would be useful but he didnt need such material clues no he had access to something far more useful clear out everything around him qurrah ordered leaves flowers even bugs harruq began sweeping the area as commanded qurrah watched him feeling a tug of nostalgia how many times had they worked his magic together dabbling in arts that were so often beyond him not that he missed the experiments themselves thinking back to those times sifting through body parts with his necrotically tuned minditd been like a child cutting animals with a sword thinking himself training to be a knight the shame of it was enough to make him shiver and push the memories far away find me small smooth stones for the runes he told aurelia you should know the type i need indeed she did even if she didnt know the exact runes themselves when the spell enacted qurrahs magic would flood into the carved runes if shaped into something malleable as dirt theyd be too weak and the magic would break them scattering the dirt and banishing the magic but stone stone would hold when he yanked this assassins soul back to the world of dezrel qurrah wanted him completely thoroughly enslaved tessanna lingered behind him her hands on his shoulders as she quietly watched when he had the first of the stones qurrah took out a dagger and breathed against it the tip shimmered purple and then he began to carve the blade easily sliced through the stone creating the straight and curved lines he needed one after another he carved them never hurrying when finished with each stone tessanna would stand situate it in its proper place around the body and then return to where she had been sitting harruq and aurelia watched holding hands in the garden it was just the four of them together and for some strange reason it made qurrah feel very much at home when the ninth stone was finished he stood and stretched his back make sure not to interrupt me he said especially you harruq i was there when you brought back the ghost of our father harruq said so dont act like ive forgotten how to behave during a ritual qurrah chuckled that at least was still a memory he cherished their father had been a coward and a racist loathing the orcish race despite his coupling with their orcish mother more and more qurrah understood it for the confused angry and violent act it was and more and more he both pitied and loathed his father of course theyd killed him prior to summoning his ghost and hadnt known his true relationship to them the halforc shook his head no even his better memories were tinged with death and guilt such was the past he thought to himself at least he could move on into the future with his head held high aurelia have you ever witnessed something like this he asked the elf shook her head no she said im not sure i want to either but i will this man tried to kill aubrienna i want to know why we all do qurrah said and between me and tess i promise you he will not have a chance to deny us everyone quiet now let the ritual begin qurrah knelt outside the circle of stones putting his hands on one of them the ancient word carved upon it was the same as the first word of the ritual hed chant them all repeatedly filling them with magic like one would fill a pitcher with water but this one was the first and most crucial the words left his tongue tinged with melancholy and the magic began to pour out from him tessanna was at his side immediately her hand atop his they echoed one another demanding the veil of life be split using the body as a guide to find the soul it had once belonged to the stones began to glow first purple then a vibrant orange as if within the stone were a great swell of fire eager for release faster and faster they spoke the words until with a great tormented shriek the ethereal visage of the man rose from the dead shell of his body welcome back qurrah said rising to his feet i assure you your stay here will not be pleasant the man continued to wail he still wore the clothes hed had on when he died which qurrah knew was common returning to the world of the living even as a spirit meant a frantic attempt to become as they were before almost like a coping mechanism the wailing was also normal qurrah himself had experienced the transition once when velixar had ripped him out of eternity and back into his rotting corpse the sensation was beyond explanation a combination of confusion pain and abandonment qurrahs memories of everything beyond had fled him and he suspected they would always be denied to him until he once more left the mortal coil but just because it was normal didnt mean he had to endure it silence he ordered the runes flared and the spirit obeyed qurrah stepped closer watching the spirits eyes when at last he saw a bit of sanity returning he knew the transition was complete answer all questions asked of you he ordered and speak no lies as you wish the assassin said his voice was thin and whispery as if he were in a distant room what is your name we are not given names we call each other by our colors qurrah glanced to the others frowned then what is your color my designation was crimson i can already tell this is going to go well harruq muttered qurrah winced prayed his brother was wrong why did you attempt to kill aurelia and the children he asked crimson looked to aurelia and it seemed he recognized her because that was our task crimson said as if it were obvious it is my highest disgrace knowing we failed you should be dead elf we do not fail silence qurrah said answer only the questions asked spirit you are not beyond feeling pain let me assure you that crimson glared but obeyed qurrah looked at the others to see if any had ideas where the line of questioning should go what is the name of your organization harruq asked we have none that we are told your headquarters aurelia said where is it located i do not know i shared a room with three brothers we left through a single door sometimes it took us to a new place to train sometimes it took us to a place to scout most times it took us to who we were to kill the more qurrah heard the more he felt his stomach tighten what he was witnessing it was unreal what were the names of those who taught you magic he asked i do not know we were only given numbers who were your trainers in swordplay i do not know we were only given letters harruq paced beyond the circle of runes are you sure they cant lie he asked this is getting stupid what life did this guy lead aurelia reached out and grabbed his hand to stop his pacing raised in a single room taught by men he didnt know she said i think haern might have known something of that life one last question spirit qurrah said sensing everyones patience nearing their limit where is this door now where is it waiting for you for the first time the spirit gave pause qurrah watched then touched one of the rune stones with his finger power surged through it pulsing into crimson the ethereal being let out a wail its features fading for a brief moment answer me qurrah said his voice calm i do not know how to answer crimson said try if we had succeeded i would have known i did not therefore i do not know that is the only way i can explain it qurrah stood glanced to the others when none offered anything qurrah turned and dismissed crimson go back to the abyss he told him maybe down there youll learn some answers he scattered one of the rune stones with his foot crimson shimmered and vanished so that only his cold pale body remained in the center harruq pulled free of his wifes hand walked to the center and gave a solid kick to the dead mans ribcage stubborn bastard he grumbled that cant all be truecan it most assassins are trained to withstand various forms of torture aurelia offered is it possible that he could resist you qurrah no tessanna said thats not it i sensed it as well he spoke the truth and even spoke it freely youre right about one thing though qurrah said turning to face aurelia that was a form of preparation against interrogation these assassins theyve been created with a very real awareness of what someone like me can do whoever hired them did so knowing that no matter if they were taken dead alive or forced to speak after death thered be nothing to learn thats it harruq said thats all we get even with your magic unbelievable its a shame tarlak isnt here maybe hed have some ideas i can only help with what i know qurrah said but were not completely in the dark such assassins take a lifetime to craft and significant magic and coin whoever you have made as enemies they are powerful and wealthy i cant say im envious harruq harruq crossed his arms and frowned i think id rather be in the dark he muttered there is one man that might fit that definition aurelia said lord maryll qurrah tried to match the name up to a face or position but failed who he asked lord kevin maryll harruq said letting out a sigh the queens older brother qurrahs mind rapidly connected to earlier in the day and he knew the answer to the question before he even asked it the clothes had been too fine and he had seemed much too certain that no guards would halt him despite his clogging of the main traffic to the castle is he fair skinned dark hair short beard you saw him in the streets didnt you harruq asked i did he had a crowd gathered a boisterous one at that it seems he and the angels dont get along and neither does he look favorably upon his brotherinlaw i think it might be time you sit down and have a talk with kevin harruq groaned yeah he said gods damn it i think youre right this isnt necessary the queen paced back and forth before harruq who slumped in antonils throne it is he insisted you have to know that youre going on assumptions based on learning nothing from a dead man susan said forgive me for not being impressed not trying to impress you only discover who tried to kill your son these werent normal assassins they werent even unusual assassins these were expensive dangerous rare men that until today none of us knew existed so before three more of them try to slice out my wifes throat and cook her with a fireball id like to do whatever i can to find out who hired them that sound fair to you harruq knew he was crossing the line but he didnt care his family was in danger because of this stupid role hed accepted so if he was going to withstand the risks by the gods he was going to at least take advantage of the power those soldiers who remained had been sent out into the city with orders to apprehend and bring in lord maryll for questioning harruq waited for him in the throne room swords lying across his lap hed been sheathing and unsheathing them for the past ten minutes desperately wishing he could plunge one of them into heart of whoever tried to kill his precious aubby and his gut said that person was about to stand before him in the next few minutes let me talk to him susan said he listens to me trusts me if you start asking him questions hell think youre accusing him and i am accusing him harruq said without proof without reason you know damn well we have reason he hates your husband with a passion not much of a stretch to carry that over to his son hes my brother susan said hes family and nothing has ever been as important to kevin as family me too harruq grumbled and thats why hes coming in for a talk the queen threw up her hands stopped her pacing i could override you she said harruq nodded you could and if you do this whole charade is over ill step down as steward grab aurelia and aubrienna and hightail it to the far ends of dezrel and you know what your highness im really really hoping you override me right now susan fell silent and she respectfully dipped her head im sorry she said i will not undermine my husband in such a way nor make him seem a fool question my brother but do not harm him unless you have proof will you at least grant me that request fair enough she stared at him and he wished he had enough skill at reading people to understand the thoughts racing behind that stare at last she curtseyed and hurried out of the room leaving harruq alone but for a few of his most trusted guards who lurked behind various pillars and curtains kevin was one man and so long as harruq held his swords he wasnt afraid the others had wanted to be there with him but harruq had rightly guessed susans response to that already they treaded on thin ice itd do no good to toss in more weight minutes passed at an interminable pace when the doors finally cracked open and kevin maryll stepped inside harruq almost felt happy almost the desire to draw one of his swords was still the stronger impulse harruq kevin shouted hurrying down the carpeted hall wheres susan wheres gregory are they all right theyre fine harruq said shifting in his seat the handle of condemnation was cold in his palm it took every shred of his selfcontrol to keep the blade sheathed they are his relief appeared genuine harruq kept telling himself it was an act to keep his rage high the guards would only tell me there was an attempt on her life they wouldnt say anything else did you capture the men responsible i dont know harruq said he shifted again kevin was so close now just a few steps and a thrust and hed be dead not that he was imagining doing that repeatedly of course i was thinking bringing you here was a first step to that kevin froze in his tracks excuse me he asked those assassins were hired by someone wealthy someone with many connections someone who might want king antonils son dead and perhaps its just me but havent you been out firing up crowds and spreading hatred against antonil or should i say the missing king aurelia would have told him it was tactless but harruq was too amused by the shock in kevins eyes at such a blunt accusation to care you bastard kevin said his voice rising this is my sister youre talking about my nephew you think id want them dead because of my frustrations with antonil and his angels the thought occurred to me harruq said he stood wanting to intimidate kevin with his height and size kevin however seemed far from intimidated he looked furious when antonil reclaimed mordeina his rule was tenuous at best many lords wanted to break up the nation with the angels as the sole unifier among the various territories instead of a king im the one who prevented that regardless of all he accomplished antonil was just a lowly soldier without a hint of noble blood in him susan gave him that she gave him legitimacy she gave him a son she became the queen he needed so others would view him as king and all the while i whispered in the ears of other lords telling them we needed a king we needed a ruler harruq shifted uncomfortably feeling a bit of his righteous fury dwindling down becoming more petulant and uncertain still he had to continue he had to know for certain you act as if you gained nothing he said your sisters rise in power only increased your own and because of that youre now safe to rally men around you spouting out hate and ignorance kevins eyes widened do you know why i rally those people in the streets he asked harruq i do it to protect susan and her son my blood will become the blood of kings my sister a queen my nephew the first of mordans new generation of rulers but every single bit of that is in danger so long as priests and angels lord over us bringing us their rules handing out their law with impunity kevin spat at harruqs feet you think you know me you think you understand why i do these things youre a damn fool halforc look to the heavens and for once open your eyes in my heart i do not believe my nephew will ever be king how long until a man with wings sits on that throne and what will we do then what will we lowly simple humans do harruq was caught off guard by his sincerity his ferocity was it possible he was uninvolved looking back at it it did seem a slight stretch if kevin had problems with antonil and the angels wouldnt it make more sense that he strike at them instead despite all his annoyances hed never shown any hostility toward his sister thinking of the angels reminded him of similar matters hed been delaying bringing up but with susan absent there was really no better time you have to stop these rallies harruq said the citys already in unrest because of the armys departure and youre just making it worse oftentimes things must get worse before getting better kevin argued riots will begin any day now harruq said people will die this needs to stop then stop it kevin gestured wildly i only give voice and reason to their unrest i only allow them to see the reason for their anger do you think mordeina is the only place turning against this oppression the countryside is worse so much worse and yet im not there to stir it up for five years now the angels have dealt death and spared lives all without a single care for the desires of mortal men then what do you want me to do about it harruq asked how in the fires of the abyss am i supposed to stop it kevin calmed down a bit becoming more earnest more businesslike at the start of the month i sent riders to all four corners of mordan he said every single settlement has already received my request im calling in elders spokesmen anyone who can come and speak for the people of their respective towns it shouldnt be long before the first of them arrives why what do you think this will accomplish we live under the rule of angels who supposedly follow a god kevin said a god that none of us can hear a god whose own priests say now slumbers after the war yet we are powerless before their rule some men live and others die and there is no consistency no justice murderers and rapists should be strung up to hang yet many find themselves forgiven only to repeat their crimes months later we need a voice we need a say in these things im summoning them all to hold a council i want the angels to hear the concerns of those they rule over i want them to admit they arent gods to open their eyes and realize that we do not serve them they serve us there was some wisdom to the idea harruq had to admit that and over the past several days hed been hearing of the growing unrest especially over a supposed attack in a village that no one could identify for certain despite his best efforts if this council might prevent riots itd be worthwhile and the representatives were already on their way what do you want me to do he asked make the angels attend make them promise to listen and convene a vote on the requests our people give and if not kevin gestured to the throne you are steward of the kingdom ruler over the men therein if the angels will not answer to you then what is the purpose of having a king ill talk to ahaesarus harruq said i cant promise their cooperation but if this will help then im willing to try but in return you need to calm the people instead of inflaming them youre getting what you want so give me what i want or ill send troops to arrest you in the street no matter what susan thinks your eloquence knows no bounds kevin said bowing tell the angels to convene the council a week from tomorrow that should be enough time for everyone to arrive now if i might have my leave id like to check on my family the lord turned and marched to the side of the throne into the darker recesses of the pillars oh kevin harruq said unable to help himself there is one way to prove to me your innocence stand before an angel swear to him you had nothing to do with the assassination attempt and let him judge whether you speak truth or lie kevin looked over his shoulder as he stopped before the door leading deeper into the castle instead of the anger he expected the man only laughed youre such a fool he said a damn stupid fool in so far over your head you havent a hope to avoid drowning the angels arent your savior harruq theyre your executioner the sooner you realize that the better the door slammed shut behind him and harruq had only impotent rage to offer in return qurrah was not much for putting off uncomfortable things so when theyd been assigned their room in the castle and tessanna slumbered restlessly from their journey he left her there and sought out harruqs room to his mild surprise two guards stood before the door and they tensed at his arrival i only wish to ask my brother a question he told them one of the guards rapped on the door after hearing it unlock from within the door popped open and harruqs face peered out seeing qurrah he grunted and opened it the rest of the way revealing him standing there with only a loose bed robe wrapped around his muscular body something wrong he asked no qurrah said he glanced at the guards then decided there was nothing too unusual about his request hed still be honoring azariahs desire for privacy how does one get to avlimar he asked harruq raised an eyebrow with wings care to explain id rather not harruq shrugged wait here he shut the door returning less than a minute later in his hands was a golden scepter its length was about half his arm and at the very top was a silver stone barely larger than a mans pinkie get into open space hold it aloft and then speak the name ashhur harruq explained as he handed it over someone will come find you i promise after that its up to you to convince them to give you a lift ill return this before the nights over qurrah promised holding the scepter against his chest it was surprisingly warm and he detected an aura of magic about it harruq yawned waved him away return it in the morning he said shutting the door qurrah chuckled caught the guards looking at him he shot one a wink then hurried away after two tries he managed to find his way out of the castle stepping out into the courtyard surrounding the structure atop the great hill itd been built upon the night sky was heavily clouded only avlimar was visible just a distant gold star in that darkness qurrah held the scepter above his head noting it much heavier than it should have been steadying it with both hands he whispered the command word ashhur he squinted his eyes expecting some sort of bright flash or signal instead the silver stone began to glow softly its golden light soothing to look upon it pulsed once twice and then into the sky shone a great pillar piercing the clouds so that its light pushed on through the slowly forming gap qurrahs mouth dropped open impressed its color was like that of lathaars sword or jericos shield a strong bluewhite vibrant with energy in the center of the beam soft smoke curled and rose vanishing the moment it left the beam the light spread nowhere beyond the beam not even brightening his hands as they held the scepter given its distinct brightness and color he had no doubt it could be seen for miles and miles even during the day in less than a minute he heard the sound of flapping wings an angel landed before him one of their warriors his body clad in armor and a spear strapped to his back i am loen and i bring to you the blessings of ashhur the angel said i saw the signal in the sky and have come what matter requires my aid my name is qurrah tun he said bowing his head in respect i seek permission to travel to avlimar and speak with azariah a look of curiosity passed over loens face and quickly vanished i remember you loen said you were of much interest after the trial to decide your fate you look healthier now more alive qurrah felt mildly embarrassed thinking of the trial when hed been ready to accept death at the angels hands only harruq had stopped them by demanding whatever fate be given to qurrah also be given to him the idea of killing his brother while trying to atone for his own sinsqurrah couldnt do it his brothers selflessness had been the only reason hed lived and thats what shamed him at the time tessanna had been alone with that monster velixar and thuloss legion of demons qurrah had been willing to give up even her had twice tried to make his brother end his life so he might not feel guilt or anguish such weakness such childishness im a better man now than i was he told loen perhaps that is all you see perhaps azariah is in his study if you do not mind waiting outside it i will see if he accepts your company thank you qurrah said bowing his head again how will i arrive the angel took the scepter from qurrah and then tucked it into the same loops that held his spear do not fear falling he said but if you are afraid i suggest closing your eyes and not looking down qurrah smirked as the angel flapped his wings several times lifting them into the air hed stepped into the chaos that was tessannas mind and seen the nightmares of her past heights werent going to frighten him wrapped in the angels arms he felt plenty secure the wind whipped against his face and he had to squint his eyes to see the city of mordeina shrank below him and high above the shining star that was avlimar grew closer and closer the strangest sight was the floating rock beneath it all as if the pull of the world meant nothing on the parcel of land broken and hurled free from the golden eternity it looked brown and compacted like any other earth but it supported the great weight of the structure built atop it every precious metal was crafted into spires towers slender homes and broad bridges some buildings were gold others silver to his surprise there were many gardens their vibrant colors easy to see despite the night avlimar was always lit no darkness allowed within copious amounts of torches lined the buildings and it seemed the very gold of the streets hummed with ethereal brightness in that light the green of trees somehow complemented the extravagant colors adding life and color to the otherwise overwhelming metal beauty there were many flat segments of street at the edge of the floating city and they landed on one of them qurrah staggered momentarily when released from loens grip then quickly steadied himself there was something unusual about standing there almost like being upon a boat despite no discernible rocking or motion have you been to avlimar before loen asked him qurrah remembered arriving as an undead monstrosity pulled along by velixars commands as war demons surged through the windows and towers battling angels by the thousands only once qurrah said follow me then loen said he walked down the street which slowly narrowed the farther from the edge they traveled qurrah marveled at the architecture it seemed everything was ornamented to an absurd extent walls were decorated with intricate carvings paintings even sculptures cut into their sides pausing at one he looked at a bewildering collection of overlapped concentric circles making it seem like the doorway of the home were the center of a great vortex of lines and motion it had to have taken hundreds of hours to carve qurrah thought of course in a land of no ruin and death time for even the most trivial things could be afforded this way loen said breaking his line of thought azariah rarely stays in avlimar for long and i would be remiss if tardiness kept you from meeting him of course qurrah said as his fingers traced along the lines perhaps another time i can explore it was to the very tallest of towers that loen took him located not far from the center of the city along the way qurrah was surprised by how few angels he spotted the creatures did not sleep like regular mortals so he saw no reason for the silence yet it was there all the same why is the city so empty he asked as they approached the great spire which rose like a sharppeaked mountain except instead of snowy peaks it was decorated with marble and pearl the harvest is great the workers few loen said we are scattered throughout the land and with our aid many new towns have sprouted in the far north but soon avlimar will be filled with angels to vote in the coming council council qurrah asked did your brother tell you nothing of it no he did not a meeting with human elders loen said pulling open the golden doors to azariahs spire to hear their concerns and allow them to open their hearts to us so we might learn how to better serve them interesting thought qurrah was that a result of his meeting with kevin seemed a bit opposite of the intended result that being kevin hanging from a gibbet wait here loen said the angel stepped through the door which was oversized to accommodate his wings all of the doors and walkways were large like that making qurrah who had grown up thin and sickly feel all the smaller staring up at the spire qurrah admired the craftsmanship it took to build it for some reason it had a newness to it the rest of the city did not perhaps it was the height or maybe because it was the lone building hed seen so far that possessed a pointed rooftop instead of a flat one qurrah azariah stepped out of the door followed by loen id have words with you the halforc said falling to one knee of course azariah said all are welcome here if we might have time alone my dear loen my guest and i will require privacy for him to speak his troubled heart but do not go far he will need you to return home qurrah held back a chuckle so his troubled heart would be the excuse to hide his lessons at magic oh well whatever worked when loen was gone azariah gestured for qurrah to step inside as the door shut qurrahs eyes needed a moment to adjust azariahs spire was bright even by avlimars standards light shone not from torches but instead various gems crystals chandeliers even candles carved of marble with no visible wick it all spoke of magic amused qurrah wondered if azariah had lost his clerical abilities because he wasted them on something a simple torch and wax candle could accomplish you should have requested my presence azariah said gesturing for qurrah to take a seat the chair was large the cushions overstuffed with feathers there was an ornate fireplace before it and in the hearth burned a fire that gave off heat yet appeared to have no effect on the log within the carpet was thick a deep crimson that was easy on the eyes a welcome respite after all the shining metals kicking off his sandals qurrah slumped in the chair which was of course far too big for him and let his bare feet sink into the carpet if id known teaching you magic would have such comforts id have agreed far more readily he said closing his eyes as the heat from the fire washed over him such tutelage will no longer be necessary azariah said qurrahs eyes snapped open and he peered around the chair the angel remained standing beside the stairs leading higher up into the spire all around him were paintings of forests of which qurrah had no doubt azariah had both been to and painted himself is that so he said trying to hide his surprise you seemed rather insistent when we last met im sure i did qurrah frowned and he pushed himself out of the chair i came to mordeina at your request he said and maybe it is just me but its a bit rude to request someones help then turn them down when they arrive to offer it now i wouldnt claim myself as brilliant in the ways of ashhur as you so perhaps you can answer the question for meis rudeness a sin your wit and sarcasm are both unnecessary and unappreciated azariah said crossing his arms then care to tell me why you changed your mind the angel looked to the side and he seemed confused almost frustrated my decision should not reflect poorly on you or tessanna he said at last my coming to youthat was not wise if my power from ashhur is waning then i should accept that as reality and not try to hide it unfortunately i came to you in pride seeking to remain the most powerful of angels im sorry to waste your time qurrah it didnt make sense no matter how many times qurrah ran the words through his mind you said you came to me in humility the halforc insisted now you say it is pride i wanted secret training to avoid the mockery of mortal men azariah said that is pride i wanted power to replace the power i lost that is pride i cannot do this for such a reason i cannot let my pride control my actions i thank you for coming qurrah but perhaps humility is what i need to learn now so youre accepting the loss of your clerical magic azariah sighed accepting it yes i will not lie and say i am pleased i will not pretend i do not miss it nor act like i do not wish it returned but i wont have you as a teacher qurrah nor your lover this is a decision i made on my flight home one i cannot fully explain i hope you understand qurrah didnt but then again he was trying to understand an angel it seemed that while on the outside they seemed simple and predictable the truth of them was anything but very well he said we will remain here for a time longer at least until im certain of my brothers safety if you change your mind let me know i assure you qurrah azariah said i wont something about his tone of voice was strikingly cold azariah opened the door and when qurrah stepped out he called for loen the angel landed moments later having spent the time hovering above the spire in a lazy circle return my friend to the castle azariah said i have much studying to do in preparation for the convening council and cannot afford the time i would be happy to loen said turning to qurrah are you ready qurrah nodded the night is late yes please take me home once more they walked through the city to the very edge before loen wrapped his arms around him and beat his wings i must warn you loen said the trip down is far more intense than the trip up at first qurrah thought it an exaggeration but as they plummeted off the edge in free fall he changed his mind perhaps there were a few things left that might frighten him several times he glanced at the angels outstretched wings having to remind himself that yes they could indeed support their weight as the city neared loen banked upward stealing much of their speed so that during a second descent they came in much slower toward the castle with surprising gentleness loen pulled up at the last moment setting qurrahs feet on the ground without the slightest difficulty many thanks for being my guide qurrah said turning to face the angel perhaps when you are not so tired and the hour not so late i can better show you the artwork and structures i would very much like the chance loen saluted before taking flight he placed a hand on qurrahs shoulder i once doubted your worth even after the trial he said but i heard of your stand on ashhurs bridge and when you killed karaks prophet a great evil left this land it was like a thorn pulled from all our minds you have done great things and i would thank you before i leave the admiration left him stunned hed gotten used to his accomplishments being overlooked or remaining completely unknown what little good ive done i did not do alone qurrah said feeling his neck flush but i accept your thanks nonetheless loen took to the air slowly fading away into the clouds as he soared toward avlimar his heart troubled qurrah stared at the glowing city like a great star in the night and wondered kinamn looked a desolate wreck but tarlak knew looks could be deceiving after all why else would he prance around in his yellow robes are you sure you want to attack the wizard asked beside him antonil nodded this city represents my greatest failure the king said we cant ignore it and we cant leave so many orcs gathered at our flank we take it back or we return now to mordeina those are our choices tarlak shrugged im all for going home but roasting orcs is fun too give the word my king and ill begin the bonfire behind them thirty thousand men prepared for battle they were far out of range of any catapult just in case the orcs there still had them functioning dozens of smoke trails lifted lazily into the sky proving the city occupied its been several years dont forget tarlak said there may have only been five thousand last time but it wouldnt surprise me if thousands more flocked out of the unguarded wedge and into the place i assure you tarlak treating the situation lightly is the one thing i will absolutely not do this time antonil said we go in with eyes open and more importantly your magic at the ready the orcs might have ballista and catapults but we have an eschaton who is worth a hundred catapults and costs more too i might add antonil laughed no need to mention it the king said you only remind me daily i know and one sweet day youll finally listen and pay me again they laughed but for tarlak the jovialness was forced he didnt like this assault one bit but he wasnt the one in charge so what if they hadnt encountered a single orc raid on their travel east so what if their supplies had gone untouched their passage completely unimpeded into enemy territory antonils generals assured them that their numbers were so great the pitiably few orcs remaining would only flee but tarlaks gut said differently and staring at the broken walls of kinamn he knew that something was amiss he just couldnt decide what the men are ready to move out said sergan coming up to join the three sergan was an old battlehardened veteran from antonils days as guard captain for the city of veldaren his face was scarred his beard long but he wielded his ax with a spryness many of the younger men struggled to match after days of marching remember i want the archers spread as far apart as possible antonil said if they do have war engines i want their effect minimized and the city gates sergan asked you sure you want to cram all twentyfive thousand of our fighting men into such a narrow space one wellplaced boulder from a catapult and well have hundreds turned to jelly the king gestured to tarlak who tipped his hat consider me the antiboulder guy he said and trust me the city gates wont be that narrow after im done with them sergan shook his head putting our faith in wizards he said its going to get us killed one day love you too sergan tarlak said shooting him a wink now go tell the men to move their asses were not getting any younger and we have orcs to kill horns began to sound throughout the massive camp they left much of their supplies behind along with the wagons with the city a mere quartermile away there seemed little point in lugging it all with them tarlak watched it all thinking of them like an incredibly dangerous nest of ants toward the city they swarmed and tarlak rode beside antonil and sergan the rest of the generals filtered throughout the army to command their individual forces tarlak saw the smoke trails within the city extinguish one by one for some reason that frightened him more than anything a foe awaited him behind those walls moving strategizing yes they were orcs yes they were stupid but they still had the blood of elves in them when it came to killing they seemed a bit more willing to use their brains instead of muscle but no matter how clever they might be antonil commanded thirty thousand men even if theyd doubled their number since the previous assault they were still outnumbered three to one five to one really once they counted in tarlaks advantage as they neared the city walls the first of the orcs finally appeared atop the ramparts there were several hundred of them all wielding long spears take them out antonil shouted and sergan quickly relayed the order the archers lifted their bows and five thousand men sent a barrage of arrows toward the walls the fighters on the front lines raised their shields and those behind kept their heads down and followed after spears rained down upon the soldiers scoring kills the archers took down many and even more spears broke against the shields tarlak nodded liking the sight he remained at antonils side watching the fight waiting for the right time theyre almost to the gates antonil said i know theyre not carrying even a battering ram i know tarlak cracked his knuckles mentally counting down threetwoone he slammed his wrists together shouting out the words of a spell from his palms shot a fireball that grew larger and larger the farther through the air it flew it arced upward as if shot from a catapult then slowly began to descend tarlak watched his eyes tracing its downward fall come on he said come on drop drop drop with perfect aim the fireball slammed into the gates when antonils men were only dozens of feet away exploding with enough force that the shieldmen in the front had to brace against it metal and wood twisted and fragmented more impressive the stone walls cracked and rumbled and leatherarmored orcs screamed and as the towers atop the portcullis crumpled and fell suddenly the entrance to the city was triple what itd been only moments before antonils men let out a cheer and with renewed vigor they rushed ahead to where the orcish defenders stood at the ready somethings wrong tarlak said antonil what in blazes is going on there were only a mere thousand to stand against them they shouted and waved their weapons crude blades and axes but against the swarm of men they would be buried in minutes antonil frowned and he clearly had the same worry its been years he said perhaps the orcs abandoned the place or there was infighting among the tribes tarlak didnt buy it he readied his magic his gut still screaming trap and then the catapults fired from either side of the far street the giant rocks sailed into the air four at a time they surely couldnt see the combat from behind all the buildings tarlak knew which meant someone coordinating the attack with no time to think on it he acted fast his hands dancing in his mind he gripped the broken rubble of the gateway hed just shattered clutching it with invisible hands stronger than a giants into the air he flung them slamming them against the incoming boulders the hits halted their momentum showering thick sledges of heavy stone all across the citywhich was fine with tarlak so long as they werent landing on their own men crushing them into jelly as sergan had so eloquently stated more catapults fired and this time tarlak was better prepared instead of relying on crude rocks he used the force of magic itself slamming into them with invisible barriers that shoved the projectiles back before they could even complete their upward arc a third volley lifted and tarlak defeated it just as easy not even breaking a sweat here tarlak told the king perhaps i should have been with you last time perhaps antonil said clearly distracted the catapults ceased firing and tarlak lowered his arms and took a deep breath when he brought his attention to the fight he realized there wasnt one at all the orcs had been slaughtered in a single wave tarlak guessed theyd taken maybe a hundred casualties at maximum the fight had gone so well and that really really worried tarlak its not supposed to be this easy he murmured antonil clapped him on the shoulder if theres bad days then theres allowed to be good days he said if you insist the archers had begun to join the rest of the men still flowing into the city and antonil went with them tarlak remained on the outside watching something felt wrong in his gut the orcs wouldnt have abandoned the city and he doubted their numbers would decrease so dramatically more troubling the city showed too many signs of orcish occupation all along the walls were crude paintings signifying allegiance to their tribal lord from various wooden poles hung flags made of tanned hide their distance was too great for him to see but he knew such decorations meant the orcs considered this land to be theirs to keep and defend so why such a pitiful defense his feelings of being cornered of being trapped led him to glance behind him and it was there he saw it oh shit said tarlak smoke rose in great plumes from the south their camp tarlak slammed his hands together ripping open a portal to take him to the camps outer edge leaping through he prepared his magic for a fight but when he stepped out there was nothing for him to kill only wreckage remained their tents had been smashed and ripped the tent poles snapped the cattle theyd brought for slaughter were in pieces intestines ripped open and left for the swarms of flies that had already begun their feast worst were the wagons and feeling himself in a dream tarlak slowly approached every one of them was aflame corpses lay about them throats cut limbs broke and bodies savaged perhaps a hundred had remained behind tending the animals preparing the food they hadnt stood a chance against whatever force descended upon them the wizard shook his head the pit in his stomach growing i hate being right he said to himself damn it tarlak you know youre allowed to be wrong for once at least once but not this time in the ruins of kinamn the three gathered to discuss their options while the rest of the soldiers scavenged the city for anything useful were fucked tarlak said righteously magnificently pantsrippingly fucked so eloquently stated antonil said sitting opposite him a small fire between them the sun had begun to set but without tents the army would have to make do with sleeping under open air or bunking in one of the many filthy homes that remained standing within the city walls truthfully stated as well sergan agreed whoever set this trap showed more cunning than id ever give an orc credit for i looked over the bodies of the thousand left behind and they were all runties weak by orcish standards they were just there to provide distraction so the catapults could get their shots in brutal but efficient without tarlaks help wed have lost hundreds of men the three fell silent thinking over what theyd seen antonil in particular looked ashen in the face taking the ambush far worse than the others what do we know of their commander he asked what orc outsmarted us so easily far as i know trummug still rules the bulk of the orcs and has since veldaren fell tarlak said but our news from the east is pretty sparse if dieredon were around id ask him but hes never mentioned any major upheaval at least not to me i checked all the flags and banners sergan said plenty of drawings written in blood and most carry the same sign its not trummugs i know that instead they all show this he picked up a rolled piece of leather beside him and unfurled it it was a flag half the size of a man on its dull brown surface was a symbol drawn with blood though faded by the sun two triangles adjacent each other both pointed upward what are they supposed to be antonil asked teeth eyes normally id suggest the standard lack of artistic skill in orcs tarlak said but i saw that drawn on the walls of the city as well as many of the buildings whatever it is its the symbol of their new warlord sadly your men were so eager for a fight they didnt leave any orcs alive for us to question hopefully next time you might order them to be more careful ill make sure we get prisoners sergan said my gut says well be encountering raiding parties from here on out this new commander was biding his time waiting until the right moment to hitand with us out of food and supplies now is definitely the right time enough of this orc antonil said well find him in time and when we meet on the battlefield well crush him for now we have larger problems to deal with specifically the fate of our campaign what are our options options tarlak asked just one we turn back toward ker and march as fast as our feet can carry us we dont have the food for a campaign they slaughtered our livestock torched our wagons and then ran for the hills the orcs fled here in a hurry sergan said shaking his head its not quite that bad but close weve discovered various stockpiles left behind and while i doubt anyone here will enjoy the mystery meats nor want to know what they are at least its still food no one will be starving for a few weeks not if we tighten our belts a few weeks tarlak rolled his eyes where exactly will we go in a few weeks if veldaren is guarded at all we wont be able to siege it if were harassed on our way east given even a slight delay well start leaving a trail of bodies we cant do this we can antonil said we dont go to veldaren we go to angelport instead tarlak rubbed his eyes really he asked yes antonil said glaring their boats and walls have kept them safe we can liberate their surrounding fields barter for food and given time restock with supplies from the west until were ready to march north tarlak could hardly believe what he was hearing antonil my king you have to understandthis campaign is lost those orcs hit us exactly where it hurt the most and if you think a besieged holdout of a city will be able to support thirty thousand additional men this campaign is not lost antonil stood jaw trembling immediately he looked away as if embarrassed for his outburst its not he said quietly i wont turn us around i wont retreat back to mordan as such a colossal failure again thirty thousand men outsmarted by brute thugs and sent running with a mere thousand dead runties to our names no we strip kinamn of every shred of supplies then hurry toward the coast and if anyone tries to stop us tarlak dared ask i hope they do sergan said drumming his fingers atop the handle of his ax because anyone trying to stop us will have food on them we can make it to angelport im certain of that our men havent given up yet to many this was still a victory and i have no intention of convincing them otherwise tarlak youve summoned food before thats why we didnt starve when we fled veldaren ages ago cant you do the same now tarlak sighed felt in one of his hidden pockets of his robes i dont have enough topaz he said not for thirty thousand i can maybe feed our entire army for a day maybe two thats two days more than we had before antonil said dont lose faith on me tarlak without you were lost tarlak chuckled and despite it all he put a smile on his face and tipped his tall yellow hat i guess compared to what weve dealt with before this is only a minor inconvenience he said i mean its not like theres going to be flying demons and an angry war god chasing after us always looking on the bright side sergan said and he laughed tarlak laughed with him though it was entirely forced jessilynn waited in the dark hating that shed been left behind it reminded her of her earliest days after entering the citadel friendless and alone because of her sex shed only been eleven unable to fully understand why the other boys looked at her like she was a different species the days had been long and that first year shed cried herself to sleep more times than she could count but through it all shed endured jerico in particular had done everything he could to make her feel welcome accepted in time shed finally felt like she belonged belonging though still didnt mean she was like the others getting dressed keeping herself clean during her monthlies even taking a piss meant going off on her own it was like a sore on the roof of her mouth that refused to go away most of the time she could easily ignore it pretend it didnt bother her but sometimes without a fire to warm her or even provide mild entertainment she sat huddled and did her best to pray to ashhur she begged for patience for calm most of all she asked her god for bravery because no matter what dieredon decided she knew it would not involve running away not from such a massive gathering of forces after far too long she heard the sound of wings and then sonowin softly landed in the flat yellow grass nearby dieredon hopped off and though jessilynn had stood at his arrival he only sat down beside her he said nothing staring up at the stars in thought it made jessilynn uncomfortable and she crossed her arms and shifted her weight from foot to foot i wish youd bring me with you she said breaking the silence your armor is too loud it would give us away werent you going to teach me to make new armor dieredon finally looked her way indeed he said but it seems we wont have time for such lessons will we she deserved that she knew but at least he was talking to her now what did you learn she asked sitting back down and facing him dieredon looked to the west where the creatures of the wedge had gathered in the ravine there does appear to be some sort of ruling council he said the various races on the whole do not interact with one another but ive seen lone members go into the wolfmen side or at least close to it theres a large pile of bones nearby and it isnt just refuse like i first thought theyre meeting there discussing right now it appears there is a wolfman strong enough to frighten not only his kind but the rest of the creatures as well then our task is simple jessilynn said we kill that wolfman and the alliance collapses in his absence dieredon nodded that is my belief as well though it will not be simple any creature with such a fearsome reputation will have earned it in blood it seems this council meets once each night i think whatever theyre preparing it is about to begin arrivals have slowed and the tension among the races is thick whoever is in charge will need to act soon lest this entire army dissolve into chaos how do we kill their leader jessilynn asked i have to discover who it is first dieredon said and that means getting close enough to overhear one of their meetings jessilynn thought of the ravine and of how each entrance was heavily populated with the vile creatures theres no way she said to this dieredon smiled even the eyes and ears of wolves are nothing to me jessilynn but if youve been wanting to be involved dont worry tomorrow night my life will be in your hands jessilynn swallowed felt a tightening in her chest suddenly remaining behind seemed like a much better idea the wolfmen occupied the larger southern end of the ravine effectively blocking in most of the races with the hyenamen filling the smaller northern end jessilynn and dieredon lay flat on their bellies at the very top of the cliff above below was the pile of bones where they expected another meeting to take place between the two was a long thin rope one end securely fastened to the ground with two different hooks remember the fires will be my greatest ally dieredon whispered to her their eyes are sharp but not when so close to light that means only wolfmen arriving from outside the ravine pose any danger of spotting me that is when you must signal are you certain you have them memorized one to halt two to retreat three if spotted she said repeating what hed told her countless times make sure you are certain and make sure you keep the signals clear give a test signal early on as well understand jessilynn nodded her breathing had increased and she felt strangely lightheaded her ears were full of the howls and roars of the creatures below and now the only friend she had for hundreds of miles was about to descend into that beastly den if something should happen run to sonowin dieredon said as he took hold of the rope and secured it to his belt shell fly you back to the citadel and from there itll be up to you to convince lathaar and jerico to act accordingly she nodded again too nervous to speak her bow was slung over her shoulder along with her arrows and she wished she had them in her hands she obviously couldnt take on thousands of creatures all by herself but at least she wouldnt feel so helpless as dieredon began his descent she remained on her stomach clutching the rope with both hands the rope was intended solely as a safety line should the elf needed to ascend rapidly as well as a means of communication between him and jessilynn the ravine cliff while steep was far from sheer and with amazing strength dieredon descended looking like a spider as he shifted between handholds jessilynn looked away from the elf and instead scanned the area below she trusted dieredon and his camouflage to keep himself hidden the fires dotting the wolfman section of the ravine were at a perfect distance too far to cast significant light on the ravine wall yet still close enough to affect the eyes of those at the bone pile and the surrounding area even when she tried to locate him knowing he was there she needed a moment it was his cloak she realized something about its subtle splotches of green and brown seemed to perfectly blend in with the stone when dieredon was a quarter of the way down she tugged on the rope pulling until she felt resistance like shed been shown the elf halted flattening himself against the cliff face and remaining perfectly still after counting to ten she tugged once more using the same number as the previously given command cancelled the command dieredon resumed his descent and jessilynn continued scanning the area so far it appeared there were no patrols which was far from surprising what could the creatures possibly need protection from the bigger danger to jessilynn and dieredon were the hunting parties which returned both often and irregularly when he was halfway down she spotted a group of seven wolfmen coming in from the south she tugged once hoping she hadnt noticed too late dieredon stopped flattening himself again the wolfmen loped past the great pile of bones three of the seven carrying corpses across their shoulders two were of other wolfmen she saw while a third was that of a goblin runaways perhaps was it punishment feasting or both she received her answer swiftly enough as the wolfmen plopped the bodies into the center of their camp and let out a howl grim but efficient jessilynn thought a way of simultaneously reinforcing discipline while keeping the army fed she figured dieredon would be safe due to the distraction and she used the rope to give her signal immediately dieredon continued moving she watched him for a moment stunned that he could maintain his grip without relying on the rope his body was slender but it was clear that all of it was muscle no wonder he was so frightening in combat not that shed seen him fight she only had reputation to rely upon but that hardwon reputation was impressive indeed when dieredon was a third of the way from the bottom he paused without need of signal from jessilynn at first she felt an impulse of panic thinking shed missed something that he himself had spotted then she saw the size of the jutted rock he used as footholds the deepness of the shadows there and felt soft pressure applied on the rope he was either resting or settling in to listen whichever it was she told herself to calm down dieredon was hundreds of years old and had most likely dealt with far more dangerous situations than this she had to trust him the minutes passed each one feeling like an eternity another hunting party arrived this one full of birdmen she gave a single tug so hed know and she actually felt a tug back in return for whatever reason it made her smile a reminder that he was aware and in control as the night wore on the sounds below grew louder more boisterous the stress picked away at her mind made her feel exhausted despite her training she knew she could go at least a full day and night without sleep theyd been forced to do so several times in the citadel but being out in the midst of real danger with the fear of being eaten or seeing a friend mutilated because of her own mistakes chipping away at her was a different beast altogether so great was the noise below that she almost didnt hear the sound of beating wings a sudden surge of fear assured her something was wrong the beating increased loud enough for her to pick it out among the chaos looking up her mouth dropped open as she realized the implication of what she saw sonowin was in flight come up come up come up jessilynn said tugging on the rope she felt ashhur scream warning in her ear after the second tug and close behind her she heard a low growl despite her terror she did not turn did not try to flee instead forcing herself to pull the third time giving dieredon the order to retreat clawed hands grabbed her lifting her into the air without the slightest bit of effort what is this asked a grayhaired wolfman he held her before him like a curiosity like a strange plaything behind him were twenty more wolfmen sauntering up the hillside the entire scene was so unreal jessilynn felt paralyzed she smelled the foul breath of her captor felt the sharp sting of his claws as they tightened around her arms his eyes were bloodshot and they glinted yellow from the starlight that she understood him made it all the more surreal shed been taught the creatures knew the human tongue but knowing and experiencing were two entirely different things she knew right then and there that she was going to die a tasty treat asked another of the wolfmen as he climbed up to join the grayhaired one a scraggly female said grayhair but with at least some fat on her the wolfman looked down saw the rope letting out a snarl he shifted jessilynn so that he carried her with one arm his muscles were like a vice and though she struggled against him she might as well have been trying to pry open a rock with her bare hands grayhair sniffed the air then opened his mouth wide and let out a yip a tricksy elf the beast said reaching down for the rope jessilynn thought hed cut it but instead he took hold of the rope and yanked upward as hard as he could dangling over the edge in the wolfmans arm jessilynn had all too fine a view of what happened next dieredon was frantically climbing and though he might have been able to support himself had rope gone slack instead it pulled against him dislodging him from the cliff face and sending him dangling above the ravine the grayhair tugged again pulling the rope free of the spikes and then let it drop already having slid down the rope the elf fell the rest of the short way down rolling to absorb the impact jessilynn screamed as the wolfman let out an earsplitting howl the attention of the camp turned their way and suddenly alert it took only moments before dieredon was spotted a legion of howls took up the hunt as the elf sprinted toward the exit the rest of the twenty wolfmen gathered around the cliff edge to watch the excitement jessilynn felt completely ignored and for some reason that made her all the more afraid they didnt care about her found her vaguely amusing at best she was but food to them what interest would they show other than when it was time to rip apart her flesh staring down jessilynn prayed for dieredons safety even as she saw how hopeless a situation it was hed stashed his bow with sonowin for the duration of the climb which left him with only two longbladed daggers his speed was incredible as he ran but the wolfmen could still overcome him the elf was a blur of motion and anytime a wolfman neared the creature fell back clutching part of its body or falling dead on the spot jessilynn stared wideeyed continuing to pray maybe he could live maybe he wouldnt suffer for her failure she should have heard them she should have realized they were sneaking up on her all her fault his death the death of a legend would be her fault a feisty one he is said one of the wolfmen all elves are grayhair snarled perhaps the pups are liars if they cannot kill one elf theyll kill him said another where else will he go sad we wont get a taste ive had elf flesh before it is sweet like honey you would not like it dieredon scrambled toward one of the cliff edges as three wolfmen cut him off they leapt in unison and beneath them dieredon tumbled fire glinted off his daggers and only two wolfmen got up to chase after the third lay motionless now he is trapped grayfur said pointing a clawed finger theyve cut him off over a dozen wolfmen had ignored chasing after dieredon instead racing past so they might curl around forming a wall of fur to prevent him from reaching the ravines exit dieredon raced toward them anyway as if he might challenge them but at the last moment he slid to a halt turned and vaulted to the side he struck the opposite cliff face scrambling upward with amazing dexterity a few wolfmen picked up speed and leapt slamming gracelessly into the rock and clawing wildly they shredded the edges of the elfs cloak but did little else still jessilynn could see hundreds of the beasts racing out of the ravine and curling back around scaling the slope to wait for dieredon should he reach the top below him were hundreds more howling and yipping at him eager to feast the moment he fell jessilynn saw him slip and from a single hand he hung above the maw of snapping teeth she let out a cry and it earned her the attention of her captor you care for him the wolfman asked you amuse me human watch him die cry for him i love seeing humans weak dieredon had regained his balance climbing halfway up the cliff jessilynn felt a lump in her throat knowing there was nowhere for him to go he was just delaying the inevitable he slipped again and she saw his movements lacking grace when compared to his initial descent he had to be wounded she knew though she could only guess how badly from such a great distance let him die from the fall she prayed spare him the pain of their teeth dieredon let go of the rock and crying out she watched him plummet he turned in the air legs downward and then swooping in from the sky came sonowin dieredon landed atop her rolled to one side and then grabbed her mane with a hand to steady himself tears were in jessilynns eyes as he flew away at least he lived at least someone would know her fate grayhair growled his teeth so close to her face stubborn elves he said tossing jessilynn to the ground the twenty gathered round flexing their claws their tongues drooling we should eat her now said one theres not enough for us as is the rest will try to take her no the grayhaired one snarled we are late and the kings might be angry let her be a gift they cannot be angry if we give them humanflesh to eat our presence is a gift one of the bigger wolfmen snarled back he turned his yellow eyes on jessilynn licking the sides of his long snout with his tongue grayhair roared stepping between him and jessilynn a gift the wolfman said or we shall feast on you instead the younger wolfman bowed his head and flattened his ears if you say then so be it the grayhaired one turned and wrapped his enormous paw around her neck his eyes were all she saw as he lowered himself to her height walk he ordered she did so flanked by the pack the thundering of her heart and quickness of her breathing gave the entire world a flat glassy look unreal she thought it was all unreal like a bad dream part of her wished it was but her senses were overloaded giving things a clarity no nightmare could ever possess down the ravine they walked as high above she saw sonowin circling when the winged horse began to lower she dared hope hed rescue her it seemed grayhair saw as well and he snarled up at the sky come for your pet he asked reaching out he grabbed jessilynn by the throat the paw closed so tightly she could not breathe and frantically she clutched at his claws as he lifted her into the air as if offering her to dieredon his other paw tightened against her chest thick claws easily punching through her armor with blurred vision she looked up to the stars saw sonowin lift back up into the air her last bit of hope died and she knew absolutely knew her time had ended such cowardice the wolfman snarled and he set her down gasping for air she fell to her knees only to find herself yanked back to her feet walk the grayhair said the kings will prefer the kill to be their own but i will present your warm dead body if i must jessilynn coughed so hard she vomited the bile dribbling down her throat yet still she struggled to her feet one foot after the other she thought beginning her descent down the outside of the ravine following the pack as they curled her around to the entrance she tried praying to ashhur but her mind was white with terror she couldnt think she couldnt form words all around her were yellow eyes and there was no disguising their hunger into the camp she went and now there were thousands of them howling and growling the sound was deafening and without even realizing it she began to cry im sorry she pleaded to her god though she didnt know why she felt an overwhelming sense of failure and though it made no sense she could not help it im sorry so sorry please forgive me they stopped at the great pile of bones where dieredon had hoped to overhear the meeting now so close she saw the age of the bones many chalkwhite and meticulously clean others were red with blood bits of meat still clinging to them overpowering was the smell of sweat from the beasts and their breath was tinged with the scent of blood she tried not to gag but her stomach was already weak to her knees the grayhair flung her slamming her atop the bone pile the bones scattered beneath her clattering think she told herself she knew the prayers she was supposed to pray if she thought herself approaching death all the comforts of the golden eternity the promises of ashhur and his angels she tried to think on them to face death with the stubbornness and comfort that jerico had when hed been captured by the enemy but all she felt was an aching desire to be anywhere other than where she was to walk backward in time to when dieredon was first climbing down the cliff and make him stay make him fly her out of there out of the wedge and to the safety of the citadel but instead the wolfmen howled the sound piercing her ears and overwhelming any rational thought sobbing on the bones she curled her head closed her eyes and waited for death the howling lessened as she heard movement upon the bones a gift great kings the grayhair said from behind her she was with the elf when we arrived aiding him with a rope this was it her whole body tensed a massive paw reached down and she waited for it to rip open her throat instead it grabbed hold of her armor and lifted her upward determined to show some shred of dignity she opened her eyes and looked upon her killer there was not one wolfman there but two both were enormous seemingly towering over the others they peered at her and the intelligence in their eyes was all the more frightening both were solid black but for their paws which were a deep red the only difference she saw was that one had two circles of white in the center of his face highlighting his yellow eyes your armor the one holding her asked lifting her higher what does it mean the question made no sense to her what did her armor mean could the wolves truly recognize the style of her armor the meaning of the various symbols a paladin she said her voice trembling im a paladin the two wolfmen shared a look as the rest of the pack howled for blood like him one said to the other like the one who humiliated father and that is why she must live an elderly female said stepping to the edge of the bone pile her back was bent low and white hair marked her ears there is much she will know that knowledge will benefit us all take her then said the wolfman holding her with ease he flung her to the females feet her meat is little and i will not taste the flesh of man until we are free he turned to the crowd his voice roaring throughout the entire ravine until we are all free others of the beasts nipped at jessilynn but the two wolfmen on the pile bared their fangs ushering them back the old female knelt down before her and grabbed her arm her watery eyes looked her over with a wisdom that seemed far beyond what jessilynn thought possible when she spoke there was no compassion in her voice follow me before you become their meal with no other choice jessilynn obeyed the village elders gathered though elder was a misleading term many were young and fiery of temper though the presence of the angel host did much to still their tongues qurrah watched them assemble into the great auditorium at the very rear of the castle seldom used but recently cleaned to accommodate the meeting he stayed at the door not allowed to enter strange that i would be denied entrance qurrah said to kevin maryll who stood beside him greeting the various men as they came to take their seat more than sixty attended each representing the village they came from the procession had slowed to a trickle but still kevin waited in case more might arrive your reputation is well known kevin said glancing at him but tell me which village do you represent oh that is right you live in ker now the angels have no sway over you observing is not the same as speaking or casting a vote qurrah said already disliking the man not true kevin said your very presence would change things youre a reminder of a different time and a threat that no longer exists we cant be lost in the past nows the future and its that future i must protect he fixed his tunic which was made of some of the finest material qurrah had ever seen then adjusted the short cape around his neck what do you hope to accomplish qurrah asked him as he straightened his hair do you think the angels will suddenly change their minds and bow to this rabble youve assembled youre just like your brother kevin said licking his fingers and making a second attempt at his hair you hold these winged men in far too high regard theyre fallible and more importantly they must follow laws and customs just like us they know this they believe themselves to represent everything good and just they say they always know the truth when they hear it and you know what he flashed qurrah a smile i think theyre right kevin stepped into the auditorium and from within two angels on guard pushed the iron doors shut qurrah shook his head wishing he could have met kevin many years ago when ripping the tongue out of a living man might not have put such a weight on his conscience being barred from listening to the complaints of the people was ridiculous worse kevin had somehow finagled it so that harruq was banned as well just the people and the angels kevin had claimed though qurrah sensed the weaseling desires behind it still sneaking into a meeting hed been banned from was far far less a burden on qurrahs conscience than tongue mutilation turning about he hurried to a nearby door which led to a closet used by servants within were various stored tools plus a great stack of clean linens more importantly the closet shared a wall with the auditorium sitting down beside that wall he put his fingers against the stone and began to cast a spell a thin tendril of shadow stretched out from his palm then began to twirl it dug through the stone with an unnatural silence when it popped through light poured into the dark closet a quick check showed he could see the rows of angels all circled around the far fewer number of representatives come to speak for the common man dismissing the spell qurrah lowered his head pressed his ear to the hole and listened tessanna lay in their bed waiting for qurrahs return shed tried playing with aubrienna but all the while she felt aurelia watching her there was no malice in it no real anger but the mistrust was there however faint and it made tessanna sick because she knew it was welldeserved wishing her lover could be with her she lay there eyes closed feeling hours pass over her in a steady uninterrupted flow when the door opened she sat up smiling youre back she said the smile on her face immediately vanished qurrah looked in a hurry and he rushed to the chest where their things were stored we must leave he said throwing it open gather whatever you wish to bring with you and if you have any goodbyes go say them now tessannas mouth dropped open what do you mean she asked whats wrong i said hurry qurrah snapped he immediately turned back to what he was doing tessanna stood up from the bed walked over to qurrah and then wrapped her hands around him to force him to calm down when he looked up at her he kissed her lips then let out a sigh forgive me he said but time is not our friend right now tell me first she said i will not flee the castle like a burglar no matter what has happened now answer me it was the meeting he said the people they spoke their demands to the angels and it was all the same they explained it in different ways disguised their real demands with impractical ideas but deep down they wanted the same thing he looked up at her and she saw the fear in her lovers eyes they want death he said they want death and i think the angels are going to give it to them thats nonsense tess said as qurrah resumed packing his things she stood over him watching the angels arent murderers and what do you mean they want death sinners punished qurrah said not forgiven not remedied punished killed hung beheaded am i making sense now stop it she said stop snapping at me im sorry he turned around sitting with his back against the open chest with his left hand he rubbed his forehead as if suffering a headache its not that they made the demands he said i understand their frustration that wasnt it thats not why we must leave it was the angels they were agreeing with them i saw them listening nodding they looked too eager to please too eager to abandon what ahaesarus kept trying to defend its like theres a sickness here tess i cant find it but i smell the scent of disease she sat in silence as he finished bundling the last of his things then stood they mentioned my name he said slamming the chest shut i wont repeat what they said but i assure you its a sign our time here is over they angels are flying back to avlimar i want us gone long before they return whatever you say tessanna said she thought of leaving aubrienna of not seeing her for several more years and felt her heart crack still she would not live without her lover if qurrah was leaving then so was she either way shed be miserable but at least shed have his company qurrah seemed to sense it and he wrapped his arms around her waist well come back he said when things have calmed down when people are thinking clearly what of aubrienna tessanna whispered shes still in danger are we to just leave them qurrah winced hed clearly been thinking the same thing and it seemed hed wanted to ignore that fact we have to trust harruq and aurelia to protect her he said you must believe me our presence here does not help my brother it only hurts him of course it does tessanna said thats all we ever do tears ran down her face but she felt her humanity receding pulled into a deeper part of herself whatever emotions she felt they suffocated becoming gray things in the corners of her mind that held no sway over her qurrahs face showed his hurt at what shed said but she felt no guilt for it no remorse she was hurting why should he not know it come on he said ill tell harruq were leaving for ker would you like to say goodbye to aubrienna before we go as if from a distance she knew doing so would make her happy yes she said i would like that im sorry qurrah said taking her hand i really am i know she said as if knowing meant anything at all harruq sat brooding on antonils throne he still didnt view it as his own and he felt sick at the idea that one day he might qurrah had informed him of their departure several hours ago his brother was probably halfway to ker by now if he was traveling by magic their change in attitude was sudden but strangely not surprising it was as if because of their recent arrival they were better able to smell the danger in the air the only thing left to do was sit and wait for the angels decision they were meeting in avlimar the many thousands come together from every corner of mordan to vote on their next course of action harruq knew hed agreed to let it happen but still that smug look on kevins face when hed swung by the throne room to inform him of the meetings end had been more than enough to ignite his anger servants came and went offering him something to eat or drink much as he wanted to he turned it all down wine might calm him but the alcohol might also make it that much harder to control himself should he not like what he was about to hear given qurrahs rapid departure he highly doubted the results would be pleasing milord a guard shouted from the far end of the hall the angel priest azariah the door opened and harruq rose from his chair he was impatient to hear the results and annoyed at himself for his nervousness azariah walked across the carpet and he dipped his head in respect we have listened to the desires of the people he said and i have done my best to weigh it against ashhurs wisdom their pain is great and their frustrations legitimate given all we have seen of the world since our return so what is your decision harruq asked whats changing azariah swallowed thinning his lips the act seemed strangely human those committing lesser crimes will still be judged in the same manner he said though men given to repeat offenses will be brought to the castle prison in solitude it will be easier to enforce the lessons they must learn harruq nodded that was acceptable enough he could oversee the prisons to ensure their humane treatment and besides prior to the angels most of the petty criminals would have been thrown into the cells anyway at least now the stay would hopefully be far shorter what of the major crimes he asked the look on azariahs face only increased his apprehension the greater crimes are what trouble the people the nature of grace is too heavy for this world at least in its truest form the chance for redemption will be offered to offenders as always but after that punishment of the physical body will also be given as per the laws of your nation only with us as the executioners these sins trouble too many minds and there are those who feel the physical punishment will serve as a deterrent against those who might seek to abuse ashhurs forgiving nature harruq frowned trying to work through the consequences of the decision so from now on youll execute them no matter what they say he asked not just from now on azariah said every man who has ever committed murder under our watch will suffer the same brought down upon him we know every name every place if this world would prefer its justice to ours then we will give it to them if we have passed judgment upon a man or woman it will be made again with no exceptions harruq felt dizzy and he took a faltering step back everyone the angels had passed judgment upon when he asked tonight well announce the decree in each village we land in just before carrying out the new justice justice it would have made harruq laugh if he were not so sick he kept repeating it to himself everyone the angels had passed judgment upon everyone qurrah he said your very first trial was for qurrah it clearly pained azariah but he nodded in agreement it was he said softly harruq felt his rage growing long suppressed but not now he couldnt control it wouldnt control it his hands were on the hilts of his swords and his mind flashed red with blood you cant do this he said hes not the same man he was as we have told the people every day for the past five years they dont want to hear it i dont care about the people harruq screamed you wont send your angels after him you cant hes my brother damn it you think im any better i killed children children no different than my little aubby send for your angels azariah bring ahaesarus here himself if you must serve my head on a platter straight from avlimar to the people and see how much they love you for it or am i just lucky to have gotten my act together before your kind came it was your answered prayer that brought us azariah said the angel looked like his patience was starting to wear thin then be an answer to prayers not this youre protectors not executioners this is what you think will win the people over flying through the night blasting open doors and knocking in walls dragging the guilty out into the streets and slitting their throats dont do this dont whatever love the people have for you whatever trust you end it right here right now if you continue with this plan azariah tried to put his hand on harruqs shoulder but he batted it away we voted every angel given equal voice azariah said im sorry but this is the decision we have reached i act as king harruq said what of my voice or do our choices mean nothing are we given no chance to rule ourselves as much as it obviously bothered azariah he appeared unwilling to have his mind changed harruq almost drew his swords but it would accomplish nothing even if he cut off azariahs head the law would be enforced only with his own life added to the list qurrahs returned to ker harruq said it was the last card he had left to play king bram wont hand him over to any angel especially not for an execution if you try for him youll be starting a war how many lives wasted then azariah how much blood will be on your conscience before you realize its madness no exceptions azariah said his soft voice taking on a hard edge there can be no exceptions im sorry we wont fight for you harruq said as the angel walked for the door ill tell bram it was done against my wishes that you dont represent mordan he will not believe you azariah said nor would it be true we fulfill the wishes of your people remember this was the demand made of us the one requested above all others a life for a life they said no murderer made free no matter how regretful the heart and so they shall have it they never trusted us never wanted to accept our ways this world is not ready for the grace we offer kill the killers the masses scream forgiveness is for the soul but punishment is for the body you truly think theyll hate us harruq come the light of the dawn let us hear just how many weep for the loss despite their penance their regret their sincerity your world will never see them as innocent none of us are innocent said harruq would you kill us all azariahs stare met his own karak tried he said at last i pray your brother is wise enough to surrender i do not seek war but if we fight i hope your people are willing to bear the bloody fruits of their mistrust you begged us to listen to them did you not you begged that we open our ears to their cries and so we did this blood is on their hands not ours we forgave them its this world that wants them condemned anew harruq drew a sword and slammed it into the stone floor it flared with magical strength spreading thin cracks in all directions youre supposed to be better he screamed feeling so helpless so lost were not azariah called without turning about if only the people had believed us when we said it reen stood in the doorway to his home staring up at the golden star that was avlimar close the door tracy his wife said from her seat by their small fire pit youre letting in a chill feels good he lied his eyes scanned the sky the moon was waning but the stars were full and across that somber tapestry he watched the shadows of angels flying in all directions numbering in the thousands the whole city was abuzz with news of the meeting though reen did not know what to make of the rumors too many contradicted each other too many were so outlandish as to be horrifying dont feel good to me tracy said lifting a thin blanket off the floor beside her and draping it over her arms go out for a walk if you need some air reen grunted not safe he said closing the door his wife said nothing only accepted the excuse he could tell she knew something was wrong but if he wasnt going to explain she wasnt going to press him she was good like that better than reen deserved thered been many nights hed freely walked the streets a long dagger hidden in his pants when the alcohol had really been in his blood hed hoped men would accost him just so he could take their coin after they lay bleeding in the street but that was another time another man what did you hear from the other women reen asked deciding he might as well bring his worries out into the open tracy frowned at him she worked with the servants in the castle one of the few that didnt sleep there due to reen owning his own property the quartermasters ran her ragged but even amid the hectic pace her work required reen knew she talked with the other servants if there was ever a place where rumors of the angels would spread itd be the castle nothing id believe tracy said reen leaned his back against the door and crossed his arms humor me the angels had a big meeting with farmers and old men from the outer lands most are saying it was just so people could let off steam nothings going to change thats not what i heard reen said tracy gave him an exasperated look if you heard more then why are you asking about my rumors instead of telling me whats bothering you reen grunted was hoping you knew more than me thats all the men at the tavern are saying the angels are thinking of executing all murderers and rapists regardless of their confessions tracys face darkened the subtle fear he saw was like a dull knife stabbing into reens belly i thought you werent going to taverns anymore i didnt drink anything reen said raising his hands honest tracy settled back into her chair but the fear still lingered reen thought of how hed been when he came home those many nights he never laid a hand on her hardly even yelled at her but no matter how hard she pretended not to he knew she saw the blood on his clothes how else would the stains be gone the next morning how late did she stay up trying to hide the proof of his sins the guilt was heavy unrelenting ever since he started his two years of sobriety ever since he killed his friend charles ever since the angels he hadnt meant to of course its not like he was ever fully in control during those nights charles had said something to him and no matter how hard he tried no matter how many times he dreamed of that moment reen never remembered what it was his friend had said a bawdy joke perhaps a jovial insult it didnt matter something about it had set off reens temper and hed struck his friend in the stomach with all of his drunken might theyd both come home bruised and bloody on multiple occasions but something about the location of his fist the way charless body had been unprepared came together just perfectly charles had lost his balance and within moments hed begun to vomit blood it didnt take long for the angel to come in his stupor reen never even learned the angels name but he knew the reason he was there the sword on the angels back had been more than enough thered been dozens of witnesses no need for reen to confess no real mystery to the trial charles had lain before him for reen had not left his side not even when his friends body had begun to turn cold something about the angel the understanding in his voice the compassion in his eyes left him feeling naked he confessed to it all and not just charles his drunkenness his greed his willingness to kill and maim feeling so lost so afraid hed bowed his head and waited for the blade to hit but it hadnt i think your old friends at the tavern are too drunk to think straight tracy said pulling him from his memories ashhur wouldnt let his angels do that it goes against everything he teaches perhaps reen said joining his wife before the fire pit but i dont see ashhur around to stop them tracy reached out and grabbed his hand kissed his rough fingers go to bed she said youll be up far earlier than i before reen could answer he heard a sound he immediately recognized itd haunted his dreams for months encapsulating everything about that horrible broken moment when charles had breathed his last breath gagging on his own blood it was the heavy sound of angel wings and just like then he felt his blood freeze reen sanderson come forth called a voice from beyond the door tracy leapt out of her chair clutching her blanket to her chest as if it might protect her its not what you think she said you arent right reen you cant be he kissed her then went to the door when he opened it he found three angels waiting for him for the moment their weapons were sheathed and he prayed that was a sign yes he asked them our council has convened the middle one said reen noticed the angel refused to meet his eyes instead looking slightly upward we have capitulated to mans law recognizing mankinds authority to rule themselves as ashhur has granted dont give me that reen said tell me why youre at my door this late an hour let me hear it in plain speech plain speech said the first angel so be it your sentence of murder is no longer stayed please step forward and let us carry out justice from behind him he heard tracy make the faintest of cries in truth he wasnt taking it much better his legs felt weak and it was only because he held the door that his hands were not shaking why he finally asked thats not why were here the middle angel said step outside reen you forgave him tracy shouted her stupor broken she rushed to reens side clutching his arm as if to never let him go you cant do this you cant this is what i prayed for all those years dont you see hes not the same hes not the same reen saw the determination in the angels eyes and knew there would be no salvation for him not this time with a firm hand he pushed his wife away holding her wrists to keep her from striking him as she cried he kissed her forehead then stepped out of his home and into the street the commotion had woken many of his neighbors assuming theyd even been sleeping in the first place doors opened and eyes peered out from windows none dared ask what was going on reen walked forward into the middle of the three angels his legs felt like they belonged to someone else his heart pounded and he almost laughed as he felt an insane desire for a drink on your knees said one of the angels drawing the sword off his back reen obeyed know that this punishment is for your body alone your confession was true and your forgiveness remains if your heart has remained pure you will be welcomed into ashhurs arms and all the heavens will sing in joy at your arrival reen nearly laughed at the absurdity as he felt the sharp edge of the sword touch his neck reen tracy screamed behind him he shifted so he could look at her one last time he remembered when he came home two years ago suddenly given new life by the angels and left with only a single command to go and live a life without sin at his wifes feet hed collapsed and told her everything before he felt it leave him before he felt his old habits return with a vengeance hed told her his desire to change hed told her he couldnt live with that guilt anymore couldnt stand her pained looks her forced silence and the quiet prayers she offered up in his name when she thought him asleep despite his tears despite how miserable a being he felt when reen had looked up at his wife hed never seen her gaze back at him with such joy such love now he saw terror now he saw betrayal reen glanced up at his executioners and he spoke with a voice stronger than he thought himself capable of not only the angels would hear but his wife and his neighbors gathering to watch in subdued silence as well ashhur will welcome me he said my souls been bought but will he welcome you there was fear in the angels eyes as he lifted the blade and there was anger these werent the eyes hed seen when hed hunched over charless body they were something else he lowered his head clenched his fists do it he said do it you damn cowards do it the last thing he heard was the whistling of the blade slicing through the air harruq stood atop the highest balcony of the castle watching the shadows of angels fly over the city to the people sleeping below he was their ruler their king in antonils absence but to the men with wings flying above nothing he was nothing and never before had he felt so powerless an hour ago hed used a scepter the only one that had shone the entire night he wondered how freely that bluewhite light would glow anymore that his request had gone unanswered failed to surprise him it only deepened his sadness the sound of wings reached his ears and he glanced upward it seemed his request hadnt been ignored after all harruq said nothing as ahaesarus landed beside him on the balcony the leader of the angels kept quiet joining the halforc in leaning against the railing that overlooked the city for a long moment the silence stretched between them as harruq tried to think of what to say how many he asked at last how many in mordeina alone ahaesaruss face remained still as a stone and his eyes refused to look harruqs way just shy of two hundred two hundred two hundred men executed in the dark of night harruq felt his lower jaw tremble why didnt you stop this he asked youre their leader if you gave the order theyd have listened not all ahaesarus said quietly the matter was put to a council and twothirds voted in agreement the priests assure me there is no sin in what we do mankind was meant to follow the law and the death of murderers has long been acceptable justice acceptable harruq shook his head youre kidding me right you want to call thisthisacceptable he pointed to the city jamming his finger into the air you think they will call this acceptable he asked youre supposed to be our protectors youre supposed to be our guides now youre nothing but terrors in the night now youre just the men swinging the swords do you think i dont know that ahaesarus snapped he smashed a fist against the railing leaving a massive crack in the stone but what am i to do harruq we are men different yes but as fallible as you weve been left to govern ourselves we must find a way to live among mankind to coexist so that ashhurs love may be known to all your people wanted this my angels wanted this the scribes wrote the letters of law the priests confirmed their righteousness and all im left with is a hole in my stomach as i watch good men die harruq was stunned by the outburst he fell silent trying to think over his words hed always viewed ahaesarus as the unquestioned ruler of the angels but now he wasnt so sure in times of war hed been their leader the one to decide all final tactics was he like so many others left to find a new purpose now that the enemies were gone if ahaesarus was struggling then surely every other angel struggled just the same it wasnt supposed to be this way ahaesarus said his voice growing soft wistful many of us watched over mankind when their race was first molded by the gods hands we protected them healed them so they might flourish we were their wardens trusted respected the land was so peaceful then so free of strife that was before the brother gods warred before that innocence was lost forever the angel looked to avlimar the finest memory i have now is of us returning here when you knelt on that battlefield the entire heavens watched harruq even in eternity the land rumbled from the impact of your faith celestia saw it too saw a chance to save this world from the desolation the war god would leave it in the sky split before us and suddenly i found myself with a chance to be a warden for mankind once more we slew the demons cast them down with so righteous a fury i can still feel the power coursing through me what better way could we protect mankind how clearer might we fight the darkness than by giving our newly granted lives to save those we loved and when thulos was defeated when the war ended and peace took its place i thought things might return to that long lost paradise we would be wardens again and we would bring ashhurs love to a land that had been aching without it for centuries you want to return us to paradise harruq asked tell me how many men did you kill in paradise ahaesarus shook his head its not that easy harruq do you know how many men committed murder during those ninety years not a one it seems paradise is lost to both of us and i dont know what it is we create in its place the shadowed angels scattered and harruq saw more and more flying out from the city including a large group traveling south my brother harruq began i know ahaesarus said trust me i know im glad you know harruq said forcing his temper down for once he had to think for once he had to be the one with wisdom but knowing isnt enough what will you do about it other than standing beside me and wishing for times that wont return the law doesnt make this right you know that deep down you know that so do something anything he let out a deep breath because if you dont he said i will theres so much you angels can do for us but trust me were quite capable of killing ourselves on our own harruq left the leader of the angels there exiting the balcony through the single wooden door just within the entrance he paused listening until he heard the sound of wings taking flight with ahaesarus gone harruq let out a sigh and prayed hed said the right thing his stomach felt like a rock when he thought of what the next day would bring thered be petitioners of course people demanding an explanation what would he tell them was his heart calloused enough to sit there on the throne and tell them they only received what they asked for turning the corner he startled to find kevin maryll leaning against the wall arms crossed harruq saw the smile on his face the smugness and knew the man had heard every word what do you want harruq asked kevin shrugged it seems unfair to say ive already had so many wishes granted today it was too much harruq snapped grabbed the lord by the front of his shirt and slammed him against the stone wall is this what you wanted he asked his face inches away from kevins is this what youve worked so hard for i hope youre happy you madman im ecstatic kevin said through clenched teeth people are dying and youre ecstatic harruq felt an intense desire to draw his sword to stop himself he instead struck kevins cheek with his fist kevin didnt even let out a cry despite the blood that dripped from his lips hit me again kevin said his voice like ice act like the thug i know you are you were born scum harruq a homeless thief with a whore for a mother and a dead elf for a father everyone knows the story its sadly a rare few of us who actually listen you have no idea what ive suffered through harruq said and i dont care you rule not me so its time you looked out that balcony and accepted the truth kevin grabbed harruqs armor yanked him closer his eyes filled his vision wide with fury hard with certainty those angels dont care about us they can preach mercy and love until their wings fall off but thats not how they see us were just cattle to them look how easily they turned look how easily they butcher us so long as they feel their priests can justify it we wanted a greater stake in our fates and in answer they slaughter hundreds harruq shoved him against the wall a second time then stepped away youre wrong he said am i kevin spat blood onto the carpet angels fly to ker for your brother did you know that i suspect you do his name came up in the council during its final minutes do you know what they called him your precious reformed brother an acceptable loss this is a hard lesson harruq perhaps the hardest lesson of all the nation you rule is headed for war its one well win of course but thousands will die so accept the silver lining the people of dezrel will finally see the angels for what they truly are superior savages that would lord over us all a hard lesson learned in blood youre enjoying this harruq said feeling sick how because i want a king not a god you told ahaesarus if he didnt stop this youd stop it yourself its the smartest thing ive heard you say since taking over antonils role for all our sakes i hope you meant it kevin fixed his shirt then gave him a low exaggerated bow as he walked off the image of plunging condemnation through the lords back flashed through harruqs mind he forced it away the mans words haunted him and he retreated back to the balcony wanting one more breath of fresh air as he leaned against the railing his hand touched the broken section ahaesarus had struck he stared at the stone then looked to the slumbering city throughout he saw the angels flying the faint white of their robes seemingly a lie what are you to us harruq whispered and what are we to you to that he had no answer not anymore in such a crowded ravine solitude should have been a near impossibility or at least thats whatjessilynn initially thought it turned out not to be true near the wolfmen encampment there was a deep crack in the side of the cliff forming a thin cave not more than a few feet in it turned completely dark lacking torch or fire it was into that darkness the female took her shoving her to the ground even with her age she still had impressive strength your bow she said hand it to me jessilynn hesitated so far theyd yet to take it from her and it remained slung across her back along with her quiver of arrows she debated drawing one surely she could kill an old wolf but what would she do after she thought of the creatures as theyd gathered below dieredon waiting for him to fall she thought of the way theyd torn into the butchered cattle or even other members of their own race the fear paralyzed her the bow hand it to me now she did as she was told giving over the quiver as well the female held them to her chest nodding my name is silverear she said though i let you live i am not your friend remain here if you leave the cave you will die with that she left jessilynn to the darkness she sat on her rear arms curled across her knees and shivered what did the beasts plan to do to her was there something worse than being eaten alive the other boys at the citadel had often joked of the crude things wolfmen did always to innocent maidens of course but shed never taken them seriously itd been easy to dismiss back then but now she was so afraid it made every single outlandish story contain grains of truth theyd rape her theyd mutilate her theyd feast on her flesh then let her recover so they might eat again and again until she was nothing but a sobbing stump theyd force her to kneel before the moon and renounce ashhur lest the pack have their way with her stop it she told herself just stop it rumors jokes stupid things that meant nothing she knew that again she prayed to ashhur but in that deep darkness it seemed he was so far away halfway through her first prayer she broke down what had she been thinking accepting a role beside dieredon he was one of the legendary heroes and she was justwell she was just an exhausted frightened little girl in a cave surrounded by monsters movement from the cave entrance pulled her attention away from herself yellow eyes glinted and despite her best efforts not to she let out a gasp it was the two identical wolfmen she could tell just from their size the cave was deep enough that they could stand side by side and they loomed before her peering down like she were an alien thing the one with the white around his eyes kneeled lower then began to ask questions what do you know of the towers beyond the river he asked jessilynn felt a momentary panic as she struggled to understand what he asked of the wall of towers she realized it did little to calm her panic nothing she said forcing herself not to stammer ive never been there what of the boats the patrols her silence was answer enough the lands beyond the river they have great armies how many wear metal armor like you why did they think she knew these things she thought to guess but decided otherwise she would not lie to them no matter the convenience i dont know she said the look the two wolfmen gave her was chilling and it was clear their patience was nearing an end your armor you are a paladin yes jessilynn nodded then realized the creatures might not fully understand such human gestures yes she said i am where is the one they call jerico does he still live she did her best to hide her surprise they knew of jerico earlier theyd mentioned someone like her humiliating their father their father she let out a gasp realizing exactly who it was that stood before her one of her favorite stories at the citadel had been jerico telling of how he and darius withstood an onslaught of wolfmen crossing the river to attack the small village of durham theyd been led by a vicious wolfman named redclaw in the stories jerico never told of what happened to the beast now it seemed she knew the hatred in their eyes grew all the more frightening jerico lives she said at the citadel to the south training more like me how many of your kind wait for us when we cross waiting they had a few boats patrolling the rigon barely covering a few dozen miles of land ever since the citadel fell theyd relied on the elves to fill in the gaps but with the orcs conquering of the east even that had ceased theres no one waiting she said i promise no one else knows ofofall this other than dieredon of course but she didnt need to say that theyd all seen him escape on sonowins back you lie the wolf with the white around his eyes said his lips pulled back in a growl exposing enormous yellow teeth no she insisted fear clutching her throat no please i dont then what good are you to us you know nothing of man nothing of his armies nothing of what awaits us his claws were reaching for her when silverear called for him to stop hold your temper moonslayer the female said from the slender cave entrance the pair turned and the whiteeyed one sniffed her way it is no temper shaman he said i only seek a meal this human is worth nothing to us you are wrong silverear said shuffling closer she is everything the other races lose their patience and worse their trust what do we need of their trust asked the other i am manfeaster son of redclaw let them fear me instead we have already slaughtered many to cow their spirits should the goblins or birds grumble we will remind them of their fear you keep them here with fear but even fear will not be enough when we cross the river into the land beyond we must have something to make them listen something to make them trust you long enough for us to secure a strip of land and that is her moonslayer asked gesturing to jessilynn what does this runt know to help us she is but a child and lacks wisdom because of it it was so terrible sitting there listening to them describe her in such a way these were the beasts theyd been taught about in the citadel led to believe they were just vicious brutal eating machines to be thought of as lesser by these creatures as lacking any wisdom was humiliating she bears the weapons and armor of a man silverear said it does not matter if she is a child for just as our own cubs still bear teeth so too does she threaten us if we are not careful all the more reason to slash her throat manfeaster argued silverear came up behind them and at her beckoning moonslayer stepped back giving her room to kneel jessilynn curled her knees to her chest watching curious what the milkyeyed female wanted of her what was it about her that the shaman felt was so important twice we have crossed the river in my lifetime silverear said twice we were defeated by men with glowing weapons and silver armor your father was defeated those creatures youve cowed out there know this and stay only because of fear but if you can make them believe you if you can make them accept you as kings silverear rubbed a claw down the side of jessilynns face she flinched but the shamans touch was strangely gentle we hold one so similar to who defeated us before silverear said and you think she is nothing she stood turned to face the two humiliate her she said enslave her parade her before all the races and let them know we will not be stopped and her use does not stop there jessilynns heart was in her throat when the female turned her cold eyes on her you will deny nothing that we say she said only nod and accept my words do you understand me human if you do not then your mutilated body will serve our purpose just as well whatever defiant part of her that existed before that moment felt miniscule in the darkness stared down by strange bestial eyes ill say nothing she said good silverear turned to the others i will begin she said i trust you two to continue when i stop one wonders who the pack leader really is moonslayer said his voice carrying a hint of a growl i swore a promise to your father silverear said do as i say lest you insult his memory by preventing me from fulfilling his dying wish she walked to the entrance of the cave glanced back the time is upon us she said everything weve prepared for it happens now bring her and bring her bloodied the two wolfmen turned to her she felt the impulse to sob but she fought it down she would not weep before these monsters moonslayer lifted a hand and there was undeniable cruelty in his eyes bloodied he said if the shaman insists with shocking speed he slashed across her face she felt the claws tearing into her cheek ripping flesh the impact sent her slamming to the stone flooding the darkness with a sudden swirl of stars and light she felt blood dripping down her neck as well as her throat and reflexively she coughed her left hand brushed her cheek felt the flesh hanging like ribbons tears from the pain rolled down her face as manfeaster grabbed her neck and lifted her off the ground come brother he said carrying her as if she and her armor weighed nothing let us show the rabble our prize once outside the cave manfeaster slung her over his shoulder like she was one of the cattle theyd brought in the night before amid her delirium she saw the entrance to her cave saw her bow and arrows lying against the stone beside it she felt a desire to grab it not to kill others but to send an arrow through her lower jaw and into her skull this was torment this was the abyss sinful or not she couldnt help it not when she thought of what her face must look like not while it throbbed with unbearable pain dripping blood across the fur of her tormenter wolfmen gathered around them as silverear and the two brothers led the way toward the center of the ravine they parted easily enough only a few nipping back all eyes were on her and she closed her own so she would not have to see them she was only a curiosity not a threat on and on they walked until she was violently thrown to the ground the force of her head striking the dirt jarred her eyes open and she let out a cry moonslayer put his foot on her chest holding her down stay put he told her jessilynn nodded glancing around they were in the center of the ravine in a place sectioned off from the other camps every race had a place to be represented she saw from the goatmen to the birdmen to the diminutive goblins in the very middle of it all stood the twowolf men with silverear nearby the creatures howled and cursed one another but when silverear threw her head back and howled they quieted enough so they might hear her words all you monsters of the wedge she said turning so she might address the races you know why you are here you know of the land beyond the rivers rich with game with green grass and clear water it will be ours as it was in the days of old and it will happen because for the first time in an age we will be united we will be free we will serve kings kings of the vile roared the wolfmen and scattered among the other races were a few who took up a similar cry in times past we failed broken and alone silverear continued our greatest could not succeed for our enemies were strong but behold now their strongest the female was at jessilynns side instantly grabbing her arm and yanking her up so they might see her armor this said silverear this weakling is all that remains of they who once defeated redclaw where once they sent mighty warriors now they send whimpering girls where once they wielded swords and shields of light now only a flimsy stick of wood look at her all of you look upon the greatest mankind may throw against us our age has come the age of our kings louder now the wolfmen howled and their excitement seemed to be infectious jessilynn clenched her jaw determined to stay silent the shamans words insulted her but there was nothing she could do about it the idea of her being weaker inferior burned deep in her belly playing on fears shed carried since those earliest nights listening to jericos stories but that is not all silverear continued this human this girl knows everything she knows of the boats she knows of the towers she knows where the armies move against us and what evil magic they will try to use to keep us imprisoned in this wretched land this broken thing will tell us everything by the words of a single human we will crush all humans she turned to the two brothers nodding slightly so they might know she was finished moonslayer stepped forward beginning his speech with an earsplitting howl that seemed to go on forever we have no reason to be afraid he cried we have no reason to kill one another the strong must eat the weak but none here are weak it is the humans who are weak their flesh their hands their willit is weak and we will crush it together we will forge a kingdom of the vile and we will be your kings manfeaster jumped in his timing flawless we do not ask you to kneel he shouted to the other races we do not ask you to serve we only ask you follow us listen to us so that you may join us in this conquest let us together crush the humans and go to a land so fertile so grand that our kind will never go hungry again we are the sons of redclaw moonslayer roared not just us but all of us and together we will finish what he began jessilynn was too tired too delirious from the pain and blood loss to take in the cacophony that followed shed listened best she could her horror slowly fading into the background of her mind it was all too much the way the creatures looked at her the goatmen with their long faces the goblins with their strange unblinking gaze it was as if she were some entity from another world perhaps she was all of them stared with a hunger a sense of greed that she no longer wished to see your patience wears thin manfeaster told the throng so know that the time to act is now this pathetic human is the sign tomorrow we march for the river tomorrow let every human heart tremble with fear this more than anything whipped them into a frenzy the goatmen brayed the hyenamen yipped goblins laughed and clapped and the birdmen squawked over it all howled the wolfmen loudest and greatest of them all to your feet silverear said as the two kings began howling to continue the excitement before one loses control and tries to eat the shamans hand took her own and as if she were a child she was led back to the cave once inside she collapsed to the cold ground the bleeding of the wounds on her face had begun to slow but still the pain remained silverear stared at her then let out a soft grunt tied to her fur were thin strips of dried leather holding small pouches made from skin from within a pouch silverear pulled out a collection of leaves chew this she said offering them to her jessilynn put the leaves into her mouth then carefully bit down the gashes in her face made any movement agony the leaves were soft yet when she chewed they were horribly bitter her eyes watered and her chest heaved do not vomit the female said chew but do not swallow jessilynn did so striking the ground several times with her fist to help her concentrate at last the shaman reached out her paw spit she gladly did so silverear took the disgusting mush narrowed her eyes at it and then grunted again lie on your back jessilynn slowly settled down the ground feeling somehow comfortable despite its hardness more than anything she wanted to sleep a dim hope in her still clung to the idea that when she awoke in the morning everyone would be gone and instead dieredon would be there cooking her breakfast she closed her eyes slowed her breathing silverear pressed the wet glob against her cheek it was like salt poured into her open wounds and jessilynn let out a scream the female easily held her down growling at her stay still she snarled jessilynn did so even as the tears ran down the sides of her face more of the substance pressed against her cheek she gritted her teeth choking down sobs it burned like fire but after a moments time the sensation finally started to relent sleep here silverear said i will bring you food in the morning remember step outside this cave and i promise you nothing but death with that she was gone jessilynn breathed in breathed out as the din of roars and growls echoed inside the confines of the cave twenty thousand creatures all ready to feed theyd march west soon crossing the rigon and into the lands beyond how many innocents would die she couldnt begin to guess but the truth of it made her ache and who would stand against them would jerico be there no he was south in the citadel oblivious to the threat darius dead the other heroes of old all dead all gone the wall of towers was all that was left and jerico had made it clear what state theyd been in for years she doubted things had improved since the gods war the towers had fallen before retaken only with dariuss help but now now the only paladin to stand against them was her and she lay marred broken and weaponless worst of all she couldnt help but think it her fault it didnt make sense it didnt have to lost in her fear and pain it seemed so blatantly obvious her pride perhaps her desire to be better than others im sorry she prayed as she waited for exhaustion to claim her im sorry ashhur whatever i did to deserve this im so so sorry the only answer she received was blessed dreamless sleep they alternated turns summoning the shadow portals to take them south through it all qurrah remained silent his nerves never calming despite the fact they crept closer to kers border each passing moment what did a border matter to men with wings an acceptable loss he murmured as they camped that night acceptable ashhur help us all tessanna glanced at him and he saw the question in her eyes he shook his head still not wanting to talk about it more than anything he felt such an immense betrayal at the words he had heard when hed expected death when hed deserved it theyd denied it to him theyd declared him forgiven ever since then hed felt changed hed tried in his own meager way to better understand the mercy and grace ashhurs priests had preached oh he often felt he failed to live up to it but the concept had been there giving him hope giving him a glimpse of a future where he could sleep without the weight of a thousand corpses on his conscience more than anything he carried hope that it would not be karaks arms he went to upon his death he would not spend eternity in a darkness lit only by velixars glowing red eyes and now when he sought only to help only to repair he instead found the angels ready to give him the death theyd declared him free of all those years ago were not going to be safe tessanna said absently tossing kindling onto their fire azariah knows where we live you think they will come hunting for us tess shrugged i dont know you wont tell me everything so i must guess but somethings wrong i know that mordeina should have felt peaceful but instead it felt she shook her head struggling for the right words like everyone was holding their breath qurrah said yes like that like everyone must keep one eye on the sky qurrah thought of the paladins whod fought in ashhurs name now secluded in their citadel what would jerico think if he walked through those streets what would he have said if hed stood there in the middle of the angels council and saw them nodding as simple farmers asked for the death of their fellow man if they come for us youre right he said our home isnt safe then where is qurrah remembered king brams words when theyd last spoken at the bridge when antonils army had come marching we first refused to stand by brams side and condemn the angels he said i think i might be changing my mind qurrah had never been to the city of angkar and now that he had he wasnt impressed its walls were tall but veldarens had been taller and mordeina had multiple walls built close together to form brutal killing lanes there were no special defenses no significant battlements no the only thing that impressed qurrah about the seaport was that it had escaped the gods war so thoroughly unscathed when other countries and cities had fallen it had thrived which spoke to the careful manipulation of its ruler king bram henley the walls will mean nothing to men with wings tessanna said taking in the city beside him from the worn road leading to the main gates its not the walls qurrah said its who owns them if were under brams protection and angels come for us itd mean war harruq wont let that happen what if he doesnt have a choice qurrah shook his head then all the more reason for us to be careful she fell silent as they walked down the road as if deep in thought qurrah held her hand squeezed it tight must we kill them she suddenly asked who the angels she nodded qurrah sighed i fear we might i dont want to kill them im scared to he frowned at his lover scared why she shook her head and with the way she regressed into herself he knew he would receive no answer so instead he lifted her hand to his lips and kissed her fingers the most immediate thing they noticed when stepping through the walls was the smell it was of salt sea and fish damp wood and overgrown moss it was vibrant if a bit overwhelming tessanna seemed to love it though inhaling deep and smiling it was good to see and qurrah grinned despite the stench its alive here she said so unlike mordeina qurrah shrugged mordeina smelled better she winked at him but did not counter the traffic was light and merchants called to them from both sides of the road qurrah meant to ignore them but tessanna drifted away she looked over the food and trinkets saying nothing only drinking it all in with her eyes like a child thought qurrah despite his impatience he let her go from booth to booth a darkness had settled over her the past few months he knew that what he didnt know was why so anything that chased it away anything that brought out the joy he knew was buried deep within her was something he would encourage at last she returned to qurrah a guilty expression on her face i was bad she said the man gave me a shrimp because i was pretty hardly that bad qurrah said taking her hand so they might resume walking toward brams castle i might have leaned forward before asking for a taste very far forward qurrah rolled his eyes youre insufferable you suffer well enough you say as you lean forward he laughed and she squeezed his hand the castle had three tall towers rising from the corners of its walls two of them were plain enough though the third easily stood out from the others from what qurrah had learned of the city when first moving into the west years ago that tower was known as the eye its door was a deep crimson oversized and bolted shut with a blatantly exaggerated lock above the door were ten skulls carved out of stone leering down as if mocking anyone who might seek to enter all three towers had guards stationed outside plus the main castle gate figuring the direct approach to be the best qurrah walked up to the guards at the gate and bowed low in respect ive come to speak with your king he said my name is qurrah tun sure you are said one of the two snickering at him and im a bloody angel the guard looked to his comrade as if to share a laugh then saw the wideeyed look he was getting when he turned back to qurrah his mouth dropped open a little you mean hehes i am qurrah he said now either sprout wings or find your king begging your pardon said the other but hes in the eye were never to disturb him when hes in the eye qurrah sighed and without waiting for their permission he began walking alongside the castle wall toward the great red doors of the eye the guards hesitated then rushed after him tessanna remained at his side and she giggled you scare people so easily she said one of the few benefits of our reputation i guess i just think its your glare we cant let you go in the guard said moving as if to cut in front of them yet still too frightened to do so so instead he kept stepping in and out of their way as bothersome as a fly im not going in qurrah said calm yourself this had the opposite effect then what are you going to do qurrah stared up at the eye noticing its various windows all of them constructed of stained and colored glass to hide whatever happened within still the glass would be thin enough for them to hear putting magic into his voice he cried out his words like that of a bellowing giant king bram qurrah tun requests your presence the two guards whod been stationed before the eye drew their weapons as the two from before clutched their ears and winced tessanna meanwhile just laughed first mordeina now here she said i think guards everywhere will soon hate us drop your weapons the first guard shouted to the others king bram named him friend at the bloodbrick they looked far from convinced but thankfully the great red doors cracked open and out stepped the king himself qurrah let out a sigh of relief how nice to be his brother who was cheered as a hero everywhere he went qurrah doubted harruq had to endure terrified guards every time he tried to visit someone i expected your return months later bram said did you change your mind about traveling to mordeina sparrows dream of traveling as fast as us tessanna said and she curtseyed to the king but we did indeed change our minds brams eyes sparkled for a moment no doubt hoping he interpreted tesss speech correctly qurrah took her hand then gestured to the tower we would like a word with you he said in private come inside the eye bram said i assure you there is no more private place in all of dezrel mildly curious about the interior of the overexaggerated tower qurrah nodded his head then followed bram through the doors directly before them was a single staircase looping upward through the low ceiling they climbed the stairs emerging onto the lone floor of the entire tower this ceiling stretched high above them and decorating the massive wall space were hundreds of paintings they showed men fighting angels demons trolls orcs and even a few creatures qurrah had never seen put to drawing in every image qurrah realized it was men who fought them never the monsters against one another torches burned at regular intervals which combined with the various stained glass windows ensured each painting was given visibility in the center of the room was a large wooden table the wood wellaged carved in perfect detail atop it was a map of the world of dezrel forgive the theatrical nature of the place bram said as he took a seat before the enormous table but the walls are sheer inside and out which leaves no place for spies no ears at these walls not even those of an angel so speak your mind tessanna wandered over to the table admiring the map her fingers drifted over a representation of the elethan mountains her fingertips brushing their pointed tops painted a snowy white they dont need to hear us tessanna said absently just find us im not sure i understand bram said qurrah took a seat beside his wife the chair felt slightly oversized leaving him feeling like a dwarf he frowned but ignored it you were right about mordan he said things there are foul and over the few days we spent in mordeina they turned all the fouler how so bram asked assassins made an attempt on my brothers family wellpaid assassins that even after death i could learn nothing from as for the angels qurrah sighed not wanting to get into it but knowing he had no choice before he could tessanna interrupted this map isnt right anymore she said staring keenly at the northwestern corner my dear this map is older than my fathers father but i assure you weve kept its borders and representations very precise over the years bram said its still wrong she slid around the side then placed her hand atop of the carved city of mordeina her eyes flared wide and after a few words of magic her hand began to glow bram tensed but remained seated qurrah watched merely curious he sensed no real anger from tessanna just a vague unease when the spell enacted he understand why rising from the wood was a small city glowing entirely out of light it hovered above mordeina a shimmering replication of the golden city of avlimar its light shone across the entirety of the west casting long shadows forgive me bram said it does appear my map was incomplete without avlimar it never will be tessanna said you cant forget its there you cant remove it the angels are coming and they will not care that you are a king bram snapped to attention coming here why he stared at the two of them and it seemed his mood improved despite his breathless words theyre coming for you arent they i dont know qurrah said slumping in his chair and rubbing his forehead but i fear they will the people of the north are demanding retribution wanting nothing to do with penance and forgiveness for murderers and thieves and in mordan theres no better known murderer than i you promised us protection if we needed it and now we are here for just that will you give us shelter youd have me spill blood to protect you bram asked if it must come to that qurrah said the king stood walked around the table so he might put a hand on qurrahs shoulder you are a citizen of my nation he said i care not where you were born but from now on your roots are here your home is here and i promise you from the highest noble to the lowliest serf no man of my kingdom will be subjected to the angels judgment not during my reign from below they heard the heavy rumbling of the door opening following by it shutting the three turned to see an older knight come noisily up the stairs without saying a word he grabbed a pitcher from a side table filled a tall cup and then plopped into a chair beside qurrah the halforc recognized him but could not quite place the face no word yet from the east your grace the newcomer said ive kept our soldiers on alert just in case since theres no telling when antonil will be making his way back to our borders for all we know the first orc army he meets will whip his behind and send him crawling back to us might not have more than a day or twos notice if were to meet him at ashhurs bridge bram chuckled gestured to the man as he guzzled down his drink qurrah tessanna meet my most trusted knight sir ian millar charmed ian said tipping his cup i hope this man wont be the one put in charge of protecting us qurrah said offering a wry smile otherwise i might try to steal away his cup so theres a chance of him remaining sober just try it halforc ian said well see just how much your reputations been inflated thats enough of that bram said ian these two will be our guests for the next few weeks they suspect angels might be coming for them and this is something that must not be allowed is that so ian said raising an eyebrow how politely are we to tell the angels to piss off with flowery words or with lowborn gestures and swears with a sword bram said darkening ians mood he finished off his cup then set it down atop the representation of veldaren aye he said i can do that if you two would follow me ill show you to your rooms other than brams own quarters theres no safer place in this castle will there be windows tessanna asked as they stood ian paused scratched at his face hrm perhaps i need to rethink just where the safest place is the safest place was far from what qurrah expected but he could not deny the logic the accommodations however could have been better now i know a dungeons not the finest smelling of places ian said as servants rushed all around him but theres no windows and only one entrance which well have guarded at all times tales of your kings generosity will spread for miles qurrah said as he watched two servants haul in a feathered mattress theyd swept and cleaned the cell best they could though nothing would ever remove the lingering dingy feel of the place their only light was from a small torch on the opposite side of the hallway still the sheets and bed were soft and both qurrah and tess had stayed in far worse conditions it should ian said given all hes risking for you two to be honest im not sure youre worth it risk qurrah asked he risks the lives of a few guards surely any king can risk that qurrah tessanna said touching his arm ian glanced at the servants then snapped his fingers they hustled out the room mostly furnished the two nearby cells had also been emptied and cleaned the prisoners moved deeper into the dungeon behind one of the many doors that helped separate the various blocks your girl gets it ian said once the servants were gone he leaned against the bars and crossed his arms have you thought about what will happen if angels do come demanding you and we refuse theyll either leave or youll kill them qurrah said as if it were obvious true ian said but think long term for a moment just try itll be war tessanna said quietly terrible brutal war a war i dont see us winning ian said at least not as we are perhaps if you two lived up to your various legends we might stand a chance but wed be going up against the might of the angels plus mordeinas far larger army you were at the bloodbrick you saw their show of might might currently spent fighting orcs qurrah argued aye ian said and just imagine how quickly theyd turn back around if they heard rumors of war you two coming here puts us all in danger im not one to complain my life is on the line pretty much every day i put on this armor but if youre going to stay here if youre going to let my men die to protect you from some winged maniacs all im asking for is a little appreciation qurrah bowed his head my apologies he said i should better control my tongue i am thankful for all you do and pray that our time here in this dungeon will be long and uneventful ian nodded his head then pushed off from the bars much better he tossed them an iron ring heres the keys to the cell just in case you need to lock yourselves in angels might be strong but i doubt theyll be breaking open bars with their bare hands try to stay in here as much as you can but youre free to walk around the city at your leisure servants will come to see if you need anythingfood drink whatever other than that enjoy your stay ive got some patrols to schedule he left the heavy door to the dungeon slamming shut with a bang qurrah stood in the center of their cell feeling as if his feet were bolted in place war he said softly as tessanna flung herself onto the bed is that really what we create by coming here dont blame yourself tessanna said stretching out on her back if it wasnt us itd be someone else you heard bram he wont let a single man or woman be judged and over the past years im sure many who were spared the angels wrath have crossed the corinth into kers lands pale comfort qurrah muttered but comfort nonetheless he joined her on the bed and tessanna curled her body into his her face pressed against his chest and her eyes closed slowly he brushed her long hair his mind far away tess he whispered can you sense the angels after a long pause she nodded theyre not like men she said they burn in my mind if i let it wander qurrah knew he should ask but he was frightened to taking a deep breath he let it out then asked anyway do you sense angels coming toward us another long pause yes how many she curled tighter against him kissed his neck enough she whispered tessanna watched her lover sleep and wished she could do the same he lay half dressed the result of their lovemaking despite all that had happened he looked peaceful for that she was jealous in her mind the voices whispered you turned against me you betrayed me for a god that will never love you never forgive you his angels come and they carry not a crown in their hands but a sword you ran from me and you now run from them who is left qurrah who is left tessanna balled her fists clenching her jaw so tightly it bared her teeth youre a dead god she whispered your priests are scattered your paladins in hiding all faith in you is broken she never expected an answer but it seemed karaks dim voice heard she felt unseen eyes turn to her felt her presence finally acknowledged it sent a chill down her spine she who had long existed under the watchful eyes of the goddess so too were ashhurs followers broken in a time not so distant the world changes daughter of balance you above all should understand it can change again the presence vanished the oppressive weight on her chest lifting only to be replaced by another presence that burned in her mind like fireflies the angels had arrived the sound of shouting awoke qurrah from his slumber his eyes snapped open his mind immediately alert grabbing his clothes he began to dress when he saw tessanna sitting at the foot of the bed already awake he was hardly surprised no doubt shed sensed the angels presence long before they actually arrived have they landed yet he asked her i dont know her voice was calm emotionless but there were tears running down her face feeling strangely guilty for them he kissed both her cheeks then held her close together we can withstand anything he told her anything she smiled up at him and he pulled her to her feet where are we going she asked qurrah shook his head i wont cower in here while others die for me if theres to be a fight then i will be a part of it he wrapped his whip around his arm its tightening weight a comfort to him done he stepped out from the cell and climbed the stairs leading to the dungeons exit to his surprise he found it locked from the outside he beat his fist against it calling out to the guards on the other side let us out forgive me a man shouted i have orders not to qurrah groaned that stupid bastard it seems he knows you better than you thought tessanna said and a smile flickered briefly on her face before qurrah could ponder ways of smashing the door open a voice rang out despite the thick walls of the dungeon he heard it clear as day leaving him certain that it was some sort of clerical or divine magic qurrah tun cried an instantly familiar voice our council has convened we have capitulated to mans law recognizing mankinds authority to rule themselves as ashhur has granted come forth and accept your fate with dignity and grace dignity qurrah snorted what a damn fool his bluster was fake and it was obvious tess knew it as well that voice that powerful intimidating voice only belonged to one angel judarius the most dangerous of all when it came to combat qurrah pressed his ear to the door for he heard a faint shouting in response that of sir ian get your bloodyass wings off our land you pompous piece of duck shit youre not welcome here qurrahs staying youre leaving that clear there was a long pause this is your last chance judarius shouted qurrah i beg of you come forth no man must die needlessly this night will you let others suffer and bleed for naught war qurrah thought this moment will spark war i can stop it i can be the hero my brother has always been he almost did just that but something stopped him the thought of kneeling before the angels and presenting his neck filled him with sickness that wasnt a noble sacrifice that was just death pointless meaningless death worse it felt like spitting in the eye of ashhur for all hed been given he couldnt do that he wouldnt open this door qurrah told the guard on the other side im under orders to open it or i destroy it the door opened and qurrah stepped out tessanna at his side stretching out before them was a great courtyard the dungeon located just within the castles outer walls filling the courtyard were over two hundred soldiers with even more rushing in from the city hovering in the air their bodies clad in shining golden armor were over thirty angels their swords and spears were drawn tips glistening looking hungry in the night sky in the center of the angels formation flew judarius his enormous mace hanging loose in his right hand with their departure from the dungeon the angels attention turned his way he felt dozens of eyes upon him and it made his skin crawl still he stepped forward refusing to be cowed here i am qurrah said get back inside sir ian shouted qurrah ignored him im here he said instead right here but i dont accept your judgment i dont accept your execution you arent on the side of righteousness judarius none of you are fly away fly now its your souls these deaths will weigh upon not mine judariuss body dipped up and down as his wings beat the air he stared at qurrah and behind those goldgreen eyes a battle raged so be it the angel said and with those soft words the courtyard erupted in chaos five of the angels dove for qurrah with the rest attempting to cover either side of their flank preventing the soldiers from closing in behind the assault feeling his whip tighten hungrily qurrah summoned his magic a grim smile on his face this was what he was best at not hiding not politics an enemy was before him seeking to challenge his strength life or death it was now in his hands hands which burned with purple fire as he raised them to the heavens violet orbs shot out two dozen of them swarming with flames the five angels banked and curved avoiding death one failed his wing clipped by an orb it burst in a great explosion flames bathing over his body and sending him crashing to the ground the rest were almost there and qurrah dove to avoid their slashes tessanna however appeared to have no intention of hiding taking in a deep breath she let loose with a shriek so loud it seemed the very air roiled with it flee it hit the angels like a physical force two slamming into the ground the other two banking upward far away from them qurrah lashed a grounded angel with his whip charring black his golden breastplate the angel endured and he blocked the second lash with his vambrace sword drawn he rushed forward another lash wrapped around the angels foot trying to trip him up but a flutter of his wings kept him steady sword lunging for qurrahs chest it seemed nothing would stop him so qurrah clapped his hands not bothering to his body became shadow for the briefest of moments just long enough for the angel to pass straight through him the being spun about reacting well to the ploy but tessanna was the faster she leapt forward her hand touching the feathers of his wings she said nothing only smiled as fire spread across white feathers the look upon her face was chilling even to qurrah as a horrible scream escaped the angels throat the angel slashed at tessanna a valiant last attempt as his body burned tessanna ducked underneath the sword stepped closer and pushed against him his armor cracked blasted as if struck by a great maul the angel flew back landed with a crash and lay still stand firm he heard sir ian screaming above the din stand firm hold your lines the angels had switched tactics looping up and around to make simultaneous passes from opposite directions as qurrah watched a dozen angels slashed through the gathered soldiers their weapons easily puncturing their armor before the men could strike back the angels were already lifting into the air propelled upward by a simple twist of their wings tens of men lay dead from the pass and tens more died as the angels repeated the maneuver soldiers continued to flood in from the outer city but it seemed they were dying as quickly as they came we have to stop them qurrah said you can judarius said landing on the ground before him with a thud his enormous mace left a small crater in the stone surrender now no more must die can you handle him tessanna asked her eyes still locked on the combat beyond i can try qurrah said tessanna kissed his cheek then rushed around judarius to where the greater battle raged judarius met his eyes and his gaze was clearly pained we mustnt do this judarius said angels and men are dying by your orders the angel shook his head i wont debate this with you your magic is powerful qurrah but against me you are nothing spare the lives of others qurrah laughed living shadows gathering in the palms of his hands the only life you can spare is your own he said my brother defeated you once do not think me incapable of the same the corner of judariuss face twitched as if holding back a smile he opened his mouth to speak but then rushed forward instead the sudden action nearly ended the fight before it began qurrah slammed his wrists together desperately pouring his power into a physical shield of swirling darkness the mace smashed into it showering the two with yellow sparks qurrah braced himself felt the impact all the way down to his knees teeth clenched he let his full strength roll out of him he was not a weakling he was not some inferior power compared to harruq hed broken the prophet compared to velixar judarius was just a bigger beefier version of his brother the mace slashed again and qurrah blocked it as before this time the impact was not so severe the halforcs feet firmly planted his spell strong enough to send the mace flying backward qurrah took advantage of the temporary reprieve dashing toward one of the dead angels he had only a moments breath of time but it was enough to close the distance sliding to his feet he slammed his fists against the body flooding it with power bones tore from the flesh snapping free of the ligaments and cartilage holding them and they hovered in the air like a tornado they swirled around him each one shimmering violet judarius swung but when his mace connected with one it was as if he struck a wall of stone the shockwave rolled over them both qurrah smirked a big man with a club he said is that all you are touching the corpse again this time he ignited the blood with a sweeping motion he pulled massive amounts of it into the air flinging it at judarius like a wave the blood caught fire lighting up the night judarius moved faster than anticipated though avoiding the attack sizzling the blood splashed across the ground charring everything it touched before qurrah could strike again judarius began to dodge he didnt quite fly but he used his wings to keep himself in perpetual motion swirling around qurrah with incredible speed twice qurrah flung bolts of darkness but his aim was never accurate enough youre wrong judarius said continuing his maneuvers i am no man his mace struck again the entire angels might behind it the bone shield cracked and broke turning the various pieces into powder and flinging qurrah through the air he bit his tongue as he jostled and bounced after landing seemingly taking forever to come to a halt judarius flew closer lifting the mace again no said the angel im something better then prove it down came the mace and up came qurrahs hands more of his magical power poured out slowly draining his reserve his mind had begun its familiar ache and he found it increasingly difficult to concentrate the shield surrounded him protected him but this time the shadows cracked like thawing ice he screamed demanded himself to be stronger judarius pressed down on him with incredible strength did the war god ever possess such might the shield shattered and the resulting shockwave sent him to the ground gasping for air his ears rang his vision blurred coughing he glanced up at the rest of the conflict the angels continued to circle but their attacks had grown less frequent every time they tried to assault tessanna was there flooding the sky with fire and lightning you fight valiantly judarius said his footfalls heavy but this is at an end on your knees so you may die with dignity if your soul is pure you have nothing to fear ashhur will still take you into his arms qurrah rolled onto his back laughing blood filled his mouth staining his teeth you truly believe this dont you he asked you actually think youre doing his will judarius lifted his mace i pray you know peace he said before he could slam it down qurrah hooked his fingers into twisting shapes enacting a spell he became shadow but instead of having the weapon pass through him he passed through the very ground below him was the sprawling dungeon and with a cry he landed hard onto the floor of a cell for a moment he felt afraid to look for if hed rematerialized in the wrong place such as between two walls thered be nothing he could do but he felt no pain and it seemed a bit of luck was with him when hed cast the spell hed fully expected to end up with prison bars piercing parts of his body groaning he pushed himself to his feet he was in the empty section near the entrance though when he tried the door he found it locked taking out the key ian had given him he tested it on the lock sure enough it opened the skeleton key usable on all cells within that section what now qurrah wondered aloud he looked to the entrance of the dungeon curious how long itd take judarius to figure out where he was it turned out not long at all the hinges twisted the center of the iron door bowing inward two more hits and it blasted open judarius stood in the jagged breach mace held in both hands he looked annoyed you would be a coward judarius asked folding his wings inward so he might descend the stairs into the underground dungeon the life you have the very breath you take was a gift from ashhur through azariahs hands for even one of your crimes you should have been hanged yet we showed mercy but the world is not ready for this mercy qurrah the world doesnt know how to live without abusing everything even things most pure your death is only a small step toward a greater peace on dezrel can you not accept this and accept the returning of your gift seems to belittle the gift if you ask me qurrah said judarius sighed as he passed by the cells the sides of his wings brushing against the bars if only azariah were here he would make you understand he would know how to explain it for one as wise as you but me well i command armies i crush my enemies this is your last chance qurrah your last chance to do something good qurrah knew there was nowhere else to go so he stood firm preparing one last desperate gamble because of the bars judarius could not dodge or maneuver hands together qurrah pulled at the well of his energy sapping every last bit of it it had been so long since hed fought and he felt himself tiring prematurely failing to live up to what he knew he could be he prayed that what he did next would be enough it had to be a beam of pure darkness shot from his palms the very center of it swirling with stars and moons and things for which qurrah had no name judarius saw the attack and braced the thick head to his mace in the way the two connected and the angel let out a cry the muscles in his legs tightened and he pushed forward step by agonizing step the magic hit the mace and splintered unable to continue on against the eternityforged weapon still qurrah poured his power outward continuing the spell challenging judarius to withstand step after step each one a trial but withstand he did his mace slammed into qurrahs gut he let out a whimper collapsing onto his back judarius put a foot atop his chest holding him in place with such weight that he struggled to breathe the mace lifted in the air so selfish said the angel thats all youve ever been judarius the angel flinched and qurrah twisted so he might see what was happening there in the entrance of the dungeon stood ahaesarus his sword in hand let him go he said theres been enough death this night the council will convene again ahaesarus said taking another step release him slowly the mace lowered and judarius cast a look to qurrah that he could not interpret if you insist judarius said he removed his foot and the halforc gasped in air ahaesarus stepped into the cell qurrah had opened so judarius might pass then approached qurrah slumped on his knees still struggling to recover qurrah the angel started to say get out qurrah said his voice raspy i dont want to hear a word ahaesarus stared at him with genuine sadness in his eyes i will honor your request he said and then he turned exiting the dungeon qurrah rubbed his raw throat with a shivering hand and wondered what madness was going on in avlimar slowly he made his way to the dungeon entrance stumbled up the stairs and exited through the broken door before him the courtyard was a horrific sight over a hundred men lay dead their bodies pierced by spears and cut open by frighteningly sharp swords scattered among them were the corpses of angels a third of those that had come to claim him ians soldiers gathered at the gates of the castle where king bram had emerged after the battle halted so far it seemed no one spoke to the other the two sides just remaining in place king of ker ahaesarus shouted flying to join his fellow angels what was done here was our own fault not of mordan and her rulers i ask that you forgive the rashness that led to such deaths and know that we will do all we can to make this right my men are dead bram shouted back attacked in the night so you could capture a man under my protection how do you make that right ahaesarus paused i do not know he said but we will find a way let there be no need for war no army will march your way and no angel will disrespect your borders again bram hardly looked convinced but he said nothing without any fanfare the angels turned and rose into the air their wings sending them far into the distance within moments qurrah let out a sigh and he leaned against the door frame of the dungeon closing his eyes he waited for the pounding behind his eyes to cease but it seemed silence would not be his all around he heard shouting men hustling about bram spoke to him not long after having walked his way i knew they would come for you eventually he said dont worry our army is already prepared to march should mordans army declare war my brother would never do such a thing he said in the distance he caught sight of tessanna through the chaos and it made him strangely nervous leave us he said not caring that he gave an order to a king bram took a step back seeming surprised by the anger in his voice careful halforc bram said but he turned to the rest of his men and shouted the order to the barracks i want us ready to march by sunrise if need be grieve now prepare now well bury the dead come the morning light the king glanced his way but qurrah ignored him instead he weaved through the bloody fallout of the battle stepping over the dead so he might reach his lover tessanna sat on her knees the body of an angel straddled across her lap her fingers stroked his face as if he were her own child long black hair cascaded down her shoulders settling over his body like a shroud the ache in her eyes was almost painful for qurrah to witness for a long while he said nothing just watched the soldiers hurry to and fro until at last the courtyard was empty but for them and the dead tess he said breaking the silence theyre beautiful she said trembling fingers brushing the angels cheek so beautiful we had no choice she looked up tears in her eyes you think i dont know that she asked theyre lost theyre broken yet theyre still divine theyre a glorious light and its blinding us all qurrah knelt beside her offering her his hand she ignored it whats wrong he asked her what bothers you so tessanna let her hair hide her face her voice dropped down to a whisper i should have let them kill us she said i know that now the world would be better for it frustration bubbled up in qurrahs chest no he said no you shouldnt have id give my life for something good tess my belief in ashhur its tentative its fragile but i still feel something there something worthwhile but this no id die for harruq id die for his family and id die for you i gave my life at that bridge for men who rightfully wished for me to suffer but i will not die for nothing thats all this would be thats what these angels brought with their blades nothing and thats why theyre wrong he offered her a hand but still she refused you dont understand tessanna said what am i qurrah what was i born for i and my mirror we were both born for balance mira killed an ancient demon she fought against us and died distracting thulos saving hundreds of lives she was my mirror my opposite in everything she was light she was good me she laughed qurrah touched her shoulder and she yanked it violently away im a danger she said to you to me to the entire damn world youre not qurrah insisted trying to keep calm what was happening to her why was the madness rising so quickly in her eyes shed been better over the past few yearshadnt she how can you know because your power has faded tess you played your role in the gods war this is what celestia wanted is it tessanna asked and she laughed again the sound of it sent a chill crawling up qurrahs spine she was breaking before him he realized and he felt helpless to stop it tessanna let the angel slip from her arms and slowly she stood do you know what i felt when i killed ashhurs angels she asked what he dared ask in answer she lifted her arms a wind blew swirling in from nowhere the darkness in her eyes grew pushing away any hint of whiteness her head tilted to one side and when she spoke her voice was filled with torment power from her back grew enormous ethereal wings the feathers made of shadow and dust they stretched further and further greater than hed ever seen before a dress of pure darkness formed about her clothing her as if she were a queen from a plane far beyond their own the wind howled swirling around her teasing her hair flapping her dress within its fabric he saw stars dance slowly her wings lifted her into the air qurrah stood before her feeling so small so confused deep down he knew he was losing her and nothing else mattered compared to that tess he screamed trying to gain her attention she looked down at him but it was as if she didnt know who he was i can see it she told him i can see the golden star breaking i can feel the world groaning taste the rivers of blood on my tongue and i can stop it no qurrah screamed this isnt you this isnt who you are youre not a puppet youre not their slave with a thought tessanna said her voice deep yet strangely hollow i sense it qurrah that city of gold and pearl everything to follow i can crush right now the seed must be ripped from the soil the world must be spared from what comes next no damn it qurrah rushed her demanding her presence refusing to wilt before the tremendous power he sensed building within his love remember who you are he screamed up at her you dont have to do this you arent evil you arent the destroyer let it go tess let it go she continued staring north seeing things that were far beyond his sight her outstretched hand trembled and the ground trembled with it tears ran down her face and her lower lip quivered the empty look on her face then changed replaced with terrible sorrow i can stop it she said her voice more her own please qurrah let me stop it let me destroy while i still can mother wants me to bring back the darkness never again qurrah said feeling his heart pounding in his ribcage let it all go her arms curled around her chest and she bent over as if shed been stabbed in the belly her wings fluttered flared out wide and then exploded in a frantic eruption of fading feathers a scream tore from tessannas very soul and she arched her back her head snapping violently from side to side the dress of stars and darkness vanished replaced by her own and then she fell qurrah caught her in his arms collapsing onto his rear beneath her weight cradling her he cried rocking back and forth as he clutched his beloved to his chest time resumed as if the whole world had paused to witness their spectacle no more he whispered no more we wont play their games tessannas eyes fluttered open when she looked up at him he saw love in them and he nearly broke down again im sorry she said pressing her face against his robe im so sorry she cried and he held her and all alone they endured by day the orcs lurked in the distance baiting them daring them to separate their numbers by night came the raids never at the same time and never from the same direction it was enough to drive tarlak mad well never make it to angelport he said as he stood in the center of their enormous camp beneath the blackened sky by ashhur i dont even think well make it halfway sergan stood beside him shaking his head as a cry of alarm came from the south the third in the past hour id celebrate just making it another day he said as they ran toward the call tarlak knew itd be over before he got there it almost always was they arrived amid the confusion with dozens of soldiers readying swords and shields all around were their tents gaping holes in the tops many with spears still jutting from the fabric despite the commotion no combat took place the orcs having already fled it took little time to find out what happened orcs had taken out the guards with arrows then a large group had rushed the camp throwing spears from a distance before retreating all in all theyd lost only seven men but that wasnt the raids purpose the men were afraid to sleep constantly roused by their hit and runs by day they marched in a desperate attempt to reach angelport and by night they suffered the raids tarlak looked to antonils large tent in the distance feeling like there were stones in his gut we wont make it the wizard whispered as a fourth alarm sounded from the north you damn fool the following morning tarlak sat before his tent legs crossed beneath him and ate his meager gruel normally hed have whipped himself up something more appetizing via magical means but his supply of topaz was low and worse he didnt want to feast so fine in front of all the other exhausted men itd been one thing on their march out wellsupplied and in good spirits now thoughnow he ate the mush and wondered how long itd take before he opened himself a portal and fled west despite his odd garb and reputation as a wizard tarlak tended to be on the popular side but not that morning no one wanted jokes no one wanted anecdotes and stories of faraway places so used to his newfound privacy tarlak was surprised when sergan plopped down before him his own bowl of food in hand at last he said i thought id never get to eat you here for company tarlak asked raising an eyebrow here hoping no one thinks to look for me next to the oddball wizard tarlak shrugged fair enough i can cast an illusion spell over you if youd like turn you into a buxom lady should buy you at least an hour sergan said something indecipherable with his full mouth tarlak assumed it was a colorful way of saying no suit yourself he said leaning his chin on his hand and looking to their destination in the far distance was a set of hills and once they crossed over them it was nothing but flat grasslands until they reached angelport hunting would go down hurting the armys already dwindling supplies tarlak tried to think of an upside got nothing so he set his bowl aside and watched sergan eat we need to change his mind he said good luck sergan said wiping at his beard ive never seen him like this even when we were fleeing the war demons he was never this determined what set him off sergan wolfed down another spoonful of gruel i dont like to say things i dont know for certain especially about my king but if you were to press me id say pride all those years ago we were running for our lives doing everything we could to hold together and protect our people but now hes a king hes got a legacy hes got tens of thousands of soldiers lords have been hanging all over him and his reputation in mordeina is in the shitter he wants this he needs this to go back home unable to capture veldaren a second time another spoonful i think hed stomach this gruel better than he would that bad a failure of course its pride thought tarlak as he let out a sigh pride the one thing that couldnt be reasoned or bargained with he looked to the hills trying to convince himself that angelport really wasnt that far away a faint speck made him frown he cast a spell to improve his eyes making them sharper than an eagles what he saw made him curse well enough to impress a veteran like sergan what is it he asked tarlak enhanced the spell and only the sheer audacity of the attack kept him from panicking in fact it left him vaguely amused get the men ready for battle now he said ill keep us alive until then keep us alive what in karaks hairy codpiece do you mean and then the first dozen stones catapulted into the air from the far hillside while sergan swore up a storm tarlak summoned his magic his mind racing for a solution a magical shield would endure too much strain against so many especially with both the weight of the stones and the enormous space hed have to cover shattering each individually would take too much time wind would do nothing that left him one option smacking them right back out of the way he shouted and ripped chunks of the ground around him hoping he didnt accidentally fling one of the soldiers with them he hurled the pieces into the air doing his best to track the downward velocity of the enemy projectiles one after another he threw them the midair collisions shattering rock and dirt across the hillside with much of it raining down upon the army still far better they be pieces of broken stone than ones the size of a tent of the twelve he stopped ten and he did his best to ignore the casualties the remaining two caused as they crashed through their ranks with unrelenting speed like bees with their hive struck the army rushed to prepare scurrying about grabbing shields and swords meanwhile rows of orcs scurried over the hills tarlak stopped estimating after the second thousand more and more rushed over and with a ferocious cry they charged the hill increasing the speed of their assault tarlak wanted to give them an oldfashioned wizardly greeting preferably with fire but couldnt as twelve more stones shot over the hill the catapults just barely visible even with his enhanced eyesight one caterpillar two caterpillar three caterpillar four tarlak said as he flung more chunks of earth come on you can do better than that the exclamation was to himself as he watched three make it past his defenses the orcs slammed into the hastily prepared line numbering at least five thousand and tarlak watched another volley of twelve boulders soar into the air his mind focused he hurled more chunks of earth the area around him looking like a great carved groove all twelve he shoved aside killing their momentum or shattering them entirely he let out a cry wishing he could see the faces of the orcs as they watched their ambush falter and then another twenty catapults rolled over the hillside on creaking wooden wheels tarlak scratched at his goatee shit over thirty stones hurled into the air and tarlak found himself glad that they couldnt see his face his arms were a blur curling and throwing the movements helping to focus his mind giving up on using real earth he started hurling great balls of ice from his palms conjuring matter out of nothing was a greater tax on his strength but he couldnt afford to delay in a great barrage they flew every which way some missing some connecting ice shards fell upon the army as the stones slammed through tents and snapped bones bouncing and rolling as to make a mockery of antonils growing lines of soldiers get up the damn hill tarlak screamed using magic to increase the volume of his voice antonils soldiers were swarming toward the front and despite the casualties and lack of preparation they still outnumbered the orcs nearly five to one they surged ahead trying to push through to the hill beyond where they could attack the catapults tarlak let out a whoop then took in a deep breath as another volley unleashed whoever commanded the orcs tarlak knew the man had them working doubletime loading and releasing those enormous stones as boulders and rocks fell from the sky he wished he could see himself from afar it had to be impressive he laughed as the stones shattered laughed as he felt himself slowing with every spell the catapulted stones landing all around him only a few missing due to so many men packed into such a small area thats enough tarlak thought as antonils army gave chase up the hill nearing the halfway mark in the short reprieve between attacks he cast a spell gathering power above the hillcrest great blasts of lightning tore through the orcs working there splintering three of the catapults tarlak let out a gasp afterward and deep in his forehead he felt a throbbing could really use you here harruq tarlak said thinking of the last time theyd had to deal with orc catapults with a wind spell hed sent harruq and haern over a great chasm letting the two expert fighters slaughter the defenseless orcs what hed give to have either of them with him now more heavy stones tarlak tried to predict which were the most accurate and therefore do the most damage flexing his fingers he gripped the stones in his mind and crushed them to powder it was a far slower process but a more certain way to counter he was only able to stop six that time the rest crashing down all throughout the emptying camp tarlak watched the fight hoping antonils men would reach the catapults before another volley that hope died when the orcs in flight suddenly turned and charged joining them were several thousand more that appeared over the hill obviously kept in reserve for such an occasion as tarlaks eyes widened he saw groups of a thousand coming around the far left and right flanks the orcs running as fast as their bulky legs could carry them the distance was such that itd take a couple minutes to reach the fight but theyd slam into both sides of the vanguard which was currently lacking even the slightest defensive formations meanwhile orcs continued to swarm over the hillside using their weight and the height of the hill to fling themselves into the human lines trapped in the middle of all those orcs there was little antonil could do and nowhere for his men to go another volley of catapults released and it took immense willpower for tarlak to continue his defense a flawlessly executed ambush and even though he guessed antonil to have twice the number of men compared to the orcs theyd still take devastating casualties what had happened who in the world was this orcish commander tarlak let the next volley hit knowing those deaths wouldnt matter if the greater bulk of their forces upon the hills were destroyed opening a portal he stepped through and appeared at the base of the hill where the soldiers were still trying to force their way up left and right flanks tarlak screamed pointing toward the distant orc forces we need lines shields at the front move he heard commanders relaying his orders and he turned his attention away from them to the fight up top the last volley of stones had smashed through the remnants of their camp taking few casualties with so many making their way to the hill praying the next volley was as foolishly aimed he summoned the last of his magic fire burst around his hands and with a dark grin he began to hurl balls of flame toward the orcs along the top of the hill over a dozen slammed into the hillside before detonating the fire spread in all directions leaving enormous gaps in the orc assault the men once they reached the crest found their enemy thinned and without reinforcements and with such an advantage they quickly chopped them down when the last of his fireballs burned out tarlak fell to one knee and vomited he glanced to either side saw the conflict had begun in earnest the outnumbered orcs fought with ferocity but antonils men were well trained and despite all that had happened they still had numbers on their side upon the hill the thousands of men pushed on with antonil at their forefront his golden armor shining antonil wished him the best of luck with his enhanced eyes he scanned the hill searching for the commander as another volley released he caught sight of a man in red armor with black wings curled around his sides tarlaks blood ran cold a war demon leading an orc army the catapults had not pulled back as far and the stones rained down upon the hill their speed was less but it didnt matter not with such weight tarlak clenched a fist trying to force out one more spell at the nearest projectile he hurled a bolt of red lightning that struck the boulders center instead of halting it it exploded into heavy chunks which rained down upon the men tarlak caught sight of one such piece heading toward him he raised his hands summoning a shield to protect himself only to find his well of magic empty the rock continued unslowed past his hands striking him across the head his body spun the world shifting at sickening speed his body struck ground all around him he saw feet rushing ahead continuing to join the fight then darkness they propped jessilynn by the exit of the ravine so all would see her as they marched jessilynn endured it best she could her mind clouded by whatever herbs the shaman had placed upon her wounded face two wolfmen guarded her with explicit orders to kill her should anyone attempt a rescue i hope your elf friend is wise enough to stay away silverear had said after relaying the instructions to the brutes jessilynn said nothing only nodded occasionally she looked to the sky hoping to see sonowins great wings but they were never there more and more she grew convinced that dieredon had abandoned her so he might fly west to warn the people of mordan and while she knew it was the right thing to do the course of action thatd save the most lives it did nothing to remove her feeling of abandonment as she stood there her arms tied with primitive ropes to a wooden stake the creatures snarled at her lapped their tongues and gnashed their teeth her eyes closed she pretended not to hear them not to be afraid once the ravine was empty and the various races had exited silverear returned for her along with an escort of wolves come the female said taking her wrist moonslayer would have words with you they left the ravine jessilynn halfwalking halfdragged across the yellow grass up ahead she saw the great mass of bodies that was the combined army but they did not go to them instead they slowed coming upon a small fire moonslayer sat waiting hunched over the fire with the bones of his meal at his feet several wolfmen were with him taller than the others stronger his most faithful and trusted she decided as moonslayer stood upon her arrival manfeaster was not with him but she could only assume he was farther ahead leading the army in his brothers absence on your knees silverear said shoving her to the ground jessilynn let out a small cry and remained where shed fallen without saying a word moonslayer turned around grabbing something that had been hidden behind him he tossed it her way where it landed with a loud clang jessilynn frowned not understanding what was expected of her the object was an enormous shield the front bearing the crest of the army of mordan what of it she finally asked pick it up the wolfman said if it was a trap it was a strange one slowly getting to her feet she walked over to the shield feeling the eyes of the monsters upon her the metal was cool to the touch and heavier than what she could use with any sort of proficiently she lifted it before her settling into a basic stance apparently whatever shed done was wrong for moonslayer lashed it out of her grip with a swipe she flinched expecting an attack but instead he went back to where hed been sitting and this time retrieved a sword he tossed it at her feet pick it up she lifted the sword careful to keep the tip pointed downward to show she had no crazy ideas there were a dozen wolfmen surrounding her and itd take more than a rusted blade to slice and dice herself free again she was judged poorly the blade knocked out of her hands the enormous wolfman lunged forward wrapping his paw around her neck and lifting her up you said you were a paladin he growled you lied the glow she realized they were looking for a glow something to match the stories of darius and jerico trying not to panic she fought for breath through his grip i am she insisted i can prove it moonslayer dropped her his back curled so he might stare at her eye to eye how he asked my bow she said i need my bow i left it at the cave silverear said having been standing nearby watching the events a quick snap from moonslayer sent one of the wolves racing back toward the ravine jessilynn sat on her knees focusing on breathing in and out she didnt know why he wanted proof of her being a paladin nor did she care all that mattered was finding a way to survive and keeping her eyes open for a chance to escape she could do that no matter the humiliations they would not break her silverear beckoned moonslayer over and she whispered something in her soft gravelly voice whatever it was the wolfman wanted no part of it and he pushed her aside jessilynn looked away unable to explain why she felt she might earn their wrath if they caught her watching human moonslayer said walking over to her from her knees she looked up at the beast there are those who doubt you are what i say you are this must be settled you will have your bow and you will prove that you are a paladin he leaned closer so that she might smell the blood on his teeth but if you are lying im not she said a thought came to her and she couldnt stop herself from saying lyings not my style moonslayer ruffled his nose at her but said nothing pacing he waited until the wolfman with her bow returned the creature dumped it unceremoniously before her scattering arrows out of the quiver when she held the bow she saw the string had been cut shaking her head in annoyance she reached for the quiver earning herself a growl from those gathered around her the string she said trying to explain its broken but i have a spare with that she continued what she was doing removing the old drawstring and then pulling out a new one from a long pouch on the side of the quiver looping the bottom on she stood braced it with her legs and then hooked the other side that done she stared moonslayer in the eyes the arrows will have the glow she said moonslayer flattened his ears and nodded urging her on jessilynn bent down and picked up an arrow this was it she thought she could fire an arrow into the air the glow alerting dieredon to her presence perhaps he could assault the crowd before they realized what was going on the idea vanished as quickly as it came there was no way dieredon had somehow lost track of her if he was nearby then he already knew that was just how he was on the other hand if he wasnt near she looked to moonslayer who watched her closely moonslayer and manfeaster were the two responsible for the entire army the fearsome leaders that kept the rest in check it was fear that prevented total anarchy and breakdown fear that would not last if the wolfmen squabbled over leadership how much might she disrupt their plans if she took him down shed be forfeiting her life but how many lives might she save in doing so this was what shed sworn to do to give her life so others may go on the arrow touched the string moonslayer was to her left and before her were two wolfmen who stepped aside to give her an empty space to shoot through her heart hammered in her chest she refused to look at moonslayer to even let him guess at her thinking up went her bow and she tightened her grip when she pulled back the string the arrowhead lit up the metal pulsing softly with a blue glow that was far fainter than she preferred the wolfmen around her saw it and several let out soft growls now she thought now was the time turn and fire send the wolfman leader to his grave save hundreds maybe thousands she released the arrow it sailed through the gap slicing through the night before striking ground with a loud crack it hit shattering rock jessilynn let out the breath shed been holding the weight of her inaction bringing her to tears no she couldnt do it she was a coward if jerico saw her then she could only imagine the disappointment in his eyes it is not the same as the stories moonslayer said as he took the bow from jessilynns hands it is enough silverear insisted let them all see it she is still a champion of mankind no matter how weak she appears moonslayer stood studying her with those intelligent eyes of his very well he said i will find manfeaster if you want a demonstration shaman then you shall have one he handed the bow and quiver off to another then lifted jessilynn into the air draping her over his shoulders one giant paw held her feet the other arms the position jammed her armor into her stomach but she kept the discomfort to herself for some reason she knew if she mentioned it the wolfman would only make it worse she felt like a child as he carried her racing along the ground with his tongue hanging out one side of his mouth the rest of the wolfmen followed leaving silverear to lag behind after an hour of running jessilynn felt she could take no more shed had nothing to eat in the past twelve hours so when she vomited it was just air and bile whenever she gagged moonslayer pulled her further past his neck so she would not stain his fur on and on they ran into the west each jostling step bringing pain to her spine at last they came upon the new encampment of the creatures it was spread out along the flatlands each race gathered separate from the others in the center of the army they left a gap just like they had in the ravine it was there moonslayer ran dropping her on the ground and assigning two of his wolfmen to guard her jessilynn remained still eyes closed and it was not long before she drifted away into sleep consciousness returned with a claw stabbing into the side of her arm she cried out and when she opened her eyes she found moonslayer standing over her the tribes are gathered he said on your feet she slowly stood her head pounding furiously all around the creatures massed come to watch whatever demonstration moonslayer had planned from what she could tell shed slept for at least an hour maybe two it wouldnt be long before the sun began to rise the giant wolfman paced before them all letting them see him letting them witness his size and power and then he began his speech i told you this human is a warrior of her kind the best they might raise against us moonslayer yelled yet i hear you speak when my back is turned you call me a liar you say she is no paladin you say you have fought humans bigger stronger more dangerous than this little whelp then let me show you how wrong you are her guess at manfeasters location had been wrong after all from the west he came running at full speed as if his return just happened to coincide with his brothers speech instead of running on all fours he ran on two for carried on his back was a human child jessilynn choked down a cry seeing him the child looked hardly more than seven years old his clothes torn and his body splashed with blood along with manfeaster came several more wolfmen and they too carried men and women on their shoulders most appeared dead but for two the child manfeaster carried and a middleaged man the bodies were dumped just outside the ring but the two living were set down not far from jessilynn the boy looked around with whiteshocked eyes too frightened to cry the man fell to his knees and grabbed the boy holding him against his chest as he kept his head down and his eyes closed his father thought jessilynn seeing their hair was the same color who were the rest of the bodies were they his family his friends we have crossed the river manfeaster roared we have tasted the flesh of humans no boats stop us no armies meet us to fight they are weak and we are strong moonslayer walked over and handed jessilynn her bow show them he said to her let them see what you are with a dawning horror she realized what he wanted the father and child that would be how she proved her abilities as a paladin of ashhur no she said no i cant i cant do this you will moonslayer growled the rest of the vile creatures hooted and howled driven wild by the scent of fresh human blood the wolfmen stood guard over the bodies the feast not yet ready to begin it was to be entertainment first caught in a nightmare jessilynn drew an arrow she nocked it then stared at the father and son they were both terrified and crying she didnt blame them all around were monsters i cant she whispered suddenly loosening her grip to murder one of them just to spare her own life had she lost her mind is that so moonslayer asked he shot a look to manfeaster who nodded understanding the unspoken message in a single smooth motion manfeaster took the boy from the fathers arms flipped him into the air and then smashed him headfirst into the rocky ground no cried jessilynn her scream echoing along with that of the father two of the creatures beat down the man when he tried to rush manfeaster their claws ripping into his flesh until he crumpled to his knees moonslayer leaned closer his words rumbling in jessilynns ears show them he whispered show them or we eat the next alive it was all too much legs shaking she looked upon the grieving father his body was covered with gashes and blood mixed with his tears and snot only the wolfmen holding him kept him away from the body of his son jessilynn thought of him lying on his back screaming while the wolves and the birds tore into his flesh feasting her arms shook and a shudder convulsed through her as the vile creatures howled she pulled back her arrow what she didwas it murder no matter what she chose the man would suffer the man would die this was compassion wasnt it was it mercy or was it cowardice a way to escape the guilt of watching such a horrific sight her eyes flicked to the boys corpse already one of the wolfmen was licking the blood off him i cant do this thought jessilynn please ashhur forgive me take him home she let loose her arrow it smashed into the man blasting him out of the wolfmens arms and flinging him back several feet his chest caved in and blood shot from his mouth the image burned into jessilynns mind yet no matter how badly she wished to close her eyes to shut it all out she could not the corpse rolled along the ground expending the last of its momentum all around her the monsters cheered thrilled with the sight and in awe of the demonstrated power did i not say she was their champion moonslayer roared yet she is nothing to us she is our toy our slave our meal mans time is at an end all of us we will have a land of our own and we will take it by force onward to the river manfeaster cried joining his brother it is near can you not taste your freedom come now and taste it in the blood of the humans the feast began and still jessilynn could not force herself to look away her mind felt frozen her emotions in shock tears ran down her face yet she was unaware she was crying a warm hand touched her shoulder and she shivered come silverear said gently taking the bow you will sleep at my side this night but first we have many miles to walk jessilynn had no heart to respond no words to say she followed the shaman into the night and though she was surrounded shed never felt so alone in all her life tearful eyes looking up at the stars she wanted to scream at ashhur demand he answer for such abandonment it was then she saw sonowins wings the winged horse like a distant bird flying through the night dieredon sat atop her just a dark speck still watching still waiting for a chance to rescue her jessilynn wept unable to cope with such a mixture of relief and torment knowing shed not been abandoned knowing there was nothing he could do to save her we should prepare our army said one of harruqs advisors as he sat on antonils throne hunched over and thoroughly miserable what army he asked you mean the one that left with the king there are more soldiers in mordan than just them said sir wess captain of the guard in mordeina and the man left in charge of keeping the peace during their kings absence the surly man spoke slowly as if he thought harruq a child most lords kept retainers especially the northern lords retaking a distant land is one thing but this is ker this is our doorstep and we cannot risk them retaliating while were unprepared harruq looked to the queen who sat quietly beside him her hands were folded in her lap and she shook her head when he caught her gaze no harruq said were not going to make this worse ive already sent a messenger to apologize if brams got any shred of sense in him hell accept it and well all pretend like this never happened but you dont know what has happened said another of the advisors none of us do would it not be wiser to prepare before harruq could answer the doors slammed open and in walked ahaesarus in all his regal splendor he pointed at harruq come with me he said harruq lifted an eyebrow uhcare to say please ahaesarus stared at him then let out a sigh please he said ive called another gathering of the angels and i would like you to bear witness harruq shot a look to susan unsure of what to do we need to know what happened she said go with him im sure youll be safe probably harruq thought as he stood but he was taking his swords with him just in case he wanted to ask outright about the incident in the south but ahaesarus didnt appear to be in the talkative mood if you need anything susan will handle it harruq told his advisors pushing through them as for me ill be with tall and handsome ahaesarus led the way out into the open courtyard and then turned your hands he said we fly to avlimar i want to know one thing before i go harruq said now that they were relatively alone is my brother all right ahaesarus hesitated then nodded he battled judarius for some length but is otherwise unharmed as is his wife now will you come with me of course harruq said offering his hands just dont drop me please itd be a poor ending to an already awful day ahaesarus grabbed him by the wrist beat his wings and into the air they soared the land was a steadily shrinking blur beneath them as they approached the floating city harruq closed his eyes knowing it helped with the vertigo while he didnt normally consider himself afraid of heights he decided he could always make an exception when he was so high up that the castle looked like one of aubriennas toys he opened his eyes when they set down on one of the many outer ledges of avlimar it was immediately apparent something was afoot given the thousands of angels circling about the city harruq wondered what it meant qurrah was alive but that didnt necessarily mean he was free for a terrified moment he thought he was being brought to witness his own brothers execution his hand drifted to his swords and he tried not to show his sudden nervousness so when do i hear exactly what happened in ker he asked as nonchalantly as he could which wasnt very nonchalant at all i stopped the attempt to punish your brother before judarius could finish the execution ahaesarus said king brams soldiers fought to protect him and both men and angels died in the conflict and so what is it we go to now harruq asked as they walked down the pristine golden streets the forum the halforc couldnt remember when hed seen ahaesarus so cranky no not that he decided as the angel led him along he wasnt cranky and he wasnt being shorttemperedhe was nervous that realization made harruqs own nerves fray what could someone as powerful and influential as ahaesarus be nervous about was there something he wasnt telling him just what did he plan on doing in this council sadly he knew hed get none of those answers so he kept his mouth shut and his eyes and ears open the forum turned out to be an enormous oval building open at the top and built with a multitude of rows steadily rising higher and higher each seat facing a central point there were no doors for the angels all flew in from the sky to take their place ahaesarus helped harruq over the wall but instead of finding him a seat he kept the halforc beside him on the smooth marble flooring of the forum looking about seeing the thousands of angels watching harruq got an inkling as to why ahaesarus was nervous more surprising though was that harruq was not the only nonangel to be there on the other side of the dais stood lord maryll his arms crossed over his chest he looked unbothered by the numbers and seeing harruq he only offered a polite nod harruq ahaesarus said the two of them alone in the center he kept his voice a whisper for it seemed even the slightest noise carried far when my angels flew about the nation to perform their new orders you told me to do something you told me it wasnt right and that i should know it for that i want to thank you no matter what any priest any scribe and any king might say i know in my heart that what you said was just what i do now i do because of you with that he turned spreading his arms and wings wide so he might address the gathered thousands harruq stepped aside to give him room feeling awkward standing there with nothing to do he almost joined kevin just so he wouldnt have to be alone but quickly rejected that terrible idea better awkward and alone than near that pompous jackass before i begin let us pray for wisdom guidance and mercy from our beloved lord ahaesarus said and a heavy silence fell over the forum so quiet that harruq could hear every cough every shift and rustle of feathers a moment later in eerie unison the angels looked up and ahaesarus spoke his prepared words harruq listened daring to hope something might be salvaged from the disaster down south angels of ashhur ahaesarus began mere days ago we met to discuss our future in the land of dezrel we heard the thoughts of men their ideas of justice mercy and forgiveness could still be for the soul but the body must still be punished and so we made our decision and with heavy hearts carried that decision out the angel shook his head and he took a deep breath i am here to tell you all that i am revoking that decision we will not carry out justice in such a manner not anymore the following outburst was immediate and deafening harruq winced at the noise ahaesarus slammed his hands together demanding attention and it was granted we will not be their executioners he cried to them we will not be their murderers from here on out we will judge as we have determining their innocence or guilt but then we shall turn them over to the humans to let them see fit the punishment for their crime we will not spare the guilty but neither shall we execute them we will wash our hands of all of it and let mankind decide the fate of those who would harm one another steal from one another and let darkness overcome their hearts instead of grace and love we had a vote a voice cried out above the rest harruq spotted the source and was not surprised to see it was azariah the priest stood gesturing to the rest of those gathered in the forum do our thoughts no longer matter he asked will you stand against the majority i will do more than stand against it ahaesarus replied i will deny it to its very core this is not what ashhur brought us here for this is not how we win over their hearts let no one fear the sight of an angel if you think otherwise so be it but my word stands your word judarius asked emerging from the crowd to stand before ahaesarus harruq noticed he carried his mace one of the few there who wielded a weapon and what of our words what of our vote do you deny our say in such a matter what if we are unwilling to let such things be ahaesarus stood to his full height a hard edge entered his voice and his message was chilling let any who would slay a human come forth now and challenge my role as leader of our kind come forth any of you show me how great your desire for blood truly is a taut silence stretched over the thousands and harruq saw them glancing at one another judarius in particular looked ready to speak staring eye to eye with the larger ahaesarus and then he turned away spread his wings and flew out of the forum as i thought ahaesarus said all of you we are to represent the glory of ashhur and perform his will this is the best way i know how now go there will be no debate and i have nothing else to say more rumbling more discontent the angels flew away in a great rustle of feathers and noise harruq looked across the marble and saw kevin watching them fly away with a contemplative look on his face would this placate the man or would such capitulation only provoke him further an angel came over took him by the arms and then they were gone harruq waited feeling more and more selfconscious as the forum grew steadily quieter a few flew over to ahaesarus to assure him of their support but they were not many at last they were alone just harruq and ahaesarus the angel approached and he looked like he carried a heavy burden on his shoulders do you see why i wanted you here he asked not quite harruq said shaking his head i wanted you to see this i wanted you to know the changes we make changes you must help enforce we need more judges we need clearer laws i want you to tell us what to do with the guilty and what to do with the repentant in this i hope we might better meet the desires of the people compared to the senseless violence we so recently spread throughout the night ill see what i can do harruq said immediately thinking it was something susan would be far better suited for more than ever he was glad shed stayed behind after antonils departure though i wouldnt expect any miracles i never do ahaesarus said but that doesnt mean i wont pray they happen do you think our actions will provoke a war harruq crossed his arms and frowned i dont know he said if one happens im determined to make sure it doesnt start on our end ive given up predicting king henley if he wants a war then well have a war but until he marches into our lands im going to do my best to prevent any further provocation ahaesarus reached for harruq for the return flight before he could harruq looked away feeling embarrassed you saved my brothers life he said thank you and i think you might save the souls of my angels ahaesarus said in that harruq i think i owe you far more than you owe me harruq laughed well in that case remind me to call you on that sometime maybe you can listen to a few hundred petitioners that might even things up a bit ahaesarus grinned as they soared into the air did you not just say to never expect any miracles loreina henley sat on her throne her husbands seat empty beside her in her lap was a letter and though shed read it three times already she read it a fourth it didnt seem it could be true yet the haggard man before her plus the wax seal of king antonil both insisted it was how far behind you are they she asked the messenger were marching at the fastest pace we can manage with such little food the man said his clothes were stained with sweat and he looked like he hadnt slept in days id say two weeks at most your grace loreina nodded my servants will find you a room and prepare you a bath she told him im sure youre hungry and if youd like to eat before resting tell them thank you your grace he said bowing low servants came having heard her orders and ushered the messenger out of the hall loreina sat there tapping the letter against her leg she read it a fifth time still unable to contain her excitement to friend and king the orcs number far beyond what i ever dreamed in my darkest of nightmares the east crawls with their kind though that is not the real danger someone leads them someone wise someone they fear my men whisper it a demon who survived the gods war i do not know but only tell you so you might understand the danger you face on your eastern border my army is crushed my supplies ruined we were ambushed on the way to angelport left with retreat as our only option we come to you now humbly and afraid asking for aid and shelter when we reach your lands my men are already starving yet we face days of marching until we reach safety whatever aid you offer i will pay back tenfold and please prepare your men an army of orcs is growing and i fear their leader will not be satisfied with just the ruins of the east your friend king antonil copernus there was nothing particularly shocking about the letter theyd long known an orc commander had risen among them though the idea of it being a war demon was unsettling and that antonil had been defeated was no surprise given his failure years ago in attempting to complete the same fools errand but knowing they were out of provisions exhausted begging for aid now that was something she could use it was an opportunity her husband musnt squander turn away any petitioners she said to her guards as she stood i fear i will have far too busy of a day for any more bram was overseeing his army as he had ever since the angels attacked in the night loreina had watched the battle from the window of her room and still she had nightmares about it the way the angels had dashed through their soldiers slaughtering them as if they were children fighting against men she shook her head to clear away such thoughts fear was unbecoming of her lifting her skirt ever so slightly so she might increase her pace she stepped out into the courtyard despite the hard work of many servants there were still signs of battle everywhere it seemed until the next year when the grass regrew in spring there would be the red blood staining the green as for the cobblestones pathways well itd taken three days of scrubbing to make them their original gray and even then she saw missed spots here and there bram had told her the final tally a hundred and twentynine men dead and in return theyd killed a paltry eleven angels fear was unbecoming of her and such failure was unbecoming of their soldiers and so the men drilled and plotted and worked out ways to kill men who flew through the air on pearly wings as she left the courtyard and entered the training grounds surrounding the barracks the men halted what they were doing so they might pay their respects loreina smiled at them knowing such small gestures did wonders for morale in the middle of all the chaos was her husband arguing with sir ian im telling you archers arent effective against the angels ian insisted either they dodge them on the way down or outrace them on the way up its only if we can get them on the ground that theyd take the significant casualties necessary to justify the extra training not if the volley is large enough that bram stopped noticing her presence loreina dipped her head in respect then kissed her husbands lips a letter she said handing it to him as she pulled away from who he asked his eyes lit up as he saw the name at the bottom oh really loreina waited as he read it and was not surprised to see him immediately go over it a second time how long ago did you receive this he asked suddenly looking up a few minutes ago a messenger came riding in from the east and our bridge guards escorted him here as fast as they could bram nodded and his face hardened into a frown that she knew meant he was deep in thought if we might speak alone she asked ian who promptly bowed of course he said milord fetch me if you need me with ian gone they were alone despite the hundreds of men milling about clanging swords their words would go unheard in such a din loreina slid beside her husband wrapping her arms around his waist this is it she said this is everything weve waited for disturbed he looked her way his frown deepening how so their numbers are weakened and they are in no shape to fight meet them at the bridge show them you will not be taken advantage of bram glared and he guided her toward the exit of the barracks it seemed even with all the noise he would not speak of such things in public are you mad he asked as they stepped out you saw what thirty angels did to our forces that was within our own castle with qurrahs lover to aid us thousands fly above the skies of mordan even if we crush antonil war will still come to our nation and against that might well be trampled when did i speak of war loreina asked letting a hard edge into her voice her husband should trust her better than that and it annoyed her when he would not fully think her ideas through when did i speak of crushing that fool of a king i only ask that you exercise the rights you possess bram shook his head what youre asking is dangerous loreina if ahaesarus meant what he said we still might escape open warfare i once thought we would stand a better chance but that was before seeing what they could do their weapons make our chainmail look like butter dont you think i know that she said i watched from my window as our men good men with families bled out and died because those fanatics were determined to get what they wanted they came at night without warning into our very capital what happens when they come for you or for me she saw the anger in his eyes and knew she had him all i ask is that you be the king i know you are she whispered softly kissing him from his neck to his ear all i ask is that you let me sleep knowing i am safe can you do that he nodded well have little time if we want to meet them at ashhurs bridge he said forgive me i must give out the order she smiled and let him go of course she said he hurried back into the barracks and her heart swelled with pride this was it this was the first step toward their freedom trying not to look in any particular hurry she walked back to the castle when her servants went to follow she dismissed them claiming she had a headache and desired solitude it was only a halflie she climbed the winding stairs to the upper floors then smiled at the man guarding her room slipping inside she twisted the lock then rushed to her private chest of things amid the various junk was a single scrap of paper hardly larger than her palm it was faded brown and looked as if itd been forgotten at the bottom of the chest for decades taking the scrap she went to her husbands desk and opened his inkwell taking a quill she wrote two simple words in its center that done she put the quill and ink away then walked over to their window she pushed it open felt the breeze blow against her her heart aflutter she lifted the paper to her lips then slowly breathed across it immediately the paper snapped to life folding over and over on itself reshaping becoming something else throwing it out the window loreina smiled as the paper bird took flight rising higher and higher into the air the words antonil approaches safely folded into its very center loreina watched until it was gone her hands clasped before her chest and her eyes alight king antonil parted the rough fabric with his hands and looked inside how does he fare tarlak lay on a pile of blankets in one of the few wagons theyd manage to salvage after the ambush at kinamn his hat was beside him exposing the wicked bruise just above his temple a bit of his hair was missing shaved off by the elderly surgeon overseeing him he fares fine tarlak said lazily lifting an arm in greeting i dare say im sick to death of this bumpy wagon i think walking would be better for my health and my sanity you have my pity said antonil thank you tarlak replied i meant the surgeon he sleeps more than he complains the surgeon said though the herbal milk i give him is probably to blame the infection is gone praise ashhur for that in a week maybe two hell be back to his old flamboyant self nonsense tarlak said im my flamboyant self right now see this smile thats the smile of a happy man the smile of a drugged man antonil said chuckling cut down on the herbs i think its time he regained a bit of his lucidity i might have to take some myself then said the surgeon you cannot imagine what this man is like when ill ive known children who handled toothaches better well be at ashhurs bridge within the hour antonil said as tarlak stuck his tongue out at the surgeon soon well all get the rest we need and even better the food our bellies have been grumbling for will that make up for the wizard itll do antonil patted tarlak on the leg get better he said oh and try not to be too annoying no promises came slurred speech from the wagon as antonil hopped back down his smile while natural in there with tarlak soon became forced as he wandered through the rest of his army of his thirty thousand only five remained and very few of them walked with their heads held high their faces were sunken and thin crying out for sleep and food antonil wished he could give it to them and he thanked ashhur they had finally made it to ker the loss of so many made him sick to the stomach whenever he thought about it hed been at the front trying to reach the catapults shattering their ranks when they finally broke through the orc line their commander had issued a retreat from atop the hill antonil watched the orcs pull away and he denied his men a chance to chase after there was no point he guessed the orcs had two thousand left maybe three perhaps they would have overrun them but he didnt want to risk it not with a broken army theyd left the dead where they were upon the hillside gathered up every shred of supplies into their few remaining wagons and then traveled west from then on the orcs had left them alone as if knowing theyd accomplished what they needed to keep their land safe retaking veldaren was now but a dream antonil did his best to accept it to push that sting aside while there was nothing he could do about it securing aid from king bram was all that mattered now whatever promises he had to make hed make and whatever humiliation he must endure hed endure if he had to kiss brams ass cheeks hed do it so long as it got food in his soldiers bellies at the head of the army were their few horses and antonil mounted one despite everything he had to appear lordly especially before a fellow king are we ready he asked sergan who had been waiting for him weve given out the last of our water he said our food will last maybe three more days but i kept it rationed no sense being wasteful until we know how badly brams going to gouge us for his aid youre a good man sergan antonil said what would i do without you go hungry and thirsty id say sergan said with a tired smile at your word well march consider that word given lets go home the army moved out and it didnt take long before they caught sight of civilization the smoke of campfires drifted lazily into the air from the direction of the bridge at first antonil was heartened by the sight but then as the river neared he felt worry growing in his empty stomach the number of fires the amount of smoke was far beyond any normal garrison theyd received no response from the messenger hed sent out but that wasnt surprising his orders had been to forgo sleep and rest as much as possible on the way to angkar most likely he was recovering from the trip hopefully in far nicer conditions than antonil and his marching army found themselves in thats a lot of smoke sergan said as he sidled alongside antonil showing hed noticed the same if brams there itd make sense for him to have an escort sergan shrugged and stared at the sky big escort then despite their apprehension there wasnt much else for them to do but continue on when the bridge came in sight the army gathered there did little to improve their mood just as when they entered ker through the bloodbrick bram had gathered his ten thousand men and set up camp before the bridge antonil was too exhausted to feel anything more than mild irritation must we go through this again he wondered thinking of the tireless back and forth squabbling the vague threats and posturing of course he would these were his men theyd risked their lives for him for a land many had never been to before and most likely would never see again in their lifetimes keep the men calm antonil said glancing back at the rest of his army i dont want anyone trying to rush across bram will want some sort of payment im sure of it and i want to know what that payment is before we cross yes milord his five thousand slowed then came to a shuffling stop before the entrance to the bridge antonil rode ahead not bothering with an escort he saw bram dismounting from his own horse and walking out to meet him friend antonil cried widening his smile it is good to see you bram stopped just outside the bridge and he slowly shook his head i dare not say the same he called out what is it you come here for antonil hid his frown as he gestured to his army did i not say as much in my letter he asked my men are hungry and thirsty an orc army ambushed us their numbers greater than we ever thought possible iweall of us require aid as we travel toward mordan and i will gladly pay you back a hundred times if need be bram stared at him and the lingering silence made antonil unconsciously reach for his sword what was it that the man so clearly debated no he said his sudden words slicing through the silence you will not be entering my lands antonil stood frozen with only years of training keeping his voice calm despite his inner furor what do you mean he asked when you last came here you mocked my right to enforce my borders he said shaking his head in doing so you mocked the right of my sovereignty you scorned the power of my crown the nation of ker is not your servant nor your slave nor your child if you would return to your home then go another way another way antonil said there is no other way please bram let me make up for my pride but do not punish these men this has nothing to do with your pride your angels flew into my lands under cover of night they killed my guards all so they might capture a man under my protection the words hit antonil like a sledge what are you talking about he asked ask them should they come for you bram said but i was promised freedom from your angels tyranny and i was not given it i warned you yet you would not listen already your angels kill my men and now you would have me feed an army allied with such beasts no antonil i will not let you through if this is the only way for you to understand the dangers you court with avlimar then do this i must briefly antonil pondered an attack but he was outnumbered and when previously crossing the bridge hed seen firsthand the extensive defenses theyd built into it there would be no forcing his way across not in the state his men were in please he said his voice softer bram dont do this dont punish my men like this theyll starve bram crossed his arms and looked away i am not without mercy he said ill send across some wagons containing food and there is plenty of water to boil from the river it will tide you over for a time perhaps long enough for you to think on your many errors oh and antonil dont try to have anyone swim across i assure you well be watching bram turned cloak flailing behind him as he crossed the bridge antonil heard the first of many fearful cries filter through his army yet there was nothing he could do he clutched his sword tighter teeth clenched and cursed bram in every way possible so what are our options sergan asked as they settled down for the night around a small campfire the two were separate from the rest of the army the other generals scattered throughout to ensure order antonil wanted to be alone with his friend to speak his mind without fear of panic or scorn im not sure what other choice we have he said it seems bram is determined to humiliate us but i dont think it extends beyond that you dont know that sergan said what was that nonsense about the angels antonil shook his head supposedly some of them attacked brams castle i dont know any more than that if it is true then i dont blame bram for his fury such an action breaks every promise ive ever made him since the gods war anger or not the mans still acting like a bastard sergan said we cant just sit here can we the food he gave us will tide us over for a week but no longer than that if we dont do anything well be at his mercy holding out our hands like lowly beggars which is what he wants antonil said poking his fire with a stick he wants his power over us acknowledged no one in mordan will expect our return so early hell keep us here helpless frustrated and then make some sort of outrageous demand ill have no choice but to agree to we still might have a shot at crossing farther upstream sergan said you have friends at the citadel and i know they have their boats we dont have the food to travel that far north besides the citadel houses thirty people maybe forty they wont have enough supplies to feed five thousand sergan grunted accepting the rejection well what about the wizard perhaps he can do something get a few of us across the river with an ice bridge or something tarlaks too weak for that antonil said shaking his head still something about what hed said sparked an idea in his mind and he looked around feeling a sudden surge of excitement a map he said where is my map what for antonil ignored him instead hurrying into his tent and throwing open his strongbox he came back out unrolling the paper and laying it out on the seat hed been sitting in wizards antonil said i completely forgot about the wizards sergan leaned over to look at what antonil pointed to there halfway between ashhurs bridge and the citadel were the twin towers of the council of mages sergan saw it and immediately paled forgive me my liege but youre insane why with that many wizards surely they would know a way to supply us and they have a bridge spanning both sides butbut theyre wizards and more importantly theyre reclusive unpredictable wizards that hate being bothered by anyone kings or not antonil stared at the two little towers one marked with red chalk the other coal thats where were going he said i know its a risk but we cant stay here i refuse to let bram lord over us in such a way well be traveling through his lands without permission if we cross this way sergan said at this point i dont care most of that land is full of farms and wilderness well beat him to the bloodbrick before he finds out and whatever token force he might have there wont be able to stop us sergan scratched at his chin and finally he let out a sigh if you think itll work then thats what well do he said though let me say now that i dont like it never trust a wizard thats wisdom to live by do you think tarlak would agree antonil asked sergan let out a sharp laugh you kidding me your highness hes the one i heard it from first antonil smiled finally feeling his mood lifting he had a plan a course of action regardless of the risk at least he wouldnt be helpless before brams army get some sleep he said rolling up his map we have a long march well head southeast make bram think were hoping one of the fishing villages along the coast of the delta survived and then curl north and cross karaks bridge once were out of sight so lets say this works sergan said we sneak across the river through the help of our mysterious wizardy pals race through the wilderness and then cross the bloodbrick back into mordan what then antonil paused before the entrance to his tent he didnt want to lie to his dear friend and so he didnt then we return to mordeina he said and once weve gathered another army well see just how well bram is capable of defending the borders hes so proud to protect the man spat in the faces of our men this day i have watched nations fall angels appear and gods die did he think this would be what broke me no bram should have known better much better he entered his tent put aside his sword and slept the army of wolfmen slept not far from the gihon river waiting for the right moment to strike the night before moonslayer and manfeaster had bid farewell to the other various races sending them either farther north or south depending on where he wanted them strike jessilynn had listened as they gave them their orders chilled by their cold brutal efficiency let no boat pass you by moonslayer had shouted leave the towers blinded and alone one by one they will fall on the night of the full moon make your attack let none survive eat well my fellow creatures of the wedge feast and enjoy your freedom the towers were the only line of defense against the wedge their boat patrols designed to keep any of the beasts from crossing but jessilynn knew they were few and undermanned could they handle an army consisting of even one of the races let alone their combined might of course not thought jessilynn as silverear dragged her to where she would sleep for the night the towers would fall and beyond them were miles upon miles of farmland and simple villages how many would die before anyone even knew the severity of the threat yes she thought moonslayer was right the beasts would feast well i have no chain to tie you silverear said but if you move from my side you will suffer whatever fate you earn they walked to the center of the camp surrounded by several thousand of the beasts jessilynn felt their eyes upon her their noses sniffing the scents she left behind she nodded at silverear to show she understood not long after the camp settled down to sleep wideeyed and awake jessilynn lay upon the grass and watched the sun rise when sonowin appeared flying in from the west she dared hope lying perfectly still she watched as the winged horse circled above she wished she could somehow communicate with dieredon but there was no way in the very heart of the camp the slightest noise would be detected by the wolfmens sharp ears dieredon had sonowin fly far to the east then south and then finally loop around north jessilynn was confused at first by what he was doing but she eventually put it together the rest of the creatures the goatmen the birdmenthey were all gone he had to realize what it meant she watched the sky waiting wondering what he would do he had to have seen her there in her armor like a strange metal flea among the sea of fur the elf flew lower dipped around and then flew even lower jessilynn slowly reached up a hand trying to wave at him to let him know she was willing for him to make any attempt to save her no matter how desperate even that small movement made the chain of her armor rattle not loudly and she could barely hear it herself but silverears hand lashed out old claws curling around her arm the female leered at her with milky eyes on your knees she said push your face to the dirt jessilynn did as she was told folding herself into the demeaning position silverear stood above her and her claws traced along the flesh of her neck she shivered wondering if this would be the end i see him the shaman said your friend is skilled but is he wise let us see how brave he is and how much your life might mean to him she didnt know what to say silverear leaned in close her nose bumping against her cheek i want your face in the dirt until the sun sets she said should i see your eyes on the sky for even a moment i will rip out your throat myself i am old do not think i require the sleep of a young pup jessilynn closed her eyes shifting her shoulders in an attempt to find a more comfortable position within moments her back started aching and she thought of the long day ahead steeling herself she shifted again trying to slow her breathing trying to remain calm she heard silverear rustle beside her settling in jessilynn dared not look to see if she remained awake time passed slow and dreadful her back tightened and she moved her legs as often as she could at last sheer exhaustion won over and she slept wake girl said a rough voice punctuated by an upward blow to her stomach jessilynn let out a scream and rolled onto her back looking up she found several wolfmen standing over her moonslayer among them he grabbed her arm yanking her to her feet the night is young he said to her why do you sleep it was mockery and he flung her onto her rear her stomach twisted and she yearned for something to eat or drink she curled her knees beneath her wondering what it was they wanted now stand moonslayer said stand or die where you sit she obeyed trying to interpret the look he gave her there was something in his eyes something frightening as she crossed her arms before her one of the wolfmen tossed her bow at her feet along with her quiver of arrows she made no move for them my army attacks moonslayer said the weaker creatures are committed i have no need of you anymore human it is a waste of time manfeaster said joining them from beyond the camp all around the wolfmen were in a stir wrestling with one another preparing for the upcoming battle i say we eat her now let the blood of a paladin mark our victory we will moonslayer said to his brother his eyes turned back to her but first we have a hunt he gestured to the bow take it he said run flee west or north or wherever you think you might hide my wolves are anxious for the battle but the moon has not yet risen you will entertain us until then you risk lives needlessly manfeaster said and any who would die at her hand would die anyway besides her teacher defeated our father her kind has stopped us for centuries before let our pack tear her apart and prove we will be beaten no longer jessilynn watched the brothers stare at each other it was manfeaster who relented flattening his ears and turning away enjoy the hunt he said to the others moonslayer gestured to the bow take it he said run she scooped the quiver up slung it over her shoulder and then did the same with her bow she looked at the wolves hardly believing it came to this all along shed desired escape but now they would let her go freely no not freely she thought as she saw the hunger in the eyes of the wolfmen around her you should have listened to your brother she said to moonslayer as she took a step backward the enormous wolfman bared his teeth we shall see his howl pierced the night as she turned to run toward the river behind her she heard moonslayer howling his deep voice slowly growing fainter by the minute a hunt he cried a hunt a hunt gather for a hunt the heart of a paladin is our prey they would find her she knew as she ran she looked to the sky daring to hope she scanned the stars the miniscule clouds she stared so long she stumbled from not watching where she ran as she hit the ground she banged her knee on a rock sending a spike of pain shooting up her leg struggling to a stand she bit down her cry with her hope turning to dread she looked to the sky again dieredon was nowhere in sight on and on she ran cramps tightening her sides shed been starved and given little water to drink already her head grew light from the exertion but there was nothing she could do but press on on a whim she changed the angle of her path though she knew it wouldnt matter the wolfmen were excellent trackers and out there in the wild her scent would stand out like a fire in the darkness as the land passed her by she wondered how much time they would give her a few minutes later she heard her answer in the communal cry of dozens of wolfmen the sound was her death knell yet on she ran when she saw the gihon floating softly before her she let out a cry of her own her armorshe couldnt swim with her armor on frantically she yanked off the heavier parts weighted down with chain flinging them to the ground when she was down to just her leather under padding she slung her bow and quiver over her shoulder and then rushed into the water the cold was shocking much as she dreaded it she plunged her head beneath the surface and began to swim upon reaching the other side jessilynn pulled herself from the river gasping for air tears ran down her face as she tried and failed to crawl beyond the shoreline her feet remained in the water her hair a wet rope looped around her neck it wasnt far enough itd never be far enough the wolfmen hunted her and their noses would not be fooled by something as simple as a river within the hour perhaps even the minute they would find her and this time they would not let her live moonslayer had made that quite clear please ashhur she begged please i cant do this i cant im not like them help me god help me she shrieked it out until she lost breath her mouth locked open from her crying shed seen what the wolfmen did to their prey the way they tore into flesh with their claws and ripped muscle from bone with their teeth would she die quickly or would they torment her panic twisted in her gut stabbing her like a rusted knife it seemed so cruel dieredon no doubt flew overhead still looking to rescue her as she assumed he had been trying to do all along yet now she was free and unable to signal him in the night if only hed been watching when they released her if only sonowin could stay aloft longer if only shed never agreed to go with the elf in the first place the frustration gave her the strength to stand and with eyes wide she ran her back to the river hardly ten feet out her bare foot struck something hard and down she went the sudden jolt made her bite her tongue warm blood filled her mouth and it took all her composure to keep from breaking down a second time turning to spit she saw what had tripped her it took a moment for her mind to register what it was for it made no sense there in the middle of some random forest beside the gihon was a greatsword nearly as tall as her the hilt was black finely carved and when her fingers touched the metal it was surprisingly warm i see you found my sword jessilynn started spinning around on her rear and bracing herself with her arms before her stood an imposing man his blonde hair long his eyes a startling shade of blue his armor though she recognized his armor it matched what they wore at the citadel from the metal a faint hue pulsed with his movements too tired to understand too tired to flee jessilynn dared feel a glimmer of hope who are you she asked afraid of the answer im not sure youve heard of me said the man my name is darius and i think im a bit before your time her mouth fell open was she dreaming was she dead jerico she stammered jerico told us about you did he now he said you were one of the most faithful paladins hed ever met hes often used you as an example in our lessons darius smiled as if he were amused i guess i shouldnt say im surprised i hope his lessons are better than they used to be in durham a fine man but a dreadfully boring speaker the man walked over to her side and knelt jessilynn flinched despite herself what was he a ghost an angel a lost spirit come to haunt the place he died do not be afraid he said im here only because you need me youll help me she asked the wolfmen theyll be here any minute you could kill them you could she stopped as he shook his head interrupting her not in that way jessilynn my days of fighting are done he picked up his sword immediately the blade vanished into pure white light not a hint of steel remaining beneath the brightness darius stared at it still smiling what is truly troubling you he asked youve always been brave i dont need much help to see that why are you so afraid to stand against the enemies chasing you she looked away as she thought she wanted to give a true answer not some weak flippant excuse whatever was happening now it was something special and she wouldnt spoil it with a pathetic lie because i cant be like you she said finally meeting his gaze like me he asked no dying pretty quickly makes you like me thats not what i mean you jerico lathaaryou were heroes nothing was stronger than you you didnt run away you didnt kill others just to spare yourself every time i try to be like you to be strong like you i i cant do it im nothing compared to you and i never will be darius sat down before her and laid his sword of light across his lap i once murdered an innocent family to prove my loyalty to karak he said his voice softer quieter i once stood by and watched an entire village burn and i did nothing to stop it how you see us the way you embrace these storiesthats not us we bled like you we cried like you most of all we failed just like you we begged and pleaded for our god to save us to protect us as we faced enemies we never thought wed defeat we were far from perfect can you not see that she sniffled then wiped her face with her sleeve then how did you do it she asked jerico once faced an entire army of demons and didnt falter how could he do that if he wasnt better if his faith wasnt stronger darius reached out a hand and gently pushed wet strands of hair from her face the only thing that made us special was that despite our terror despite our fear despite our doubts and sorrow we fought anyway even when we thought it hopeless even when we knew it would cost us our lives thats all you can do jessilynn with every breath we try to make this world a better place hoping in the vain that someday in some beautiful future our acts of faith and goodness will overshadow those who know only how to destroy gently he leaned forward and kissed her forehead youre not abandoned not forgotten not unloved never forget that and never believe otherwise jessilynn broke down at his words crying not out of sorrow but from joy the whole time shed been dragged about the wedge as a puppet for the wolfmen she thought it had been her fault shed thought her faith too weak her cowardice too great for her to deserve her gods love to know otherwise to know every stupid failure had done nothing to ruin that love she looked up at darius and laughed despite herself can i hug you she asked still wiping away tears darius grinned why not she lurched to her feet and wrapped her arms around his waist touching him set her nerves alight as if she hugged a bolt of lightning quickly she let go stepped back and blushed a fierce red darius shot her a wink dropped his sword to the dirt and faced the north wait she said as he began to walk away yes he asked turning back whywhy are you still here shouldnt you be with ashhur and his angels darius shrugged as if it were no big thing im still waiting for someone he said isnt it obvious who he smiled jerico tell that bastard to hurry up and die theres this spot by a lake i want to show him a wolf howled and instinctively she looked to the river when she turned back darius was gone and the sword had lost its glow the night returned to darkness lit only by the stars dotting the clear sky it was like stepping out of a dream jessilynn stood perfectly still yet to catch her breath when another howl came from the river answered by several others in the hunting party she closed her eyes im sorry if this is stupid she prayed but im not running she grabbed dariuss sword and hurried to the gihon at its edge she jammed the blade downward surprised by how easily it slid into the dirt once certain it was secure she pulled her quiver of arrows off her shoulder and looped it around the handle of dariuss sword when she stepped forward it put her arrows within easy reach of her hand her fingers rustling through the feathers she counted them nine arrows nine wolfmen to put down grabbing one she readied her bow took a deep breath and gazed beyond the river to the vile wedge in the shadows she saw the yellow glint of hungry eyes those she dared not count closer and closer they ran their outlines visible in the moonlight in a single smooth motion she pulled back her first arrow saw the bluewhite hue surround the arrowhead it was still weak but it was there let the arrow do its work she thought remembering dieredons words just let it fly as the first wolfman reached the river she did just that the arrow streaked through the night like a flash of thunder blasting into the creatures muscled chest with a whimper it fell without thinking without hesitating she drew another arrow and sighted anew more wolfmen were at the rivers edge and one by one she shot them dead they were many and soon they splashed through the gihon swimming toward her while snarling with bared teeth she shot an arrow through the closest wolfs mouth dropping the creature into the water two more tried to swim beneath the surface but when they came up gasping for air she loosed her arrows six seven still the bodies surged into the river still she held firm grabbing for arrows and relying on instinct they were reaching the other side now the upper halves of their bodies emerging from the water dripping wet they raked the air they howled but her arrows flew true the shine on their arrowheads grew brighter and brighter and when they struck the wolfmen it was like they were hit with a battering ram ten eleven her mind dared not think she dared not look as her routine continued one after another she fired her arrows gleams of deadly light and after each one shed feel soft feathers touch her fingers when she reached for just one more fourteen fifteen hairy bodies floated downstream and from the other side roared several wolfmen that had come running at the tail end she shot one dead her arrow connecting with its jaw and hitting with such impact it tore off its head others dove in the water howling biting seventeen eighteen some tried to flee but they died like the others theyd have hunted her and once they killed her theyd have continued on beyond the river were hundreds of farms homes innocents who would have felt the hatred of their claws she wouldnt let them she couldnt the monsters were all but dead one last wolfman emerged from the river teeth bared with fury she recognized his size recognized the white circles about those hungry yellow eyes moonslayer was so strong so fast and it seemed even the river would not slow him as he rushed toward her itd take more than one arrow she thought surely even she could not take him down with a single shot jessilynn looked down to her quiver trance breaking and she saw it empty for the briefest moment she felt panic as she turned to face one of the kings of the vile moonslayers muscles were taut his legs curling in for a leap refusing to give in refusing to let him win she felt her instincts take over once more empty handed she reached for her string and began to pull it back tears filled her eyes she didnt understand how how was it even possible nocked in her bowstring shimmered an arrow of the purest light she felt its feathers against her skin impossibly soft the head was slender sharp the wolfman howled lunged the arrow flew exploding with radiance she heard bones crack as the creatures momentum reversed with jarring speed into the river landed the corpse vanishing beneath the dark waters in the sudden calm she stood holding her bow and then she laughed a grin spread across her face huge and dumb and she felt helpless to stop it taking her bow she grabbed the string aimed to the sky and released anew arrow after shimmering arrow sailed high continuing on as if they would escape the very world itself im here she cried out to the stars im alive after only a few minutes and three more arrows she saw the dark shape slicing through the blanket of stars heard the heavy beating of sonowins wings i still dont like it tarlak said as the towers loomed ever closer his head was heavily bandaged and he looked unsteady atop his horse were far past doing things we dont like antonil said riding beside the wizard as the remnants of his army made their way north along the river twice now i must return to mordeina with my head hung low and my tail between my legs and what will any say if i try for a third campaign if thirty thousand is not enough then what perhaps we should give the land up for lost tarlak suggested after a moments hesitation he winced as if expecting an outburst and antonil understood why the words stung but there was too much wisdom too much truth in the simple statement id prefer it if you were wrong more often wizard he said me too honestly they turned their attention to the towers there were two of them each standing on opposite sides of the rigon river the one on the western side had its bricks painted a sheer black making it seem as if it were built out of obsidian the eastern side was built like the other tall and cylindrical except with its stones colored a deep red that invoked a sense of blood and danger spanning the river held up by what antonil assumed to be magic was a lengthy stone bridge connecting the tops of the two towers its bricks a mixture of red and black is there any significance to the color antonil asked hoping that learning more would put his mind at ease about the strange structures the more unknown something was the easier to fear it the black is the masters tower tarlak said he closed his eyes and held the side of his face for a moment grimacing as if against a wave of pain these are the men and women who rule the roost their numbers vary but its never more than twenty as for the red thats where the apprentices go to learn anyone can apply if theyre insane enough few are accepted and even fewer actually survive the process is learning magic that dangerous tarlak chuckled to graduate you have to beat one of the mages on the council in a duel if there is an available seat on the council the duel is merely one of skill not to the death if the councils full well the wizard shrugged theres really only one way to open up a seat a shadow had passed over tarlaks face as he spoke and antonil sensed there was far more the man was hiding he felt bad to be so inquisitive what with tarlak in such poor shape but his curiosity was stronger were you ever an apprentice there he asked i was supposed to be tarlak said his speech was slow as if he were deeply tired my father paid a lot of coin to have a man named madral prepare me teach me some rudimentary spells to help ensure my success as an apprentice but madralthere was a reason he was considered a renegade among the council he worshipped karak in secret and helped topple the citadel back in the day given how my father was a priest of ashhur you can imagine how well we got along once i discovered that fact i was barely sixteen when i confronted him the way he looked at me as if i were less than a flea in his eyesi dont know how but i killed him im not sure ive ever been more frightened antonil gave him a moment of silence instead staring at the nearing towers as he thought well that explained the moment of darkness in tarlaks routinely cheery attitude you could have joined the council couldnt you he said isnt that how the rules worked tarlak nodded yes i could have but i refused the council guards magic so jealously and my time with madral did much to scar my opinion on such matters that and id have faced waves of challenges from the apprentices some twice my age i couldnt do it so i took what money i had left and worked to create my little band of mercenaries the rest you could say is infamy antonil elbowed the wizard in the side doing his best to smile id say it turned out all right he said sure theres been some tough times but youre friends with a king now and some claim you helped save the world that must count for something for a moment he got nothing but then tarlak laughed dont think for a second youre getting out of your debt with a few sunny words he said and im running up interest too saving the world doesnt come cheap and neither will healing this head wound they rode for a while in silence antonil felt better seeing tarlaks spirits rise perhaps if they could not cross the river they could still send out hunters maybe spear some fish as a way of sustaining things until the tarlak was well enough to create a way to cross the river on his own when the towers were only two hundred yards away antonil raised his hand and ordered his army to slow i dont want them to think we come with threats he said do you think youd have more luck requesting passage across the river than me pretty as i am tarlak asked gesturing to his bandage no i dont theyve tried to kill me twice antonil like i said they guard magic pretty closely so youre saying i should keep you hidden in the back im saying they will either let us pass or they wont theres no way of telling not with them theyre recluses for a reason and the gods war didnt help matters any antonil muttered a curse against all spellcasters under his breath then ordered his army to halt despite the worry in his gut he rode ahead determined to show the council he was neither afraid nor attempting to intimidate them all they wanted was to cross a bridge so they could return home why did it have to be so bloody complicated just speak tarlak shouted from behind theyll hear you i promise antonil swallowed chose his words carefully then shouted up to the red tower that rose so high above him wizards of the council i am king antonil copernus of mordan my army has suffered many casualties and our stores of food dwindle i ask that we may cross the rigon by way of your bridge and receive any supplies youd be willing to give us i promise all kindness will be repaid and any price within reason will be met twice over with that he waited his horse shifted uneasily beneath him as if smelling the approach of a distant storm patting her neck antonil once more called out to the towers what say you strangely it seemed his horses instincts were correct the sky above which had been white with clouds suddenly darkened antonil kept his horse still as he heard worried cries from his army behind him it was just intimidation he told himself the mages wanted to show they were in control to confirm this he glanced back at tarlak when their eyes met he saw the wizards concern and rocks twisted in his gut all along the face of both towers various stones shifted opening to create dozens of windows antonil felt his heart jump at last he would receive his answer and he did in the barrage of a dozen balls of fire each larger than the size of a house his jaw fell open panic freezing him in place no he thought it couldnt be why what had they done looking back he saw the fire slamming into his troops detonating in great explosions that sent bodies flying lightning struck from the sky its thunder rolling over them like mocking laughter soldiers fled in all directions and following them came the fire and lightning now coupled with lances of ice and massive boulders all from those open windows so far untouched antonil broke free of his terror and kicked the sides of his horse turning about he raced toward the dying remnants of his army seeking one man in particular tarlak eschaton stood on the ground having abandoned his horse silver light shone around his hands as he tried to summon his magic can you protect us antonil shouted i cant tarlak screamed damn it antonil i cant stop them all several of the incoming spells shattered but they were too few antonil watched his throat constricting as he listened to the screams stop it the king screamed to the towers stop it are you mad lightning struck blinded antonil was thrown from his mount he landed hard on his head gasping for air his vision swirling with color he saw faint images of his men those he had promised to lead to victory to safety and watched them die amid a horrible mixture of fire lightning and ice their bodies burned their bodies bled so horrible so futile and why what had he done the barrage lessened nearly all of his army broken antonil staggered to his feet found tarlak on his knees still trying to cast a spell i can protect us the wizard was mumbling i fought gods i can protect us i can protect from the windows of the tower shot three balls of flame their centers a deep blue their outer ring a brilliant orange all three were aimed their way tarlak grabbed antonils hand and accompanying a scream of pain a translucent shield formed before the two the first fireball exploded the heat washed over them rolling about as if they were in the center of furnace yet they were not yet burned the second hit tarlak screamed and the fire passed before the third reached them antonil pulled his shield off his back despite the burns on his face despite the blood dripping from his mouth and nose tarlak was still trying to protect them knowing it hopeless antonil shoved him to the grass dove atop him and raised his shield tarlak continued to mumble and strangely he heard aurelias name im sorry antonil whispered thinking of his kingdom his wife his child all of it lost all of it in peril protect them harruq the fire washed over him burning away flesh and melting his armor consuming the life that was his and ending his short bittersweet reign from high atop the masters tower the lord of the council watched as the last of the army was buried in a wave of magical attacks satisfied he turned to the lady at his right inform the capitol he said to her before descending the stairs that led up to the roof if kevin wants the throne its his to take of course said the silverhaired lady from the pocket of her dress she pulled out a scrap of paper with a soft breath she blew across it the paper folded in on itself over and over until it had taken the shape of a dove its wings flapped with the speed of a hummingbird and then into the sky it shot racing north at speeds only angels could hope to match kevin stepped into susans room and she spun about ready to berate him are the guards outside daft she asked you might have caught me in a state of undress she meant it as playful banter but the seriousness of his look stopped her he held a piece of paper out to her as he approached your guards are dead he said susans mouth fell open and she took a step back toward her bed what she asked in answer he gave her the paper she took it unfolding the delicate material to reveal a simple message antonil is dead she looked up saw the hope in her brothers eyes what is this she asked what does this mean it means my men have already cleared the city walls and theyll be here in moments where is the halforc susans mouth suddenly felt dry this was it this was everything shed feared of her brother reaching fruition at last shed always told herself itd never come this far apparently shed told herself a lie hes with aurelia in their room she said still in a daze will you kill them kevin put his hands on her shoulders his hard gaze staring down at her it made her feel small it always did harruq was named steward by your husband if i do nothing that brute will rule not you not your child by the time gregory comes of age do you think hell even have a throne to inherit harruq is the angels puppet you know this youve seen it dont do this susan whispered please you dont need to do this at least let their little girl live kevin swallowed this is an ugly business he said im not sure if she can be spared no one must know what takes place here we can still save our land my dear sister it will just take a little sacrifice can you do that for me can you be strong like i need you to be susan tried to push him away but he held onto her his grip on her arms tightening you bastard she said youll kill us all wont you my baby boy even him you sick he slapped her across the face silencing her a hard shove knocked her to the ground shaking his head he pulled out a small length of rope that had been looped about his belt i do what must be done he said something youd never understand she wanted to laugh at him what must be done shed married a stranger so their household could prosper in the chaos following the war just a man of common blood a man who loved his lost homeland more than her shed sat in the shadow of a halfblood hero named steward because she was seen as too vulnerable to be declared ruler herself for family for friends she understood enduring such things but this wasnt for family it wasnt for country she saw greed in her brothers eyes a lust for power she should have quashed years ago you wont kill them she said giving him her hardest glare harruqs stronger than any man you have and the elfs magic is unstoppable theyll escape and when they do theyll tell the whole world of your betrayal kevin smiled that confident smile of his as he forced her to her knees wrapping his rope around her wrists my dear sister trust me he said as men in strange clothes and gray masks entered the room behind him ive taken care of that what do you think harruq asked as he held up two different shirts one crimson and shiny the other a deep subdued green which will look better on me at the ball tonight i want tough but smart think we can do that with these frilly outfits you know haern always managed to he stopped mouth hanging open as aurelia suddenly collapsed falling off the bed and onto her knees her hands clutching the sides of her head aurry he asked rushing to her side she let out a gasp as he put his arms around her holding her against him stop it she screamed her eyes rolling back into her head stop it youre burning him and then just like that it ceased her body crumpled and he held her stroking her hair completely baffled and terrified because of it for a long while she trembled in his arms crying softly it was only when she finally sat up sniffling and wiping at her eyes that he was convinced shed regained her senses tarlak she said that was tarlak hes dead harruq antonil as well theyre all dead he opened his mouth closed it her words were a knife to his heart no he blubbered no thats not right youwhat you saw was a dream a vision maybe you stop it she said i know what that was he was trying to warn us about something all i saw was fire i felt it harruq antonil dove atop him to save him but they both burned warn us harruq asked he was still trying to wrap his head around the idea of such good friends dying in so terrible a way warn us about what she rose unsteadily to her feet the king is dead she said i dont know if he knew i heard but antonils last words were him begging you to protect his family think harruq gregorys now the heir who benefits most whos now in the most danger before shed even finished her sentence harruq was belting his swords to his waist not even bothering with his armor wheres gregory he asked as he cinched the belt tight then looped the extra leather beyond the buckle into a knot when finished he tossed aurelia her staff from a corner of the room he and aubrienna are with their tutor she said as she caught it good theyre together thatll save us time once we get them well gather some guards keep everyone on alert theres not going to be any sort of coup today i promise they left his room and hurried down the hall stay calm aurelia said pulling on him to slow him down theres no way anyone can know about it yet you know about it harruq countered they reached the stairwell and climbed to the upper floor of the castle down the hall stood four soldiers holding short swords harruq nodded at them then barged through the door they guarded gregory and aubrienna sat at small desks scraps of paper before them hovering over them was an older man with white hair the tutor brought in to teach the children their letters gregory was fairly young for it but aubrienna had taken to writing both their hands were smeared with ink and at his noisy entrance they jumped lessons are over harruq said to the tutor go on home the old man bowed clearly confused but not pressing for a reason he said goodbye to the children then left with him gone harruq checked every part of the room even what seemed like empty spaces haern had taught him how well the best of the best could hide in plain sight once certain the room was secure he flung the bolt on the door in place locking them inside keep playing aurelia told aubrienna when she asked what was going on beside her gregory had fallen silent watching with his inkcovered hands in his lap staining his outfit black weve got some time to think harruq said feeling infinitely better now that he was with his daughter now that antonil is he paused glancing at gregory not around he continued that means gregorys king right they wont let a child rule at such a young age aurelia said then itll be susan we need to get her to safety shell be next in line to rule aurelia gave him a look and he realized he was still missing something what he asked a steward is appointed to rule when a child cannot she explained and in this case the kings last act was to appoint such a steward susan wont rule harruq you will harruqs emotions felt too raw to act appropriately so he just acted like himself shit he punched the wall ignoring how much the stone hurt his hand shit shit shit he caught both children watching him and he felt his neck flush sorry he muttered ignore daddys mouth susans life might still be in danger aurelia said keeping her voice subdued in hopes aubrienna and gregory would not pay attention if anyone wants to usurp the throne shell still need to be eliminated harruq nodded trying to think hed accepted his position thinking itd only be temporary in a year at most antonil was supposed to return having conquered the scattered orc armies but nowgregory wasnt even four how long until the boy was considered a man by law he didnt know but he severely wished he did eight years ten he thought of the years passing the weight of everything on his shoulders and felt panic rising in his chest i cant do this he said i cant i cant keep going i cant rule for that long even with susans help shell have to do it she has to he walked over to the window gesturing out to the city stretching out before them a great expanse of homes and shops i cant rule all that i cant he stopped leaning farther out the window and squinting aurry get over here he said when she did he pointed to the street what is that she joined him and with her sharper eyes she spotted men marching up the road toward the front of the castle he estimated at least four hundred maybe five they waved no banners to show their allegiance but their tunics looked familiar he couldnt place it but aurelia could kevin she said those are kevin marylls men the two shared a look there was no valid reason for kevin to be marching so many men into the castle no reason but one as they watched craning their necks down and to the right so they might see they noticed kevin walked ahead of the throng talking with the castle guards as the doors opened to let him in he stabbed one of the guards then rushed inside his soldiers followed using their very bodies to prevent its closure harruq swore as he jerked his head back inside the room time to go harruq said make us a portal and take us somewhere far far away what of susan aurelia asked as she began the motions with her hands ill come back for her once you three are safe her look said she wasnt happy with the idea of him remaining behind but she focused on casting her spell harruq waited expecting the familiar blue line to rip open before him tearing into reality and creating a gateway to somewhere wellknown to his wife but instead nothing happened he blinked glanced around thinking hed missed something whats wrong he asked aurelia frowned and her brow furrowed as she concentrated harder something isstrange she said again she tried casting the spell and again nothing happened harruq watched his anxiety increasing tenfold i think i know whats going on she said after a third time yielded similar results to test she went to the window ice surrounded her hand forming into a thin lance that she hurled out the window toward the courtyard barely an inch beyond the window ledge the ice dissolved away as if it had never been harruq grimaced confused but knowing that whatever it meant it wasnt good the entire castle is surrounded by some sort of invisiblewall she explained no magical spell can make it through without disappating worse its disrupting any sort of translocational magic ive tried opening portals even to somewhere inside the castle but they wont take i cant get us out harruq he could only follow half of what she said but he understood the deeper meaning behind it kevins ready for us harruq said he knew you would be with me the two shared a glance each thinking the same thing if kevin was ready for them if hed gone through all the trouble to trap them there then he wanted them for a reason most likely he wanted them dead he seeks the throne for himself aurelia said were just obstacles in his way were more than obstacles harruq opened the door to where the four guards waited all four looked nervous steward one said we thought to interrupt but werent sure he didnt need to ask about what from the floor below they could hear the faint sounds of steel hitting steel kevins men were swarming the castle killing all of the guards weve been betrayed harruq said all of you get in here guard the little prince with your lives despite their apparent nervousness the men saluted and hurried inside harruq glanced up and down the hall his mind racing we cant hold them off forever aurelia said coming up behind him aubrienna clutched her mothers hand her eyes wide with fear at the sudden commotion sure we can harruq said but we dont need to theres a scepter back in our room if i can get to it we can summon a whole army of angels to protect us what about susan harruq looked back into the room he couldnt get the scepter and susan at least not both at the same time aurelia could go but that left the children with only four guards to hold off kevins men until one of them returned theres nothing we can do he said well just have to hope she lives stay here i dont care if they brought a thousand men youre strong enough to stop them he kissed her then bent down to wrap aubrienna in a hug you stay safe he said to her kissing her cheek standing he drew his swords and went over the layout of the castle in his mind no matter which way he went hed need to go down the stairs to the lower floor presumably the floor was already lost the guards within overrun if only he could get down there without need of the stairs bypassing the bulk of the forces he looked to aurelia the outside of the castles been blocked he said but not inside right his wife gave him a confused look then understood i wont be able to get you back up she said leave that part to me aurelia went to nearest door pushing it open inside were simple beds clean and unused for some time gathering her energy aurelia unleashed it in a focused point blasting a hole in the stone floor just large enough for harruq to hop through peering down he found another room this one far fancier reserved for visiting lords and ladies beside the bed lay a heavy gentlemen blood pooling around his throat harruq shook his head then turned back to his wife love you he said before hopping down he landed atop the bed rolled off and then drew his swords should have put my armor on after all he muttered as he slid to the door which was slightly ajar glancing out he saw soldiers rushing down the hall their tabards bearing the maryll family crest all wore heavy chain mail for protection harruq winced again really really should have put on my armor when he decided the hall was as empty as it would get he burst out then spun in an attempt to orientate himself to his left were over fifty men filtering into the stairwell leading up on his right were only a few and they froze at his sudden appearance harruq barreled down the hall toward them relying on surprise to take them out quickly the first tried to stab him but woefully underestimated harruqs speed without slowing harruq slashed his throat and sidestepped his collapsing body swatting aside the seconds hesitant defense before shoving his swords into the mans stomach the chainmail resisted but the magic in harruqs swords was strong and they pushed through to pierce flesh with a roar harruq yanked them out kicked away the body and slammed both blades down against the paltry attempt to block by a third soldier the steel shattered harruqs ancient blades flaring red as they continued on chopping through either side of the mans shoulders to crush in his collarbones using the swords to maneuver the corpse he flung it behind him into the path of the soldiers breaking off from the stairwell the way was clear and he ran like mad toward his room from all sides he heard scattered combat and he tried not to think on how many died would kevin execute the servants too the cooks the cleaners the errand boys all to hide his crime he prayed not but the screams he heard said otherwise a glance behind him showed at least fifteen men in chase the breath in his lungs felt like fire and again harruq chastised himself for growing so lazy orcish heritage might have granted him extra muscles and stamina most men could only dream of but it meant little when he spent two thirds his day in a chair chugging down wine to keep himself from going out of his mind the stone walls were a blur as he ran he turned a corner slamming into a group of four soldiers coming through harruq muttered his momentum continuing through the jumble of arms and legs two the men managed to stay on their feet and they swung weakly at him easily dodging their surprised flailing harruq hamstrung one shifted a step to his right and stabbed salvation straight through the mans throat he left them there racing along before the rest of those chasing him could catch up his room was just up ahead he stared at the door with his eyes wide getting back to aurelia might be impossible now but if he could barricade himself in his room and summon the angels they could turn the tide saving them from kevins madness all he needed was the scepter in his closet without slowing he blasted through the door with his shoulder catching it with his left hand upon entering so he could immediately fling it shut behind him jamming in the lock he had to hope it held as he dashed for the closet pulling out the scepter he clutched to it like the desperate prayer it was at the window to their room he pointed the crystal outward and spoke the command word light built up around it forming into a pillar when it shot out that pillar halted mere feet beyond the window harruq blinked at it remembered the protection aurelia had said had been cast around the castle well he said the door shaking behind him as something heavy slammed into it thats not good shrugging his shoulders he spoke the command word again and then with all his strength he hurled the scepter out the window it curled end over end through the air and once beyond the barrier the pillar of light whipped around as if held by a wild drunk angel preparing his swords he turned to the door and braced himself to fight whoever might break through the lock shattered despite no pressure exerted on the door at the time before harruq could even realize what was going on he felt a sharp pain in his stomach letting out a cry he stumbled to his knees as lightning surged through his insides dissipating into the wall behind him the force of the attack knocked him backward and he cracked his head against the stone wall vision swimming he stared as two men with masks leisurely stepped into his room not harruq said as the men raised their hands unleashing more of their power notfair darkness came for him and all he could think was that surely things were supposed to have gone differently aurelia watched until harruq was gone from sight then returned to the makeshift classroom inside were the four soldiers waiting with drawn swords and doing their best to hide their anxiety get away from the door aurelia said to them they obeyed shuffling awkwardly to the far side once sure the two children were safely behind her she put her hands together focusing a spell now open it she said they did ice stretched from her fingers growing spreading out from one side of the doorway to the other sealing them in with a wall of ice that should slow them for a while she said more than that said one of the soldiers theyd need a ram to break through ice that thick she smiled at him a young man with barely any stubble on his face perhaps she said i hope youre right but i fear kevin prepared for my tricks from the outside they heard muffled noises undecipherable arguments and shouting through the blue of the ice aurelia could make out dark shapes of men on the other side telling herself to remain calm she took aubriennas hand and led her and gregory to a corner she overturned two desks and set them inside stay in here she said kissing both are they bad men aubrienna asked her yes very bad men will you stop the bad men she ran a hand through her daughters beautiful brown hair you bet mommy will she said she touched the stone bricks that made up the floor and they clung to her like honey lifting it upward she formed a wall overlapping the desks higher and higher she pulled the malleable stone creating a dome that sealed away the children at the very top she left a hole so light and air might still enter from within she heard sniffling but both children remained brave proud of them aurelia turned eyes focused on the ice barrier blocking the doorway i dont know how kevins planned to kill me she told the guards but the ice will let him know where i am soon enough please understand what i ask of you if any of you refuse i will let the ice remain and well wait for the trap to unfold to its fullest otherwise i plan on taking down as many of that bastards men as i can before he knows whats hit him she met their eyes saw their apprehension had disappeared leaving behind only bravery and determination im not one for hiding said the youngest of them well be outnumbered said another thats what im here for aurelia said draw your swords electricity encircled her hands as they readied themselves with a thunderous roar she unleashed her fury upon the ice the lightning blasted it outward showering the stunned soldiers with painful shards the spell continued on finding plenty of bodies for its ravenous power kevins soldiers screamed as the lightning swirled through them frying lungs and knocking dozens to the ground among the smoking ruin of the dead the rest of the soldiers gathered themselves raised their shields and charged stay clear of the doorway aurelia shouted to the four take out those who make it through they listened and even if she hadnt said so they most likely would have figured it out anyway from her hands tore another blast of magic this time of fire the inferno bathed over the men struggling to enter the room turning their shields to ash their armor to liquid with barely a moment to breathe she unleashed a second burst of fire refusing to relent shed seen their numbers when they entered the castle each one she killed was one less to threaten her family one less to keep harruq from safety the four with her looked on awe and wonder etched across their faces only a rare few made it through such overwhelming destruction and they were easily dispatched by the guards aurelia collapsed to one knee after the last spurt of fire ignoring the momentary dizziness blood had begun to pound through her veins and despite the strain she suddenly felt shockingly alive it was more than she could say for the fools allied with kevin maryll somehow convinced they could defeat a sorceress like her so far the last barrage seemed to have cowed them for they did not try to enter and they stayed far from doors edges its only five of us she shouted to them a dark grin on her face is this all you can do she stood her fingers dancing before the others could stop her she rushed out into the hall twirling on her feet her first spell unleashed great flashes of light from her palms blinding any unfortunate enough to be watching when it went off all around her aurelia saw soldiers gathering at least a hundred on either side she felt a thrill surge through her pride in the danger she represented gregory was under her protection nearly half of kevins forces coming to take him but they could not surpass her they couldnt even begin to understand the raw power they faced arms spread wide she unleashed that power from either hand arced lightning bouncing from man to man igniting their nerves burning the flesh beneath their armor letting out a scream aurelia poured more strength into the spell the lightning focused became a beam that blasted through her enemies punching holes in their armor and ripping men in twain it continued down either side of the hall the power of its shockwave knocking to the ground even those who the beam had missed and then the spell passed and she stood alone before the survivors blowing them a kiss she stumbled back into the room collapsing in the arms of one of the soldiers buy me time she said pushing herself off him the four stood side by side swords ready it seemed even they were afraid of the carnage shed unleashed it almost made her laugh if only theyd seen her in woodhaven dueling the prophet now that had been a fight she stepped back already feeling better it felt like forever since shed been forced to battle in such a way pushed to her very limits to protect the lives of those she loved she wouldnt say she missed it but she couldnt deny the thrill it gave her the four guards tensed but it seemed like the remaining soldiers had no desire to challenge herthough she wasnt certain just how many soldiers shed even left out there to fight just when she was thinking things might be easier than she hoped she saw a small painfully familiar sphere roll to a stop just before the soldiers feet get back she screamed knowing it was already too late her magic useless she could do nothing as a man and women wearing matching red and gray outfits vaulted into the room twisting and turning to avoid the guards useless defenses their twin daggers lashed out finding openings in their armor desperate aurelia ripped a chunk out of the wall and hurled it with her mind the momentum continuing on despite coming into range of the voidsphere one of the soldiers had his throat slit and as he fell the stone slammed into him knocking him into the hallway the assassin before him tumbled aside at the last moment avoiding the hit aurelia held in a swear as she readied her staff with the guards dead the two assassins rolled a second voidsphere toward her chasing after it with frightening speed aurelia twirled her staff reminding herself that harruq was faster shed fought him before which meant shed faced the deadliest there could be with her elven grace she shifted and spun her body like water as she avoiding a combination of thrusts and slashes her staff continued spinning knocking aside the attacks she could not avoid the exhaustion the pressure of such intense focus wore on aurelia quickly and it took all her willpower to fight down the panic she felt rising in her there was no way she could win retreating with each step she would soon have nowhere to go no way to fight back with such proximity to the voidsphere she felt naked deprived twice she tried to shift the fight toward it so she could smash it with her staff but the assassins seemed to be aware of her ploy at last she couldnt keep up the necessary speed she shifted her body left when it should have gone right and with a cry she felt the tip of a dagger pierce her shoulder a heel connected with her midsection and then an elbow struck her across the face when she fell to her knees fists rained down upon her knocking her to the ground and stealing the breath from her lungs fighting back tears she pushed herself off the floor only to be beaten again defeated she lay there struggling for air the stone cold against her cheek she stared at the entrance to the room as one of the assassins sat atop her binding her wrists together mere feet in front of her lay the voidsphere glowing its soft mocking rainbow of colors as if from another world she heard aubrienna and gregory crying and the helplessness the inability to go to them gave her far more pain than the bleeding wound in her shoulder through her tears she watched lord kevin maryll stride into the room dragging the queen along by the arm even knowing youd be difficult you still surprise me with your tenacity kevin said shaking his head and smiling at her the female assassin grabbed her by the hair and yanked her head up as she let out a cry the assassin scooped up the voidsphere and jammed it into her mouth her slender fingers pushed overriding her gag reflex to shove the object farther down her throat her body heaved followed by an unstoppable coughing fit as the assassin pulled away her fingers but there was little aurelia could do as she swallowed the voidsphere bringing its accursed denial of magic down into her very stomach harruq will kill you aurelia said as her face was shoved back to the floor will he now kevin moved aside his grin spreading behind him were two more of his strange assassins into the room they stepped and with a heave they dumped before her the unconscious body of her husband the first thing harruq realized when he came to was that for some reason he was still alive the second was a distant sound like a wailing that he couldnt place the third was that his chest hurt worse than any sword wound hed ever suffered before when he opened his mouth to cry out he felt something hard strike him across the face stop your screaming he heard a voice say from the darkness harruq didnt recognize it but he knew it was the voice of someone he hated forcing his eyes wider the darkness became a blur of gray followed by color realizing where he was and what was going on the world suddenly came into focus with shocking clarity and speed kevin maryll stood before him holding a sword in his hand with his other hand he held his sister whose wrists were roped together before her all around harruq were the strange assassins with the gray masks over their faces more stunning to harruq besides being alive was that he was unbound in any way his temper flaring he moved to attack kevin assassins be damned but kevin took a step back and pointed to the side now now he said wouldnt want to do something wed regret harruq hesitated just long enough to glance in the direction kevin pointed his heart froze when he saw aurelia being held by one of the assassins her arms were behind her back and the woman holding her kept a dagger pressed against his wifes throat behind the gray mask the assassins eyes glinted as if hoping he would make a move he wondered why aurelia made no attempt to free herself with a spell even with a dagger at her throat and rope around her wrists he still trusted her to be resourceful enough to escape did one of them hold a voidsphere that had to be it despite the fact he didnt see one anywhere fair enough harruq said remaining put he felt his insides churn the pain in his chest flaring up again but he forced himself to ignore it im here were all here we can talk right yes we can kevin said he shoved the door shut behind him leaving him alone with his four assassins this is private but you can trust my friends here to keep their mouths shut as for you harruq id ask you to keep quiet as well difficult as it may be for once i need you to listen harruq nodded he glanced around trying to find his daughter and he spotted a strange stone dome in the far corner of the room muffled crying came from within as if following his gaze kevin let go of susan and approached the magical creation clever if a bit crude kevin said looking it over a good maul should break through in time your daughter is in there isnt she harruq leave her out of this harruq said i will if you do as i say this is a historic day a chance for humanity to save itself from its captors but youll need to do something for me you halfblood freak harruq shot a glance at his wife her eyes were glassed over but when she met his gaze he saw the helpless fury in them what is that harruq asked kevin put his back to the stone dome and gestured to susan i need you to kill my sister susan flinched as if shed been slapped but she stood tall glaring at her brother silently excuse me harruq asked you know you cannot leave this room alive kevin said stalking closer antonil named you steward and your false rule cannot be allowed to go on but your wife though your daughterthey can live do as i say and ill only exile them they can go live in the forests with the elves or the wedge with the dogs for all i care all you have to do is one simple little task harruq looked to susan trying to read her she softly shook her head this doesnt make sense harruq said the angels wont let you wont let me kevin interrupted he shot forward lashing out his knuckles slammed against harruqs mouth and it took all his selfcontrol to not respond wont let me that we require their permission for anything is proof enough i do what must be done dont you get it harruq you put so much faith in them even when i warned you not to those angels will not be able to lay a hand on me by the time they get here the castle will be mine with the crown upon my head and ill offer to go before the entire kingdom bearing witness that it was you the lowborn halforc that killed my sister and do you know what those angels will say then theyll tell all the world that i speak the truth the angels will know aurelia said wincing as the assassin holding her pressed the dagger tighter against her throat theyre not fools theyll figure out what youve done it doesnt matter kevin said shaking his head ive spent years telling the people of mordan that a time would come when the angels would make a play for power years and years insisting the angels would usurp our lords and kings this city is a hairs breadth away from riot as is this entire nation what do you think would happen if i the rightful heir to the throne after gregory and susans death were suddenly overthrown by our guardian angels can you imagine it the glorious rebellion rising up against them even if they kill me ill be a martyr for all mankind we must be made free we must escape the reach of their wings kevin gestured to his sister do it he said do it or watch your wife and daughter die it all felt like a bad dream one harruq had no way to wake up from slowly he walked over to susan putting a hand on her face she leaned against his touch her eyes meeting his my life is forfeit she whispered to him so do what you think is right i wont condemn you for that two of the assassins stood guard over kevin a third hovered by the door holding harruqs two swords the fourth kept hold of aurelia ensuring his wife made no move to escape harruq faced them all took in a deep breath ill do it he said kevin smiled then reached out a hand toward the assassin by the door instead of handing over one of his swords the assassin gave kevin his dagger im not a fool he said tossing the dagger at harruqs feet the last thing im giving you are the swords you killed a god with harruq grunted and carefully he bent down and picked the dagger up by the handle he didnt want to make any sudden movements for the one holding aurelia looked ready to draw blood at a moments notice the dagger felt tiny in his beefy hands turning to susan he slowly reached out grabbing the ropes around her wrists and tugging them free she dies with dignity harruq said glaring at kevin before he might protest you owe your sister that at least the lord waved a hand to show he accepted harruq turned back to susan stepped closer do you trust me he asked her she nodded good he lifted the dagger pulled it back to thrustand then turned and hurled it into the face of the assassin holding aurelia it punched through the cloth burying into an eye flinging susan to the ground harruq lunged for the assassin holding his swords his foe dropped them with one hand the assassin drew his remaining dagger with the other he reached outward lighting circled around his palm then streaked toward harruqs chest but this time he was ready and with a scream he crossed his arms and pushed onward denying the magic denying the pain dipping his body as if to grab for his swords he instead flung himself forward his body smashed into the assassins and together they collided with the door the hinges shook but held the same could not be said for the bones in the assassins chest as harruqs fists slammed into them a vicious elbow dislocated the vertebrae in his neck and down he dropped harruq turned surveying the battle in an instant with training long since beaten into him by haern aurelias hands were still bound behind her but instead of trying to free herself shed run forward ramming her stomach into the desk aubrienna had been drawing upon the impact bent her over and she vomited all across the ink scribblings one of the remaining two assassins rushed toward her and harruq panicked knowing he could not reach her in time her back was turned she couldnt escape but susan was free and as harruq scooped up his swords she dove between aurelia and the assassin she had no defense no weapon just her body with brutal efficiency the assassin thrust his dagger into her throat twisted it and then flung her aside you bastard harruq screamed legs pumping aurelia rolled off the desk and then harruq was there his swords blocking the downward thrust of the assassin their blades connected but harruqs body felt more alive than it had in ages compared to thulos the mans speed was nothing his skill substandard and with a single looping cut he batted aside the assassins defenses and then stabbed his swords deep into his chest roaring out his fury he kicked the body back and then settled into a defensive stance over his wife stay back kevin screamed as the lone assassin rushed to the stone dome fire circled around the mans hand just over the hole at the top stay back or they die harruq froze horrified by the thought of his beloved aubby burning to death kevin saw that hesitation and the victory was clear in his eyes it died the moment aurelia flung a lance of ice across the room its sharp point ripping through the last assassins chest spilling innards across the floor kevin lifted his sword in defense harruq stalked closer and if not for the death around him he might have laughed aurelia gave him no chance to show the man how outclassed he was ice shot from her fingers several bursts that wrapped around his wrists and ankles pinning him to the wall in vain he struggled against them his sword clattering harmlessly to the floor thats it kevin said face turning red from his struggling bring the angels have them hold me trial you want to see riots you want to see who the people truly believe in all this not you harruq said not anymore with one single swing he let out all his fury all his exhaustion and sorrow condemnation cut clean through his neck severing kevins head it hit the ground with a sickening plop growling like an animal harruq picked it up by the hair and then flung it out the window fucking lunatic he said shaking his head he heard aurelia let out a cry and he turned shed rushed to the dome and with a wave of her hand moved aside the rock tears ran down her face as the two children flung themselves against her holding on with desperate strength while they cried harruq wanted to relax wanted to go to them but they werent safe just yet he checked the door ensuring it was locked then wondered when the remaining soldiers might come looking for kevin no doubt hed wanted susans death to come about in private where no one could contradict him to the angels perhaps that might buy them time harruq said a voice the halforc turned unsure where itd come from he saw ahaesarus leaning into the window one foot on the ledge his wings flapping to keep him balanced he was too big to fit inside but he could see within i saw the scepter the angel said as harruq approached the doors are locked and they would not allow me entrance youre about five minutes too late harruq said kevins dead his men attacked the castle hoping to usurp the throne a shadow spread across the angels face as he listened are you safe where you are harruq glanced about shrugged safe as anywhere in this castle good ahaesarus pushed off from the ledge where are you going the angel leader drew his sword to get more of my kind he said with that ahaesarus flew away staggering toward aurelia harruq passed susans body he leaned down once put a hand on her face so he might close her eyes im so sorry he whispered thank you for trusting me im sorry i didnt do better i should have i he let it go instead went to his wife he fell to his knees beside her wrapping her in his arms i thought wed lose her aurelia said glancing over at him tears ran down her face but shed composed herself well enough never harruq said kissing her forehead before taking aubrienna into his arms where she curled up against his chest never again daniel stood in the top floor of the blood tower feeling very old itd been eleven years since sir robert had died and control of the wall of towers passed over to him staring out the window at the river beyond he wished anyone else had taken his place in the aftermath of the gods war someone younger someone with energy because as he watched in vain for another boat to return knowing it would not he felt too damn tired to do anything about it this is your fault antonil he muttered as he turned away for once couldnt you have looked to this countrys defense instead of your old homes for years hed requested more soldiers and for years hed been denied at first it was because everyone was needed to help rebuild the land then came the first failed campaign to retake the east followed by the even larger second and through it all good men men he needed to man the boats and patrol the wildlands of the vile wedge were instead sent to die in a foreign land whenever someone would whisper the title the missing king daniel had always made sure his ears were deaf to it the last thing he wanted was to punish one of his few men for saying something he actually agreed with daniel descended the steps of the tower and stepped out into the bright light of the full moon his two hundred men were out and about as per his orders something was amiss he felt it in his gut and so hed kept them awake not even bothering to assign shifts the signs were too similar to before made all the more frightening by their suddenness has johnson returned daniel asked as he approached the docks several men were gathered there and they all shook their heads not yet said one of the men daniel was hardly surprised but he tried not to let his frustration show keep looking he said he spun making his way to the wall that surrounded the tower before dipping into the shallower portions of the river he climbed the steps then looked out across the gihon patrols walked past and he squinted against the light of their torches two days ago it had started thered been no warning no casualties no reports of deaths like when the wolfmen first started preying on the people of durham marking their eventual assault no one night his boats simply had not returned he sent out two more one north one south the one north had been a patrol the one south to check with tower red to see if they had encountered anything unusual the northern boat never returned and so far theyd yet to receive word from the south glancing at the full moon he felt the pale orb put fear into his blood something was definitely wrong and no matter what it might be he didnt have the manpower to fight it an hour before hed sent out a rider to the castle of the yellow rose to plead for aid from lord hemman beyond that there was little he could do but wait and pray sir one of the patrolmen shouted rushing alongside the wall and waving his arms to get his attention yes daniel asked turning a boat at the docks daniel felt his tension easing perhaps it wasnt as dire as he thought is it johnson or someone from red i dont know said the soldier i just saw it from the wall daniel climbed down the steps to the ground and he saw many other soldiers hurrying toward the docks as well he couldnt blame them a bunch of nervous men stuck armed and ready with nothing to do but wait the crowd parted easily enough and when daniel caught sight of the boat his hopes were dashed the man from tower red looked pale and he saluted daniel upon his arrival sir the man said iforgive me i dont know how to say it tower red is gone gone daniel asked feeling ice thickening around his spine the goatmen he said they rushed us from the wedge thousands of them i managed to escape during the attack i was ordered to i swear i aint no coward but they smashed down the doors of the tower like they were nothing and against that many we couldntwe daniel grabbed his shoulders and shook him to force him to calm deep breaths soldier he said tell me again how many at least two thousand the man said please we have to get help we have to go back there they might still from beyond the river came a single highpitched shriek following it were thousands more a sound so painful that daniel clutched his hands to his head his fingers jammed into his ears he knew that sound though never in such terrifying volume to your places he screamed hoping they heard his voice above the noise man the walls and form ranks along the river he drew his own sword and rushed to the nearest staircase leading up to the wall before he even reached the top he saw the swarm growing on the opposite side of the river birdmen a veritable legion flapping their wings and shrieking like the wild things they were their feet were long their claws sharp and the river was a paltry defense against them everyone along the river he shouted realizing the birdmen intended no delay no siege to prevent flight the water roiled as the creatures dove into it using their wide flightless wings to push them forward when he was back on solid ground daniel grabbed the nearest man and yanked him close get to the stable he shouted into the mans face determined to be heard over the chaos sir he asked his eyes were wide but he appeared to be in control of himself take the fastest horse and ride to the yellow rose they have to know this isnt just a single pack then what do i tell him it is daniel glanced at the river where the first of the birdmen were being hacked to death by his soldiers as they attempted to scramble out of the water tell them its an army he said the whole damn vile wedge has come for blood now go he shoved the man back then rushed to the river they had just enough men to form a single line along the shore with the water slowing the beasts the advantage was theirs at least for a short while daniel thrust his sword letting a birdman impale itself on the blade while its enormous beak snapped futilely at his neck he twisted the handle before kicking the creature off then he swung again and again batting at a second birdman that flapped free of the river with an awkward gait his sword easily crushed its thin bones all around him men screamed as beaks snapped down on their arms and long raptor claws raked against their exposed flesh two hundred against thousands thought daniel as he continued to hack and slash but what more could they do other than buy time for his rider daniel thought of the people beyond the farmlands that waited like ripened berries for the beasts to pluck two towers falling in the same night what did it mean fall back he screamed bodies of the dead floated all throughout the river obstacles against the remaining forces but too many birdmen were making it clear of the water fall back to the tower daniel led the way his old legs pumping as hard as they could others passed him by younger and faster than he from behind he heard screams wet snapping sounds and overwhelming it all was that continuous mindnumbing shriek into the tower he ran several soldiers stood at the door watching the moment the last man entered they slammed it shut flinging the heavy bolts in place immediately the door shook as bodies smashed into the other side digging soon followed sharp claws scratching grooves into the thick wood find anything you can to block the door with daniel ordered before climbing the stairs his bones ached but he ignored the pain easily enough for even on good days his body gave him trouble to the very top of the tower he climbed opening a hatch in the ceiling he grabbed a wrapped package from his closet then up he went climbing onto the small flat space other than a few stacked stones there was nothing to keep him from falling and on his knees he overlooked the surrounding area the full moon kept the land lit and he directed his gaze to the river the birdmen continued swimming across at least three thousand he guessed as the creatures swarmed throughout the inner compound looking like a horde of vermin from that height a few failed to climb the sides of the stone the rest taking turns scratching at the door daniel shook his head knowing it would not take long before the door fell goatmen birdmen daniels gut told him the wolfmen were a part of it as well a coordinated attack he shivered to think of who could ally the beasts together it was their constant squabbling that had kept their numbers in check for all these years their inherent hatred of each other that had protected the people on the other side of the river from any real danger but somehow that was gone ashhur help us all he said he unwrapped the package the gold of the scepter shone in the moonlight daniel lifted it above him and spoke the command word the blue pillar shot into the sky the beacon visible for miles upon miles he stared at it daring to have hope twice more he activated it and each time he noticed the birdmen below staring up as if mesmerized he wondered what the creatures pathetic brains thought of the light perhaps they knew what it meant after all theyd coordinated an assault on multiple towers despite his years not to mention his experience he still hadnt given enough credit to the beasts where are you daniel muttered staring at the sky hed never called for the angels before but this seemed as perfect a time as any at least he might inform them of the attack ensuring that the riders he sent to lord hemman didnt have their warnings go unheeded the minutes passed interminable due to the constant squawking and screeching at last he saw white wings they were almost above him by the time he spotted them for they came from the east daniel raised his arms waving but something was wrong the wings were even larger than he expected and as the creature dipped he realized it wasnt an angel at all but a winged horse two people rode atop it their bodies just faint silhouettes slowly he lowered his hands and he felt his innards tighten silent he watched as the horse circled twice then continued west from the horse shot a blinding object an arrow daniel realized as it smashed into one of the birdmen it was only one and then they were gone flying toward the castle of the yellow rose the acknowledgement made daniel feel better but only by a miniscule amount at least someone else one of the elven ekreissar apparently would help spread the tale perhaps an army might be raised in time perhaps thousands of lives might be spared from below he heard the shattering of wood and he glanced down to see the tower doors had broken his men fought bravely using the cramped space of the doorway to their advantage but defeat was inevitable he had barely fifty men left against three thousand what could they do one last time he used the scepter calling ashhurs name so the light would pierce the night as it faded and the starlight replaced it he let out a sigh wherever the angels were it wasnt where they were needed from his limp hand he let the scepter drop down the side of the tower it fell smashing as it hit ground a puff of blue smoke rose from the pieces drifting away to nothingness as the birdmen swarmed through the gateway killing their way ever higher at last he heard movement from the hatch which hed left open drawing his sword he turned a single creature came climbing upward its wings making it difficult for the thing to get a grip on the rungs daniel shoved his sword down its throat then kicked in its beak it fell the noise alerting the rest to his presence the monsters scrambled upward biting at his thrusts using their impressive strength to hurl themselves at the hatch ignoring the ladder altogether daniel laughed as he fought thinking he might be able to kill them off one at a time brawling as the hours passed and he whittled the thousands down at the ridiculously slow pace that thought didnt last long one of the birdmens beaks locked tight when he stabbed it straight through its throat and into the back of the brain it fell hurdling backward so violently that it yanked the sword from daniels hand weaponless he backed toward the edge of the tower preparing himself he would not be their food a single step and off hed go falling the ground to be his killer instead of the freakish leftovers of a longforgotten war the first birdman made it to the top of tower but it did not find the easy prey it expected a heavy gust of air blew daniel away from the ledge and then a man came falling from the sky a long blade in hand the man an elf stabbed the creature through the eye upon landing then kicked it down to join the rest of the bodies in daniels room that damn girl is going to be the death of me the elf said glancing over his shoulder as he settled into a stance before the hatch consider yourself fortunate for the eagerness of youth behind him daniel heard the winged horse let out a neigh and when he turned he saw the creature hovering just beyond the ledge a young woman sat atop it reaching for him take my hand she shouted and before he lost his nerve he did just that his step was not far enough and as she yanked he fell with his stomach bent over the horses back that appeared good enough and into the air they shot leaving the elf behind dont take us far the girl shouted as daniel hung on for dear life what he shouted back not you less than a quartermile beyond the tower was a stretch of forest and the horse landed at its edge daniel slipped off thrilled to be on solid ground barely slowing the pair hooked around and swooped back toward the tower daniel watched while on his knees trying to regain his breath he felt overwhelmed pulled back from certain death to a sudden reprieve at the same time he knew his men were gone his tower overrun he didnt know how to feel other than sick and exhausted even from the forest he could hear the sounds of the birdmen and it filled him with shivers moments later he saw the horse and he was glad to see both had survived they landed with a burst of wind both the elf and the girl hopping off are you all right she asked him i am thanks to you he said this isnt good said the elf a frown locked across his features sonowin cannot carry the three of us then we run the girl offered indeed the elf turned to him except for you get back on sonowin will take you to safety if you guide her no daniel said i wont be a burden like that youre not said the elf i need you to raise an army and send out warnings to all the nearby villages at least three towers have fallen from what weve seen it wont be long before the rest are gone and the entire north is being overrun reluctantly daniel climbed back atop the horse wishing there was at least a saddle the creature swung her head side to side neighing loudly head southwest he told her can you understand southwest the horse bobbed her head snorting her wings flared wide and he guessed the intelligent creature did he looked down at his rescuers they each stood tall with long bows in hand what will you two do he asked dont worry the elf said sonowin will come find us and until then well he glanced to the girl her face was haggard and scarred and despite looking like shed endured a nightmare she smiled until then we go hunting she said lifting her bow sonowins wings beat harder and away into the air they went daniel watched the two vanish into the forest before turning his attention to where they flew leaning closer so the horse could hear his words and see his actions he pointed in the direction where he thought the nearby castle waited fly on he said and the horse obeyed daniel settled back in his arms wrapped around the creatures neck to keep him secure still exhausted he said a prayer for his dead men as well as his saviors it made him sad when he realized hed never even asked them their names perhaps he thought if the world was kind hed get another chance the old soldier shook his head a kind world what an insane thought onward they flew as far behind him the birdmen emptied out from the walls of blood tower and continued on heading for where the farms and villages slumbered ezekai circled staring down at the town of norstrom as the wind blew through his hair he should land he knew he should land though no scepter had called for his aid his fine eyes could clearly see the mob gathering below in the square that they did not call him was unsurprising whenever he talked with the rest of his kind they said the same the use of the scepters was dwindling and exclusively for those in need of healing ever since that one night theyd given the humans the justice they desired things had changed deep down ezekai knew itd never be the same he saw the way the people looked at him there was fear now just fear no love to match the love in his own eyes that ahaesarus had repealed the decision and revoked their right as executioners of the guilty seemed not to matter still the mob below was growing and he could not ignore what was happening ezekai dipped his wings and down to the square he flew landing with a gust of wind and dust over a hundred men and women gathered there and they begrudgingly made room for his landing to call the reception cold did not give the icy feeling justice quickly he took in his surroundings in the center still being built was another pole the nearby rope showed its eventual purpose in the arms of two men knelt a woman her face beaten and her clothes torn what is going on here ezekai asked trying his hardest to keep his temper in check none of your concern angel said the same man that had denied him before back when theyd hung saul and who are you to challenge me names david he said and we dont want your justice were capable of doing that ourselves bella heres guilty as sin and we all know it the crowd gave its enthusiastic support to the statement the bound woman however did her best to rise to her feet though the two men prevented her from going to him please she yelled to ezekai please help me for what crime do you capture and beat this woman ezekai asked bella poisoned my little girl another woman yelled she spoke neither truth nor lie only an accusation she firmly believed thered be nothing useful from her but ezekai prodded anyway poisoned why jealous david said we all know it too jealous of marys girl bella has no girl of her own and shes whored herself about this village trying to get one bella opened her mouth to speak but one of the men holding her wrapped his arm about her head shoving his forearm against her mouth to muffle her words the crowd took up shouting demanding her life demanding she hang others called out for her to suffer and the feeling of loathing and hatred made ezekai physically ill his wings shook behind him tiny vibrations he could not stop let her speak he said hoping to at least make things right let me hear her words and judge the truth of the matter we dont need your truth david said weve got people who saw her doing it thats right another man said stepping forward i saw her putting shit into the girls cup me too said a third a heavyset man with a beard i asked her what but she said she didnt do nothing but i know what i saw ezekais eyes widened and he felt pain in his chest they were lying both men lying about what they saw all to justify the hatred in their heart what had this woman done was it because she was a whore or did the love for marys daughter demand a scapegoat for them someone to blame the man gagging bella yelled and pulled back his arm blood was smeared across the womans face from biting him i didnt do it she shrieked at the top of her lungs theyre liars all of them i didnt do it her words struck him like a sledge she spoke truth beaten mocked hatedand innocent yet despite his arrival men had continued building frantically setting up the pole with a hook at the top for them to loop the rope about the other end would be for her neck to snap her spine and crush her throat shes innocent ezekai said first softly then louder innocent dont you all know what it is you do are you calling us liars one of the supposed witnesses demanded i am ezekai roared i call you fools i call you bitter and petty release that girl and let those who laid a hand on her in violence step forth you arent in charge here david said and the cries of the crowd affirmed their agreement be gone angel we know why the babe died and we know who did it fly away just a babe then not even a child fury continued to grow in his breast was it an illness was it something he could have prevented if only they had swallowed their pride and used their scepter to summon him how many would die because of their hatred and mistrust stop it ezekai said as a third man wrapped the end of a rope around bellas neck i said stop it now i will not watch an innocent die the crowd yelled louder the men surrounding ezekai pulled out whatever weaponry they owned hatchets and knives and fieldworn scythes theyd been ready for him the angel realized they knew he might arrive for ashhurs sake they probably saw him circling above i said stop ezekai insisted dont do this all of you youre sick youre caught up in this ugliness this hatred i wont allow it i cant allow it they flung the other end of the rope around the hook grabbed it as it fell back down such insolence such blatant insult to continue on before him his law meant nothing to them he saw it so clearly now the men stared weapons ready there to defy him in saving an innocent life bella continued sobbing her voice strained by the tightness of the rope slowly ezekai drew his sword an emotion bubbled in him one he couldnt quite place he looked to these people he loved these sinful creatures and realized he didnt love them anymore if this is how it must be he whispered he flapped his wings lunging forward as three men grabbed the rope in preparation to pull david was the first to step in his way but with a single powerful cut ezekai sliced his body in twain a step a spin and his sword arced out cutting down three more men before they could bring their weapons to bear against him panicked screams echoed from the crowd half the mob turned to flee the other half rushing the angel ezekai cut again and again keeping them at bay so they could not overwhelm him meanwhile the three men pulled on the rope lifting bella into the air she clutched at her neck gasping silently as her face began to turn red damn you all ezekai roared taking to the air his sword sliced through the rope and before she could fall he caught her in one arm when he landed he pulled at the noose around her neck trying to loosen it so she might breathe before he could he felt something sharp pierce his side and he let out a cry of pain spinning about he cut the head off the man whod stabbed him then tried to turn back to bella men leapt atop him pulling at the tender bones of his wings wrapping their arms about his neck he yelled for them to stop pleaded as he flung them aside the rope it wasnt loose yet it wasnt another stabbing pain and he had no choice but to turn his sword did its work their pathetic instruments nothing compared to his blade still they rushed him and still he couldnt understand why why this anger why such hatred and loathing even their fear was obvious yet they wouldnt flee like dogs they died rabid dogs and he put them down words flashed in his mind thoughts he didnt want to think killer reaper demon was it their thoughts or his could he even know the bodies around him grew in number until at last none stood to face him the rest fleeing back to their homes or the fields beyond bleeding from a multitude of wounds ezekai turned around he still had healing magic in him knew there was always hope if the woman lived but kneeling before bella he found her an empty shell her soul had moved on and he prayed it went to a far better place than this miserable world innocent he whispered touching her cooling face with his bloodied palm an innocent murderedand why he stood flared his wings and lifted his sword as he cast his judging eyes upon the village why he screamed he took to the air flying faster than an arrow like a ram he blasted into the nearest home sword drawn he looked upon the family within people who had shouted out their anger people who had done nothing to stop the bloodshed he judged them as he did to those the next home and the people who fled down the streets looping into the sky he found those in the fields those who knelt begging and pleading as if it might mean something anymore he judged them all until his armor was soaked with blood and his sword felt heavy with the weight of a hundred souls judged until there were none left to judge outside their village he landed nearly crashing to the ground in delirium he crawled to a nearby stone pulled himself atop it and sobbed he slammed his sword into the dirt he beat his chest and he let his tears flow why had they done it what monstrosity filled their souls that they would let such a thing happen he was supposed to protect them was that not why ashhur had sent him to this world to chase off the demons and safeguard the populace before it was all lost to darkness but the darkness was already there itd already won long before he and his ilk had arrived in every heart hed felt their sin felt their anger jealousy lust and fear he didnt know how long he knelt there it might have been minutes might have been hours slowly he felt himself returning to some shred of sanity there before that forest he realized that it was quiet he no longer felt their presence like a thorn in his mind he no longer heard their cries of anger there were none left to sin none left to spit in the face of their god and deny the gifts freely given to them there was nothing no weight on his shoulders justemptiness absolute blessed emptiness a shadow crossed over ezekai marking someones arrival he looked up the blood fresh on him his actions clearly revealed the words of the newcomer broke the silence and they were so sincere so seductive i understand im sorry for the long flight ahaesarus told him shouting to be heard over the whipping wind my arms hurt harruq shouted back he hung beneath the angel as they flew over the land his life literally in the angels hands should ahaesarus let go of his wrists hed fall and no matter how strong he was harruq knew hed splatter upon hitting the ground below it is not far now not far still meant another ten minutes and harruq endured best he could his shoulders ached feeling like they were about to be yanked from their sockets to get his mind off the pain he watched the land below the hills slowly flattening as they traveled farther south the grass grew taller wilder and soon he saw clusters of trees that grew thicker and thicker until they were fullblown forests idly he wondered what would happen if he were to be dropped onto those trees would the limbs spear him dead or perhaps the leaves slow his fall he really really didnt want to find out how far again he asked you have the patience of a child the temper too ahaesaruss wings spread wide and tilted downward then for both our sakes i am glad we are here here was a village bordering the northern edge of the forest other than being on the smaller side harruq could tell little as to why the angel had been so insistent to fly him here ahaesarus circled once then finished their descent with an unceremonious plop harruq dropped to the ground rolled once then stood he brushed the dirt from his armor as he glanced around it was midday so most of the men were gone working in the fields he assumed women gave him curious looks from their windows and harruq felt thankful none appeared afraid one or two even waved which now that he thought of it was strange it was the outlying villages that were growing the angriest with the angels justice those on kers border the most willing to succumb to violence yet as ahaesarus landed beside him there was only joy on the faces of children that came running to gather at their feet did you bring us something they asked did you ahaesarus pulled a large bag off his back and opened it from within he drew two sweet cakes they were already crumbling from the flight and he broke them further into pieces the children scrambled for them until they were gone harruq watched hiding his smile he still felt uneasy and that he was confused helped matters none follow me ahaesarus said not far from where they landed was a house larger than the others attached to a shed almost as large one of the children beat them to its door and a moment later a women in her forties stepped out you are late she said i was burdened ahaesarus said handing over the sack such excuses the woman said she nodded at harruq do we get to cook him too harruq blinked uh no shame youre a beefy one she gave him a wink then hauled the sack into her house while calling out several names to come help her ahaesarus watched her go then turned to harruq who had finally lost patience whats in the bag he asked why do they all love you here bribing them with gold not gold flour ahaesarus beckoned for him to follow again and as they walked to the forest the angel explained we havent located all of the demons he said though dieredon and his ekreissar killed many a few escaped and fled here to this forest this village used to live on the meat of their hunts but the demons killed recklessly far more than they could have eaten it is as if their rage against the very world made them lose control the people here were afraid to hunt for many died trying even the animals eventually fled their wrath are the demons still here harruq asked his hands reaching for the hilts of his swords was that why the angel had brought him to help hunt down and kill the last of thuloss kind no ahaesarus said as they exited the village they left several months ago to where i do not know but by then the people here they were hungry their forest stripped cleanthey were starving when i found them such a small village they did not have a scepter to summon us and it was only by chance i flew overhead before them was the forest and ahaesarus crossed his arms and stared within the last of their hunters are in there he said they are proud and in vain they search for deer squirrel even a game bird in time such prey will return now that the demons have fled but not soon enough the flour harruq said remembering the sack you fly all this way just to bring them flour i do he said every day for the past month ive made this flight back and forth from avlimar in doing so i have learned something harruq something i would pass on to you you are to be the steward of mordan for years to come and i believe this wisdom may benefit you as well as it has me even more so i want you to learn it before it is too late the angel folded his wings against his back and sat in the grass realizing they werent going anywhere for a while harruq sat opposite him shifting his swords so their sheaths did not poke into the ground well he asked he tried to be flippant about it hed always felt uncomfortable with these moments when someone was trying to give him personal advice but the solemnness in ahaesarus made his tone feel childish crossing his arms he looked to the side berating himself so he would listen ashhurs land fades from my mind with every passing day ahaesarus said he lifted an open hand and stared at it i once touched the garment of my god yet now i cannot remember his face held in these fingers heldyet now i hold a sword with every breath i take i become more like the man i was being here in this land among this pain and despair it tears at me tears at every one of my kind we came from the sky with swords with spears our armor shining brighter than the sun itself but weve erred harruq weve erred and i fear it runs too deep for us to heal the silence lingered how the halforc dared ask every day i bring this village food ahaesarus said and every day i remember the lives i am to protect we were never meant to rule harruq never meant to be law and executioner were trying to change the world but well never succeed not like this through law we tried to conform man to ashhurs grace what fools we were we cant make forgiveness law we cant enforce grace with a sword this food i bring has done far more good than i have ever brought about with my blade we werent meant to be masters of this world we were meant to be servants it is from the hearts of men not their courts that we shall spread our light jerico once told me how before the citadel fell he worked the fields with the men in the village he was to preach to yet we angels fly above mankind separate watchful im afraid harruq im so afraid they feel a judging gaze not a loving one what does that mean harruq asked trying to wrap his mind around it all will you put aside your sword ahaesarus shook his head no sometimes a servant must protect his master but things must change and it will not be easy in this i fear i am a minority among my own kind who are we angels of ashhur to bow down and wash the feet of sinners to bleed and sweat beside them but they have forgotten we are men same as you and each day we must decide to obey our lord lest we fall our wings have not freed us of that need harruq stood and put a hand on the ahaesaruss enormous shoulder we dont deserve a guardian like you he said yet he has sent me anyway which i think was the point could you find a greater pair of sinners than my brother and i yet side by side you fought with us many of your kind even dying for us no wound runs too deep not for this we just have some work to do is all ahaesarus smiled at him and he rose to his feet mordan is blessed to have you as its steward he said i wouldnt go that far these arent happy times and the days ahead dont look too sunny either now grab my arms and lets go i have a little brats coronation to prepare for it was another parade this one far more somber the whole affair seemed almost sickening to harruq as he checked over his armor thered be no more chants for the missing king at least no young lasses vying for his attention the celebration was a sham a forced event are you certain of antonils death ahaesarus asked standing with him in the castle hallway little late to change our minds now harruq said but yeah im certain aurelia knew before anyone because of tarlaks message and kevin all but confirmed it with his attack the halforc let out a sigh staring off into nowhere as he fought back a wave of sadness ahaesarus sensed it easily enough and put a large hand on his shoulder tarlak was a great man he said and even in death he saved lives i assure you his entry into ashhurs golden land was met with much rejoicing harruq forced himself to chuckle yeah he said tarlak would have appreciated a lot of fanfare ahaesarus smiled for a time before it faded it seemed he could not keep his mind on happier matters we must discover how antonils army was defeated the angel said that kevin acted so quicklyit implies he had a hand in what transpired and knew the same moment aurelia did just as troubling is the magic set in place to interfere with your wifes spellcasting weve removed the runes but that still leaves us to discover who made them there is also the matter of the reports weve received about the north of a supposed invasion i know harruq said interrupting him but right now one thing at a time a side door opened and aurelia stepped out she smiled at them then moved aside so gregory could follow harruq grunted surprised at how much taller he looked somehow regal in his deep reds and silvers despite his age ive cast a glammer upon him aurelia said looking him over it should make him seem a little taller and a little older nothing too obvious of course but i think itll help gregory looked terrified but he stood straight enough aurelia took his hand and he squeezed it tight lets go she said the city needs to see its steward enjoy your walk ahaesarus said i will meet you at the platform guards opened the door and the three of them stepped out immediately those nearby bowed in respect to the little prince gregory harruq watched trying to decide if it was forced or genuine in the end he didnt know glancing down he saw gregory still holding onto aurelias hand let go he said leaning down and whispering to the boy youre to be a king im sorry but no choice here gregory wasnt happy about it but he let go nonetheless through the streets they walked flanked on either side by soldiers it felt like forever but at last they reached the platform at the bottom harruqs heart ached knowing tarlak would not be waiting there with antonil and susan so many lost so many he didnt know if he could endure it anymore the war was over the deaths were supposed to stop that was how it worked wasnt it when they reached the platform harruq saw how tall the steps were thered be no way for gregory to climb them with any sort of dignity so he picked up the child and hefted him straight up onto the platform after that he followed taking aurelias hand in his all around were soldiers and they knelt in respect gregory stood in the center and as theyd told him repeatedly he looked to the sky with that as the signal the angels flocked down taking up positions all throughout the city their white wings decorated the rooftops lined the walls and filled the streets the entire host of avlimar was present there to pay respects to the boy king ahaesarus was the only one to actually come and greet gregory he landed with a heavy gust of wind then dipped his head gregory copernus consider me honored to be given such a privilege he said in his hands he held the crown harruq had worn the halforc would remain steward until gregory came of age but still they needed the ceremony to reinforce gregorys eventual right to rule to all of mordan harruq watched as gregory dipped his head and ahaesarus set the crown on his head it was laughably oversized ahaesarus lifted it off immediately after setting it beside gregory on his seat thank you gregory said he looked ready to cry and harruq couldnt blame him the honor is ours said the angel harruq was supposed to then address the crowd but before he could a great rumbling shook the land scattered cries marked its continuing and harruq felt aurelia grab his hand in fear mouth open harruq looked to the sky and he was not alone the shock overwhelmed him as the sound rolled over the crowd a massive explosion nearly deafening to hear ashhur help us whispered ahaesarus from the sky the city of avlimar fell crumbling to pieces the gold and silver shattering across the fields beyond mordeinas walls its spires broke its streets crashing down upon green earth as whatever magic holding the city aloft ceased to be panicked angels took flight soaring toward the ruins as all around men and women watched in awe aurelia squeezed harruqs hand tight what does it mean she asked as gregory began to cry i dont know harruq said while a third rumble like that of thunder marked the last of the eternal citys fall epilogue the land before the apprentice tower was a blackened heap with nary a blade of grass still green through the ash walked cecil just one of many sent out into the mess carefully he made his way through the melted armor wincing at the stains the bodies left on his red apprentices robe the destruction had been most impressive with each of the apprentices competing for the most efficient kill cecil had smashed four with a boulder hed flung from the sky the massive hunk of rock crushing over a dozen more as it rolled along before coming to a halt despite what esmere claimed he was sure hed gotten the most of any please no he heard someone say to his left he glanced over saw one of the younger apprentices killing a survivor a soldier tough enough to live despite the burns covering his body cecil barely knew the apprentice and that he had to use a dagger instead of his own magic to enforce the kill showed how new he was to the art cecil found a collection of bodies and he knelt down beside the more intact ones listening two were silent but a third still held breath with careful movements of his fingers he summoned a thin lance of frost forming it before him from thin air it shimmered then pierced the mans throat blood flowed the lance melted instantly and then the breathing halted on and on cecil went killing whatever survivors he found there were so many though that soon sweat covered his brow they were but thirty apprentices scouring the corpses of thousands even with none able to provide a fight it was still heavy work after half an hour and with hardly a word spoken between the apprentices cecil began making his way back toward the front of the killing field careful to make sure there were none he missed if even one man survived there would be consequences despite his many years at the towers cecil still felt a shudder run up his spine at the thought he shoved fire down the throats of a few more bodies just to be sure even when he heard no breathing finally deciding he was done he hurried back toward the tower and it was then he heard a cough stunned cecil looked down and to the left barely a foot away was the charred corpse of a soldier his armor was melted but in it were flecks of gold the king cecil realized he wondered if there would be any sort of reward for being the one to find the body but that was for later there was no way the king had survived but the way he was laying shoving the corpse off he found another man hidden beneath his face and hands were terribly burned his yellow robes spotted with black from where the fabric had been consumed by fire cecils brow furrowed the burn marks looked strange though he couldnt put his finger on why they appeared that way was it how uneven they were perhaps shrugging his shoulders he opened the palm of his hand amazing as it was that the man lived he was clearly in terrible pain his breathing came in wheezes and though he glared at cecil with bloodshot eyes he couldnt speak a word cecil was clearly doing him a favor in the palm of his hand appeared a small ball of fire before he could throw it the burned man lifted his hand and from his own palm sparked a thin tendril of lightning it struck cecil in the arm igniting his nerves his fingers twitched breaking the spell temper flaring he kicked the stupid bastard in the side some fight left after all he asked the burned man had nothing to say his body settled back as if resigned to death the fire grew in cecils palm wait cecil recognized that voice and immediately he dismissed his spell spun around and fell to his knees roand the flame lord of the council stood before him with his arms crossed his gaze locked on the badly burned man for a long moment his master thought in silence and cecil felt the hairs on his neck stand up had he somehow made a mistake the seconds dragged on until at last roand spoke bring him inside without hesitation cecil rushed to grab the burned mans arm three more apprentices quickly joined in and together the four carried him across the field through the doors and into the tower where behind them the doors eased shut with nary a sound
