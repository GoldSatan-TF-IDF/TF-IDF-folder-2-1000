mary higgins clark where are the children prologue he could feel the chill coming in through the cracks around the windowpanes clumsily he got up and lumbered over to the window reaching for one of the thick towels he kept handy he stuffed it around the rotting frame the incoming draught made a soft hissing sound in the towel a sound that vaguely pleased him he looked out at the mistfilled sky and studied the whitecaps churning in the water from this side of the house it was often possible to see provincetown on the opposite shore of cape cod bay he hated the cape he hated the bleakness of it on a november day like this the stark greyness of the water the stolid people who didnt say much but studied you with their eyes he had hated it the one summer hed been here waves of tourists sprawling on the beaches climbing up the steep embankment to this house gawking in the downstairs windows cupping their hands over their eyes to peer inside he hated the large for sale sign that ray eldredge had posted on the front and back of the big house and the fact that now ray and that woman who worked for him had begun bringing people in to see the house last month it had been only a matter of luck that hed come along as theyd started through only luck that hed got to the top floor before they had and been able to put away the telescope time was running out somebody would buy this house and he wouldnt be able to rent it again that was why hed sent the article to the paper he wanted to still be here to enjoy seeing her exposed for what she was in front of these people now when she must have started to feel safe there was something else that he had to do but the chance had never come she kept such a close watch on the children but he couldnt afford to wait any more tomorrow he moved restlessly around the room the bedroom of the topfloor apartment was large the whole house was large it was a bastardized evolution of an old captains house begun in the seventeenth century on a rocky crest that commanded a view of the whole bay it was a pretentious monument to mans need to be forever on guard life wasnt like that it was bits and pieces icebergs that showed in tips he knew he rubbed his hand over his face feeling warm and uncomfortable even though the room was chilly for six years now hed rented this house in the late summer and fall it was almost exactly as it had been when he had first come into it only a few things were different the telescope in the front room the clothes that he kept for the special times the peaked cap that he pulled over his face which shaded it so well otherwise the apartment was the same the oldfashioned sofa and pine tables and hooked rug in the livingroom the rock maple bedroom set this house and apartment had been ideal for his purpose until this fall when ray eldredge had told him they were actively trying to sell the place for a restaurant and it could be rented only with the understanding it could be shown on telephoned notice ray nor eldredge the thought of the man brought a smile what would ray think tomorrow when he saw the story had nancy ever told ray who she was maybe not women could be sly if ray didnt know it would be even better how wonderful it would be to actually see rays expression when he opened the paper it was delivered a little after ten in the morning ray would be in his office he might not even look at it for a while impatiently he turned from the window his thick trunklike legs were tight in shiny black trousers hed be glad when he could lose some of this weight it would mean that awful business of starving himself again but he could do it when it had been necessary hed done it before restlessly he rubbed a hand over his vaguely itchy scalp hed be glad when he could let his hair grow back in its natural lines again the sides had always been thick and would probably be mostly grey now he ran one hand slowly down his trouser leg then impatiently paced around the apartment finally stopping at the telescope in the livingroom the telescope was especially powerful the kind of equipment that wasnt available for general sale even many police departments didnt have it yet but there were always ways to get things you wanted he bent over and peered into it squinting one eye because of the darkness of the day the kitchen light was on so it was easy to see nancy clearly she was standing in front of the kitchen window the one that was over the sink maybe she was about to get something ready to put into the oven for dinner but she had a warm jacket on so she was probably going out she was standing quietly just looking in the direction of the water what was she thinking of whom was she thinking of the children peter lisa hed like to know he could feel his mouth go dry and licked his lips nervously she looked very young today her hair was pulled back from her face she kept it dark brown someone would surely have recognized her if shed left it the natural redgold shade tomorrow shed be thirtytwo but she still didnt look her age she had an intriguing young quality soft and fresh and silky he swallowed nervously he could feel the feverish dryness of his mouth even while his hands and armpits were wet and warm he gulped then swallowed again and the sound evolved into a deep chuckle his whole body began to shake with mirth and jarred the telescope nancy s image blurred but he didnt bother refocusing the lens he wasnt interested in watching her any more today tomorrow he could just see the expression shed have at this time tomorrow exposed to the world for what she was numbed with worry and fear trying to answer the question the same question the police had thrown at her over and over seven years ago come on nancy the police would be saying again come clean with us tell us the truth you should know you cant get away with this tell us nancy where are the children chapter one november ray came down the stairs pulling the knot closed on his tie nancy was sitting at the table with a stillsleepy missy on her lap michael was eating his breakfast in his poised reflective way ray tousled mikes head and leaned over to kiss missy nancy smiled up at him she was so darn pretty there were fine lines around those blue eyes but youd still never take her for thirtytwo ray was only a few years older himself but always felt infinitely her senior maybe it was that awful vulnerability he noticed the traces of red at the roots of her dark hair a dozen times in the last year hed wanted to ask her to let it grow out but hadnt dared happy birthday honey he said quietly he watched as the colour drained from her face michael looked surprised is it mommys birthday you didnt tell me that missy sat upright mommys birthday she sounded pleased yes ray told them nancy was staring down at the table and tonight were going to celebrate tonight im going to bring home a big birthday cake and a present and well have aunt dorothy come to dinner right mommy ray no nancy s voice was low and appealing yes remember last year you promised that this year wed celebrate was the wrong word he couldnt say it but for a long time hed known that they would some day have to start changing the pattern of her birthdays at first shed withdrawn completely from him and gone around the house or walked the beach like a silent ghost in a world of her own but last year shed finally begun to talk about them the two other children shed said theyd be so big now ten and eleven i try to think how they would look now but cant seem to even imagine everything about that time is so blurred like a nightmare that i only dreamed its supposed to be like that ray told her put it all behind you honey dont even wonder what happened any more the memory strengthened his decision he bent over nancy and patted her hair with a gesture that was at once protective and gentle nancy looked up at him the appeal on her face changed to uncertainty i dont think michael interrupted her how old are you mommy he asked practically nancy smiled a real smile that miraculously eased the tension none of your business she told him ray took a quick gulp of coffee good girl he said tell you what mike ill pick you up after school this afternoon and well go to get a present for mommy now id better get out of here some guy is coming up to see the hunt place i want to get the file together isnt it rented nancy asked yes that parrish fellow whos taken the apartment on and off has it again but he knows we have the right to show it any time its a great spot for a restaurant and wouldnt take much to convert itll make a nice commission if i sell it nancy put missy down and walked with him to the door he kissed her lightly and felt her lips tremble under his how much had he upset her by starting this birthday talk some instinct made him want to say lets not wait for tonight ill stay home and well take the kids and go to boston for the day instead he got into his car waved backed up and drove on to the narrow dirt lane that wound through an acre of woods until it terminated on the crosscape road that led to the centre of adams port and his office ray was right nancy thought as she walked slowly back to the table there was a time to stop following the patterns of yesterday a time to stop remembering and look only to the future she knew that a part of her was still frozen she knew that the mind dropped a protective curtain over painful memories but it was more than that it was as though her life with carl were a blur the entire time it was hard to remember the faculty house on the campus carls modulated voice peter and lisa what had they looked like dark hair both of them like carls and too quiet too subdued affected by her uncertainty and then lost both of them mommy why do you look so sad michael gazed at her with rays candid expression spoke with rays directness seven years nancy thought life was a series of sevenyear cycles carl used to say that your whole body changed in that time every cell renewed itself it was time for her to really look ahead to forget she glanced around the large cheerful kitchen with the old brick fireplace the wide oak floors the red curtains and valances that didnt obstruct the view over the harbour and then she looked at michael and missy tm not sad darling she said im really not she scooped missy up in her arms feeling the warmth and sweet stickiness of her ive been thinking about your present missy said her long strawberryblonde hair curled around her ears and forehead people sometimes asked where she got that beautiful hair who had been the redhead in the family great nancy told her but think about it outside youd better get some fresh air soon its supposed to rain later and get very cold after the children were dressed she helped them on with their windbreakers and hats theres my dollar michael said with satisfaction as he reached into the breast pocket of his jacket i was sure i left it here now i can buy you a present me has money too missy proudly held up a handful of pennies oh now you two shouldnt be carrying your money about nancy told them youll only lose it let me hold it for you michael shook his head if i give it to you i might forget it when i go shopping with daddy i promise i wont let you forget it my pocket has a zipper see ill keep it in that and ill hold missys for her well nancy shrugged and gave up the discussion she knew perfectly well that michael wouldnt lose the dollar he was like ray well organized now mike im going to straighten up you be sure to stay with missy okay michael said cheerfully come on missy ill push you on the swing first ray had built a swing for the children it was suspended from a branch of the massive oak tree at the edge of the woods behind their house nancy pulled missys mittens over her hands they were bright red fuzzy angora stitching formed a smile face on their backs leave these on she told her otherwise your hands will get cold its really getting raw im not even sure you should go out at all oh please missys lip began to quiver all right all right dont go into the act nancy said hastily but not more than half an hour she opened the back door and let them out then shivered as the chilling breeze enveloped her she closed the door quickly and started up the staircase the house was an authentic old cape and the stairway was almost totally vertical ray said that the old settlers must have had a bit of mountain goat in them the way they built their staircases but nancy loved everything about this place she could still remember the feeling of peace and welcome it had given her when shed first seen it over six years ago shed come to the cape after the conviction had been set aside the district attorney hadnt pressed for a new trial because rob legler the vital prosecution witness had disappeared shed fled here completely across the continent as far away from california as she could get as far away from the people shed known and the place shed lived and the college and the whole academic community there she never wanted to see them again the friends who had turned out not to be friends but hostile strangers who spoke of poor carl because they blamed his suicide on her too shed come to cape cod because shed always heard that new englanders and cape people were reticent and reserved and wanted nothing to do with strangers and that was good she needed a place to hide to find herself to sort it all out to try to think through what had happened to try to come back to life shed cut her hair and dyed it sable brown and that was enough to make her look completely different from the pictures that had frontpaged newspapers all over the country during the trial she guessed that only fate could have prompted her to elect rays real estate office when she went looking for a house to rent shed actually made an appointment with another realtor but on impulse shed gone in to see him first because she liked his handlettered sign and the window boxes that were filled with yellow and champagne mums she had waited until he finished with another client a leatheryfaced old man with thick curling hair and admired the way ray advised him to hang on to his property that hed find a tenant for the apartment in the house to help carry expenses after the old man left she said maybe im here at the right time i want to rent a house but he wouldnt even show her the old hunt place the lookout is too big too lonesome and too draughty for you he said but i just got in a rental on an authentic cape in excellent condition thats fully furnished it can even be bought eventually if you like it how much room do you need miss mrs miss kiernan she told him nancy kiernan instinctively she used her mothers maiden name not much really i wont be having company or visitors she liked the fact that he didnt pry or even look curious the cape is a good place to come when you want to be by yourself he said you cant be lonesome walking on the beach or watching the sunset or just looking out the window in the morning then ray had brought her up here and immediately she knew that she would stay the combination familyand diningroom had been fashioned from the old keepingroom that had once been the heart of the house she loved the rockingchair in front of the fireplace and the way the table was in front of the windows so that it was possible to eat and look down over the harbour and the bay she was able to move in right away and if ray wondered why she had absolutely nothing except the two suitcases shed taken off the bus he didnt show it she said that her mother had died and she had sold their home in ohio and decided to come east she simply omitted talking about the six years that had lapsed in between that night for the first time in months she slept through the night a deep dreamless sleep in which she didnt hear peter and lisa calling her wasnt in the courtroom listening to carl condemn her that first morning here shed made coffee and sat by the window it had been a clear brilliant day the cloudless sky purpleblue the bay tranquil and still the only movement the arc of sea gulls hovering near the fishing boats with her fingers wrapped around the coffee cup shed sipped and watched the warmth of the coffee had flowed through her body the sunbeams had warmed her face the tranquillity of the scene enhanced the calming sense of peace that the long dreamless sleep had begun peace give me peace that had been her prayer during the trial in prison let me learn to accept seven years ago nancy sighed realizing that she was still standing by the bottom step of the staircase it was so easy to get lost in remembering that was why she tried so hard to live each day not look back or into the future she began to go upstairs slowly how could there ever be peace for her knowing that if rob legler ever showed up theyd try her again for murder take her away from ray and missy and michael for an instant she dropped her face into her hands dont think about it she told herself its no use at the head of the stairs she shook her head determinedly and walked quickly into the master bedroom she threw open the windows and shivered as the wind blew the curtains back against her clouds were starting to form and the water in the bay had begun to churn with whitecaps the temperature was dropping rapidly nancy was enough of a cape person now to know that a cold wind like this usually blew in a storm but it really was still clear enough to have the children out she liked them to have as much fresh air as possible in the morning after lunch missy napped and michael went to kindergarten she started to pull the sheets from the big double bed and hesitated missy had been sniffling yesterday should she go down and warn her not to unzip the neck of her jacket it was one of her favourite tricks missy always complained that all her clothes felt too tight at the neck nancy deliberated an instant then pulled the sheets completely back and off the bed missy had on a turtleneck shirt her throat would be covered even if she undid the button besides it would take only ten or fifteen minutes to strip and change the beds and turn on a wash ten minutes at the most nancy promised herself to quiet the nagging feeling of worry that was insistently telling her to go out to the children now chapter two some mornings jonathan knowles walked to the drugstore to pick up his morning paper other days he pedalled on his bike his outing always took him past the old nickerson house the one that ray eldredge had bought when he married the pretty girl who was renting it when old sam nickerson had had the place it had begun to be rundown but now it looked snug and solid ray had put on a new roof and had painted the trim and his wife certainly had a green thumb the yellow and orange mums in the window boxes gave a cheerful warmth even to the bleakest day in nice weather nancy eldredge was often out early in the morning working on her garden she always had a pleasant greeting for him and then went back to her work jonathan admired that trait in a woman hed known rays folks when they were summer people up here of course the eldredges had helped settle the cape rays father had told jonathan the whole family line right back to the one who had come over on the mayflower the fact that ray shared enough love for the cape to decide to build his business career here was particularly exemplary in jonathans eyes the cape had lakes and ponds and the bay and the ocean it had woods to walk in and land for people to spread out on and it was a good place for a young couple to raise children it was a good place to retire and live out the end of your life jonathan and emily had always spent vacations here and looked forward to the day when theyd be able to stay here the year around theyd almost made it too but for emily it wasnt to be jonathan sighed he was a big man with thick white hair and a broad face that was beginning to fold into jowls a retired lawyer hed found inactivity depressing you couldnt do much fishing in the winter and poking around antique stores and refinishing furniture wasnt the fun it had been when emily was with him but in this second year of his permanent residency at the cape hed started to write a book begun as a hobby it had become an absorbing daily activity a publisher friend had read a few chapters of it one weekend and promptly sent him a contract the book was a case study of famous murder trials jonathan worked on it five hours every day seven days a week starting promptly at ninethirty in the morning the wind bit against him he pulled out his muffler grateful for the watery sunshine he felt on his face as he glanced in the direction of the bay with the shrubbery stripped you could see clear to the water only the old hunt house on its high bluff interrupted the view the house they called the lookout jonathan always looked at the bay right at this point of his trip this morning again he squinted as he turned his head irritated he looked back at the road after barely registering the stormy churning whitecaps that fellow who rented the house must have something metallic in the window he thought it was a damn nuisance he felt like asking ray to mention it to him then ruefully brushed the thought away the tenant might just suggest that jonathan check the bay somewhere else along the way he shrugged unconsciously he was directly in front of the eldredge house and nancy was sitting at the breakfast table by the window talking to the little boy the little girl was on her lap jonathan glanced away quickly feeling like an intruder and not wanting to catch her eye oh well hed get the paper fix his solitary breakfast and get to his desk today hed begin working on the harmon murder case the one that he suspected would make the most interesting chapter of all chapter three ray pushed open the door to his office unable to shake the nagging sensation of worry that like an unlocated toothache was throbbing somewhere inside him what was the matter it was more than just making nancy acknowledge her birthday and risking the memories it aroused actually shed been pretty calm he knew her well enough to understand when the tension was building about that other life it could be triggered by something like the sight of a darkhaired boy and girl together who were the age of her other children or a discussion of the murder of that little girl whod been found dead in cohasset last year but nancy was all right this morning it was something else a feeling of foreboding oh no what does that mean ray looked up startled dorothy was at her desk her hair more grey than brown casually framed her long pleasant face her sensible beige sweater and brown tweed skirt had an almost studied dowdiness and signalled the wearers indifference to frills dorothy had been rays first client when he had opened his office the girl he had hired didnt show up and dorothy had volunteered to help him out for a few days shed been with him ever since you do realize that youre shaking your head and frowning she told him ray smiled sheepishly just morning jitters i guess how are you doing dorothy immediately became businesslike fine i have the file all together on the lookout what time do you expect that fellow who wants to see it around two ray told her he bent over her desk where did you ever dig out those plans theyre on file in the library dont forget that house was begun in sixteenninety it would make a marvellous restaurant if anyone is willing to spend money renovating it it could be a showcase and you cant beat that waterfront location i gather mr kragopoulos and his wife have built up and sold several restaurants and dont mind spending the dollars to do everything the way it should be done ive never yet met a greek who couldnt make a go of a restaurant dorothy commented as she closed the file and all englishmen are fags and no german has a sense of humour and most puerto ricans i mean spies are on welfare god i hate labels ray took his pipe from his breast pocket and jammed it into his mouth what dorothy looked up at him bewildered i certainly was not labelling or i guess maybe i was but not in the way you took it she turned her back to him as she put the file away and ray stalked into his private office and closed the door he had hurt her stupidly unnecessarily what in the hell was the matter with him dorothy was the most decent fairminded nonbiased person he knew what a lousy thing to say to her sighing he reached for the humidor on his desk and filled his pipe he puffed thoughtfully on it for fifteen minutes before he dialled dorothys extension yes her voice was constrained when she picked up the phone are the girls in yet yes coffee made yes dorothy did not ask him if he was ready to have some would you mind bringing yours in here and a cup for me and ask the girls to hold calls for fifteen minutes all right dorothy hung up ray got up to open the door for her and when she came in with two steaming cups he carefully closed it peace he said contritely im terribly sorry i believe that dorothy said and its all right but whats the matter sit down please ray gestured to the rustcoloured leather chair by his desk he took his coffee to the window and stared moodily out at the greying landscape how would you like to come to our house for dinner tonight he asked were celebrating nancy s birthday he heard her sharp intake of breath and spun around do you think its a mistake dorothy was the only one on the cape who knew about nancy nancy herself had told her and asked her advice before she had agreed to marry ray dorothys voice and eyes were speculative as she answered i dont know ray whats the thinking behind a celebration the thinking is that you cant pretend that nancy doesnt have birthdays of course its more than just that its that nancy has got to break with the past to stop hiding can she break with the past can she stop hiding with the prospect of another murder trial always hanging over her but thats just it the prospect dorothy do you realize that that fellow who testified against her hasnt been seen or heard of for over six years god knows where he is now or if hes even alive for all we know hes sneaked back into this country under another name and is just as anxious as nancy not to start the whole business up dont forget hes officially a deserter from the army theres a pretty stiff penalty waiting for him if hes caught thats probably true dorothy agreed it is true and take it one step further level with me now what do people in this town think of nancy and i include the girls in my own office here dorothy hesitated they think shes very pretty they admire the way she wears clothes they say shes always pleasant and they think she keeps to herself pretty much thats a nice way of putting it ive heard cracks about my wife thinking shes too good for the folks around here at the club im getting more and more ribbing about why i only have a golf membership and why i dont bring that beautiful wife of mine around last week michaels school called and asked if nancy would consider working on some committee needless to say she turned them down last month i finally got her to go to the realtors dinner and when they took the group picture she was in the ladies room shes afraid of being recognized i understand that but dont you see that that possibility gets less all the time and even if someone said to her youre a dead ringer for that girl from california who was accused well you know what i mean dorothy for most people it would end there a resemblance period god remember that guy who used to pose for all those whisky and bank ads the one who was a ringer for lyndon johnson i was in the army with his nephew people do look like other people its that simple and if there ever is another trial i want nancy to be entrenched with the people here i want them to feel shes one of them and that theyre rooting for her because after shes acquitted shell have to come here and take up life again we all will and if theres a trial and she isnt acquitted i simply wont consider that possibility ray said flatly how about it have we got a date tonight id like very much to come dorothy said and i agree with most of what youve said most yes she looked at him steadily i think youve got to ask yourself how much of this sudden desire to opt for a more normal life is just for nancy and how much because of other motives meaning what ray i was here when the secretary of state of massachusetts urged you to go into politics because the cape needs young men of your calibre to represent it i heard him say that hed give you any help and endorsement possible its pretty hard not to be able to take him up on that but as things stand now you cant and you know it dorothy left the room without giving him a chance to answer ray finished the coffee and sat down at his desk the anger and irritation and tension drained from him and he felt depressed and ashamed of himself she was right of course he did want to pretend that there wasnt any threat hanging over them that everything was just nifty and he had a hell of a nerve too hed known what he was getting into when hed married nancy if he hadnt she certainly had pointed it out shed done her best to warn him ray stared unseeingly at the mail on his desk thinking of the times in the last few months when hed blow up unreasonably at nancy just the way he had this morning at dorothy like the way he had acted when she had shown him the watercolour shed done of the house she should study art even now she was good enough to exhibit locally hed said its very good now which closet are you going to hide it in nancy had looked so stricken so defenceless hed wanted to bite his tongue off hed said honey im so sorry its just that im so proud of you i want you to show it off how many of these flareups were being caused because he was tired of the constant constriction on their activities he sighed and started going through his mail at quarter past ten dorothy threw open the door of his office her usually healthy pink complexion was a sickly greyishwhite he jumped up to go to her but shaking her head she pushed the door closed behind her and held out the paper shed been hiding under her arm it was me weekly cape cod community news dorothy had it open to the second section the one that always featured a humaninterest story she dropped it on his desk together they stared down at the large picture that to anyone was unmistakably nancy it was one hed never seen before in her tweed suit with her hair pulled back and already darkened the caption under it said can this be a happy birthday for nancy harmon another picture showed nancy leaving the courtroom during her trial her face wooden and expressionless her hair cascading down her shoulders a third picture was a copy of a snapshot of nancy with her arms around two young children the first line of the story read somewhere today nancy harmon is celebrating her nd birthday and the seventh anniversary of the death of the children she was found guilty of murdering chapter four it was timing the whole universe existed because of splitsecond timing now his timing would be perfect hurriedly he backed the station wagon out of the garage it was such a cloudy day it had been hard to see much through the telescope but he could tell that shed been putting the childrens coats on he felt in his pocket and the needles were there filled ready to use to produce instant unconsciousness dreamless absolute sleep he could feel the perspiration starting under his arms and in his groin and great beads of it were forming on his forehead and rolling down his cheeks that was bad it was a cold day mustnt look excited or nervous he took a precious few seconds to dab his face with the old towel he kept on the front seat and glanced over his shoulder the canvas raincoat was the kind many cape men kept in their cars especially around fishing season so were the rods that showed against the back window but that coat was big enough to cover two small children he giggled excitedly and swung the car towards route a wiggins market was on the corner of this road and route a whenever he was at the cape he shopped there of course he brought most of the staples he needed with him whenever he came to stay it was too risky to go out much there was always the chance that hed run into nancy and shed recognize him even with his changed appearance it had almost happened four years ago hed been in a supermarket in hyannis port and hed heard her voice behind him he was reaching for a jar of coffee and her hand went right up next to his as she took a jar from the same shelf she was saying wait a minute mike i want to get something here and while he froze she brushed against him and murmured oh im sorry he didnt dare to answer just stood there and she moved on he was positive she hadnt even looked at him but after that he had never risked a meeting it was necessary though for him to establish a casual routine in adams port because some day it might be important for people to dismiss his comings and goings as routine that was why he bought milk and bread and meat at wiggins market always about ten in the morning nancy never left the house before eleven and even then she always went to lowerys market down the road a halfmile and the wigginses had begun to greet him as a customer of long standing well hed be there in a few minutes right on schedule there wasnt anyone out walking at all the raw wind was probably discouraging any inclination to go outdoors he was almost at route a and slowed to a full stop the incredible luck there wasnt a car in either direction quickly he accelerated and the station wagon shot across the main street and on to the road that ran along the back of the eldredge property audacity that was all it took any fool could try to come up with a foolproof plan but to have a plan so simple that it was unbelievable even to call it a plan a schedule timed to the split second that was real genius to willingly leave yourself open to failure to tightropewalk across a dozen pits so that when the act was accomplished no one even glanced in your direction that was the way ten minutes to ten the children had probably been out one minute now oh he knew the possibilities one of them might have gone into the house to the bathroom or for a drink of water but not likely not likely every day for a month straight hed watched them unless it was actually raining they came out to play she never came to check them for ten to fifteen minutes they never went back into the house for those same ten minutes nine minutes to ten he steered the car into the dirt road on their property the community paper would be delivered in a few minutes that article would be out today motivation for nancy to explode into violence exposure of her past all the people in this town talking in shocked tones walking by this house staring he stopped the car halfway into the woods no one could see it from the road she couldnt see it from the house he got out quickly and keeping close to the protection of the trees hurried to the childrens play area the leaves were off most of the trees but there were enough pines and other evergreens to shield him he could hear the childrens voices before he saw them the boy his voice panting a little he must be pushing the girl on the swing well ask daddy what to buy for mommy ill take both our money the girl laughed good mike good higher mike push me higher please he stole up behind the boy who heard him in that last second he had an impression of startled blue eyes and a mouth that rounded in terror before he covered both with one hand and with the other plunged the needle through the woollen mitten the boy tried to pull away stiffened then crumpled noiselessly to the ground the swing was coming back the girl calling push mike dont stop pushing he caught the swing by the right side chain stopped it and encircled the small uncomprehending wiggly body carefully stifling the soft cry he plunged the other needle through the red mitten that had a smiling kitten face sewn on the back an instant later the girl sighed and slumped against him he didnt notice that one mitten caught in the swing and was pulled off as he easily lifted both children in his arms and ran to the car at five minutes to ten they were crumpled under the canvas raincoat he backed down the dirt road and on to the paved highway behind nancy s property he cursed as he saw a small dodge sedan coming towards him it slowed up slightly to let him pull into the right lane and he turned his head away damn the luck as he passed he managed a swift sidelong glance at the driver of the other car and got an impression of a sharp nose and thin chin silhouetted from under a shapeless hat the other driver didnt seem to turn his head at all he had a fleeting feeling of familiarity probably someone from the cape but maybe not aware that the station wagon he had slowed up for had come off the narrow dirt road leading from the eldredge property most people werent observant in a few minutes this man probably wouldnt even have a recollection of having slowed for an instant to let a car complete a turn he watched the dodge through the rearview mirror until it disappeared with a grunt of satisfaction he adjusted the mirror so that it reflected the canvas raincoat on the back deck it was apparently tossed casually over fishing gear satisfied he flipped the mirror back into place without looking into it again if he had looked into it he would have seen that the car he had just been watching was slowing backing up at four minutes past ten he walked into wiggins market and grunted a greeting as he reached into the refrigerator section for a quart of milk chapter five nancy came down the steep staircase precariously balancing an armful of towels and sheets pyjamas and underwear on impulse shed decided to do a wash that could be hung outdoors to dry before the storm broke winter was here it was on the edge of the yard forcing the last few dead leaves off the trees it was settling into the dirt road that now was as hardened as concrete it was changing the colour of the bay into a smoky greyblue outside the storm was building but now while there was still some weak sun shed take advantage of it she loved the fresh smell of sheets dried outside loved to pull them against her face as she drifted off to sleep with the way they captured the faint smell of cranberry bogs and pine and the salty smell of the sea so different from the coarse rough dank smell of prison sheets she pushed the thought away at the foot of the staircase she started to turn in the direction of the back door then stopped how foolish the children were fine theyd been out only fifteen minutes and this frantic anxiety that was her constant albatross had to be conquered even now she suspected that missy sensed it and was beginning to respond to her overprotection shed turn the wash on then call them in while they watched their tenthirty television programme shed have a second cup of coffee and look at the weekly cape cod community news with the season over there might be some good antiques available and not at tourist prices she wanted an oldfashioned settee for the parlour the highbacked kind they used to call a settle in the seventeenhundreds in the laundry room off the kitchen she sorted the wash tossed the sheets and towels into the machine added detergent and bleach and finally pushed the button to start the cycle now it surely was time to call the children but at the front door she detoured the paper had just arrived the delivery boy was disappearing around the curve in the road she picked it up shivering against the increasing wind and hurried into the kitchen she turned the burner jet under the stillwarm coffeepot then anxious to get a look at the classified page she thumbed quickly to the second section of the paper her eyes focused on the blaring headline and the pictures all the pictures of her and carl and rob legler the one of her with peter and lisa that clinging trusting way theyd always huddled up to her through a roaring in her ears she remembered vividly the time theyd posed for that one carl had taken it dont pay attention to me hed said pretend im not here but theyd known he was there and had shrunk against her and she had looked down at them as he snapped the picture her hands were touching their silky dark heads no no no no now her body arched in pain unsteadily she reached out her hand and it hit the coffeepot knocking it over she drew it back only dimly feeling the searing liquid that splattered on her fingers she had to burn the paper michael and missy musnt see it that was it shed burn the paper so that no one could see it she ran to the fireplace in the diningroom the fireplace that wasnt cheery and warm and protecting any more because there was no haven there never could be a haven for her she squeezed the paper together and reached unsteadily for the box of matches on the mantel a wisp of smoke and a flame and then the paper began to burn as she stuffed it between the logs everyone on the cape was reading that paper theyd know theyd all know the one picture theyd surely recognize she didnt even remember that anyone had seen her after shed cut her hair and dyed it the paper was burning brightly now she watched as the picture with peter and lisa flamed and charred and curled dead both of them and shed be better off with them there was no place to hide for her or to forget ray could take care of michael and missy tomorrow in michaels class the children would be looking at him whispering pointing their fingers the children she must save the children no get the children that was it theyd catch cold she stumbled to the back door and pulled it open peter lisa she called no no it was michael and missy they were her children michael missy come here come in now her wail heightened to a shriek where were they she hurried out to the backyard unmindful of the cold that bit through her light sweater the swing they must have gotten off the swing they were probably in the woods michael missy michael missy dont hide come here now the swing was still moving the wind was making it sway then she saw the mitten missys mitten caught in the metal loops of the swing from far off she heard a sound what sound the children the lake they must be at the lake they werent supposed to go there but maybe they had theyd be found like the others in the water their faces wet and swollen and still she grabbed missys mitten the mitten with the smile face and staggered towards the lake she called their names over and over again she pushed her way through the woods and out on to the sandy beach in the lake a little way out something was glistening below the surface was it something red another mittenmissys hand she plunged into the icy water as far as her shoulders and reached down but there wasnt anything there frantically nancy clutched her fingers together so that they formed a strainer but there was nothing only the terrible numbing cold water she looked down trying to see to the bottom leaned over and fell the water gushed into her nostrils and mouth and burned her face and neck somehow she staggered up and back before her wet clothes pulled her down again she fell on to the icecrusted sand through the roar in her ears and the mist that was closing in front of her eyes she looked into the woods and saw him his face whose face the mist closed over her eyes completely sounds died away the mournful cackle of the sea gull the lapping of the water silence it was there that ray and dorothy found her shivering uncontrollably lying on the sand her hair and clothes plastered to her head and body her eyes blank and uncomprehending angry blisters raised on the hand that clutched a small red mitten to her cheek chapter six jonathan carefully washed and rinsed his breakfast dishes scoured the omelet pan and swept the kitchen floor emily had been naturally effortlessly neat and years of living with her had made him appreciate the intrinsic comfort of tidiness he always hung his clothes in the closets put his laundry in the bathroom hamper and cleared up immediately after his solitary meals he even had an eye for the kind of detail that his cleaning woman missed and after she left on wednesdays would do small jobs like washing canisters and bricabrac and polishing surfaces that shed left cloudy with wax in new york he and emily had lived on sutton place on the southeast corner of fiftyfifth street their apartment building had extended over the fdr drive to the edge of the east river sometimes they had sat on their seventeenthfloor balcony and watched the lights of the bridges that spanned the river and talked about the time when theyd be retired at the cape and looking out over maushop lake you wont have bertha in every day to keep the wheels spinning hed teased her by the time we get up there bertha will be ready to retire and ill break you in as my assistant all well really need is a weekly cleaning woman how about you will you miss having a car pick you up at the door any time you want it jonathan had answered that hed decided to buy a bicycle id do it now hed told emily but im afraid some of our clients might get upset if the word was around that i arrived at work on a tenspeeder and youll try your hand at writing emily had prodded i sometimes wish youd just taken a chance and done it years ago never could afford to married to you hed said the onewoman war against recession all fifth avenue stays in the black when mrs knowles goes shopping its your fault shed retorted youre always telling me to spend your money i like spending it on you hed told her and i have no complaints ive been lucky if only theyd had even a few years up here together jonathan sighed and hung up the dish towel seeing nancy eldredge and her children framed in the window this morning had vaguely depressed him maybe it was the weather or the long winter setting in but he was restless apprehensive something was bothering him it was the kind of itch he used to get when he was preparing a brief and some facts just didnt jibe well hed get to his desk he was anxious to start working on the harmon chapter he could have taken early retirement he thought as he walked slowly into his study as it turned out that was just what he had done anyway the minute he lost emily hed sold the new york apartment put in his resignation pensioned off bertha and like a dog licking its wounds had come here to this house that theyd picked out together after the first bleak grief hed found a measure of contentment now writing the book was a fascinating and absorbing experience when hed gotten the idea for doing it he had asked kevin parks a meticulous freelance researcher and old friend to come up for a weekend then he had outlined his plan to him jonathan had selected ten controversial criminal trials hed proposed that kev take on the job of putting together a file of all available material on those trials court transcripts depositions newspaper accounts pictures gossip anything he could find jonathan planned to study each file thoroughly and then decide how to write the chapter either agreeing with the verdict or rejecting it and giving his reasons he was calling the book verdict in doubt hed already finished three chapters the first was called the sam sheppard trial his opinion not guilty too many loopholes too much suppressed evidence jonathan agreed with the dorothy kilgallen opinion that the jury had found sam sheppard guilty of adultery not murder the second chapter was the cappolino trial marge farger in his opinion belonged in a prison cell with her former boyfriend the justcompleted chapter was the edgar smith trial jonathans view was that edgar smith was guilty but deserved his freedom fourteen years constituted a life sentence today and he had rehabilitated and educated himself in a grisly cell on death row now he sat down at his massive desk and reached into the file drawer for the thick cardboard folders that had arrived the previous day they were labelled the harmon case a note from kevin was stapled to the first envelope it read jon i have a hunch youll enjoy getting your teeth into this one the defendant was a sitting duck for the prosecutor even her husband broke down on the stand and practically accused her in front of the jury if they ever locate the missing prosecution witness and try her again shed better have a stronger story than last time the district attorneys office out there knows where she is but i couldnt get it from them somewhere in the east is the best i can do jonathan opened the file with the accelerating pulse that he always associated with the beginning of an interesting new case he never allowed himself to do much speculating until he got the research all together but his memory of this case when it was being tried six or seven years ago made him curious he remembered how at that time just reading the trial testimony had left so many questions in his mind questions he wanted to concentrate on now he recalled that his overall impression of the harmon case was the nancy harmon never had told all she knew about the disappearance of her children he reached into the folder and began to lay out the meticulouslylabelled items on the desk there were pictures of nancy harmon taken during her trial she certainly was a pretty little thing with that waistlength hair according to the papers she was twentyfive at the time the murders were committed she looked even younger not much more than a teenager the dresses she wore were so youthful almost childish they added to the overall effect probably her attorney had suggested that she look as young as possible funny but ever since hed started planning this book hed felt that hed seen that girl somewhere he stared at the pictures in front of him of course she looked like a younger version of ray eldredges wife that explained the nagging resemblance the expression was totally different but wouldnt it be a small world if there was some family relationship his eye fell on the first typewritten page which gave a rundown on nancy harmon she had been born in california and raised in ohio well that let out any possibility of her being a close relative to nancy eldredge rays wifes family had been neighbours of dorothy prentiss in virginia dorothy prentiss he felt a quick dart of pleasure at the thought of the handsome woman who worked with ray jonathan often stopped by their office around five oclock when he picked up the evening paper the boston globe ray had suggested some interesting land investments to him and they had all proved sound hed also persuaded jonathan to become active in the town and as a result theyd become good friends still jonathan realized that he went into rays office more often than necesary ray would say youre just in time for an endoftheday drink and call out to dorothy to join them emily had liked daiquiris dorothy always had jonathans favourite drink a rob roy with a twist the three of them would sit for a half hour or so in rays private office dorothy had a penetrating humour that he enjoyed her family had been showbusiness people and she had countless great stories about travelling with them shed planned a career too but after three small parts off broadway she had got married and settled down in virginia after her husband died shed come up to the cape planning to open an interiordecorating shop then had got started working with ray ray said that dorothy was a hell of a realestate saleswoman she could help people visualize the possibilities in a place no matter how seedy it looked at first glance more and more often lately jonathan had toyed with the idea of suggesting that dorothy join him for dinner sundays were long and a couple of sunday afternoons recently hed actually started to dial her number then stopped he didnt want to rush into getting involved with someone hed run into constantly and he just wasnt sure maybe she came on a little too strong for him all those years of living with emilys total femininity had made him somewhat unprepared for reacting on a personal level with a terribly independent woman god what was the matter with him he was so easily diverted into woolgathering this morning why was he letting himself get distracted from this harmon case resolutely he lit his pipe picked up the file and leaned back in his chair deliberately he picked up the first batch of papers an hour and fifteen minutes passed the silence was unbroken except for the ticking of the clock the increasing insistence of the wind through the pines outside his window and jonathans occasional snort of disbelief finally frowning in concentration he laid the papers down and walked slowly to the kitchen to make coffee something smelled about that whole harmon trial from as much of the transcript as hed read through so far it was evident that there was something fishy there an undercurrent that made it impossible for the facts to hang together in any kind of reasonably cohesive way he went into the immaculate kitchen and absently halffilled the kettle while he waited for it to heat he walked to the front door the cape cod community news was already on the porch tucking it under his arm he went back into the kitchen poured a rounded teaspoon of tasters choice into a cup added the boiling water stirred and began to sip as with the other hand he turned the pages of the paper scanning the contents he had almost finished the coffee when he got to the second section his hand with the cup stopped in midair as his gaze froze on the picture of ray eldredges wife in that first instant of realization jonathan sadly accepted two irrefutable facts dorothy prentiss had deliberately lied to him about having known nancy as a child in virginia and retired or not he should have been enough of a lawyer to trust his own instincts subconsciously he had always suspected that nancy harmon and nancy eldredge were one and the same person chapter seven it was so cold there was a gritty taste in her mouth sand why where was she she could hear ray calling her feel him bending over her cradling her against him nancy whats the matter nancy where are the children she could hear the fear in his voice she tried to raise her hand but felt it fall loosely by her side she tried to speak but no words formed on her lips ray was there but she couldnt reach him she heard dorothy say pick her up ray take her to the house we have to get help looking for the children the children they must find them nancy wanted to tell ray to look for them she felt her lips trying to form words but the words wouldnt come oh my god she heard the break in rays voice she wanted to say dont bother with me dont bother with me look for the children but she couldnt speak she felt him pick her up and hold her against him whats happened to her dorothy he asked whats the matter with her ray weve got to call the police the police vaguely nancy could hear the resistance in his voice of course we need help finding the children ray hurry every moment is precious dont you see you cant protect nancy now everyone will know her from that picture the picture nancy felt herself being carried remotely she knew she was shivering but that wasnt what she had to think about it was the picture of her in the tweed suit shed bought after the conviction was overturned theyd taken her out of prison and brought her to court the state hadnt tried her again carl was dead and the student whod testified against her had disappeared and so shed been released the prosecuting attorney had said to her dont think this is over if i spend the rest of my life ill find a way to get a conviction that sticks and with his words beating against her shed left the courtroom afterward when shed received permission to leave the state shed had her hair cut and dyed and gone shopping she had always hated the kind of clothes carl liked her to wear and had bought the threepiece suit and brown turtleneck sweater she still wore the jacket and slacks shed worn them shopping only last week that was another reason the picture was so recognizable the picture it had been taken in the bus terminal that was where shed been she hadnt known that anyone was taking a picture of her shed left on the last evening bus for boston the terminal hadnt been crowded and no one had paid any attention to her shed really thought that she could just slip away and try to begin again but someone had just been waiting to start it all over again i want to die she thought i want to die ray was walking swiftly but trying to shield her with his jacket the wind was biting through the wet clothes he couldnt shield her not even he could shield her it was too late maybe it had always been too late peter and lisa and michael and missy they were all gone it was too late for all of them no no no michael and missy they were here a little while ago they were playing they were out on the swing and then the mitten was there michael wouldnt leave missy he was so careful of her it was like last time last time and theyd find them the way they found peter and lisa with the wet seaweed and bits of plastic on their faces and in their hair and their bodies swollen they must be at the house dorothy was opening the door and saying ill call the police ray nancy felt the darkness coming at her she began sliding back and away nono no chapter eight oh the activity oh the way they were all scurrying around like ants all milling around her house and yard he licked his lips anxiously they were so dry when all the rest of him was wet his hands and feet and groin and underarms perspiration was streaming down his neck and back as soon as he got back to the big house he carried the children in and brought them right up to the room with the telescope he could keep an eye on them here and talk to them when they woke up and touch them maybe hed give the little girl a bath and dry her off in a nice soft towel and rub baby powder on her and kiss her he had all day to spend with the children all day the tide wouldnt come in until seven tonight by then it would be dark and no one would be nearby to see or hear it would be days before theyd be washed in it would be like last time it was so much more enjoyable touching them when he knew their mother was being questioned by now what did you do with your children theyd ask her he watched more police cars swarm up the dirt road into her backyard but some of them were passing the house why were so many of them going to maushop lake of course they thought she had taken the children there he felt wonderfully gratified here he could see everything that was happening without risk perfectly safe and comfortable he wondered if nancy was crying she had never cried once at her trial until the very end after the judge sentenced her to the gas chamber shed begun sobbing and buried her face in her hands to cover the sound the court attendants had snapped handcuffs on her and her long hair had spilled forward covering the tearstained face that looked hopelessly out at the hostile faces he remembered the first time hed seen her walking across the campus hed been immediately attracted to her the way the wind blew her strawberrygold hair around her shoulders the delicately formed face the small even white teeth the enchanting round blue eyes that looked gravely out from thick sooty brows and lashes he heard a sob nancy but of course not it was coming from the girl nancy s child he turned from the telescope and stared resentfully but his expression changed to a smile as he studied her those damp ringlets on her forehead the tiny straight nose the fair skin she looked a lot like nancy now she wailed as she started to wake up well it was just about time for the drug to wear off theyd been unconscious nearly an hour regretfully he left the telescope hed laid the children on opposite ends of the mustysmelling velour couch the little girl was crying in earnest now mommy mommy her eyes were squeezed shut her mouth was open her little tongue was so pink tears were running down her cheeks he sat her up and unzipped her jacket she shrank away from him there there he said soothingly its all right the boy stirred and woke up too his eyes were startled just as they had been when he had seen him in the yard now he sat up slowly who are you he demanded he rubbed his eyes shook his head and looked around where are we an articulate child well spoken his voice clear and well modulated that was good welltrained children were easier to handle didnt make a fuss taught respect for older people they tended to be pliable like the others theyd come with him so quietly that day they had knelt in the trunk of the car unquestioningly when he had said they were going to play a game on mommy its a game he told this little boy im an old friend of your mommys and she wants to play a birthday game did you know it was her birthday today he kept patting the little girl while he spoke she felt so soft and good the boy michael looked uncertain i dont like this game he said firmly unsteadily he got to his feet he pushed aside the hands that were touching missy and reached for her she clung to him dont cry missy he said soothingly its just a silly game well go home now it was obvious that he wasnt going to be fooled easily the boy had ray eldredges candid expression were not going to play any of your games he said we want to go home there was a wonderful way he could make the little boy cooperate let go of your sister he ordered here give her to me he yanked her from the boy with the other hand he took michaels wrist and pulled him over to the window do you know what a telescope is michael nodded uncertainly yes its like the glasses my daddy has it makes things bigger thats right youre very smart now look in here the boy put his eye to the viewer now tell me what you see no squeeze your other eye shut its looking at my house what do you see there there are lots of cars police cars whats the matter alarm made his voice quiver he looked down happily at the worried face a faint pinging sound came from the window it was starting to sleet the wind was driving hard little pellets against the glass panes the visibility would be very poor soon even with the telescope it would be hard to see much but he could have a wonderful time with the children the whole long afternoon and he knew how to make the boy obey do you know what its like to be dead he asked it means to go to god michael answered he nodded approvingly thats right and this morning your mother went to god thats why all the police cars are there your daddy asked me to mind you for a while and said for you to be good and help me take care of your sister michael looked as though hed cry too his lip quivered as he said if my mommy went to god i want to go too running his fingers through michaels hair he rocked the stillwailing missy you will he told him tonight i promise chapter nine the first reports went over the wireservice tickers at noon in time to make bulletins on the news broadcasts throughout the country newscasters hungering for a story seized upon it and sent researchers scurrying to the files for records of the nancy harmon murder trial publishers chartered planes to send their top crime reporters to cape cod in san francisco two assistant district attorneys listened to the bulletin one said to the other have i always said that bitch was as guilty as if id seen her kill those kids myself have i said it so help me if they dont hang this one on her ill take a leave of absence and personally comb the globe to find that legler slob and get him back here to testify against her in boston dr lendon miles was enjoying the beginning of his lunch break mrs markley had just left after a year of intense therapy she was finally beginning to get pretty good insight shed made a funny remark a few minutes ago shed been discussing an episode from her fourteenth year and said do you realize that thanks to you im going through adolescence and change of life all at once its a hell of a deal only a few months ago she hadnt been doing much joking lendon miles enjoyed his profession to him the mind was a delicate complicated phenomenon a mystery that could be unravelled only by a series of infinitely small revelations one leading slowly patiently into the next he sighed his tenoclock patient was in early analysis and had been extremely hostile he switched on the radio next to his desk to catch the balance of the noon news and was just in time to hear the bulletin a shadow of an old pain crossed his face nancy harmon priscillas daughter after fourteen years he could still see priscilla so clearly the slender elegant body the way she held her head the smile that came like quicksilver she had started working for him a year after her husbands death shed been thirtyeight then two years his junior almost immediately he began taking her out to dinner when they worked late and soon he realized that for the first time in his life the idea of marriage seemed logical and even essential until he met priscilla work study friends and freedom had been enough hed simply never met anyone who made him want to alter his status quo gradually shed told him about herself married after her first year in college to an airline pilot she had one child a daughter the marriage had obviously been a happy one then on a trip to india her husband had come down with viral pneumonia and had died within twentyfour hours it was so hard to take priscilla told him dave flew over a million miles he brought s down in blizzards and then something so totally unexpected i didnt realize people still died of pneumonia lendon never did meet priscillas daughter she had left for school in san francisco soon after priscilla had come to work for him priscilla had talked out her reasons for sending her so far away she was growing too close to me priscilla had worried shes taken daves death so hard i want her to be happy and young and to get away from the whole climate of grief that i think is closing in on us i went to auberley and met dave while i was there nancy had been with me to reunions so it isnt as if its too strange to her in november priscilla had taken a couple of days off to visit nancy at college lendon had driven her to the airport for a few minutes they had stood in the terminal waiting for her flight to be called of course you know ill miss you terribly hed said she was wearing a dark brown suede coat that showed off her patrician blonde beauty i hope so she said and her eyes were clouded im so worried she told him nancy s letters are so down lately im just terribly afraid did you ever have a feeling of something awful hanging over you then when he stared at her they both began to laugh you see why i didnt dare mention this before she said i knew youd think i was crazy on the contrary my training has taught me to appreciate the value of hunches only i call it intuition but why didnt you tell me you were so worried maybe i should be going with you i only wish id met nancy before she left oh no its probably me being a mother hen anyhow ill pick your brains when i get back somehow their fingers had become entwined dont worry kids all straighten out and if there are any real problems ill fly out over the weekend if you want me i shouldnt bother you an impersonal voice came over the loudspeaker flight fivesixnine now boarding for san francisco priscilla for gods sake dont you realize that i love you im glad i think i know i love you too their last moment together a beginning a promise of love she had called him the next night to say that she was worried and had to talk to him she was at dinner with nancy but would call as soon as she got back to her hotel would he be home he waited all night for the call but it never came she never got back to the hotel the next day he learned about the accident the steering apparatus of the car shed rented had failed the car had careened off the road into a ditch he probably should have gone to nancy but when he finally got through to where she was staying he spoke to carl harmon the professor who said he and nancy were planning to marry he sounded perfectly competent and very much in charge nancy wouldnt be returning to ohio they had told her mother of their plans at dinner mrs kiernan had been concerned about nancy s youth but that was natural she would be buried out there where her husband was interred the family had after all been residents of california for three generations until nancy was born nancy was bearing up well he thought that it was best for them to have a quiet wedding immediately nancy should not be alone now there had been nothing for lendon to do what could he do tell nancy that he and her mother had been falling in love the odds were that she would simply have resented him this professor harmon sounded fine and undoubtedly priscilla had simply been worried about nancy s taking such a decisive step as marriage at barely eighteen but surely there was nothing that he lendon could do about that decision hed been glad to accept the offer to teach at the university of london that was why hed been out of the country and had never learned of the harmon murder trial until after it was over it was at the university of london that he had met allison she was a teacher there and the sense of sharing that priscilla had begun to show him had made it impossible to go back to his wellordered solitary selfish life from time to time he had wondered where nancy harmon had vanished hed been living in the boston area for the last two years and she was only an hour and a half away maybe now he could somehow make up for the way he had failed priscilla before the phone rang an instant later the intercom light blinked on his phone he picked up the receiver mrs miles is on the phone doctor his secretary said allisons voice was filled with concern darling did you by chance hear the news about the harmon girl yes i did he had told allison about priscilla what are you going to do her question crystallized the decision he had already made subconsciously what i should have done years ago im going to try to help that girl ill call you as soon as i can god bless darling lendon picked up the intercom and spoke crisply to his secretary ask dr marcus to take over my afternoon appointments please tell him its an emergency and cancel my fouroclock class im driving to cape cod immediately chapter ten weve started dragging the lake ray weve got bulletins going out on the radio and tv stations and were getting manpower from all over to help in the search chief jed coffin of the adams port police tried to adopt the hearty tone that he would normally use if two children were missing but even looking at the agony in rays eyes and the ashen pallor of his face it was difficult to sound reassuring and solicitous ray had deceived him introduced him to his wife talked about her coming from virginia and having known dorothy there hed filled him with talk and never once told the truth and the chief hadnt guessed or even suspected that was the real irritation not once had he suspected to chief coffin what had happened was very clear that woman had seen the article about herself in the paper realized that everyone would know who she was and gone berserk did to these poor kids the same thing shed done to the others studying ray shrewdly he guessed that ray was thinking pretty much the same thing charred bits of the morning paper were still in the fireplace the chief realized ray was looking at them from the jagged way the unburned parts were torn it was obvious theyd been pulled apart by someone in a frenzy doc smathers still upstairs with her there was unconscious discourtesy in the question hed always called nancy mrs eldredge till now yes hes going to give her a needle to relax her but not to put her out weve got to talk to her oh god ray sat down at the diningroom table and buried his face in his hands only a few hours ago nancy had been sitting in this chair with missy in her arms and mike asking is it really your birthday mommy had he triggered something in nancy by demanding she celebrate and then that article had no ray looked up and blinked turning his head away from the sight of the policeman standing by the back door what is it chief coffin asked nancy is incapable of harming the children whatever happened it wasnt that your wife when shes herself wouldnt harm them but ive seen women go off the deep end and there is the history ray stood up his hands clenched the edge of the table his glance went past the chief dismissing him i need help he said real help the room was in chaos the police had made a quick search of the house before concentrating on the outside a police photographer was still taking pictures of the kitchen where the coffeepot had fallen spewing streams of black coffee on the stove and floor the telephone rang incessantly to every call the policeman answering said the chief will make a statement later the policeman at the phone came over to the table that was the ap he said the wire services have got hold of this well be mobbed in an hour the wire services ray remembered the haunted look that had only gradually left nancy s face he thought of the picture in this mornings paper with her hand up as though trying to fend off blows he pushed past chief coffin and hurried upstairs opening the door of the master bedroom the doctor was sitting next to nancy holding her hands you can hear me nancy he was saying you know you can hear me ray is here hes very worried about you talk to him nancy her eyes were closed dorothy had helped ray strip off the wet clothes theyd put a fluffy yellow robe on her but she seemed curiously small and inert inside it not unlike a child herself ray bent over her honey please youve got to help the children weve got to find them they need you try nancy please try ray i wouldnt dr smathers warned his lined sensitive face was deeply creased shes had some kind of terrible shock whether it was reading the article or something else her mind is fighting confronting it but weve got to know what it was ray said intently maybe she even saw someone take the children away nancy i know i understand its all right about the newspaper well face that together but darling where are the children you must help us find them do you think they went near the lake nancy shuddered a strangled cry came from somewhere in her throat her lips formed words find them find them we will find them but you must help please honey im going to help you sit up you can now come on ray leaned down and supported her in his arms he saw the raw skin on her face where the sand had burned it there was wet sand still clinging to her hair why unless i gave her a shot the doctor said it should relieve the anxiety but it wont be enough to knock her out she felt so heavy and vague this was the way shed felt for such a long time from the night mother died or maybe even before that so defenceless so pliable so without ability to choose or move or even speak she could remember how so many nights her eyes would be glued together so heavy so weary carl had been so patient with her he had done everything for her she had always told herself that she had to get stronger had to overcome this terrible lethargy but she never could but that was so long ago she didnt think about that any more not about carl not about the children not about rob legler the handsome student whod seemed to like her who made her laugh the children had been so gay when he was there so happy she had thought he was a real friend but then he sat on the witness stand and said she told me that her children would be smothered that was exactly what she said four days before they disappeared nancy please nancy why did you go to the lake she heard the stifled sound she made the lake did the children go there she must search for them she felt ray lifting her and slumped against him but then forced her body to begin to sit up it would be so much easier to slip away to slide into sleep just as she used to do thats it thats right nancy ray looked at the doctor do you think a cup of coffee the doctor nodded ill ask dorothy to make it coffee shed been making coffee when she saw that picture in the paper nancy opened her eyes ray she whispered theyll know everyone will know you cant hide you cant hide but there was something else the children she clutched his arm ray find them find my babies steady honey thats where we need you youve got to tell us every single thing just get your bearing for a few minutes dorothy came in with a cup of steaming coffee in her hand i made the instant how is she shes coming round captain coffin is anxious to begin questioning her ray panic made nancy clutch rays arm darling its just that we have to have help finding the children its all right she gulped the coffee welcoming the searing hot taste as she swallowed it if she could just think just wake up just lose this terrible sleepiness her voice she could talk now her lips felt rubbery thick spongelike but she had to talk make them find the children she wanted to go downstairs she mustnt stay here like last time waiting in her room unable to go downstairs to see all the people downstairs the policeman the faculty wives are there any relatives do you want us to call anyone no one no one no one leaning heavily on rays arm she stood up unsteadily ray she had his arm to lean on now his children his children ray i didnt hurt them of course not darling the voice too soothing the shocked sound of course he was shocked he was wondering why she would deny it no good mother spoke of hurting her children why then did she with a supreme effort she groped towards the door his arm around her waist steadied her steps she couldnt feel her feet they werent there she wasnt there it was one of the nightmares in a few minutes shed wake up as she had so many nights and slip out of bed and go in to see missy and michael and cover them and then get back into bed softly quietly not waking ray but in sleep hed reach out and his arms would pull her close and against the warm scent of him shed be calmed and sleep they started down the stairs so many policemen everyone looking up curiously still suspended in time chief coffin was at the diningroom table she could feel his hostility it was like last time mrs eldredge how do you feel a perfunctory question noncaring probably he wouldnt have bothered to ask except that ray was there im all right she had never liked this man were searching for the children i have every confidence that well find them quickly but you must help us when did you last see the children a few minutes before ten i put them outside to play and went upstairs to make the beds how long were you upstairs ten minutes not more than fifteen then what did you do i came downstairs i was going to turn on a wash and call the children but after i started the wash i decided to heat the coffee then i saw the boy deliver the community paper did you speak to him no i dont mean i saw him i went to get the paper and he was just going around the corner i see what happened then i went back into the kitchen i turned on the coffeepot it was still quite warm i started turning the pages of the paper and you saw the article about yourself nancy stared straight ahead and nodded her head how did you react to seeing that article i think i started to scream i dont know what happened to the coffeepot i knocked it over the coffee went all over it burned my hand why did you do that i dont know i didnt mean to it was just that i was going to burst i knew that everyone would start looking at me again theyd stare and whisper theyd say i killed the children and michael mustnt ever see that i ran with the paper i pushed it into the fireplace i lit a match and it burned it started to burn and i knew i had to get michael and missy i had to hide them but it was the way it was last time when the children were gone i ran out to get michael and missy i was afraid now this is important did you see the children no they were gone i started calling i ran to the lake mrs eldredge this is very important why did you go to the lake your husband tells me the children have never once been disobedient about going there why didnt you look on the road for them or in the woods or see if theyd decided to walk into town to buy you a birthday present why the lake because i was afraid because peter and lisa were drowned because i had to find michael and missy missys mitten was caught on the swing shes always losing a mitten i ran to the lake i had to get the children its going to be just like last time their faces all wet and quiet and they wont talk to me her voice trailed off chief coffin straightened up his tone became formal mrs eldredge he said it is my duty to inform you that you have a right to legal advice before you answer any further questions and that anything you say can be used against you without waiting for her response he got up and stalked out of the room and to the back door a car with a policeman at the wheel was waiting for him in the rear driveway as he stepped from the house thin driving pellets of sleet stung his face and head he got into the car and the wind blew the door closed behind him scraping it against his shoe he winced at the short stab of pain in his ankle and growled the lake fat chance they had of doing any searching if this weather got any worse at noon it was already so dark youd think it was nighttime the diving operation was a mess under optimal conditions maushop was among the biggest lakes on the cape and one of the deepest and most treacherous that was why over the years thered been so many drownings there you could be wading up to your waist and at the next step be in forty feet of water if those kids had been drowned it might be spring before their bodies surfaced the way the temperature was dropping the lake would be fit for iceskating in a few days the lakeside normally deserted at this time of the year and certainly in this kind of weather was crowded with bystanders who huddled together in small clusters silently watching the ropedoff area where the divers and their apparatus were flanked by police chief coffin jumped out of the squad car and hurried to the beach he went directly to peter regan the lieutenant who was supervising the operation petes eloquent shrug answered his unasked question hunching his shoulders inside his coat the chief stamped his feet as the sleet melted into his shoes he wondered if this was the spot from which nancy eldredge had dragged her kids into the water now men were risking their own lives because of her god only knew where or when those poor little kids would be found shows what happened a technicality a convicted murderess gets off because a smartass lawyer gets a couple of bleedingheart judges to declare a mistrial angrily he spat out petes name pete turned to him quickly sir how long are those guys planning to keep diving theyve been down twice and after this session theyll try once more then take a break and set up in a different location he pointed to the television equipment looks like well make the headlines tonight youd better have a statement ready with numbed fingers the chief dug into his coat pocket ive scribbled one down he read it quickly we are conducting a massive effort to find the eldredge children volunteers are making a blockbyblock search of the immediate vicinity of their home as well as the neighbouring wooded areas helicopters are conducting an air reconnaissance the search of maushop lake because of its proximity to the eldredge home must be considered a normal extension of the investigation but a few minutes later when he delivered that statement to the growing assemblage of reporters one of them asked is it true that nancy eldredge was found hysterical and drenched in this area of maushop lake this morning after her children disappeared that is true a thin sharpeyed reporter who he knew was connected with boston channel s news team asked in view of that fact and her past history doesnt the search of the lake take on a new aspect we are exploring all possibilities now the questions came thick and fast the reporters interrupting one another to ask them in view of the past tragedy wouldnt the disappearance of the eldredge children be considered of suspicious origin to answer that question could prejudice mrs eldredges rights when will you question her again as soon as possible is it known whether mrs eldredge was aware of the article about her that came out this morning i believe she was what was her reaction to that article i cant say isnt it a fact that most if not all of the people in this town were unaware of mrs eldredges past that is true were you aware of her identity no i was not the chief spoke through clenched teeth no more questions then before he could get away another question came a reporter from the boston herald blocked his path all the other news personnel stopped trying to get the chiefs attention when they heard him ask loudly sir in the past six years havent there been several unsolved deaths of young children both on the cape and on the nearby mainland that is true chief coffin how long has nancy harmon eldredge been living on the cape six years i believe thank you chief chapter eleven jonathan knowles did not realize how much time was slipping by neither was he aware of the activity in the area near maushop lake his subconscious had registered the fact that heavierthanusual traffic was passing on the road in front of his house but his study was to the back of the house and much of the sound was filtered out before it came to his ears after the first shock of realizing that ray eldredges wife was the notorious nancy harmon hed got another cup of coffee and settled down at his desk he resolved to stick to his schedule to begin to study the harmon murder case just as hed planned if he found that knowing nancy harmon personally in some way clouded his ability to write about her hed simply eliminate this chapter from his book he began his research by carefully studying the sensational article in the cape paper with grim detail that insidiously evoked horror in the reader it reviewed nancy harmons background as the young wife of a college professor two children a home on the college campus an ideal situation until the day professor harmon sent a student to his house to repair the oil burner the student was goodlooking glib and experienced with women and nancy barely twentyfive herself had flipped over him jonathan read excerpts from the trial testimony in the article the student rob legler explained how he had met nancy when professor harmon got that call from his wife about the oil burner not working i was in his office theres just nothing mechanical i cant fix so i volunteered to go over he didnt want me to do it but he couldnt get the regular maintenance service and had to get the heat back on in his house did he give you any specific instructions concerning his family a district attorney asked yes he said that his wife wasnt well and i shouldnt bother her that if i needed anything or wanted to discuss whatever problem i found i should call him did you follow professor harmons instructions i would have sir but i couldnt help the fact that his wife followed me around like a little dog objection objection but the defence attorney had been too late the point had been made and further evidence from the student had been totally damaging he was asked if he had had any physical contact with mrs harmon his answer was direct yes sir how did it happen i was showing her where the emergency switch was on the oil burner it was one of those oldfashioned hot airblower types and the switch had caused the problem didnt professor harmon tell you not to trouble mrs harmon with any questions or explanations she insisted on knowing about it said she had to learn how to manage things in her house so i showed her then she was sort of leaning over me to try the switch and well i figured why not so i made a pass what did mrs harmon do she liked it i could tell will you please explain exactly what happened it wasnt really what happened cause nothing much actually happened it was just that she liked it sort of spun her around and grabbed her and kissed her and after a minute she pulled away but she didnt want to what happened then i said something about that being pretty good what did mrs harmon say she just looked at me and said almost like she wasnt talking to me she said ive got to get away i figured i didnt want to get in any trouble i mean i didnt want to do anything to get kicked out of school and end up being drafted that was the whole reason for the college scene so i said look mrs harmon only then i decided it was about time to call her nancy so i said look nancy this doesnt have to be a problem we can work something out so we can get together without anyone ever guessing you cant leave here youve got the kids how did mrs harmon respond to that statement well its funny just then the boy peter came down the stairs looking for her he was a real quiet kid didnt say boo she looked mad and said the children then she sort of laughed and said but theyre going to be smothered mr legler this is a crucial sentence youre quoting are you sure you are repeating mrs harmons exact phrasing yes sir i am it really made me feel spooky right then thats why im so sure of it but of course you dont really believe that anyone means it when they say something like that on what date did nancy harmon make that statement it was on november thirteenth i know because when i went back to school professor harmon insisted on giving me a cheque for fixing the burner november thirteenth and four days later the harmon children disappeared from their mothers automobile and eventually were washed in on the shores of san francisco bay with plastic bags over their heads in effect smothered thats right the defence attorney had tried to reduce the impact of the story did you continue to embrace mrs harmon no she went upstairs with the kids then we have only your statement that she enjoyed the kiss you forced on her believe me i can tell a receptive babe when im with one and nancy s sworn testimony when asked about that incident yes he did kiss me yes i believe that i knew he was going to and i let him do you also remember making the statement that your children were going to be smothered yes i do what did you mean by that statement according to the article nancy simply looked past her attorney and stared unseeingly over the faces in the courtroom i dont know she said in a dreamy voice jonathan shook his head and swore silently that girl should never have been permitted to take the witness stand she did nothing except damage her own case he continued reading and winced as he came to the description of the finding of those pathetic children washed in both of them two weeks and fifty miles apart bodies badly swollen seaweed clinging to them the little girls body savagely mutilated probably by shark bites the handmade bright red sweaters with the white design still miraculously colourful against the small bodies after hed finished reading the article jonathan turned his attention to the voluminous file kevin had sent him leaning back in his chair he began to read through it starting with the first newspaper clipping headlining the disappearance of the harmon children from their mothers automobile while she was shopping blowups of fuzzy snapshots of both of the children a minutely detailed description of their weight and size and what they were wearing anyone with any information please call this special number with his carefully trained mind and eyes jonathan read rapidly assorting and assimilating information lightly underlining cogent facts he wanted to refer to later when he began reading the transcript of the trial he understood why kevin had referred to nancy harmon as a sitting duck for the prosecutor the girl didnt even make sense she had played so completely into the prosecutors hands the way she testified without fight her protestations of innocence sounding perfunctory and emotionless what had been the matter with her jonathan wondered it was almost as though she didnt want to get off at one point shed even said to the husband right from the witness stand oh carl can you forgive me the creases along jonathans forehead deepened as he recalled that just a few hours before hed passed the eldredges house and glanced in at that young family around the breakfast table hed compared them with his own solitary state and had been envious now their life was ripped apart theyd never be able to stay in as insular a community as the cape knowing that everywhere they went people were pointing and talking anyone would instantly recognize nancy from that one picture even he remembered her wearing that tweed suit and recently too suddenly jonathan recalled the occasion it had been at lowerys market hed run into nancy when they were both shopping and theyd stopped for a few minutes to talk hed admired the suit telling her that there was nothing betterlooking than a good tweed and pure wool of course none of that synthetic junk that had no depth or sheen nancy had looked very pretty a yellow scarf knotted casually at her neck had picked up the glint of yellow in the predominantly brown and rustcoloured material shed smiled a warm lovely smile that wrapped you in it the children were with her nice polite children both of them then the boy had said oh mommy ill get the cereal and as he reached for it he knocked over a pyramid of soup cans the clatter had brought everyone in the store running including lowery himself who was a sour disagreeable man many young mothers might have been embarrassed and started berating the child jonathan had admired the way nancy said very quietly were sorry mr lowery it was an accident well take care of it then she said to the little boy who looked stricken and worried dont be upset mike you didnt mean it come on lets pile them back up jonathan had helped with the restacking after first shooting a menacing glare at lowery whod obviously been about to make some kind of remark it seemed so hard to believe that seven years ago today that same considerate young woman could have deliberately taken the life of two other children children she had brought into life but passion was a powerful motive and she had been young maybe her very indifference at her trial had been acceptance of guilt even though she couldnt publicly bring herself to admit such a heinous crime hed seen that kind of thing happen too the doorbell rang jonathan got up from his chair surprised few people visited unannounced at the cape and any doortodoor selling was absolutely forbidden as he walked to the door jonathan realized how stiff hed become from sitting to his amazement his visitor was a policeman a young man whose face he only vaguely recognized from seeing him in a squad car selling some kind of tickets was jonathans immediate thought but he discarded that idea at once the young officer accepted his invitation to step inside there was something crisply efficient and serious about his demeanour sir im sorry to bother you but were investigating the disappearance of the eldredge children then while jonathan stared at him he pulled out a notebook his eyes darting around the orderly house he began his questions you live alone here sir do you not without answering jonathan reached past him and opened the massive front door at last he became aware of the presence of unfamiliar cars driving down the road towards the lake and the sight of grimfaced men in heavy rain gear swarming through the neighbourhood chapter twelve just sip this nancy your hands are so cold it will help you you need your strength dorothys voice was cajoling nancy shook her head dorothy set the cup on the table hoping the aroma of the fresh vegetables bubbling in a spicy base of tomato soup might tempt her i made that yesterday nancy said tonelessly for the childrens lunch the children must be hungry ray was sitting next to her his arm slung protectively across the back of her chair an ashtray filled high with groundout cigarettes in front of him dont torture yourself dear he said quietly outside over the rattling of the shutters and windowpanes they could hear the staccato sound of helicopters flying low ray answered the question he saw on nancy s face theyve got three helicopters scanning the area theyll spot the kids if they just wandered away theyve got volunteers from every town on the cape there are two planes over the bay and sound everyones helping and there are divers in the lake nancy said looking for my childrens bodies her voice was a remote monotone after giving the statement to the news media chief coffin had gone back to the police station to make a series of phone calls when they were completed he returned to the eldredge house coming in just in time to hear nancy s words his practised glance took in the staring quality of the eyes the ominous stillness of her hands and body the facile expression and voice approaching a state of shock again and theyd be lucky if she was able to answer to her own name before long he looked past her his eyes seeking bernie miles the policeman hed left on duty in the house bernie was standing at the doorway of the kitchen poised to pick up the telephone if it rang bernies sandy hair was plastered neatly over his bony skull his prominent eyes softened by short blond lashes moved horizontally accepting the signalled message chief coffin looked again at the three people around the table ray got up walked behind his wifes chair and put his hands on her shoulders twenty years disappeared for jed coffin he remembered the night hed gotten a call at the precinct house when he was a rookie cop in boston that delias folks had been in an accident and it wasnt likely theyd make it hed gone home shed been sitting in the kitchen in her nightgown and robe sipping a cup of her favourite instant hot chocolate reading the paper shed turned surprised to see him early but smiling and before he said one word hed done just what ray eldredge was doing now pressed his hands on her shoulders holding her hell wasnt that the guts of the departure speech stewardesses used to rattle off on airplanes in the event of an emergency landing sit straight grip the arms of your seats plant your feet solidly on the floor what they were saying was let the shock pass through you ray can i see you privately he asked brusquely rays hands contined to steady nancy s shoulders as her body began to shake did you find my children she asked now her voice was almost a whisper honey hed tell us if he found the kids just sit tight here ill be right back ray bent down and for an instant laid his cheek on hers without seeming to expect a response he straightened up and led the chief through the connecting foyer into the large livingroom jed coffin felt an unwilling admiration for the tall young man who positioned himself by the fireplace before turning to face him there was something so gutlevel selfpossessed about ray even in these circumstances fleetingly he remembered that ray had been decorated for outstanding leadership under fire in vietnam and given a field promotion to captain he had class no doubt about that there was class inherent in the way ray stood and talked and dressed and moved in the firm contours of his chin and mouth in the strong wellshaped hand that rested lightly on the mantel stalling to regain his sense of rightness and authority jed looked slowly around the room the wide oak floorboards shone softly under oval hooked rugs a dry sink stood between the leadedpaned windows the mellow creamy walls were covered with paintings jed realized that the scenes in them were familiar the large painting over the fireplace was nancy eldredges rock garden the countrygraveyard scene over the piano was that old private cemetery down the road from our lady of the cape church the pineframed painting over the couch had caught the homecoming flavour of sesuit harbour at sundown as all the boats came sailing in the watercolour of the windswept cranberry bog had the old hunt house the lookout barely outlined in the background jed had occasionally noticed nancy eldredge sketching around town but never dreamed that she was any good most women he knew who fooled around with that sort of thing usually ended up framing stuff that looked like exhibits from show and tell builtin bookcases flanked the fireplace the tables made of heavy old distressed pine werent unlike the ones he remembered theyd donated to the church bazaar after his grandmother died pewter lamps like hers were on the low tables next to comfortable overstuffed chairs the rocker by the fireplace had a handembroidered cushion and back somewhat uncomfortably jed compared this room with his own newlydecorated livingroom delia had picked out black vinyl for the couch and chairs a glasstopped table with steel legs walltowall carpeting thick yellow shag that clawed at the shoes and faithfully preserved and displayed every drop of saliva or pee their stilluntrained dachshund bestowed on it what do you want chief rays voice was cold and unfriendly the chief knew that to ray he was an enemy ray had seen through his routine admonition to nancy about her rights ray knew exactly how he felt and was fighting him well if a fight was what he wanted with the ease born of experience garnered from countless similar sessions jed coffin sought out the weakness and directed his attention to it who is your wifes lawyer ray he asked curtly a flicker of uncertainty a stiffening of the body betrayed the answer just as jed had figured ray hadnt taken the decisive step still trying to pretend his wife was the average distraught mother of missing children christ hed probably want to put her on a television news show tonight handkerchief twisting in her hands eyes swollen voice pleading give me back my children well jed had news for ray his precious wife had done that scene before jed could get copies of the sevenyearold film the newspapers had called a moving plea in fact the assistant district attorney in san francisco had offered to provide it during their telephone conversation only half an hour ago itll save that bitch the trouble of going through her act again hed said ray was speaking quietly his tone a hell of a lot more subdued we havent contacted a lawyer he said i hoped that maybe with everyone searching most of that search is going to be suspended pretty soon jed said flatly with this weather there isnt going to be anyone able to see anything but ive got to take your wife down to the station for questioning and if you havent arranged for a lawyer yet ill have the court appoint one for her you cant do that ray snapped the words furiously then made an obvious effort to control himself what i mean is that you would destroy nancy if you took her to a policestation setting for years she used to have nightmares and they were always the same that she was in a police station being questioned and then that she was taken down a long corridor to the mortuary and made to identify her children my god man shes in shock right now are you trying to make sure that she wont be able to tell us anything she may have seen ray my job is to get your children back yes but you see what just reading that cursed article has done to her and what about the bastard who wrote that article anyone vile enough to dig up that story and send it out might be capable of taking the children naturally were working on that that feature is always signed with a fictitious staff name but the articles are actually freelance submissions that if accepted involve a twentyfivedollar payment well who is the writer then that was what we tried to find out jed replied he sounded angry the covering letter instructed that the story was offered only on condition that if accepted it would not be changed at all that all the accompanying pictures would be used and that it would be published on november seventeenth today the editor told me that he found the story both well written and fascinating in fact he felt it was so good that he thought the writer was a fool to have submitted it to him for a lousy twentyfive dollars but of course he didnt say so he dictated a letter accepting the conditions and enclosing the cheque jed reached into his hip pocket for his notebook and flipped it open the letter of acceptance was dated october twentyeighth on the twentyninth the editors secretary remembers receiving a phone call asking if a decision had been reached about the harmon article it was a bad connection and the voice was so muffled she could hardly hear the caller but she told him or her that a cheque was in the mail care of general delivery hyannis port the cheque was made out to one jr penrose the next day it was picked up man or woman ray asked quickly we dont know as you have to realize a town like hyannis port has a fair number of tourists going through it even at this time of the year anyone requesting something from general delivery would only have to ask for it no clerk seems to remember the letter and so far a twentyfivedollar cheque hasnt been cashed we can work our way back to jr penrose when it is frankly it wouldnt surprise me if the writer turns out to be one of our own little old ladies in town they can be just wonderful at digging into gossip ray stared into the fireplace its cool in here he said a fire will feel good his eye fell on the cameos on the mantelpiece that nancy had painted of michael and missy when they were babies he swallowed over the stinging lump that suddenly closed his throat i dont think you really need a fire in here now ray jed said quietly i asked you to step in here because i want you to tell nancy to get dressed and come with us to the station house no no please chief coffin and ray whirled to face the archway leading into the room nancy was standing there one hand leaning against the carved oak archway for support her hair had dried and she had pulled it into a bun caught loosely against the nape of her neck the strain of the past hours had turned her skin a chalky white that was accentuated by the dark hair an almost detached expression was settling into her eyes dorothy was behind her she wanted to come in dorothys voice was apologetic now she felt the accusation in rays eyes as he hurried over to them ray im sorry i couldnt make her stay inside ray pulled nancy against him its all right dorothy he said briefly his voice changed and became tender honey just relax nobodys going to hurt you dorothy felt the dismissal in his tone he had counted on her to keep nancy away while he spoke to the chief and she couldnt even do that much she was useless here useless ray she said stiffly its ridiculous to bother you about this but the office just phoned to remind me that mr kragopoulos who wrote about the hunt property wants to see it at two oclock shall i get someone else to take him up there ray looked over nancy s head as he held her firmly against him i dont give a damn he snapped then quickly he said im sorry dorothy i would appreciate it if you showed the place you know the lookout and can sell it if theres real interest poor old mr hunt needs the money i havent told mr parrish that we might be bringing people in today his lease clearly states that we have the right to show the house at any time with simply a half hours telephone notice thats why he has it so cheap give him a call from the office and tell him youre coming all right uncertainly dorothy waited not wanting to go ray he looked at her understanding her unspoken wish but dismissing her theres nothing you can do here now dorothy come back when youve finished at the lookout she nodded and turned to go she didnt want to leave them she wanted to stay with them sharing their anxiety ever since that first day when shed walked into rays office hed been a lifeline for her after nearly twentyfive years of planning her every activity with kenneth or around kenneths schedule shed been so rootless and for the first time in her life frightened but working with ray helping him to build the business using her knowledge of interior decorating to spark people to buy the houses then invest in renovating them had filled so much of the void ray was such a fair fine person hed given her such a generous profitsharing arrangement she couldnt have thought more of him if hed been her own son when nancy had come shed been so proud that nancy trusted her but there was a reserve in nancy that didnt permit any real intimacy and now she felt like an unnecessary bystander wordlessly she left them got her coat and scarf and went to the back door she braced herself against the wind and sleet as she opened it her car was parked halfway around the semicircular back driveway she was glad she didnt have to go through the front drive one of the networks had a television van parked in front of the house as she hurried towards her car she saw the swing on the tree at the edge of the property that was where the children had been playing and where nancy had found the mitten how many times had she herself pushed the children on that swing michael and missy the awful possibility that something might have happened to them that they might be dead gave her a terrible choking sensation oh please not that almighty and merciful god please not that shed joked once about being their surrogate grandmother and then the look of pain had been so unmistakable on nancy s face that she had wanted to bite her tongue off it had been a presumptuous thing to say she stared at the swing lost in thought unmindful of the wet sleet stinging her face whenever nancy stopped in the office the children made a beeline for her desk she tried to always have a surprise for them just yesterday when nancy had come in with missy shed had tollhouse cookies shed baked the night before as the special treat nancy had been on her way to look at drapery material and dorothy had offered to mind missy and pick up michael from kindergarten its hard to select material unless you can really concentrate shed said and i have to pick up some titlesearch papers at the courthouse it will be fun to have company and on the way back well get some icecream if thats all right only twentyfour hours ago dorothy startled she looked up jonathan must have cut through the woods from his house his face was deeply creased today she knew he must be nearly sixty years old and today he looked every bit of it i just heard about the eldredge children he said ive got to talk to ray possibly i can help thats nice of you dorothy said unsteadily the concern in his voice was oddly comforting theyre inside no trace of the children yet no i saw the article in the paper belatedly dorothy realized that sympathy was not being offered to her there was a coolness in jonathans tone a reproof that clearly reminded her that she had lied to him about having known nancy in virginia wearily she opened the door of her car i have an appointment she said abruptly without giving him time to answer she got in and started up the engine it was only when her vision blurred that she realized that tears were swimming in her eyes chapter thirteen the clatter of the helicopters pleased him it reminded him of the last time when everyone for miles around the university had fanned out looking for the children he stared out of the front window overlooking the bay the grey water was caked with ice near the jetty earlier the radio had spoken of gale warnings and sleet or rain mixed with snow for once the weatherman had been right the wind was whipping the bay into angry whitecaps he watched as a flock of gulls flew unsteadily in a futile effort to make headway against the wind he carefully consulted the indooroutdoor thermometer twentyeight degrees out there now a drop of twenty degrees since the morning the helicopters and search planes wouldnt be up much longer in this there wouldnt be many searchers out on land either high tide was seven oclock tonight at that time hed take the children up through the attic to the outer balcony they called the widows walk the water at high tide covered the beach below broke furiously against the retaining wall and then sucked by the violent undertow rolled back to sea that would be the time to drop the children over down they might not be washed up for weeks but even if they were found in a few days hed prepared for that hed given them only milk and cookies he wouldnt be fool enough to feed them anything that would suggest that a person other than nancy had fed them a real meal after breakfast of course hopefully theyd be beyond analysis when they were found he chuckled in the meantime he had five hours five long hours to look at the floodlights that were being set up near nancy s house and the lake five hours to be with the children even the boy come to think of it was a beautiful child such soft skin and that perfectly formed body but it was the little girl she looked so much like nancy that silky beautiful hair and small wellformed ears he turned from the window abruptly the children were lying together on the couch the sedative hed put in the milk had both of them sleeping the boys arm was protectively over his sister but he didnt even stir when he picked up the little girl hed just take her inside and put her on the bed and undress her she made no sound as he carefully carried her into the bedroom and laid her down he went into the bathroom and turned on the faucets in the tub testing the gushing water until it reached the temperature he wanted when the tub had filled he tested the water again with his elbow a little hotter than it should be but that was all right it would cool in a few minutes he sucked in his breath he was wasting time swiftly he opened the door of the medicine cabinet nd pulled out the can of baby powder hed slipped into his coat pocket at wiggins market this morning as he was about to close the door he noticed a little rubber duck poked back behind the shaving cream hed forgotten about that why it had been used the last time how appropriate laughing softly he reached for the duck ran it under cold water feeling the lack of elasticity and the cracking of the rubber then tossed it into the tub it was a good idea to distract children sometimes grabbing the can of powder he hurried back into the bedroom swiftly his fingers unbuttoned missys jacket and pulled it off easily he slipped the turtleneck polo shirt over her head bringing her undershirt with it he sighed a lingering groaning sound and picked up the little girl hugging her limp body to him three years old just a beautiful age she stirred and started to open her eyes mommy mommy it was a weak lazy cry so dear so precious the phone rang angrily he tightened his grip on the child and she began to wail a hopeless lethargic cry hed let the phone ring he never never got calls why now his eyes narrowed it might be a call from the town asking him to volunteer in the search hed better answer it might be suspicious not to answer he tossed missy back on to the bed and closed the bedroom door securely before he picked up the phone in the sittingroom yes he made his voice sound formal and cold mr parrish i hope i havent disturbed you this is dorothy prentiss of eldredge realty im sorry to give you such short notice but ill be bringing a prospective buyer for the house over in twenty minutes will you be there or shall i use my passkey to show your apartment chapter fourteen lendon miles turned right off route a on to paddock path all the way down on the trip from boston hed kept his radio at a news station and most of the news was about nancy eldredge and the missing eldredge children according to the bulletins maushop lake had been divided into sections but it would take divers at least three days to search it properly maushop lake was filled with underwater ledges police chief coffin of adams port was quoted as explaining that at one point it was possible to walk halfway across the lake and still be in water only to the waist a few yards away only five feet from the shore the water became forty feet deep the underwater ledges caught and held objects and made the search hazardous and inconclusive the bulletins announced that helicopters small seaplanes and ground search parties had been out but gale warnings for the cape were in effect and the air search was being called off at the news that nancy eldredge was expected to be taken to police headquarters for questioning lendon unconsciously accelerated the car he felt a desperate urgency about getting to nancy but he quickly found that he had to reduce his speed sleet was glazing the windshield so rapidly that the defroster was having trouble melting the crusting ice when at last he turned into paddock path he had no trouble finding the eldredge home there was no mistaking the centre of activity on the street halfway up the road a television van was parked across the street from a house that had two police cars stationed in front of it private cars lined the road near the television van many bore special press identifications the entrance to the semicircular driveway was blocked by one of the police cars lendon stopped and waited for a policeman to come over to him when one did his tone was brusque state your business please lendon had anticipated that question and was ready he handed out his card with a note scrawled on it please take this to mrs eldredge the policeman looked uncertain if youll wait here doctor ill have to check he returned promptly his attitude subtly less hostile ill move the squad car out of the way park in the driveway and go into the house sir from across the street reporters had been watching the byplay and then hurried over one of them thrust a microphone in front of lendons face as he got out of the car dr miles may we ask you a few questions without waiting for an answer he went on quickly sir you are a prominent psychiatrist on the staff of harvard medical school has the eldredge family sent for you no one has sent for me lendon replied sharply i am a friend was a friend of mrs eldredges mother i have come here because of personal friendship and that alone he tried to pass but was blocked by the microphoneholding reporter you say you were a friend of mrs eldredges mother will you tell us this was nancy harmon eldredge ever a patient of yours absolutely not lendon literally shoved his way through the reporters and on to the porch the front door was being held open by another policeman right in there the man said indicating the room to the right nancy eldredge was standing at the fireplace next to a tall young man undoubtedly her husband lendon would have known her anywhere the finely chiselled nose the large midnightblue eyes that looked straight out from under thick lashes the widows peak at the hairline the profile that was so like priscillas ignoring the openly hostile look of the police officer and the scrutiny of the craggyfaced man at the window he went directly to nancy i should have come before he said the girls eyes had a staring quality but she knew what he meant i thought you would come last time she told him when mother died i was so sure you would come and you didnt expertly lendon measured the symptoms of shock that he could see the enlarged pupils the rigidity of her body the low monotone quality of her voice he turned to ray i want to help if theres any possible way he said ray studied him intently and instinctively liked what he saw then as a doctor try to persuade the chief here that it would be a disaster to take nancy to the police station he said flatly nancy stared into lendons face she felt so detached as though each minute she were slipping farther and farther away but there was something about this dr miles mother had liked him so much mothers letters had sounded so happy more and more often his name had been in them when her mother had come out to visit her at college shed asked about the doctor how important was he but carl was with them and mother didnt seem to want to talk about him then she just smiled and said oh terribly important but ill fill you in later dear she could remember that so clearly she had wanted to meet dr miles somehow shed been sure that when he heard about mothers accident he would call her she had needed to talk to someone who loved mother too you loved my mother didnt you it was her voice asking that question she wasnt even aware that she had intended to ask it yes i did very much i didnt know that she had told you about me i thought you might resent me i should have tried to help you help me now he took her hands in his her terribly cold hands ill try nancy i promise she sagged and her husband put his arms around her lendon liked the looks of ray eldredge the younger mans face was grey with anxiety but he bore himself well his attitude towards his wife was protective he obviously had a firm grip on his emotions lendon noticed the small framed picture on the table next to the sofa it was an outdoor snapshot of ray holding a little boy and girl the missing children of course what a handsome family interesting that nowhere in this room could he see a single picture of nancy he wondered if she ever allowed herself to be photographed nancy come honey youve got to rest ray gently eased her down on to the sofa and lifted her feet now thats better she obediently leaned back lendon watched as her eyes focused on the snapshot of ray and the children and then closed in pain a shiver made her entire body tremble i think wed better stir up this fire he told ray he selected a mediumsized log from the basket on the fireplace and threw it on to the smouldering hearth a shower of flames sprayed up ray tucked a quilt around nancy youre so cold darling he said for an instant he held her face between his hands tears trickled from under her closed eyelids and dampened his fingers ray have i your permission to represent nancy as her legal counsel jonathans voice had subtly altered it was infused with an authoritative crispness calmly he met the astonished stares i assure you i am well qualified he said drily legal counsel nancy whispered from somewhere she could see the colourless frightened face of the lawyer last time domes that had been his name joseph domes hed kept saying to her but you must tell me the truth you must trust me to help you even he hadnt believed her but jonathan knowles was different she liked his bigness and the courtly way he always spoke to her and he was so attentive to the children when he stopped to speak lowerys market that was it a couple of weeks ago hed helped her and mike to stack up the cans that mike had knocked over he liked her she was sure instinctively she knew it she opened her eyes please she said looking at ray ray nodded wed be very grateful jonathan jonathan turned to lendon doctor may i have your medical opinion as to the advisability of allowing mrs eldredge to be taken to the police station for questioning it is highly inadvisable lendon said promptly i would urge that any questioning be done here but i cant remember nancy s voice was weary as though she had said those same words so many times you say i know where my children are but i dont remember anything from when i saw that paper in the kitchen this morning until i heard ray calling me she looked up at lendon her eyes clouded and staring can you help me to remember is there any way what do you mean lendon asked i mean isnt there some way you can give me something so that if i know or saw or did even if did something i have to know that isnt something you can hide if there is some awfui part of me that could hurt my children we have to know that too and if there isnt but if somehow i know where they might be were just wasting time now nancy i wont let but ray stopped when he saw the anguish in her face is it possible to help nancy to remember what happened this morning doctor jonathan asked perhaps she is probably suffering from a form of amnesia which is not uncommon after what to her was a catastrophic experience in medical terms its a hysterical amnesia under an injection of sodium amytal she would be relaxed and probably able to tell us what happened the truth as she knows it answers given under sedation would not be admissible in court jed snapped i cant have you questioning mrs eldredge like that i used to have such a good memory nancy murmured once at college we had a contest to see who could recall what shed done every day you just kept going backwards day by day until you couldnt remember any more i won by so much it was a joke in the dorm everything was so clear the telephone rang and had the effect of a pistol exploding in the room nancy shrank back and ray covered her hands with his they all waited silently until the policeman on duty at the phone came into the room he said long distance for you chief i can assure you that this is the call ive been trying to place jed told nancy and ray mr knowles id appreciate it if youd come with me you too ray be right back darling ray murmured to nancy then he looked into lendons face satisfied with what he saw he followed the other men out of the room lendon watched as relief drained from nancy s expression every time it rings i think somebody has found the children and theyre safe she murmured and then i think it will be like last time when the call came steady lendon said nancy this is important tell me when you started having trouble remembering specific events when peter and lisa died but maybe even before that its so hard to remember the years i was married to carl that could be because you associate those years with the children and its too painful to remember anything about them but during those five years i was so terribly tired so much after mother died always so tired poor carl so patient he did everything for me he got up with the children at night even when they were babies everything was such an effort for me after the children disappeared i couldnt remember like now i just couldnt her voice had begun to rise ray came back into the room something had happened lendon could see it in the taut lines around rays mouth the slight trembling of his hands he found himself praying please dont let it be bad news doctor could you speak with jonathan for a minute please ray was making a determined effort to keep his voice even certainly lendon hurried towards the arched doorway that led into the family and diningroom sure that the phone call had badly upset ray when he got to the diningroom chief coffin was still on the phone he was barking orders to the lieutenant on duty at the station get the hell down to that post office and round up every clerk who was on duty october thirtieth and dont stop questioning them until somebody remembers who picked up that letter from the community news addressed to jr penrose i need a full description and i need it now he slammed the receiver into its cradle there was new tension in jonathan too without preamble he said doctor we cant lose any time in trying to break through nancy s amnesia to fill you in have a very complete file on the harmon case because of a book im writing ive spent the last three hours studying that file and reading the article that appeared in todays paper something struck me that seemed of the greatest possible importance and i asked chief coffin to phone the district attorney in san francisco and check my theory his assistant has just returned the call jonathan reached into his pocket for his pipe clamped his teeth on it without lighting it and continued doctor as you may know in cases of missing children where foul play is suspected the police will often deliberately withhold a piece of information so that they have some help in sifting through the inevitable meaningless clues they receive after a publicized disappearance he began to speak more quickly as though he felt he was letting too much time pass i noticed that all the newspaper accounts seven years ago described the missing children as wearing red cardigan sweaters with a white pattern when they disappeared nowhere in any of the extensive newspaper coverage is there an exact description of what that pattern was i surmised correctly that the motif of the pattern had been deliberately withheld jonathan looked directly at lendon wanting him to understand immediately the importance of what he was about to tell him the article which appeared in the cape cod community news clearly states that when the harmon children disappeared they were wearing red cardigan sweaters with an unusual white sailboat design and that they were still wearing them when their bodies were washed ashore weeks later now nancy of course was aware of that sailboat design she made those sweaters herself but only one other person outside of the top people on the san francisco investigative staff knew about that design jonathans voice rose in pitch if we assume nancy s innocence that person was the one who kidnapped the harmon children seven years ago and who one month ago wrote the story that appeared in todays paper then you mean lendon began doctor i mean as nancy s lawyer and friend if you can break through her amnesia do it quickly i have persuaded ray that it is worthwhile to waive any immunity the overriding necessity is to find out what nancy may know otherwise it will surely be too late to help her children can i telephone a drugstore and get something delivered lendon asked you call doctor jed ordered ill send a squad car over to pick up whatever you need here ill dial the drugstore for you quietly lendon phoned his instructions and when he had finished went into the kitchen for a glass of water oh the waste he thought the awful waste the tragedy that had begun with priscillas accident cause and effect cause and effect if priscilla had not died she probably would have persuaded nancy not to marry so young the harmon children would never have been born sharply he pulled himself back from useless speculation the kitchen had obviously been gone over for fingerprints grains of powder were still evident on the countertops around the sink and on the stove no one had wiped up the stain from where coffee had spilled he returned to the diningroom to hear chief coffin say remember jonathan i may well be exceeding my authority as it is but im going to have a taperecorder on in that room when that girl is questioned if she confesses to anything under sedation we may not be able to use it directly but ill know what to ask her under regular questioning later shes not going to confess to anything jonathan said impatiently what concerns me is that if we accept her innocence as a fact not only about michael and missys disappearance but also her innocence in the murder of the harmon children then our next supposition becomes this if the killer of the harmon children wrote the article for the community news and used a hyannis post office he has been here on the cape for some time and you are saying that he abducted the eldredge children this morning chief coffin finished jonathan relit his pipe and puffed at it vigorously before answering im afraid so he said his tone of voice deliberately devoid of expression made lendon understand what he meant jonathan believed that if the killer of the harmon children had taken michael and missy eldredge they were probably dead on the other hand jed theorized if we remove mrs eldredge as a suspect it is equally possible that someone who never came forward at the harmon trial knew something about these murders wrote that article and has now kidnapped the eldredge children a third possibility is that the two cases are unrelated except that someone reading that article and recognizing nancy eldredge has become involved in the disappearance this morning the children may have been taken by a frustrated mother who feels nancy doesnt deserve them ive seen a lot screwier rationalizations than that in my day jed snapped jonathan what im trying to say is that no matter who else may have become involved one fact is very clear i dont believe theres any question but that nancy knew more than she told about the disappearance of her children seven years ago lendon raised an eyebrow jed frowned deeply at the expressions on the faces of the two men jonathan slapped his hand impatiently on the table im not saying that that girl is guilty i am saying that she knew more than she told probably knew more than she was aware of knowing look at the pictures of her on the witness stand her face is an absolute blank read the testimony for gods sake man read the trial testimony that girl was out of it her lawyer may have upset her conviction on a technicality but that doesnt mean that he didnt let that district attorney crucify her that entire setup stank and youre trying to reenact it here im trying to get away from your theories and thats all they are and perform my job which is to recover those children dead or alive and find out who abducted them jed was clearly out of patience in one breath you tell me shes too sick to be questioned and in the next one that she knows more than she ever let on look jonathan you said yourself that writing a book about questionable verdicts is a hobby for you but those lives arent hobbies with me and im not here to help you play chess with the law hold on lendon put a restraining hand on the chiefs arm mr knowles jonathan you believe that whatever knowledge nancy has of the death of her first family may help us find the eldredge children exactly but the problem is to extract that knowledge not drive it deeper into her subconscious dr miles you are considered an expert in the use of sodium atnytal in psychiatry are you not yes i am is it possible you might be able to have nancy reveal not only what she knows of this mornings events which i suspect will be nothing but also information about the past that she doesnt even know she has herself its possible then unless she can tell us something tangible about michael and missys whereabouts i beg you to try when dorothy was readmitted to the house an hour later the family room and kitchen were deserted except for bernie miles the policeman charged with answering the phones theyre all in there he said jerking his head towards the front parlour something pretty queer going on dorothy hurried down the hall but stopped at the doorway of the room the greeting she was about to utter died on her lips as she took in the scene before her nancy was lying on the couch a pillow under a head a quilt tucked around her a stranger who looked like a doctor was sitting beside her speaking softly nancy s eyes were closed an anguishedlooking ray and grimfaced jonathan were side by side on the love seat jed coffin was sitting at a table behind the couch holding a microphone pointed towards nancy as dorothy realized what was happening she sank into a chair not bothering to take off her coat numbly she slipped her chilled fingers into the deep side pockets unconsciously gripping the scrap of damp fuzzy wool that she felt in the righthand pocket how do you feel nancy are you comfortable lendons voice was tranquil im afraid why the children the children nancy lets talk about this morning did you sleep well last night when you woke up did you feel rested nancy s voice was reflective i dreamed i dreamed a lot what did you dream about peter and lisa theyd be so grown up theyre dead seven years she began to sob then as jonathans iron grip held ray back she cried how could i have killed them they were my children how could i have killed them chapter fifteen before dorothy had met john kragopoulos at the office she had tried to camouflage her redrimmed eyes with a dusting of powder shed tried to convince herself that after all showing the hunt place would be an outlet an action that could be concentrated on for a little while and keep her mind from its endless squirreling for clues to the childrens whereabouts what clues normally she took prospective clients on a brief tour of the area before showing a property to let them see the beaches and lakes and marina the stately old homes that were scattered between cranberry highway and the bay the breathtaking views from maushop tower the old town landmarks but today with the sleet beating a sharp tattoo on the car roof and windows with the sky filled with black fields of clouds and with the cold sea air chilling the very marrow of the bones she headed directly for the lookout it was so hard to keep her mind on what she was doing she felt so distracted and shaken she who hadnt cried in years was having to bite her lips to keep tears back there was a crushing weight on her shoulders a weight of grief and fear that she could not hope to support alone as she drove the car along the treacherously slick road she stole an occasional glance at the swarthycomplexioned man beside her john kragopoulos was somewhere in his midforties he had the build of a weightlifter yet there was an innate courtliness in his bearing that complemented his slightly accented manner of speaking he told dorothy that he and his wife just sold their restaurant in new york and agreed their next venture would be in an area where they would want to settle permanently they were anxious to be where welltodo retired people could be found for winter business as well as the summerresort trade mentally reviewing these points dorothy said id never recommend investing in a restaurant over on the other side of the cape any more its just one mass of motels and pizza parlours now absolutely frightful zoning but this side of the cape is still lovely the lookout has unlimited possibilities as a restaurant and inn during the thirties it was renovated extensively and turned into a country club people didnt have money to join expensive country clubs at that time and so it never caught on eventually mr hunt bought the house and grounds nine acres in all including one thousand feet of waterfront property and one of the finest views on the cape the lookout was originally a captains house was it not dorothy realized that john kragopoulos had done some homework on the place a sure sign of real interest yes it was she agreed it was built by a whaling captain in the sixteennineties as a gift for his bride the most recent renovation forty years ago added two floors but the original roof was put back on including one of those charming little balconies near the peak of the chimney widows walks theyre called because so many of the captains wives used to watch in vain for their men to come back from a voyage the sea can be treacherous her passenger agreed by the way is there a dock with the property if i relocate up here i plan to buy a boat a very good one dorothy assured him oh dear she gasped as the car skidded dangerously when she turned on to the narrow winding road that led up to the lookout she managed to straighten the wheels and glanced anxiously at her passenger but he seemed unperturbed and remarked mildly that she was a brave lady to risk driving on such icy roads like a surgeons knife the words penetrated to the core of dorothys misery it was a frightful day it would be a miracle if the car didnt skid right off this narrow road whatever interest she had talked herself into about showing the house vanished if the weather were only decent the beaches and streets and woods would be filled with men and boys looking for missy and michael but in this weather only the heartiest would think of going out especially since many felt it was a useless search i dont mind driving she said thickly im just sorry mr eldredge isnt with us but im sure you understand i understand very well john kragopoulos said what an agonizing experience for the parents to have young children missing i am only sorry to take your time today as a friend and coworker you must be concerned determinedly dorothy did not let herself reply to the sympathy in the mans voice and manner let me tell you more about the house she said all the windows to the front look over the water the front door has an exquisite fanlight which was a feature on the finer houses of that period the large downstairs rooms have wonderful gableend fireplaces on a day like this many people would enjoy going to a restaurant where they can watch the storm while they enjoy a good drink and good food and a warm fire here we are they rounded the curve and the lookout was in full view to dorothy it seemed strangely bleak and dreary as it loomed against the shrouded embankment the weatherbeaten shingles were stark grey the sleet slapping against the windows and porches seemed to reveal mercilessly the peeling shutters and sagging outside steps she was surprised to see that mr parrish had left the garage doors open maybe he had been carrying groceries his last trip in and had forgotten to come out again to pull the door down but it was a break for them shed drive right into the roomy garage and park her car beside his station wagon and theyd be able to make a run for the house with some protection from the garage overhang ive got a key to the back door she told john kragopoulos after theyd got out of the car im so sorry i didnt think to bring rays golf umbrella i hope you dont get too wet dont worry about me he chided im pretty rugged dont i look it she smiled faintly and nodded all right lets make a dash for it they ran out of the garage and kept close to the wall as they covered the fifty feet to the kitchen door even so the sleet pelted their faces and the wind pulled at their coats to her annoyance dorothy found that the door was doublelocked mr parrish might have been more considerate she fumed she rummaged through her bag for the key to the top lock and found it she gave a quick yank at the bell to let mr parrish know they had arrived she could hear the ringing sound echoing upstairs as she pushed the door in her prospective buyer seemed unperturbed as he brushed sleet from his coat and dried his face with a handkerchief he was a lowkeyed person dorothy decided she had to will herself not to sound either nervous or overly talkative showing the place every fibre of her being made her want to rush this man through the house see this and this and this now let me go back to ray and nancy please maybe theres been some news of the children she did notice that he was carefully studying the kitchen deliberately she reached for her own handkerchief to dab at her face aware suddenly that she was wearing her new suede winter coat this morning shed decided to wear it because of this appointment she knew it was becoming and that the grey shade complemented her pepperandsaltcoloured hair the big deep pockets were what made her conscious that she wasnt wearing her old storm coat but the storm coat would certainly have been a better choice today and there was something else oh yes when she had put on the coat she had wondered if jonathan knowles would stop into the office this afternoon and maybe notice it maybe this would be the day when hed suggest they might have dinner together she had daydreamed like that only hours ago how could everything change so quickly so terribly mrs prentiss yes oh im sorry i guess im a bit distracted today to her ears she sounded falsely cheery as you can see the kitchen needs modernizing but it is very well laid out and roomy that fireplace is large enough to cook for a crowd but im sure youd settle for modern ovens unconsciously shed lifted her voice the wind was howling around the house with a harsh mournful sound from somewhere upstairs she heard a door slam and just for a second a wailing sound it was her nerves this house upset her today the kitchen was freezing too quickly she led the way into the front rooms she was anxious that mr kragopoulos have the important first impression of the water view the savagery of the day only enhanced the breathtaking panorama that met their eyes when they stood at the windows angry whitecaps churned lifted fell crashed on the rocks pulled back together they stared at the tumultuous beating of the water on the rocks at the base of the cliff below at high tide these rocks are completely covered she said but just down a little to the left past the jetty theres a beautiful big sandy beach that is part of the property and the dock is just past that she took him from room to room pointing out the magnificent wide oak floors the massive fireplaces the leadedpaned windows the way the overall layout lent itself to a fine restaurant they went up to the second floor and he examined the large rooms that could be rented to overnight guests during the renovation they changed the small bedrooms into baths and connected them with the large rooms dorothy explained as a result youve got really beautiful units that only need painting and papering the brass beds alone are worth a fortune really lots of the furniture is very good look at that highboy for example i used to have an interior decorators shop and a house like this is my idea of a dream to work on the possibilities are endless he was interested she could tell by the way he took time to open closet doors pound walls and turn on water taps the third floor has more bedrooms and then mr parrishs apartment is on the fourth floor she said that apartment was designed for the resident manager of the country club its quite spacious and has a wonderful view of the town as well as the water he was pacing off the room and did not answer feeling pushy and garrulous dorothy walked over to the window she should give him a chance to consider the house quietly and come up with any questions that might occur to him hurry hurry she thought she wanted to get out of here the insistent need to be back with ray and nancy to know what was happening was overwhelming suppose the children were out somewhere exposed to this weather maybe she should take the car and cruise up and down maybe they had just wandered away maybe if she tried to look in the woods if she called them she shook her head she was being so foolish when nancy had left missy at the office with her yesterday shed said please make her keep her mittens on when you go out her hands get so cold nancy had laughed as she handed dorothy the mittens saying as you can see they dont match and im not trying to set a style this kid is always losing mittens shed given her one red mitten with a smile face and a blueandgreenchecked one dorothy remembered the cheerful smile with which missy had held up her hands when theyd gone for their drive mommy said dont forget my mittens aunt dorothy she warned reproachfully later on when theyd picked up mike and stopped for icecream shed asked is it all right if i take my mittens off when i eat my cone blessed little baby dorothy dabbed at the tears that rushed to her eyes determinedly she composed herself and turned back to john kragopoulos who had just finished making notes on the size of the room you dont get high ceilings like these any more except in these wonderful old houses he exulted she couldnt tolerate being here like this any longer lets go upstairs now she said abruptly think youll like the view from the apartment she led the way back into the hall and to the front staircase oh did you notice that there are four heat zones in this house it saves a lot of fuel bills they walked up the two flights of stairs quickly the third floor is exactly like the second floor she explained as they passed it mr parrish has been renting the apartment on and off for six or seven years guess his rent is quite minimal but mr eldredge felt that the presence of a tenant discourages vandals here we are just down the hall she knocked at the door of the apartment there was no answer mr parrish she called mr parrish she began to open her handbag thats strange i cant imagine where hed go without his car but ive got a key here somewhere she started to rummage through her bag feeling unreasonable annoyance over the phone mr parrish had obviously been unhappy that she was bringing someone over if he had been going out he might have told her she hoped the apartment was tidy there werent that many people looking for a threehundredfiftythousanddollar investment they hadnt had even a nibble on the property in nearly a year dorothy did not realize that the handle was being turned from the inside but when the door was pulled open abruptly she looked up and gasped and stared into the searching eyes and perspiring face of the fourthfloor tenant courtney parrish what a dreadful day for you to have to come parrishs tone was courteous as he stepped aside to let them pass by holding the door back and getting out the way he reasoned he might be able to avoid shaking hands he could feel that his hands were drenched in perspiration his eyes darted from one to the other had they heard the little girl that one cry he was such a fool getting too eager after the phone call hed had to hurry so much picking up the childrens clothing in his excitement hed almost missed the little girls undershirt then the can of baby powder had spilled hed had to wipe that up hed taped the childrens hands and feet and mouths and hidden them in that secret room behind the fireplace downstairs that hed discovered months ago in wandering through the house he knew those hidden rooms were peculiar to many old cape houses the early settlers used to hide in them during indian attacks but then hed panicked suppose that fool of a realestate woman knew about that room and decided to show it it was reached by a spring in the builtin bookcase in the main room downstairs suppose she knew about it just suppose even as dorothys buick sedan pulled up and into the garage he had dashed from his watching point at the window and rushed down to get the children hed carried them up and thrown them into one of the deep closets in the bedroom better much better he could say that he used that closet for storage and couldnt find the key since he had put a new lock on that fool of a realestate woman couldnt possibly have a duplicate besides the other closet in the room was practically the same size she could show that one that was where he could make a mistake by getting complicated theyd dallied downstairs long enough for him to make one last inspection of the apartment he hadnt missed anything he was sure the tub was still full but hed decided to leave it he knew hed sounded too annoyed over the phone let dorothy think that that was the reason hed been just about to bathe that would justify annoyance he wanted so much to get back to the little girl that it was painful from deep in his loins he felt frantic desire right now there she was just a few feet from them all behind that door her little body halfnaked oh he couldnt wait be careful be careful he tried to pay attention to the voice of reason that kept cautioning him but it was so hard john kragopoulos that damn fellow was insisting on shaking his hand clumsily he tried to dry his palm on his trouser leg before grasping the outstretched hand that he could not ignore courtney parrish he said sullenly he could see the fleeting expression of distaste come over the other mans face when their hands touched probably a damned fag half the restaurants on this side of the cape were run by fags now they wanted this house too well fine after today he wouldnt need it suddenly he realized that if this house were sold no one would ever find it suspicious if as courtney parrish he didnt come back to the cape then he could lose weight and let his hair grow and totally change his appearance again because he would want to be here for nancy s trial after they found the childrens bodies and accused her why this wasnt a problem at all fate was playing into his hands this was meant to be he shuddered as a wave of exhilaration surged through his body why he could even ask about nancy it would be only neighbourly feeling suddenly confident he said courteously i am pleased to meet you mr kragopoulos and rue the weather in which you first observe this wonderful house miraculously the dampness was leaving his hands and armpits and groin the tension in the small foyer relaxed tangibly he realized that most of it was emanating from dorothy anyway why not hed seen her countless times in these past years in and out of the eldredge house pushing the children on the swing taking them in her car he had her number one of those dreary middleaged widows trying to be important to someone a parasite husband dead no children a miracle she didnt have a sick old mother most of them did that helped them to be martyrs to their friends so nice to mother why because they needed to be nice to someone they had to be important and if they had children they concentrated on them the way nancy s mother had i have been listening to the radio he said to dorothy and am so disturbed have the eldredge children been found yet no dorothy felt all her nerve endings tingling from inside she could hear that the radio was on she caught the word bulletin excuse me she cried and hurried into the livingroom and over to the radio swiftly she turned up the volume storm increasing gale winds from fifty to sixty miles an hour are predicted driving is hazardous the air and water search for the eldredge children has been suspended indefinitely special patrol cars will continue cruising in adams port and vicinity chief coffin of adams port urges that anyone who believes he or she may have any information report it at once he urges that any untoward incident be discussed with the police such as a strange vehicle that may have been seen in the neighbourhood of the eldredge home any unfamiliar person or persons in the area call this special number kl five three eight hundred your privacy will be respected the commentators voice continued despite the urgent appeal for clues to the missing children we have it on good authority that mrs nancy harmon eldredge will be taken to police headquarters for questioning she had to go to nancy and ray dorothy turned to john kragopoulos abruptly as you can see this is a charming apartment quite suitable for two people the view from both the front and back windows in this room is really spectacular you are an astronomer perhaps john kragopoulos spoke to courtney parrish not really why do you ask it is just that magnificent telescope belatedly parrish realized that the telescope was still positioned facing the eldredge house seeing that john kragopoulos was about to look through it he gave it an abrupt push so that it tilted upward tenjoy studying the stars he volunteered hastily john kragopoulos squinted as he looked through the lens magnificent equipment he cried simply magnificent carefully he manipulated the telescope until it was pointing in the same direction as it had been when he had first noticed it then sensing the other mans antagonism he straightened up and began to study the room this is a well laid out apartment he commented to dorothy i have been most comfortable here parrish volunteered inwardly he was fuming at himself once more he had suspiciously overreacted the moisture was pouring from his body again had he forgotten anything else was there any sign of the children around frantically his eyes darted around the room nothing dorothy said id like to show the bedroom and bath if its all right of course hed straightened the coverlet on the bed and shoved the can of baby powder into the nighttable drawer the bathroom is as large as most of todays second bedrooms dorothy told john kragopoulos then as she glanced around it she said oh im so sorry she stared down at the filled tub we did catch you at an inconvenient time you were just about to bathe i have no rigid schedule to follow despite the words he managed to leave the impression that she had indeed inconvenienced him john kragopoulos stepped back into the bedroom hastily he realized that this man obviously resented their coming leaving the tub like that was a clumsy way of making the point and that duck floating in the tub a childs toy he winced disgusted his hand touched the closed door the satiny quality of the wood intrigued him really this house was beautifully constructed john kragopoulos was a hardheaded businessman but he also believed in instinct his instinct told him that this house would be a good investment they wanted three hundred and fifty thousand for it hed offer two ninetyfive and come up to three twenty he was sure he could get it for that the decision finalized in his mind he began to take a proprietary interest in the apartment may i open this closet he asked the question was perfunctory he was already turning the handle im sorry i changed the lock on that closet and cant seem to find the key if youll look in this other closet theyre practically identical dorothy looked sharply at the new handle and lock both were runofthemill lowpriced hardwarestore items i do hope you kept the original handle she said all the doorknobs were specially cast solid brass yes i have it it needs fixing god would that woman insist on turning the handle suppose the new lock gave it wasnt a very tight fit into the old wood suppose it slid open dorothy relaxed her grip on the handle the slight flare of annoyance shed felt vanished as quickly as it had come what in the name of heaven difference did it make if all the brass handles all over the universe were changed who cared parrish had to clamp his lips together to keep from ordering that nosy woman and her prospective buyer out the children were just on the other side of the door had he tightened their gags enough would they hear the familiar voice and try to make some kind of sound he had to get rid of these people but dorothy wanted to go too she was aware of an indefinably familiar scent in the bedroom one that made her acutely aware of missy she turned to john kragopoulos perhaps we should start if youre ready he nodded im quite ready thank you he started to leave this time obviously avoiding shaking hands dorothy followed him thank you mr parrish she said hastily over her shoulder ill be in touch with you she led the way down the stairs to the main floor in silence they went through the kitchen and when she opened the back door she could see why the gale warnings were in effect the wind had heightened sharply in the brief time theyd been in the house oh god the children would die of exposure if they were outside all this time wed better make a dash for the garage she said john kragopoulos looking preoccupied nodded and took her arm together they ran not bothering to stay under the overhang with the increased wind velocity there was simply no protection from the sleet which was now finely blended with snow in the garage dorothy walked between the station wagon and her car and opened the door on the drivers side as she began to slide into her car she glanced down a bright red scrap of material on the garage floor caught her eye getting out of the car again she bent down picked it up then slumped back into the car seat holding the object against her cheek john kragopoulos sounding alarmed asked my dear mrs prentiss what is wrong its the mitten dorothy cried its missys mitten she was wearing it yesterday when i took her out for icecream she must have left it in the car i guess i kicked it out when i got out of the car before she was always losing her mittens she never had two on that matched we always joked about that and this morning they found the mate of this one on the swing dorothy began to sob a dry hacking sound that she tried to stifle by holding the mitten against her lips john kragopoulos said quietly there is little that i can say except to remind you that a merciful and loving god is aware of your pain and the agony of the parents he will not fail your need somehow i am confident of that now please wouldnt you like me to drive please dorothy said in a muffled voice she pushed the mitten deep into her pocket as she slid over she wouldnt want nancy or ray to see it it would be too heartbreaking oh missy missy shed taken it off when she started to eat the cone yesterday she could see her dropping it on the seat oh the poor little kids john kragopoulos was glad to be driving a great restlessness had come over him in the room with that hideous man there was something too slimy and soursmelling about him and that scent of baby powder in the bedroom and that incredible toy in the tub how could a grown man need such trappings upstairs parrish stood to one side and watched from the window until the car had disappeared around the bend in the lane then with trembling fingers he drew out the key from his pocket and unlocked the closet door the boy was conscious his sandy hair fell on his forehead and his large blue eyes were filled with terror as he stared mutely up his mouth was still securely taped and his hands and legs still firmly tied roughly he pushed the child aside and reached past him for the little girl he lifted out her limp body and laid her on the bed then shrieked in outrage and despair as he stared down at her closed eyes and pinched blue face chapter sixteen nancy s hands were clenching and unclenching pulling at the coverlet gently lendon covered her fingers with his own strong wellshaped hands anxiety and agitation were causing her to breathe in harsh laboured breaths nancy dont worry everyone here knows that you couldnt hurt your children thats what you meant isnt it yes yes people think i could hurt them how could i kill them they are me i died with them we all die a little death when we lose the people we love nancy think back with me before all the trouble started tell me what it was like when you were growing up in ohio growing up nancy s voiced trailed off into a whisper the rigidity of her body began to relax yes tell me about your father i never knew him jed coffin moved restlessly and the chair he was sitting on made a creaking sound against the wooden floor lendon shot him a warning glance i have reason for this he said quietly please bear with me daddy a lilt came into nancy s voice she laughed softly he was such fun mother and i used to drive to the airport to pick him up when he came in from a flight in all those years he never came back from a trip without something for mother and me we used to go all over the world on his vacations they always took me with them i remember one trip ray could not take his eyes off nancy he had never heard her speak in that tone of voice animated amused a ripple of laughter running through her words was this what he had been blindly trying to find in her was it more than being tired of living with the fear of discovery he hoped so jonathan knowles listened intently to nancy approving of the technique lendon miles was using to gain her confidence and relax her before asking about the details of the day the harmon children had vanished it was agonizing to hear the soft ticking of the grandfather clock a reminder that time was passing he realized that he was finding it impossible not to look at dorothy he knew he had been harsh when he spoke to her as she was getting into her car it was his disappointment that had reacted to her deliberate falsehood the fact that she had made a point of telling him personally about knowing nancy as a child why had she done that was it perhaps that he had indicated somehow that nancy looked familiar had it been simply an attempt to keep him from the truth because she couldnt trust him with the truth had he perhaps been displaying what emily used to call his your witness counsel manner in any event he felt that he owed dorothy an apology she didnt look well the strain was telling on her she still was wearing her heavy coat and her hands were jammed in her pockets he decided that he wanted to talk to her at the first opportunity she needed calming down she certainly thought the world of those children the lights in the room flickered then went off that figures jed coffin propped the microphone on the table and searched for matches quickly ray lighted the antique gas lamps on either side of the mantel they threw a yellow glow that melted and blended with the vivid red flames of the fireplace bathing the couch where nancy was lying in a rosy glow and throwing deep shadows on the corners of the dark room it seemed to ray that the steady tattooing of the sleet against the house and the moaning of the wind through the pines had intensified suppose the children were out somewhere in this weather last night hed awakened hearing missy cough but when he went into her room shed been settled again in deep sleep her cheek cupped in her palm as he bent over to pull up her covers shed murmured daddy and stirred but at the touch of his hand on her back shed settled down again and michael he and mike had gone for milk to wiggins market was it just yesterday morning theyd arrived just as that tenant at the lookout mr parrish was leaving the man had nodded pleasantly but when he got into the old ford wagon of his michaels face had wrinkled with distaste i dont like him hed said ray almost smiled at the memory mike was a rugged little guy but he had something of nancy s distaste for ugliness and no matter how you sliced it courtney parrish was a clumsy slowmoving unattractive man even the wiggjnses had commented on him after he left jack wiggins said drily that fellows about the slowestmoving human being i ever bumped into he meanders around shopping like hes got all the time in the world michael had looked reflective i never have enough time hed said im helping my dad refinish a desk for my room and every time i want to keep working on it i have to get ready for school youve got quite an assistant there ray jack wiggins had remarked ill give him a job any time he sounds like a worker mike had picked up the package im strong too hed said i can carry things i can carry my sister for a long time ray ground his hands into fists this was unreal impossible the children missing nancy sedated what was she saying her voice still had that eager lilt daddy used to call mother and me his girls her voice faltered what is it nancy dr miles asked your father called you his little girl did that upset you no no no he called us his girls it was different it was different not like that at all her voice rose sharply in protest lendons voice was soothing all right nancy dont worry about that lets talk about college did you want to go away to school yes i really did except i was worried about mother why did you worry about her i was afraid shed be lonely because of daddy and wed sold the house she was moving into an apartment so much had changed for her and shed started a new job but she liked working she said she wanted me to go she liked to say that today today today is the first day of the rest of your life lendon finished quietly yes priscilla had said that to him too the day she came into the office after shed put nancy on the plane for school she told him about still waving goodbye after the plane had taxied away towards the runway then her eyes had filled and shed smiled apologetically look how ridiculous i am shed said trying to laugh the proverbial mother hen i think youre doing fine lendon had told her its just that when you think how your life can change so incredibly ah of a sudden a whole part the most important part is ended but on the other hand i think when youve had something quite wonderful so very much happiness you cant look back and regret thats what i told nancy today i dont want her worrying about me i want her to have a wonderful time in school i said that we should both remember that motto today is the first day of the rest of our lives lendon remembered that a patient had come into the office at the time hed considered it a blessing hed been dangerously close to putting his arms around priscilla but it was all right nancy was saying her voice still hesitant and groping mothers letters were cheerful she loved her job she wrote a lot about dr miles i was glad did you enjoy school nancy lendon asked did you have many friends at first i liked the girls and i dated a lot how about your schoolwork did you like your subjects oh yes they all came pretty easily except bio her tone changed subtly became troubled that was harder i never liked science but the college required it so i took it and you met carl harmon yes he wanted to help me with bio he had me come to his office and hed go over the work with me he said i was dating too much and that i must stop or id be sick he was so concerned he even started giving me vitamins he must have been right because i was so tired so much and started to feel so depressed i missed mother but you knew you would be home over christmas yes and it didnt make sense all of a sudden it got so bad i didnt want to upset her so i didnt write about it but i think she knew she came out for a weekend because she was worried about me i know it and then she was killed because she came out to see me it was my fault my fault her voice rose in a shriek of pain then broke into a sob ray started out of his chair but jonathan pulled him back the oil lamp flickered on nancy s face it was contorted with pain mother she cried oh mother please dont be dead live oh mother please please live i need you mother dont be dead mother dorothy turned her head trying to bite back tears no wonder nancy had resented her remarks about being a surrogate grandmother to missy and michael why was she here no one was even conscious or caring of her presence shed be more useful if she went out and made coffee nancy might want some later too she should take off her coat she couldnt she felt too cold so alone she stared down for a moment at the hooked rug and watched as the pattern blurred before her eyes lifting her head she met the inscrutable gaze of jonathan knowles and knew that hed been watching her for some time carl helped you when your mother died he was good to you why was lendon miles dragging out this agony what point was there in making nancy relive this too dorothy started to her feet nancy s answer was quiet oh yes he was so good to me he took care of everything and you married him yes he said hed take care of me and i was so tired he was so good to me nancy you mustnt blame yourself for your mothers accident that wasnt your fault accident nancy s voice was speculative accident but it wasnt an accident it wasnt an accident of course it was lendons voice stayed calm but he could feel the tightness of his throat muscles i dont know i dont know all right well talk about it later tell us about carl he was good to me you keep saying that nancy how was he good to you he took care of me i was sick he had to do so much for me what did he do for you nancy i dont want to talk about that why nancy i dont i dont all right tell us about the children about peter and lisa they were so good they were well behaved you mean they were so good too good nancy you keep saying good carl was so good to you and the children were good you must have been very happy happy i was so tired why were you so tired carl said i was so sick he was so good to me nancy you must tell us how was carl good to you he made sure i was getting better he wanted me to get better he said i had to be a good little girl how did you feel sick nancy what hurt you so tired always so tired carl helped me helped you how i dont want to talk about that but you must nancy what did carl do im tired im tired now all right nancy i want you to rest for a few minutes then well talk some more just rest just rest lendon got up chief coffin immediately took his arm and jerked his head towards the kitchen as soon as they were out of the room chief coffin spoke abruptly this isnt leading us anywhere this could take hours and youre not going to find anything out the girl blames herself for her mothers accident because the mother had made the trip to see her its that simple now if you think you can find out anything else about the harmon murders get to it or else i question her at headquarters you cant force shes starting to talk theres a great deal that even her subconscious doesnt want to face the chief snapped and i dont want to face myself if theres any chance those kids are still alive and ive wasted precious time here all right ill get to questioning her about this morning but first please let me ask her about the day the harmon children disappeared if there is any link between the two she may reveal it chief coffin looked at his watch god its almost four already whatever visibility there was all day will be gone in half an hour where is a radio i want to hear the newscast theres one in the kitchen chief bernie mills the patrolman on guard in the house was an earnest darkhaired man in his early thirties hed been on the force twelve years and this was by far the most sensational case hed ever known nancy harmon nancy eldredge was nancy harmon ray eldredges wife it showed you never knew what was going on inside people bernie had played on the same ball team summers with ray eldredge when they were little kids then ray had gone to one of those fancy prep schools and dartmouth college he had never expected ray would settle on the cape when he finished service but he did when he married the girl whod rented this house everybody said that she was some looker a few people commented that she kind of reminded you of someone bernie remembered his own reaction to that talk lots of people look like someone else his own uncle a deadbeat and drunk who made his aunts life miserable was a dead ringer for barry goldwater he glanced quickly out of the window the television news guys were all still out here with their truck and all their gear looking for a story he wondered what theyd think if they knew nancy eldredge was injected with truth serum right now now there was a story he was anxious to get home to tell jean about it he wondered how she was doing the baby had been teething last night kept both of them up for a single terrible minute bernie wondered how it would feel if the little guy was missing on a day like this out there somewhere and he not knowing the prospect was so awful so breathtaking so mindshattering that he rejected it jean never took her eyes off bobby sometimes she bugged bernie the way she was always fussing over the kid right now her need to never take her eyes off their baby reassured him assuaged his apprehensions the little guy was fine trust jean dorothy was in the kitchen filling the coffeepot bernie reflected that dorothy bugged him a little she had such a well guess youd call it reserved way she could be nice and friendly but well bernie didnt know he decided that dorothy was just a little too highfalutin for his thinking he turned on the transistor radio and instantly the voice of dan phillips the newscaster for wcod in hyannis filled the room the case of the missing eldredge children has just taken a new twist phillips said and his voice was pulsing with somewhat unprofessional excitement a mechanic otto linden from the gulf station on route twentyeight in hyannis has just phoned us to say that he can positively state that this morning at nine am he filled the gas tank of rob legler the missing witness in the harmon murder case of seven years ago mr linden said that legler appeared nervous and volunteered the information that he was on his way to adams port to visit someone who probably wouldnt be glad to see him he was driving a latemodel red dodge dart jed coffin swore softly and im wasting my time here listening to this claptrap he started for the phone and picked it up just as it rang after the caller identified himself he said impatiently i heard it all right i want a roadblock on the bridges going to the mainland check with the fbi deserter file find out what they may know about the latest whereabouts of rob legler put out a bulletin about a red dodge he slammed the receiver back on to the hook and turned to lendon now ive got a simple direct question for you to ask mrs eldredge its whether or not rob legler got here this morning and what he said to her lendon stared you mean i mean that rob legler is the person who could dump nancy eldredge back into the middle of a murder trial the harmon case has never been closed now suppose hes been hiding out in canada for six years or so he needs money didnt it come out at the harmon trial that nancy had inherited a fair amount of money from her parents some hundred and fifty thousand dollars now suppose rob legler knows about that money and somehow finds out where nancy is the district attorneys staff in san francisco know where shes been now suppose legler decides hes sick of canada and wants to come back here and needs a stake how about going to nancy eldredge and promising to change his testimony if hes ever caught and theres a new trial thats the same as making her give him a blank cheque for the rest of her life he gets here he sees her the deal sours she doesnt go for it or he changes his mind she knows that at any moment he may be caught or turn himself in and shes back in san francisco on a murder charge and she cracks and murders her eldredge children lendons voice was scornful have you thought about the possibility that this student who nearly put nancy in the gas chamber was in the vicinity when both sets of children disappeared give me one more chance lendon pleaded just let me ask her about the day the harmon children disappeared i want her to describe the events of that day first you have thirty minutes no more dorothy began pouring coffee into cups that shed already placed on a tray quickly she cut up a coffee cake that nancy had baked the day before perhaps coffee will help everyone she said she carried the tray into the front room ray was sitting in the chair lendon had drawn next to the couch he was holding nancy s hands in his gently massaging them she was very still her breathing was even but as the others came into the room she stirred and moaned jonathan was standing by the mantel staring into the fire he had lighted his pipe and the warm smell of the good tobacco he used had begun to penetrate the room dorothy breathed it in deeply as she set the coffee tray on the round pine table by the fireplace a wave of pure nostalgia washed over her kenneth had smoked a pipe and that had been his brand of tobacco she and kenneth used to love stormy winter afternoons like this they would make a roaring fire and get out wine and cheese and books and sit contentedly together regret swept over her regret because you really cant control your life most of the time you dont act you react will you have coffee and cake she asked jonathan he looked at her thoughtfully please she knew he took cream and one sugar without asking she prepared the coffee that way and handed it to him shouldnt you take your coat off he asked her in a little while im still so chilled dr miles and chief coffin had followed her in and were helping themselves to the coffee dorothy poured another cup and carried it over to the couch ray please have some he looked up thank you as he reached for it he murmured to nancy everything is going to be all right little girl nancy shuddered violently her eyes flew open and she threw up her arm knocking the cup from rays hand it fell and broke on the floor spewing hot liquid over her robe and the blanket splashes of it spattered on ray and dorothy simultaneously they winced as nancy cried out in the desperate tone of a trapped animal i am not your little girl dont call me your little girl chapter seventeen courtney parrish turned from the small unmoving figure on the bed sighing heavily hed taken the adhesive from missys mouth and the cords from her wrists and ankles and they made an untidy pile on the quilt her fine silky hair was matted now hed been planning to brush it when he bathed her but now there was no point he needed her response the little boy michael was still on the floor of the closet his large blue eyes were terrified as courtney picked him up and hugged him against his massive chest he laid michael on the bed undid the binding on his ankles and wrists and with a quick pull yanked the adhesive off his mouth the boy cried out in pain then bit his lip he seemed more responsive infinitely wary apprehensive but with some of the courage of a trapped animal what did you do to my sister the belligerent tone made courtney realize that the boy hadnt drunk all the milk with the sedative hed given him just before the meddling fools came along shes asleep let us go home we want to go home i dont like you i told my daddy i didnt like you and aunt dorothy was here and you hid us courtney lifted his right hand curved in to a mittlike shape and slapped michael across the cheek michael jerked back in pain and then rolled out from under the mans grasp courtney reached for him lost his balance and fell clumsily across the bed his mouth touched missys tangled yellow hair and for an instant he was distracted pulling himself up he turned and was on his feet crouching to spring at michael but michael was backing away towards the bedroom door with a swift movement he opened it and raced through the adjoining sittingroom courtney lunged after him realizing that he hadnt locked the apartment door he hadnt wanted dorothy to hear the distinct ping of the lock as she went downstairs michael threw open the door and raced for the staircase his shoes clattered on the uncarpeted stairs he moved swiftly a slim shadow that darted down into the protecting gloom of the third floor courtney hurried after him but in his frantic rush lost his balance and fell he hurtled down six steps before he managed to stop the fall by grasping the heavy wooden banister shaking his head to clear it he picked himself up aware of a sharp pain in his right ankle he had to make sure the kitchen door was locked there was no further sound of footsteps the boy was probably hiding in one of the thirdfloor bedrooms but he had plenty of time to look for him first the kitchen door the windows were no problem there were all doublelocked and too heavy anyhow the double lock on the front door was too high for the child hed just secure the kitchen door then search for the boy room by room hed call to him and warn him the boy was so frightened his eyes had been so terrified and wary he looked more than ever like nancy this way oh this was so unexpectedly wonderful but he had to hurry he had to make sure the boy couldnt get out of the house ill be right back michael he called ill find you ill find you michael youre a very bad boy you must be punished michael do you hear me michael he thought he heard a noise in the bedroom on his right and rushed in favouring his ankle but the room was empty suppose the boy had run through this hallway and used the front stairs suddenly panicking he lumbered down the remaining two flights from outside he could hear the waves from the bay crashing against the rocks he raced into the kitchen and over to the door this was the door he always used going into and out of the house this one had not only a double lock but a high bolt his breath came in quick furious gasps with thick trembling fingers he shoved the bolt into place then he pulled over a heavy wooden kitchen chair and wedged it under the knob the boy would never be able to move this there was no other way out of the house the heavy storm had almost obliterated the remaining daylight courtney switched on the overhead light but an instant later it flickered and went off he realized that the storm had probably pulled down some wires it would make it harder to find the boy all the upstairs bedrooms were fully furnished they all had closets too deep ones and cupboards that he might hide incourtney bit his lip in fury as he reached for the hurricane lamp on the table and lighted the wick the glass was red and the light cast an eerie reddish glow against the fireplace wall and faded planked floor and thickbeamed ceiling the wind wailed against the shutters as courtney called michael its all right michael im not angry any more come out michael ill take you home to your mother chapter eighteen the chance to blackmail nancy harmon was the break rob legler had been needing for over six years from the day hed got on a plane to canada after carefully shredding his embarkation orders for vietnam during those years hed worked as a farmhand near halifax it was the only job hed been able to get and he loathed it not for a minute did he regret his decision to bolt the army who in the hell wanted to go to a filthy hot hole to be shot at by a bunch of pintsized bastards he didnt hed worked on the farm in canada because he didnt have any alternative hed left san francisco with sixty bucks in his pocket if he went back home hed be tossed in jail a conviction for desertion wasnt his idea of the way to spend the rest of his life he needed a good stake to cut out for some place like argentina he wasnt just one of the thousands of deserters who eventually might be able to slip back into the states with faked identification thanks to that blasted harmon case he was a hunted man if only that conviction hadnt been upset that case would be finished but that bastard of a da had said if he spent twenty years hed retry nancy harmon for the murder of those kids and rob was the witness the witness who supplied the motive rob couldnt let that scene happen again as it was the da last time had told the jury that there was probably more to the killing than nancy harmon wanting to get out of a home situation she was probably in love hed said we have here a very attractive young woman who since the age of eighteen has been married to an older man her life might well be the envy of many a young woman professor harmons devotion to his young wife and family was an example for the community but is nancy harmon satisfied no when a studentrepairman comes in sent by her husband so that she will not have to endure even a few hours discomfort what does she do she follows him around insists he have coffee says its nice to talk to someone young says she has to get away responds passionately to his overtures and then when he tells her that raising kids isnt his bag she calmly promises him that her children are going to be smothered now ladies and gentlemen of the jury i despise rob legler i believe that he toyed with this foolish young woman i dont for a minute believe that their unholy passion ended with a few kisses but i do believe him when he quotes the damning phrases that fell from nancy harmons lips frig him rob felt sick fear in the pit of his stomach whenever he remembered that speech that bastard would have given anything to have made him an accessory to murder all because hed been in old harmons office the day his wife phoned to tell him the heater had gone off rob wasnt usually given to volunteering his services but hed never seen a machine or engine or piece of equipment he couldnt fix and hed heard some guys talk about what a doll that creepy old drag had for a wife that piece of intriguing information had made him volunteer his services at first harmon had turned him down but then when he couldnt get his regular maintenance man hed said okay he said he didnt want his wife taking the kids to a motel that was what shed suggested so rob had gone over everything the guys had said about nancy harmon was true she was a real looker but she sure didnt seem to know it she was kind of hesitant unsure of herself hed got over about noon she was just feeding the two little kids a boy and a girl quiet kids both of them she didnt pay much attention to him just thanked him for coming and turned back to the kids he realized that the only way to get her attention was through the kids and started talking to them it was always easy for rob to turn on the charm he liked gals older than himself too not that this one was older by much but hed learned from the time he was sixteen and screwing his nextdoor neighbours wife that if youre nice to a womans kids she thinks youre aokay and all the guilt goes down the drain boy rob could write a book on the whole mothercomplex rationalization in a couple of minutes hed had the kids laughing and nancy laughing and then hed invited the little boy down to be his helper fixing the furnace just as he expected the little girl asked to go too and then nancy said shed come along to make sure they didnt get in the way there wasnt much wrong with the furnace just a clogged filter but he said it needed a part and he could get it working but hed be back and do the job right he got out fast the first day no point in getting old harmon upset went straight back to his office harmon looked annoyed and worried when he opened the door but when he saw rob he gave a big relieved smile so soon you must be a whiz or couldnt you take care of it rob said i got it going but you need a new part sir that ill be glad to pick up its one of those little things that if you call in a regular service theyll make a big production over i can get the part for a couple of bucks be glad to do it harmon fell for it of course probably glad to save the money and rob went back the next day and the next day harmon warned him that his wife was very nervous and rested a lot and to please keep out of her way but rob didnt see where she acted nervous timid maybe and scared he got her talking she told him that shed had a nervous breakdown after her mother died i guess ive been terribly depressed she said but im sure im getting better ive even stopped taking most of my medicine my husband doesnt realize that hed probably be annoyed but i feel better without it rob had told her how pretty she was kind of feeling his way hed begun to suspect that she might be a pushover it was obvious she was pretty bored with old harmon and getting restless he said maybe she should get out more shed said my husband doesnt believe in company he feels that at the end of the day he doesnt need to see any more people not after all the students he has to contend with that was when hed known hed try to make a pass at her rob had an airtight alibi for that morning the harmon kids had disappeared hed been in a class of only six students but the da had told him that if he could find one shred of evidence that would help him hang an accessory charge on rob it would be his pleasure to do it rob had hired a lawyer plenty scared he didnt want the da poking into his background and finding out about the time hed been named in a paternity suit in cooperstown the lawyer had told him that his posture had to be that he was the respectful student of a distinguished professor had been anxious to do a favour for him had tried to stay away from the wife but she had kept following him around that he never took it seriously when she talked about the children being smothered actually hed thought she was just nervous and sick the way the professor had warned him but on the stand it didnt work like that were you attracted to this young woman the da asked smoothly rob looked at nancy sitting at the defendants table next to her lawyer looking at him through blank unseeing eyes i didnt think in those terms sir he replied to me mrs harmon was the wife of a teacher i admired greatly i simply wanted to fix the furnace as id volunteered to do and get back to my room i had a paper to write and anyhow a sick woman with two children simply isnt my bag it was that elaboration that last damned phrase that the da had pounced on by the time he was finished with him rob was wringing with perspiration yes hed heard the professors wife was a doll no he wasnt given to volunteering his help yes hed been curious to get a look at her yes he had made a pass at her but it stopped there rob had shouted from the stand with two thousand coeds on campus i didnt need problems then hed admitted that he had told nancy that she turned him on and hed like to hustle her the da had looked at him contemptuously then read into the record the time rob had been beaten up by an irate husband the episode in cooperstown when hed been named in the paternity suit the da said this philanderer was no willing volunteer he went into that house to size up a beautiful young woman whom hed heard about he made a play for her it succeeded beyond his wildest dreams ladies and gentlemen of the jury i am not suggesting that rob legler was part of the scheme to murder nancy harmons children at least in the legal sense he wasnt but i am convinced that morally before god he is guilty he let this gullible ungrateful young woman know that hed and i use his words hustle her if she were free and she chose a freedom that is repugnant to the basic instincts of mankind she murdered her children to be free of them after nancy harmon was sentenced to die in the gas chamber professor harmon had committed suicide he drove his car to the same beach where one of the kids had been found and left it by the shore he pinned a note to the wheel saying that it was all his fault he should have realized how sick his wife was he should have taken his children from her he was responsible for their deaths and her action i tried to play god he wrote i loved her so dearly that i thought i could cure her i thought bearing children would turn her mind from the grief of her mothers death i thought love and care would heal her but i was wrong i meddled beyond my depth forgive me nancy there hadnt been any roar of approval when the conviction was overturned it happened because two women jurors had been heard discussing the case in a bar midway through the trial and saying she was guilty as sin but by the time a new trial was ordered rob had graduated been drafted given vietnam orders and bolted without him the da had no case and had to let nancy go but swore hed retry her the day he could get hold of rob again over the years in canada rob had thought of that trial often there was something that bothered him about the whole setup taking himself out of it he didnt buy nancy harmon as a murderess shed been like a clay pigeon in court harmon certainly hadnt helped her breaking down on the stand when he was supposed to be in the midst of saying what a great mother she was in canada rob was something of a celebrity among the draft evaders he hung out with whom hed told about the case theyd asked about nancy and rob told them what a dish she was hinting that hed had a little action he showed them the press cuttings of the trial and nancy s pictures he told them that she had to have some dough that it came out at the trial that her folks left her over a hundred and fifty grand that if he could find her hed put the arm on her for money to split to argentina then he got his break one of his buddies jim ellis who knew about his connection with the harmon case slipped home to visit his mother who had terminal cancer the mother lived in boston but because the fbi was watching the house hoping to pick up jim she met him in cape cod in a cottage she had hired on maushop lane when jim got back to canada he was bursting with news he asked rob what it would be worth to him to know where he could find nancy harmon rob was sceptical until he saw the picture jimmy had managed to snap of nancy on the beach there was no mistaking her jim had done some digging too the background checked hed found out that her husband was pretty prosperous quickly they worked out a deal rob would get to see nancy tell her that if shed stake him to fifty thousand bucks hed split to argentina and shed never have to worry about him testifying against her rob reasoned that shed go for it especially now that she was remarried and had more kids it was a cheap price for her to know that some day she wouldnt be haulassed back to california to stand trial jim wanted a flat twenty per cent for his share while rob was seeing nancy jim would arrange for phony canadian passports identification and reservations to argentina they were available for a price they laid their plans carefully rob managed to rent a car from an american kid who was in school in canada he shaved his beard and cut his hair for the trip jim warned him that the minute you looked like a hippie every damn cop in those crabby new england towns was ready to clock you with radar rob decided to drive straight through from halifax the less time he spent in the states the less chance of getting picked up he timed his arrival at the cape for early in the morning jim had found out that nancy s husband always opened his office about ninethirty hed get to her house around ten jim had made a map of her street for him including the driveway through the woods he could hide the car there he was running low on gas when he hit the cape that was why he got off at hyannis to refuel jim had told him that even out of season there were a lot of tourists there hed be less likely to be noticed all the way down hed been nervous trying to decide if he should offer his deal to nancy and her husband together likely hed have to know about her getting a bundle of cash but suppose this guy called the cops rob would be convicted of desertion and blackmail no it was better to talk directly to nancy she must still remember sitting at that defendants table the attendant at the gas station was helpful checked everything over cleaned the windows put air in the tyres without being asked that was why rob was off guard when he was settling the bill the attendant asked if he was down for some fishing that was when he babbled that he was actually doing some hunting going to adams port to see an old girlfriend who might not be glad to see him then cursing his talkiness he bolted stopping at a nearby diner for some breakfast he drove into adams port at quarter to ten slowly cruising around studying the map jim had drawn for him he got a feel of the layout even so he almost missed the dirt road leading to the woods behind her property he realized that after he slowed up for that old ford wagon pulling out from it backing up he turned into the dirt road parked the car and started walking to the rear door of nancy s house that was when shed come running out like a madwoman shrieking those names peter lisa those were the dead kids he followed her through the woods to the lake and watched when she threw herself into the water he was just about to go after her when she dragged herself out and fell on the beach he knew she looked in his direction he wasnt sure if she saw him but he did know that he had to get out of there he didnt know what was happening but he didnt want to get involved back in the car hed cooled off maybe shed turned into a drunk if she was still screaming for the dead kids chances were that shed jump at the chance to know she didnt have to worry about a new trial he decided to check into some motel in adams port and try to see her again the next day in the motel rob promptly went to bed and fell asleep he awakened late in the afternoon and switched on the television set to catch the news the screen focused in time for him to see a picture of himself and a voice describing him as the missing witness in the harmon murder case numbly rob listened as the announcer recapped the disappearance of the eldredge children for the first time in his life he felt trapped now that hed shaved off his beard and shortened his hair he looked exactly the way he had in the picture if nancy eldredge had actually killed her new family who would believe that he hadnt had something to do with it it must have happened just before he got there rob thought of the old ford wagon that had backed out from the dirt road just before he turned in massachusetts licence first two numbers heavyset guy behind the wheel but he couldnt talk about that even if he got caught couldnt admit being at the eldredge house this morning who would believe him if he told the truth rob leglers instinct for selfpreservation told him to get off cape cod and it was a cinch he couldnt go in a bright red dodge that every cop was looking for he packed his bag and slipped out the back door of the motel a volks beetle was parked in the stall next to the dodge through the window hed noticed the couple who had left it theyd checked in just before he turned on the news chances were if he was any judge they were good for a couple of hours no one else was outside braving the sleet and wind rob opened the engine lid of the volks connected a few wires and drove away hed use route a heading for the bridge with any luck in half an hour hed be off the cape six minutes later he ran a red light thirty seconds after that he glanced in the rearview mirror and saw a flashing red light reflected there he was being chased by a police car for an instant he considered surrendering himself then the overwhelming need to bolt from trouble overcame him as he rounded a corner rob slipped open the door wedged the accelerator down with his suitcase and jumped out he was disappearing into the wooded area behind stately colonial homes when the police car its siren now screaming chased the wildly careening volkswagen down the sloping road chapter nineteen when michael began to run down the stairs he was sure that mr parrish would catch him but then he heard the terrible thumping that meant mr parrish had fallen down the stairs michael knew that if he wanted to get away from mr parrish he mustnt make any noise he remembered the time mommy had had the carpet on the stairs at home taken off now until the new treads go down you kids have to play a new game shed said its called civilized walking michael and missy had made a game of walking down the side of the stairs near the banister on tiptoe they got so good at it they used to sneak down and scare each other now walking lightly that same way michael slipped noiselessly down to the first floor he heard mr parrish calling his name saying he would find him he knew he had to get out of this house he had to run down the winding road to the long road that led to wiggins market michael hadnt decided whether hed go into wiggins market or run past it across route a up the road that led to his house he had to get daddy and bring him back here for missy yesterday in wiggins market he had told daddy he didnt like mr parrish now he was afraid of him michael felt the choking fear as he ran through the dark house mr parrish was a bad man that was why he had tied them up and hidden them in the closet that was why missy was so scared she couldnt wake up michael had tried to touch missy in the closet he knew she was scared but he couldnt get his hands free from inside the closet he could hear aunt dorothys voice but she hadnt asked for them she was right there and didnt guess that they were there he was very angry that aunt dorothy didnt know they needed her she should have guessed it was getting so dark it was hard to see at the bottom of the stairs michael looked around confused then darted towards the back of the house he was in the kitchen the outside door was over there he rushed to it and reached for the knob he was just about to turn the lock when he heard the footsteps approaching mr parrish his knees trembled if the door stuck mr parrish would grab him quickly noiselessly michael raced out the other kitchen door across the small foyer and into the little back parlour he heard mr parrish bolt the kitchen door he heard him drag the chair over to it the light in the kitchen was snapped on and michael shrank behind the heavy overstuffed couch crouching quietly he barely fitted into the space between the couch and the wall dust from the couch tickled his nose he wanted to sneeze the light in the kitchen and hallway went out suddenly and the house was black dark he heard mr parrish walking around striking a match a moment later there was a reddish glow in the kitchen and he heard mr parrish call its all right michael im not angry any more come out michael ill take you home to your mother chapter twenty john kragopoulos had intended to drive directly to new york after leaving dorothy but the vague sense of depression coupled with a headache over the bridge of his nose made the fivehour trip seem suddenly insurmountable it was the frightful weather of course and the intense distress dorothy was suffering couldnt help transmitting itself she had shown him the picture she carried in her wallet and the thought of those beautiful childrens having met with foul play left a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach but what an incredible thought he mused there was still the possibility the children had simply wandered away how could anyone hurt a child john thought of his two twentyeightyearold twin sons one an air force pilot the other an architect fine young men both of them a source of pride for a father long after he and their mother were gone they would live they were part of his immortality suppose when they were babies he had lost them he was driving down route a towards the mainland ahead on the right an attractive restaurant was set back from the road the lighted sign the stageway was a welcoming beacon in the afternoon gloom instinctively john swung off the road and into the parking lot he realized that it was nearly three oclock and he had had exactly one cup of coffee and one piece of toast all day the bad weather had made the driving up from new york so slow he had been forced to skip lunch he rationalized that it was common sense to have a decent meal before he attempted the trip and it was good business sense to try to strike up a conversation with the personnel of a large restaurant in a vicinity he was considering he might be able to garner some useful information on the probable trade in the area subconsciously approving of the rustic interior of the restaurant he went directly to the bar there were no customers at it but that wasnt unusual before five oclock in a town like this he ordered a chivas regal on the rocks then when the bartender brought it he asked if it would be possible to get something to eat no problem the bartender was about forty darkhaired with exaggerated muttonchops john liked both his obliging answer and the way he kept the bar immaculately neat a menu was produced if you feel like steak the special sirloin is great he volunteered technically the kitchen is closed between twothirty and five but if you dont mind eating right here sounds perfect quickly john ordered the steak rare and a green salad the chivas warmed his body and some of his depression began to lift you make a good drink he said the bartender smiled it takes real talent to put together a scotch on the rocks he said im in the business you know what i mean john decided to be candid im thinking of buying the place they call the lookout for a restaurant whats your topofthehead opinion the other man nodded emphatically could work a real class restaurant i mean here we do fine but we get the middlebuck crowd families with kids old ladies on pensions tourists heading for the beach or antique shops were right on the main drag but a place like the lookout overlooking the bay good atmosphere good booze a good menu you could charge top dollar and keep it packed thats my feeling of course if i was you id get rid of that old creep on the top floor i was wondering about him he seems to be somewhat odd well hes supposed to be up here every year around this time for the fishing i know because ray eldredge happened to mention it nice guy ray eldredge hes the one whose kids are missing i heard about that damn shame nice little kids ray and mrs eldredge bring them in here once in a while some looker rays wife but like i was saying im not a native i quit bartending in new york ten years ago after the third time i was mugged going home late but i always been crazy for fishing thats how i ended here and one day just a few weeks ago this big guy comes in and orders a drink i know who he is i seen him around hes the tenant at the lookout well i try to make anybody relax get his beefs of his chest so just to make conversation i ask him if he was here in september when the blues were running you know what that stupe said john waited nothing blank zero he didnt have a clue the bartender stood with his hands on his hips do you believe anyone can come fishing to the cape seven years and not know what i meant the steak arrived gratefully john began to eat it was delicious as the taste of the prime meat combined with the warm glow of the drink he relaxed perceptibly and began to think about the lookout what the bartender had told him had confirmed his decision to make an offer on the place he had enjoyed going through the house the sense of discomfort hed experienced had begun only on the top floor that was it he had been uneasy in the apartment of the tenant mr parrish john finished the steak thoughtfully and rather abstractedly paid his bill remembering to tip the bartender generously turning up his collar he left the restaurant and headed for his car now he should turn right and keep towards the mainland but for minutes he sat irresolutely in the car what was the matter with him he was acting like a fool what crazy impulse was forcing him to return to the lookout courtney parrish had been nervous john had been too many years in the business of sizing people up not to know nervous tension when he saw it that man had been worried desperately anxious for them to leave why there had been a heavy sour sweaty smell on him the smell of fear but fear of what and that telescope parrish had rushed over to change the direction it was pointing in when john bent over it john remembered that when he put it back to approximately where it had been hed been able to see the police cars around the eldredge home such an incredibly powerful telescope if it was directed into the windows of homes in the town anyone looking into it could become a peeping tom a voyeur was it possible that courtney parrish had been looking through the telescope when the children disappeared from behind their home that he had seen something but if he had of course he would have called the police the car was cold john turned the ignition key and waited for the engine to warm up before switching on the heater he reached for a cigar and lighted it with the small gold dunhill lighter that had been his wifes anniversary present to him an extravagant deeply cherished gift he puffed at the cigar until the top began to glow he was a fool a suspicious fool what did one do phone the police and say that a man seemed nervous and they should look into it and if they did courtney parrish would probably say i was about to take my bath and disliked having such short notice of the house being shown perfectly reasonable people who lived alone tended to become precise in their habits alone that was the word that was what was nagging john he had been surprised not to see someone else in the apartment something had made him sure that courtney parrish was not alone it was the childs toy in the tub that was it that incredible rubber duck and the cloying scent of baby powder a suspicion so absurd that it would be impossible to vocalize took shape in john kragopouloss mind he knew what he had to do deliberately he took his gold lighter from his pocket and hid it in the glove compartment of his car he would drive back to the lookout unannounced when courtney parrish answered the door he would ask permission to look for his valuable lighter which he must have dropped somewhere in the house during his inspection it was a plausible request it would give him a chance to look around carefully and either allay what was probably a ridiculous suspicion or have something more than suspicion to discuss with the police having made up his mind john stepped on the accelerator and swung the car left on route a back towards the centre of adams port and the curving hilly road that led to the lookout visions of a faded peeling rubber duck bobbed in his head as he drove through the steadily pelting sleet chapter twentyone she didnt want to remember there was only pain in going back once when she was very little nancy had reached up and pulled the handle of a pot on the stove she could still remember how great torrents of bright red tomato soup had gushed over on her shed been in the hospital for weeks and still had faint scars on her chest carl had asked her about those scars stroked them poor little girl poor little girl he liked her to tell him about the incident over and

left them in back seat of car never saw them again never never nancy were there many cars in the lot no no one i knew in store so windy cold not many people how long were you in the store not long ten

must get it water so cold i cant reach it its not a mitten its cold cold what did you do children arent here get out get out of water so cold the beach i fell on the beach he was there in the woods watching me i saw him there watching me jed coffin stood up ray jumped forward convulsively lendon held up a warning hand who was there nancy he asked tell us who was there a man i know him it was it was rob legler rob legler was there he was hiding looking at me her voice rose fell her eyelids fluttered open then closed again slowly ray paled dorothy inhaled sharply so the two cases were linked the amytals about worn off shell be coming to soon lendon stood up grimacing against the cramped sensation in his knees and thighs doctor may i speak with you and jonathan outside jeds voice was noncommittal stay with her ray lendon cautioned shell probably wake up any minute in the diningroom jed faced lendon and jonathan doctor how long is this to go on jeds face was impenetrable i dont think we should attempt to question nancy any further what have we gotten from all this other than the fact that she was afraid of her husband that she obviously did not love him and that rob legler may have been at the lake this morning lendon stared good god didnt you hear what that girl was saying dont you know what you were listening to i only know that i havent heard one thing that will help me discharge my responsibility to find the eldredge children i heard nancy eldredge blaming herself for her mothers death which is natural in a case where a visit to a child in school results in a parents death her reactions to her first husband sound pretty hysterical shes trying to blame him for the fact that she wanted out of their marriage what impression did you get of carl harmon lendon asked quietly one of those possessive guys who marries a younger girl and wants the upper hand hell he isnt any different than half the men on the cape i can cite you examples of guys who wont let their wives handle a dime except for food money i know one who wont let his wife drive the family car another never lets his wife go out at night by herself this kind of thing is common all over the world maybe thats why that womens lib bunch have something to beef about chief do you know what pedophilia is lendon asked quietly jonathan nodded thats what ive been thinking he said lendon didnt give jed time to answer in laymens terms its a sexual deviation involving sexual activity of any type with a child who has not yet reached puberty how does that fit in here it doesnt not completely nancy was eighteen when she married but in appearance she could look quite childish chief is there any way you can run a check on carl harmons background jed coffin looked incredulous when he answered his voice was trembling with repressed fury he pointed to the sleet that was beating a steady sharp staccato against the window doctor he said do you see and hear that somewhere out there two kids are either wandering around freezing or theyre in the hands of god knows what kind of kook and maybe theyre dead but its my job to find them and find them now we have one distinct lead to all this that is that both nancy eldredge and a gasoline attendant have placed rob legler a pretty unsavoury character in the immediate vicinity thats the kind of information i can do something about his voice bit off the words scornfully and youre asking me to waste my time running a check on a dead man to prove some cockeyed theory the telephone rang bernie mills whod been standing unobtrusively in the room hurried to answer it now they were talking about running a check on nancy s first husband wait till he told this to jean he picked up the phone quickly it was the station house put the chief on sergeant poler at the desk spat the words lendon and jonathan watched while chief coffin listened then asked quick short questions how long ago where the men looked at each other silently lendon realized he was praying an inarticulate fervent prayer that the message was not bad news about the children jed slapped the receiver back into the cradle and turned to them rob legler checked into the adams port motel right here in town around tenthirty this morning a car we believe he stole has just been smashed up on route a but he got away hes probably heading for the mainland weve got an allout search for him and im going over to direct it ill leave officer mills here well get that legler bird and when we do i think well really have the answer to what happened to those kids after the door had closed behind the chief jonathan spoke to lendon what do you make of this so far he asked lendon waited a long minute before answering am too close to this he thought see priscilla at that phone calling me carl harmon left the table after her where did he go did he overhear what priscilla said to me nancy said her dress was smeared with grease hadnt she been saying in effect that she believed carls hand must have been smeared and when he put his hand on her shoulder her dress got dirty hadnt she been trying to say that she believed carl harmon might have done something to priscillas car lendon saw a violent pattern forming but what purpose would this knowledge serve with carl harmon in his grave jonathan said if your mind is running in the same direction as mine going back to the disappearance of the harmon children wont help us youre thinking of the father yes lendon said and since he is dead we turn to rob legler the man sent into the home by carl harmon and the one witness whose testimony convicted nancy how accurate is her statement about this morning under the amytal lendon shook his head i cant be sure its been known that even under sedation some patients can resist and suppress but i believe that she saw or believes she saw rob legler at maushop lake jonathan said and at tenthirty this morning he checked into a motel alone lendon nodded without speaking again the two men turned and looked out of the window in the direction of the lake chapter twentytwo the fiveoclock television news gave little coverage to the mideastern crisis spiralling inflation the automobile workers threatened strike or the dismal standing of the new england patriots most of the halfhour broadcast was devoted to the disappearance of the eldredge children and old film clips from the sensational harmon murder case the pictures that had appeared in the cape cod community news were reproduced special attention was focused on the one of rob legler leaving the san francisco courthouse with professor carl harmon after nancy harmons conviction for the wilful murder of her children the commentators voice was especially urgent when that picture was shown rob legler has been positively identified as being in the vicinity of the eldredge home this morning if you believe you have seen this man please call this special number at once kl five three eight hundred the lives of the eldredge children may be at stake if you believe you have any information which may lead to the person or persons responsible for the childrens disappearance we urge you to call this number kl five three eight hundred let me repeat it again kl five three eight hundred the wigginses had closed their store when the power failed and were home in time to catch the broadcast on their batteryoperated television set that fellow looks kind of familiar mrs wiggins said youd say that anyhow her husband snorted no not really theres something about him the way he bends forward certainly is nothing to look at jack wiggins stared at his wife i was just thinking hes the type that might turn a young girls head him oh you mean the young one im talking about the other fellow the professor jack looked at his wife condescendingly this is why i say women dont make good witnesses and never should be jurors nobodys talking about that professor harmon he committed suicide theyre talking about the legler fellow mrs wiggins bit her lip i see well guess youre right its just oh well her husband got up heavily whenll dinner be ready oh not long but its hard to worry about food when you think about little michael and missy god knows where you think you just want to help them i dont care what they say about nancy eldredge she never came in the store much but when she did i liked to watch her with the kids she had such a nice way with them never upset never cranky the way half these young mothers are it makes our little annoyances so unimportant you know what little annoyances do we have his tone was sharply suspicious well mrs wiggins bit her lip theyd had so much trouble with shoplifters this past summer jack got so upset even discussing it that was why all day it just hadnt seemed worthwhile to tell him that she was absolutely certain that mr parrish had stolen a large can of baby powder from the shelf this morning chapter twentythree the fiveoclock news was on in a modest home down the block from st francis xavier church in hyannis port the family of patrick keeney was about to start dinner all eyes were glued on the small portable set in the crowded juniorsize diningroom ellen keeney shook her head as the picture of michael and missy eldredge filled the screen involuntarily she glanced at her own children neil and jimmy deirdre and kit one two three four whenever she took them to the beach that was the way it was she never stopped counting heads god dont let anything happen to them ever please that was her prayer ellen was a daily communicant at st francis church and usually went to the same mass as mrs rose kennedy she remembered the days after the president and then bobby were killed when mrs kennedy would come into the church her face lined with grief but still serene and composed ellen never watched her during mass poor lady she had a right to some privacy somewhere often mrs kennedy would smile and nod and sometimes say good morning if they happened to walk out after mass at the same moment how does she stand it ellen wondered how can she stand it now she was thinking the same thing how can nancy eldredge stand it especially when you think that it happened to her before the commentator was talking about the article in the community news that the police were trying to track down the author his words barely registered on ellens mind as she decided that nancy was not responsible for the death of her children it simply wasnt possible no mother murdered her flesh and blood she saw pat looking at her and smiled at him faintly a communication that said we are blessed my dear we are blessed he got awful fat neil said startled ellen stared at her oldest child at seven neil worried her he was so daring so unpredictable he had pats darkblond hair and grey eyes he was small for his age and she knew that worried him a little but from time to time she reassured him daddys tall and your uncle johns tall and some day you will be too still neil did look younger than anyone else in his class who got fat dear she asked absently turning her back to gaze at the screen that man the one in front hes the one who gave me the dollar to ask for his mail at the post office last month remember i showed you the note he wrote when you wouldnt believe me ellen and pat stared at the screen they were looking at the picture of rob legler following professor carl harmon out of the courtroom neil youre mistaken that man has been dead for a long time neil looked aggrieved see you never believe me but when you kept asking me where i got that dollar and i told you you didnt believe me either hes a lot fatter and his hairs all gone but when he leaned out of the station wagon he had his head kind of pulled down on his neck like that man the anchorman was saying any piece of information no matter how irrelevant you may consider it pat scowled why do you look mad daddy fiveyearold deirdre asked anxiously his face cleared neil had said like that man i guess because sometimes i realize how hard it is to raise a bunch like you he answered running his hand through her short curly hair grateful that she was here within his touch turn off the television neil he ordered his son now children before we say grace we will pray that god sends the eldredge children safely home through the prayer that followed ellens mind was far away they had pleaded for any information no matter how irrelevant it seemed and neil had got that dollar tip to pick up a letter at general delivery she remembered the day exactly wednesday four weeks ago she remembered the date because there was a parents meeting at school that night and she was annoyed that neil was late for the early dinner suddenly she remembered something neil by any chance do you still have the note the man gave you to show the post office she asked didnt i see you put it in your bank with the dollar yes i saved it will you get it please she asked him i want to see the name on it pat was studying her when neil left he spoke over the heads of the other children dont tell me you put any stock she suddenly felt ridiculous oh eat up dear i guess i just have a case of nerves its people like me who are always wasting policemens time kit pass me your plate ill cut up the end piece of the meat loaf just the way you like it chapter twentyfour it was all going so badly nothing was working as hed expected that foolish woman coming here and then the little girl having to wait till she woke up if she woke up so that he could feel her twisting and pulling from him then the boy squirming away from him hiding hed have to find him courtney had a feeling of everything slipping away from him his sense of pleasure and expectation had changed to disappointment and resentment he wasnt perspiring any more but the heavy sweat still clung to his clothes and made them unpleasantly sticky against his body the thought of the boys big blue eyes so like nancy s didnt give him anticipatory pleasure the boy was a threat if he escaped it would be the end better to finish with them both better to do what hed done before in an instant he could remove the threat seal off air so that lips and nostrils and eyes were covered and then in a few hours when the tide was high toss their bodies into the churning surf no one would know then hed be here safe again with nothing to threaten him here to enjoy her torment and tomorrow night with all the threat gone hed drive to the mainland hed go around dusk and probably some little girl would be walking alone and hed tell her he was the new teacher it always worked his decision made he felt better now all he wanted was to be finished with this threat that child recalcitrant like nancy troublesome ungrateful wanting to escape he would find him hed tie him and then get the thin sheets of velvety plastic hed made sure to have a brand that nancy could have bought at lowerys then hed seal it on the boy first because the boy was so troublesome and then the little girl right away too it was too dangerous to even keep her the sense of danger always heightened his perception like last time he hadnt really known what he would do when he had slipped across the campus to the shopping centre hed only known that he couldnt let nancy take lisa to the doctor hed been there before she arrived parked on that little supply road between the shopping centre and the campus hed seen her drive in speak to the children go into the store no cars nearby not a soul around in a moment hed known what to do the children had been so obedient theyd looked startled and frightened when he opened the car door but when he said now quickly were going to play a game on mommy for her birthday theyd gotten into the trunk and in an instant it was over the plastic bags slipped over their heads twisted tight his hands holding them till they stopped squirming the trunk shut and he back in school less than eight minutes gone in all the students intent on their lab experiments no one had missed him a roomful of witnesses to testify to his presence if need be that night hed simply driven the car to the beach and dumped the bodies into the ocean opportunity seized danger averted that day seven years ago and now danger to be averted again michael come out michael ill take you home to your mother he was still in the kitchen holding the hurricane lamp up he looked around there was no place to hide here the cupboards were all high but finding the boy in this dark cavernous house with only this lamp to see by would be infinitely difficult it could take hours and where should he begin michael dont you want to go home to your mother he called again she didnt go to god shes all better she wants to see you should he try the third floor and look in those bedrooms first he wondered but the boy would probably have tried to get to this outside door he was smart he wouldnt have stayed upstairs would he have gone to the front door better to look there he started into the little hall then thought of the small back parlour if the boy had tried the kitchen and heard him coming that would be the logical place to hide he walked to the doorway of the room was that breathing he was hearing or only the wind sighing against the house he walked a few steps farther into the room holding the kerosene lamp high above his head his eyes darted picking objects out of the gloom he was about to turn around when he swung the lamp to his right staring at what he was seeing he let out a highpitched hysterical whinny the shadow of a small figure huddled behind the couch was silhouetted like a giant crouched rabbit across the faded oak floor i found you michael he cried still giggling and this time you wont get away chapter twentyfive the power failure began as john kragopoulos turned off route a on to the road that led to the lookout instinctively he pressed the button under his foot to turn on the bright headlights vision was still poor and he drove carefully feeling the slick road under the tyres and the tendency of the car to skid at the turns he wondered how he could possibly justify looking through that cavernous house for a small lighter mr parrish could reasonably suggest that he return in the morning or offer to search for it himself and give it to dorothy if it was found john decided he would go to the door with his flashlight hed say that he was quite sure he remembered hearing something drop when he was bending over the telescope he had meant to check to see if something had slipped out of his pocket that was reasonable it was the fourthfloor apartment that he wanted to see anyhow the hilly ascent to the lookout was treacherous at the last bend in the road the front end of the car swayed precariously john gripped the wheel as the tyres grabbed and held the road he had been within inches of veering on to the sloping embankment and would surely have hit the massive oak tree less than six feet away a few minutes later he turned the car into the back driveway of the lookout rejecting the alternative of pulling into the comparative shelter of the garage as dorothy had done he wanted to be casual open if anything his manner should be a bit irritated as though he were being inconvenienced too he would say that since he had discovered his loss at dinner and was still in town hed decided to come right back rather than phone as he got out of the car he was struck by the foreboding blackness of the big house even the top floor was completely dark surely the man had hurricane lamps power blackouts on the cape in bad storms couldnt be unusual suppose parrish had fallen asleep and didnt realize the electricity had failed suppose just suppose thered been a woman visiting him who had not wanted to be seen it was the first time the possibility had occurred to john suddenly feeling foolish he debated about getting back into the car the sleet stung his face the wind whipped it under the collar and sleeves of his coat and the warm satisfaction of the dinner was dispelled he realized he was chilled and tired and had a long difficult drive ahead of him he would look like a fool with his contrived story why hadnt he thought about the possibility that parrish had a visitor who would be embarrassed at being seen john decided he was a fool a suspicious idiot he and dorothy had probably interrupted a liaison and nothing more hed get away from here before he made a further nuisance of himself he was about to get behind the wheel when he saw a glimmer of light from the farleft kitchen window it moved swiftly and a few seconds later he could see it reflected in the windows to the right of the kitchen door someone was walking around the kitchen with a lamp carefully john closed the car door so that it made no slamming sound only a soft click gripping the flashlight he edged across the driveway to the kitchen window and peered in the light seemed to be coming from the hall now mentally he reviewed the layout of the house the back staircase was reached through that hall and so was the small parlour on the other side sheltering against the weathered shingles he moved quickly along the back of the house past the kitchen door to the windows that should be those of the small parlour the glow from the lamp was muted but as he watched it grew stronger he shrank back as the lamp became visible held high by an outstretched arm he could see courtney parrish now the man was searching for something for what he was calling to someone john strained to hear the wind smothered sound but he could make out the name michael parrish was calling michael john felt chilling fear race along his spinal column he had been right the man was a maniac and those children were somewhere in the house the lamp he was arching in circles was a spotlight that illuminated the solid thickness of parrishs bulk john felt totally inadequate aware that he was no physical match for this man he had only the flashlight as a weapon should he go for help was it possible michael had got away from parrish but if parrish found him even a few minutes might make a difference then before his horrified eyes john saw parrish swing the lamp over to the right and reach behind the couch to pull out a small figure who tried desperately to escape parrish put down the lamp and as john watched closed both hands around the childs throat acting as instinctively as he had when hed been on combat duty in world war ii john pulled his arm back and smashed the window with his flashlight as courtney parrish spun around john reached his hand in and forced the lock open with superhuman strength he pushed the window up and vaulted over the sill into the room he dropped the flashlight as his feet hit the floor and parrish grabbed for it still holding the hurricane lamp in his left hand parrish raised the flashlight in his right hand holding it over his head like a weapon there was no way to escape the inevitable blow but john ducked and weaved back against the wall for time shouting run away michael call help he managed to kick the kerosene lamp from parrishs hand an instant before the flashlight crashed down on his skull chapter twentysix it had been a mistake to ditch the car it had been an act of sheer stupid panic rob believed in making your own luck today he had made every blunder in the book when he saw nancy at the lake he should have got the hell off cape cod instead hed figured that she might be on a trip or stoned and all he had to do was lie low for a day and then go see her and her husband and get some money now hed made a point of placing himself in the vicinity and her kids were missing rob had never really believed that nancy had anything to do with the other kids disappearance but now who could know maybe she did go haywire just as harmon used to tell him when he left the car rob had headed south towards the main expressway that ran through the center of the cape but when a police car whipped past him hed doubled back even if he could hitch a ride the odds were theyd have a roadblock at the bridge it would be better to head towards the bay there had to be plenty of closedup summer cottages there hed break into one of them and hole up for a while most of them probably had some staples left in the kitchen and he was getting hungry then in a couple of days when the heat was off hed find a truck hide in the back and get off this damned island he shivered as he hurried down the narrow darkened roads one good thing in this shit weather there wasnt any danger of running into people out walking hardly any cars on the road either but when he rounded a bend in the road rob barely had time to jump back into thick hedges to escape being revealed by the headlights of an approaching car breathing harshly he waited till the automobile had screeched past him christ another cop car the place was swarming with them hed have to get off the road it couldnt be more than a couple of blocks to the beach now moving swiftly along the row of hedge rob headed towards the clump of woods that edged the back of the houses near him less chance of being spotted there even if it took longer to wind through back yards suppose nancy had seen him at the lake she did look in his direction but maybe not hed deny he was there of course she was in no state to be a witness about seeing him nobody else had he was sure of that except the driver of that station wagon probably a local guy massachusetts plates x how did he remember that the reverse oh sure hed noticed that if rob did get caught he could tell the cops about that station wagon hed seen it backing out of the dirt road leading from the eldredge property and that must have been just around the time the kids disappeared but on the other hand suppose the station wagon was a regular delivery car that they already knew about rob hadnt seen the driver at all hadnt paid attention really just noticed he was a big fat guy if he did get caught and told about the station wagon hed only nail himself as having been johnnyonthespot at the eldredge house no he wouldnt admit anything if they got him hed say he had been planning to visit nancy then he had seen his picture in that story about the harmon case and decided to get away the decision made rob felt better now if he could just get to the beach and into a cottage he hurried careful to stay well in the shadows of the stark trees stumbled swore softly and recovered his balance this sleet was making the whole damn place as slippery as a skating rink but he couldnt have much farther to go he had to get indoors somewhere or someone would be sure to spot him steadying himself against the icecrusted trees he tried to move faster chapter twentyseven thurston givens sat quietly in his glassedin back porch watching the storm in the near dark an octogenarian hed always found noreasters fascinating and knew that he wouldnt be likely to see them for too many more years the radio was on very low and hed just heard the latest bulletin about the eldredge children there was still no trace of them now thurston sat staring out towards the back wondering why young people had to know so much misery his only child had died at five from flu during the epidemic of a retired realtor thurston knew ray eldredge well hed been a friend of rays father and grandfather too ray was a fine fellow the kind of man the cape needed he was a gogetter and a good realtor not the kind out to turn a fast buck and the public be damned damn shame if anything happened to those little children of his nancy certainly didnt strike thurston as the type to get mixed up with murdering anyone there had to be a better answer than that he was drifting into a kind of reverie when some movement in the woods caught his attention he leaned forward and peered through narrowed eyes there was someone out there sliding along obviously trying to stay hidden nobody up to any good was in those woods in this kind of weather and thered been a lot of robberies on the cape and particularly in this area thurston reached for the phone he dialled police headquarters chief coffin was an old friend but of course the chief probably wasnt there he must be out on the eldredge case the phone was answered at the other end and a voice said adams port police headquarters sergeant poler thurston interrupted impatiently thurston givens here he said crisply i want you fellows to know theres a prowler in the woods behind my place and hes heading towards the bay chapter twentyeight nancy sat upright on the couch staring straight ahead ray had lighted the fire and the flames were beginning to lick at the thick twigs and broken pieces of branches yesterday it was just yesterday wasnt it she and michael had been raking the front lawn this is the last time well have this job this winter mike shed said i guess just about all the leaves are down now hed nodded soberly then without her telling him hed picked out the biggest chunks of branch and thick twigs from the pile of leaves these are good for fires he commented hed dropped the iron rake and it had fallen with the metal prongs facing upward but when missy came running from the driveway hed quickly turned over the rake with an apologetic halfsmile hed said daddy always says its dangerous to leave a rake like that he was so protective of missy he was so good he was so like ray nancy realized that in some incredible way there was comfort in knowing that mike was with missy if there was any way to do it hed take care of her he was such a resourceful little kid if they were outside somewhere now hed make sure that her jacket was zipped up hed try to cover her hed oh god she didnt know shed spoken aloud until ray looked up startled he was sitting in his big chair his face looked so strained he seemed to know that she didnt want him to touch her now that she needed to assimilate and evaluate she must not believe that the children were dead they could not be dead but they must be found before anything happened dorothy was watching her too dorothy who suddenly looked so much older and so lost she had taken dorothys affection and love without giving in return she had held dorothy at arms length made it clear that dorothy was not to intrude on their closed family circle she didnt want the children to have a grandmother substitute she didnt want anyone to replace mother i have been selfish nancy thought i have not seen her need how odd that it was so clear now how odd to even think about that now when they were sitting here so helpless so powerless then why was something reassuring her why was she feeling some tiny lick of hope what was the source of her comfort rob legler she said i told you that i saw rob legler at the lake this morning yes ray said is it possible i was dreaming does the doctor believe that i saw him that i was telling the truth ray considered then decided to be honest there was a strength in nancy a directness that wouldnt tolerate evasion i believe that the doctor feels that you gave an exact account of what happened and nancy you should know rob legler has definitely been seen near here both last night and this morning rob legler would not hurt the children nancy s voice was matteroffact flatly positive that was her area of comfort if he took them if he was responsible he wouldnt hurt them i know it lendon came back into the room jonathan close behind him jonathan realized that he inadvertently looked for dorothy first her hands were dug into her pockets he suspected they were gripping into fists she had always struck him as a remarkably efficient selfsufficient person traits that he admired without finding them necessarily endearing in a woman when jonathan was honest with himself he realized that an essential part of his relationship with emily had been his constant awareness of her need for him she never could unscrew the cap from a jar or find her car keys or balance her checking account he had basked in his role as the indulgent able constant fixer doer solver it had taken the past two years to make him begin to realize that hed never understood the steel shaft of strength at the core of emilys femininity the way shed accepted the doctors verdict with only a sympathetic glance at him the way shed never once admitted to pain now seeing dorothy with her mute anguish so tangible he ached somehow to comfort her he was diverted by a question from ray what was the phone call chief coffin went out jonathan said evasively its all right nancy knows that rob legler has been seen near here thats why the chief left legler was chased and left a car hed stolen two miles down on a but dont worry he wont get far on foot in this weather how do you feel nancy lendon studied her closely she was more composed than hed expected im all right i talked a lot about carl didnt i yes there was something i was trying to remember something important i wanted to tell you lendon kept his voice matteroffact several times you said i dont believe i dont believe do you know why you would say that nancy shook her head no she got up and walked restlessly to the window its so dark it would be hard to find anything or anybody now movement was desirable she wanted to try to clear her head to be able to think she looked down realizing for the first time that she was still wearing the fluffy woollen robe im going to change she said i want to get dressed do you dorothy bit her lip shed been about to ask if nancy wanted her to go upstairs with her ill be all right nancy said gently they were going to find rob legler she was sure of it when they did she wanted to be dressed she wanted to go to him wherever they took him she wanted to say rob i know you wouldnt hurt the children do you want money what do you need tell me where they are and well give you anything upstairs in the bedroom she took off her robe mechanically she walked over to the closet and hung it up for an instant she felt lightheaded and leaned her forehead against the coolness of the wall the bedroom door opened and she heard ray cry nancy his voice was startled as he hurried over to her turned her to him and put his arms around her she felt the scratchy warmth of his sports shirt against her skin and the growing intensity of his grasp im all right she said really nancy he tilted her head up his mouth closed over hers as her lips parted she arched her body against his it had been like this from the beginning from that first night when hed come to dinner and afterwards theyd walked down to the lake it had been chilly and shed shivered his coat was open and hed laughed and pulled her against him wrapping the coat around so that it covered her too when hed kissed her that first time it had been so inevitable shed wanted him so much right from the beginning not like carl poor carl shed only tolerated him felt guilty about not wanting him and after lisa was born he had never again not like a husband had he sensed her revulsion shed always wondered it was part of her guilt i love you she didnt know shed said it words said so often words she murmured to ray even in her sleep i love you too oh nancy it must have been so bad for you i thought i understood but i didnt ray will we get the children back her voice shook and she felt her whole body begin to tremble his arms tightened i dont know darling i dont know but remember this no matter what happens we have each other nothing can change that theyve just come by for the chief they have rob legler at the station house dr miles went with them and jonathan and i are going over too i want to go maybe hell tell me no jonathan has an idea and i think it could work weve got to find out maybe rob has an accomplice who has the children if he sees you he might refuse to say anything especially if he was involved last time ray nancy heard the despair in her voice darling hang on just a little while longer take a hot shower and get dressed dorothy will stay with you shes fixing a sandwich for you now ill be back as soon as i can for an instant he buried his lips in her hair then was gone mechanically nancy walked into the bathroom off the bedroom she turned on the water in the shower stall then looked into the mirror over the washbasin the face she saw looking back at her was pale and drawn the eyes heavy and clouded it was the way she had looked all those years with carl like the pictures of her in that article quickly she turned away and twisting her hair into a knot stepped into the shower the warm needle spray struck her body making a steady assault against the rigid tension of her muscles it felt good gratefully she lifted her face to the spray a shower felt so clean she never never took a tub bath any more not since the years with carl she didnt think about those baths any more a vivid shaft of recollection came as the water splashed against her face the tub carls insistence on bathing her the way he had touched and examined her once when shed tried to push him away hed slipped and his face had gone under the water hed been so startled that for a moment he couldnt pull up when he did hed begun sputtering and trembling and coughing hed been so angry but mostly so frightened it had terrified him to have his face covered by the water that was it that was what she had tried to remember that secret fear of water oh god nancy swayed against the side of the shower stall she felt nausea rack her stomach and throat stumbled out of the shower and began retching uncontrollably minutes passed she clung to the sides of the commode unable to stem the violent waves of illness then even when the vomiting finally stopped icy chills still shuddered through her body chapter twentynine ray dont count on too much jonathan warned ray ignored him through the streaked windowpane he could see the station house the glow from the gas lamps gave it the look of another century quickly parking the car ray threw open the door and darted across the macadam into the station from behind he could hear jonathan puffing as he tried to keep pace the desk sergeant looked surprised didnt expect to see you here tonight mr eldredge im sure sorry about the kids ray nodded impatiently where are they questioning rob legler the sergeant looked alarmed you cant have anything to do with that mr eldredge the hell i cant ray said evenly go in and tell the chief i have to see him now the sergeants protest died on his lips he turned to a policeman who was coming down the corridor tell the chief that ray eldredge wants to see him he snapped ray turned to jonathan with a trace of a wan smile he said suddenly this seems like a farfetched crazy idea it isnt jonathan replied quietly ray glanced around the room and realized for the first time that two people were sitting on a small bench near the door they were just about as old as he and nancy a nicelooking couple he wondered abstractedly what they were doing here the guy looked embarrassed the woman determined what would bring anyone out on a night like this was it possible they had had a fight and she was pressing charges the idea was wildly funny somewhere outside this room outside this whole incredible day people were home with their families cooking dinner by candlelight telling kids not to be scared of the dark making love having fights he realized that the woman was staring at him she started to get up but the husband pulled her down quickly ray turned his back to her the last thing in the world he wanted or needed was sympathy footsteps hurried down the corridor chief coffin rushed into the room what is it ray have you heard anything jonathan answered you have rob legler here yes were questioning him dr miles is with me leglers asking for a lawyer wont answer any questions i thought as much thats why were here in a low voice jonathan outlined his plan chief coffin shook his head wont work this guys a cool one theres no way youll get him to place himself at the eldredge house this morning well let us try cant you see how important time is if he had an accomplice who has the children now that person may panic god knows what he might do well come in here talk to him but dont count on anything with a jerk of his head the chief nodded to a room halfway down the corridor as ray and jonathan started to follow him the woman got up from the bench chief coffin her voice was hesitant could i speak to you for just a minute the chief looked her appraisingly is it important well probably not its just that i felt i wouldnt have any peace unless its something my little boy the chief visibly lost interest just sit down please maam ill be back with you as soon as i can ellen keeney sank down on the bench as she watched the three men leave the sergeant at the desk sensed her disappointment are you sure i cant help you maam he asked but ellen didnt trust the sergeant when she and pat had first come in they had tried to tell him that they thought their little boy might know something about the eldredge case the sergeant had looked pained lady do you know how many calls weve had today since the wire services got hold of this weve had nothing but calls some jerk from tucson phoned to say he thought he saw the kids in a playground across the street from his apartment this morning no way they could have gotten there even in a supersonic plane so just take a seat the chief talk to you when he can pat said ellen i think we should go home were only in the way here ellen shook her head she opened her pocketbook and took out the note the stranger had given neil when he had sent him in for the mail she had attached the note to her own scribblings about everything neil had told her she knew the exact time he had gone in for the letter she had carefully written down his description of the man his exact words when hed said the man looked like the picture on television of nancy harmons first husband the kind of car the man was driving a real old station wagon just like gramps that sounded like a ford last neil had said that the man had a fishing permit for adams port on his windshield ellen was determined to sit here until she got a chance to tell her story pat looked so tired reaching over she patted his hand bear with me dear she whispered i suppose it doesnt mean anything but something is making me wait the chief did say hed talk to me soon the door of the station house opened a middleaged couple came in the man looked thoroughly annoyed the woman was visibly nervous the desk sergeant greeted them hi mr wiggins miz wiggins anything wrong you wont believe it wiggins snapped on a night like this my wife wants to report that somebody pilfered a can of baby powder from the store this morning baby powder the sergeants voice ranged upward in astonishment mrs wiggins looked more upset i dont care how stupid it sounds i want to see chief coffin hell be coming out soon these people are waiting for him too just sit down wont you he pointed to the bench at a right angle to the one where the keeneys were waiting they came over and as they sat down the husband muttered angrily i still dont know why were here ellens ready sympathy made her turn to the couple she thought that maybe just talking to someone would help the other woman to get over her nervousness we dont know why were here either she said but isnt it an awful thing about those missing children fifty feet away in the office down the corridor rob legler stared through narrowed hostile eyes at ray eldredge the guy had class he decided nancy had certainly done a lot better this time that carl harmon had been some creep fear knotted robs stomach the eldredge kids hadnt been found if anything had happened to them they might try to pin something on him but nobody had seen him near the eldredge house nobody except that fat slob whod been in the old station wagon suppose that guy had been a deliveryman or something and called the cops suppose he could identify rob as being around the eldredge house this morning what excuse did he have for being there no one would believe that he had sneaked into the country just to say hello to nancy mentally rob darted around for a story there was none that made sense hed just keep his mouth shut until he got a lawyer and maybe after that too the older guy was talking to him you are in a very serious situation jonathan was saying you are a deserter who has been taken into custody shall i remind you of the penalty the law holds for deserters your situation is far more serious than that of a man who left the country to avoid conscription you are a member of the armed forces no matter what has happened to the eldredge children or how guilty or innocent you are in their disappearance you stand right now to spend the better part of the next ten or twenty years in prison well see about that rob muttered but he knew jonathan was right christ but of course even the desertion charge isnt nearly so serious as a murder charge i never murdered anyone rob snarled jumping up from his chair sit down chief coffin ordered ray stood up and leaned across the table until his eyes were on a level with robs im going to lay it out for you he said evenly i think youre a bastard for two cents id kill you myself your testimony almost put my wife in a gas chamber seven years ago and right now you may know something that could save my childrens lives if it isnt already too late now listen bum and listen hard my wife doesnt believe that you could or would harm our children i happen to respect that belief but she saw you there this morning so that means youve got to know something about what went on trying to stall and say you never got to our house wont help well prove you were there but if you level with us now and we get our kids back we wont prosecute a kidnapping charge and mr knowles who happens to be one of the top lawyers in the country will be your lawyer to get you off with as light a sentence as possible on the desertion charges he has pull plenty of it now which is it punk do you take the deal the veins bulged out in rays forehead he moved forward until his eyes were inches away from robs because if you dont and if you know something and if i find out that you could have helped us get our kids back and didnt i dont care what jail they throw you in ill get to you and ill kill you just remember that you stinking bastard ray jonathan pulled him back forcibly rob stared from face to face the chief the doctor ray eldredge that knowles guy the lawyer if he admitted being at the eldredge house but what good not to admit it there was a witness his instinct told him to take the offer that had been made rob knew when he had no cards left to play at least by taking the offer he had some leverage on the desertion business he shrugged and looked at jonathan youll defend me yes i dont want any bum kidnapping rap no ones trying to pin one on you jonathan said we want the truth the simple truth as you know it and the deals off unless we get it now rob leaned back he avoided looking at ray okay he said this is how it started my buddy up in canada they listened intently as he talked only occasionally did the chief or jonathan ask a question rob chose his words carefully when he said he was coming to ask nancy for money see i never believed she touched a hair on the head of those harmon kids she wasnt the type but i got the word that they were trying to pin the rap on me out there and id better just answer questions and keep my opinions out of it i felt kind of sorrv for her she was a scared kid in a big frameup as far as i was concerned a frameup that was your direct responsibility ray said shut up ray chief coffin said get to this morning he ordered rob when did you arrive at the eldredge home it was like a couple of minutes before ten rob said i had been driving real slow looking for that dirt road my friend drew a picture of and then i realized id missed it how did you realize you missed it well this other car i had to slow down for then i realized that the other car had come off that road so i backed up the other car ray repeated he jumped up what other car the door of the interrogation room burst open the sergeant hurried in chief i think its real important you talk to the wigginses and that other couple i think they have something real important to tell you chapter thirty finally nancy was able to get up wash her face and rinse her mouth she mustnt let them see that shed been sick they mustnt talk about it theyd think she was crazy they wouldnt believe or understand but if the unbelievable was possible the children oh god not again not like that please not again she rushed into the bedroom and grabbed underwear from the drawer slacks and a heavy sweater from the closet she had to go to the station house she had to see rob tell him what she believed beg him for the truth what did it matter if everyone thought she was crazy with lightning speed she dressed stuffed her feet into sneakers laced them with trembling fingers and hurried downstairs dorothy was waiting for her in the diningroom the table was set with sandwiches and a pot of tea nancy sit down just try to have something nancy cut her off i have to see rob legler theres something i have to ask him she clenched her teeth together having heard the hysteria rising in her voice she must not be hysterical she turned to bernie mills who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen please call the station she begged him tell chief coffin i insist on coming over that it has to do with the children nancy dorothy grabbed her arm what are you saying that i must see rob dorothy call the station no i will nancy ran over to the phone she was just reaching for it when it rang bernie mills hurried to take it but she picked it up hello her voice was quick and impatient then she heard so low it was a whisper she had to strain to make out his words mommy mommy please come and get us help us mommy missy is sick come and get us michael michael she screamed michael where are you tell me where you are were at then his voice faded and the line went dead frantically she jiggled the phone operator she shrieked dont break the connection operator but it was too late an instant later the monotonous dull buzzing dial tone whined in her ear nancy what is it who was it dorothy was at her side it was michael michael phoned he said missy is sick nancy could see doubt on dorothys face in gods name dont you understand that was michael frantically she jiggled the dhone then dialled the operator and broke into her perfunctory offer of help when she responded can you tell me about the call that just came in who handled it where did it come from im sorry maam we have no way of knowing that in fact were having a lot of trouble generally most of the phones in town are out because of the storm what is the problem ive got to know where that call came from ive got to know there is no way we can trace the call once the connection is broken maam numbly nancy put down the receiver somebody may have broken that connection she said whoever has the children nancy are you sure mrs eldredge youre kind of strungup and upset bernie mills tried to make his voice soothing nancy ignored him dorothy michael said were at he knows where he is he cant be far away dont you see that and he says missys sick from far off she was hearing something else lisa is sick she doesnt feel right she had said that to carl long ago what is the number of the police station nancy asked bernie mills she pushed back the waves of weakness that were like clouds of fog inside her head it would be so easy to lie down to slip away right now someone was with michael and missy someone who was hurting them maybe was doing to them what had happened before no no she had to find them she mustnt get sick she had to find them she grasped the edge of the table to steady herself she said quietly you may think im hysterical but i am telling you that was my sons voice what is the number of the police station call kl five three eight hundred bernie said reluctantly shes really flipped he thought and the chief would have his head for not having got to the phone she imagined it was the kid but it could have been anybody or even a crank the number rang once a crisp voice said adams port police headquarters sergeant speaking nancy started to say chief coffin and realized that she was speaking into nothingness impatiently she jiggled the phone its dead she said the phone is dead bernie mills took it from her its dead all right im not surprised probably half the houses dont have phones by now this is some storm take me to the police station no you go if the phone comes back on and michael can call again please go to the police station or is someone outside i dont think so the television van went to the station house too then you go well stay here tell them michael phoned tell them to bring rob legler here weve got to wait i cant leave you nancy how sure are you it was michael im sure dorothy please believe me im sure it was michael it was officer please how far is the station in your car five minutes youll be gone ten minutes in all but make them bring rob legler here please bernie mills thought carefully the chief had told him to stay here but with the phone out there wouldnt be messages if he brought nancy with him the chief might not like it if he left and came right back hed be gone a total of ten minutes and if that ever was the kid on the phone and he didnt report it he considered asking dorothy to drive to the station then discarded the idea the roads were too icy she looked so upset that the odds were shed crack up her car ill go he said stay right here he didnt take time to look for his coat but ran out the back door to the patrol car nancy said dorothy michael knew where he was he said were at what does that mean to you if youre on a street or a road you say were on route a or were on the beach or were on the boat but if youre in a house or store you know you say were at dorothys house or were at daddys office do you see what i mean oh dorothy there must be some way to know i keep going over things there must be something some way to know and he said that missy is sick i almost didnt let her go out this morning i thought about it i thought about it was it too cold was it too windy but i hate to think about them being sick or to baby them about being sick and i know why now it was because of carl and the way he examined them and me he was sick i know that now but thats why i let missy out it was damp and too cold for her but i thought just half an hour and it was because of that and i got her red mittens the ones with the smile faces and i told her to be sure to keep them on because it was so cold i remember thinking that for a change she had a matching pair but she did lose one by the swing oh god dorothy if i hadnt let them out if i had kept them in because she was getting sick but i didnt want to think about that dorothy nancy spun around at dorothys strangled cry dorothys face was working convulsively what did you say she demanded what did you say about the mittens i dont know do you mean that she lost one or that they matched dorothy what do you mean what do you know with a sob dorothy covered her face know where they are oh god i know and i was so stupid oh nancy what have i done oh what have i done she reached into her pocket and pulled out the mitten it was there this afternoon on the floor of the garage and i thought id kicked it out and that awful man i knew there was something about him the way he smelted so sour so evil and that baby powder oh my god nancy grabbed the mitten dorothy please help me where did you find that mitten dorothy sagged limply at the lookout when i was showing it today the lookout where that parrish man lives i dont think ive ever seen him except from a distance oh no in an instant of total clarity nancy saw truth and realized it might be too late dorothy im going to the lookout now the children are there maybe maybe ill be in time you go for ray and the police tell them to come can i get into the house dorothys shaking stopped her voice became as calm as nancy s later later for the rest of her life she could indulge in selfrecrimination but not this minute the kitchen door has a bolt if he put it on you cant get in but the front door the one on the bay side he never uses it i never gave him a key this will open both locks she dug into her pocket and came out with a set this one she did not question nancy s decision to go alone together the women raced out the back door towards the cars dorothy let nancy pull out first she caught her breath as nancy s car lurched skidded and then righted itself it was almost impossible to see the sleet had formed a thick ice shield against the window nancy rolled down her side window glancing out of it squinting against the pelting sleet she raced the car down the road across route a and down the street that led to the cutoff for the lookout as she started up the winding incline the car began to slip she floored the gas pedal and the front wheels skidded twisting the car on the icy road nancy jammed on the brake the car spun around too late she tried to right it a tree loomed ahead she managed to yank the wheel in a half circle the front end of the car pulled to the right and with a grinding crash hit the tree nancy was thrown forward then snapped back the wheels were still spinning as she pushed open the door on the drivers side and stepped out into the pelting sleet she hadnt put on a coat but she barely felt the sleet go through her sweater and slacks as she tried to run up the precarious hill at the approach to the driveway she slipped and fell ignoring the sharp pain in her knee she ran towards the house dont let me be too late please dont let me be too late like clouds breaking before her vision she could see herself staring down at the slabs at lisa and peter their faces white and bloated from the water the bits of the plastic bag still sticking to them please she prayed please she got to the house and steadied herself against the shingles as she ran around it towards the front entrance the key in her hand was wet and cold she grasped it tightly the house was completely dark except for the top floor she could see a light coming through the shade of one of the windows as she rounded the house she could hear the harsh crashing sounds of the bay as the waves broke against the rocky shore there was no beach just piles of rock the beach was over to the left she hadnt realized this property was so high you could probably see the whole town from the back windows her breath was coming in deep sobbing gasps nancy felt her heart pounding she couldnt breathe from running in the cold wind her numbed fingers fumbled with the key let it turn please let it turn she felt resistance as the rusty lock grabbed at the key then held it and finally the lock turned and nancy pushed open the door the house was dark so terribly dark she couldnt see there was a musty smell and it was so quiet here the light had come from the top floor that was where the apartment was shed have to find the stairs she resisted the impulse to shriek michaels name dorothy had said something about two staircases in the foyer past the big front room this was the front room uncertainly nancy started forward in the pitch darkness she reached her hands in front of her she mustnt make noise mustnt give warning she tripped fell forward and recovered herself by grabbing something it was the arm of a couch or chair she felt her way around it if only she had matches she strained to hear had she heard something a cry or was it just the way the wind howled in the fireplace she had to get upstairs had to find them suppose they werent there suppose she was too late suppose it was like last time with those little faces so quiet so distorted they had trusted her lisa had clung to her that last morning daddy hurt me was all she would say nancy was sure that carl had spanked her for wetting the bed had cursed herself for being too tired to wake up she hadnt dared to criticize carl but when she made the bed it wasnt wet so lisa hadnt wet the bed she should have told them that at the trial but she couldnt she couldnt think and she was too tired and it didnt matter any more the stairs that was a post under her arm the stairs three flights walk on the side be quiet nancy reached down and yanked off her sneakers they were so wet theyd made a squishing noise important to be quiet have to get upstairs mustnt be too late again last time too late shouldnt have left children in car should have known the stairs squeaked under her foot mustnt let him panic last time he panicked maybe michaels call panicked him last time they said the children hadnt been thrown in the water till after they were dead but michael was still alive just a few minutes ago twenty minutes ago and he thought missy was sick maybe she was sick have to get to her the first flight bedrooms on this floor but no light no sound upstairs two more flights on the third floor there was no sound either at the base of the last staircase nancy stopped to control her harsh breathing the door at the head of the stairs was open she could see a shadow against the wall caused by a thin flicker of light then she heard it a voice michaels voice dont do that dont do that she ran up the stairs blindly furiously michael missy she hurried not caring about the noise but her thick socks didnt make noise her hand grasping the banister was silent at the top of the stairs she hesitated the light was coming from down the hall silently swiftly she hurried through the room the livingroom probably that was shadowy and quiet towards the candlelight in the bedroom towards the gross figure with its back to her that was holding a small struggling figure on the bed with one hand giggling softly as with the other he pulled a shiny plastic bag over a blond head nancy had an impression of startled blue eyes of michaels blond hair matting on his forehead of the way the plastic clung to his eyelids and nostrils as she cried let go of him carl she didnt know shed said carl until she heard the name come from her lips the man spun around somewhere lurking in that gross mass of flesh she could see eyes that darted and burned nancy had an impression of the plastic clinging of missys tousled figure lying on the bed her windbreaker a bright red heap beside her she saw the look of stupefaction replaced by cunning you the voice she remembered the voice that over seven years shed tried to blot out he started towards her menacingly she had to get around him michael couldnt breathe he lunged for her she pulled away feeling his thick grasp on her wrist they fell together clumsily heavily she felt his elbow dig into her side the pain was blinding but his grip relaxed for an instant his face was next to hers thick and white the features bloated and broadened but the sour dank smell the same as it had been before blindly she reached out with all her force and bit the thick jowly cheek with a howl of rage he lashed out but let her go and she dragged herself up feeling his hand pulling at her she threw herself on to the bed with her fingernails tearing at the tight plastic sheet that was making michaels eyes bulge his cheeks become blue she heard his gasping breath as she twisted around to meet carls new attack his arms pulled her tight against him she felt the sick warmth of his exposed body oh god she pushed back his face with her hands and felt him bend her backward as she tried to pull away she could feel missys foot under her touching her moving it was moving missy was alive she knew it she could feel it she began to scream a steady demanding call for help and then carls hand covered her mouth and nostrils and futilely she tried to bite the thick palm that was choking out air and causing great black curtains to close in front of her eyes she was sinking into gasping unconsciousness when abruptly the hands loosened their pressure she choked great gurgling sounds from somewhere someone was shouting her name ray it was ray she tried to call out but no sound came struggling up on to one elbow she shook her head mommy mommy hes taking missy michaels voice was urgent his hand shaking her she managed to sit up as carl swooped his arm passed her and grabbed the small figure that had begun to squirm and cry put her down carl dont touch her her voice was a croak now but he looked at her wildly and turned holding missy against him he ran away his gait awkward in the dark of the next room she heard him bumping into furniture and she staggered after him trying to shake the dizziness there were footsteps on the stairs now hard racing footsteps coming up desperately she listened for carl heard him down the hall saw his dark shadow silhouetted against the window he was climbing the stairs to the attic he was going up to the attic she followed him caught up with him tried to grasp his leg the attic was cavernous mustysmelling thickbeamed with a low ceiling and dark so dark it was hard to follow him help she screamed help at last she could make her voice carry up here ray up here she stumbled blindly after the sound of carls footsteps but where was he the ladder he was climbing the thin rickety ladder that led from the attic straight up to the roof the widows walk he was going on to the widows walk she thought of the narrow perilous balcony that circled the chimney between the turrets of the house carl dont go up there its too dangerous carl come back come back she could hear his harsh breathing the highpitched sound that was between sob and giggle she tried to grab his foot as she climbed after him but he kicked savagely when he felt her hand the thick sole of his shoe caught the edge of her forehead and she slipped down the ladder ignoring the warm gushing blood that streamed down her face not feeling the force of the blow she started up again crying carl give her to me carl stop but he was at the top of the ladder pushing up the door that led on to the roof thick sleet pelted down as the door creaked upward carl you cant get away she pleaded carl ill help you youre sick ill tell them youre sick the wind caught the door pulled it open till it thudded against the side of the house missy was crying now a loud frightened wail mommmmmmmy carl thrust his body on to the balcony nancy scrambled after him bracing against the door frame it was so narrow there was barely space for one person between the railing and the chimney frantically she clawed at his clothes trying to get a grip on him to pull him back from the low railing if he fell or dropped missy carl stop stop sleet beat against him he turned and tried to kick her again but stumbled backward grasping missy against him he lurched against the railing and regained his balance his giggle was now a persistent hiccuping sound the walk was covered with a layer of ice he sat missy on the railing holding her with one hand dont come any nearer little girl he said to nancy ill drop her if you do tell them they must let me go away tell them they must not touch me carl ill help you give her to me you wont help youll want them to hurt me he swung one foot over the rail carl no dont do it carl you hate water you dont want water to cover your face you know that thats why i should have known you didnt commit suicide you couldnt drown yourself you know that carl she made her voice calm deliberate soothing she took one step towards the railing missy was reaching her arms out pleading then she heard it a cracking breaking sound the railing was breaking as she watched the wooden posts gave way under carls weight his head went backward he swung his arms forward as he released his hold on missy nancy darted forward and grabbed her baby her hands caught in missys long hair caught and twisted and held she was teetering on the edge of the walk the rail was crumbling she felt carl grab her leg as he fell screaming then as she was being dragged forward firm arms came around her waist from behind arms that held and supported her a strong hand pulled missys head against her neck pulled them both back and she collapsed against ray even as with a last despairing scream carl slid off the balcony across the icy sloping roof and into the angry rockfilled surf far below chapter thirtyone the fire licked hungrily at the thick logs the warm hearth smell permeated the room and mingled with the scent of freshlymade coffee the wigginses had opened the store and brought up cold cuts for sandwiches and they and dorothy had prepared a spread while nancy and ray were at the hospital with the children when they got home nancy insisted that the television crews and reporters be fed too and jonathan had thrown his home open to them they had taken films of the homecoming of nancy and ray carrying their children in from the car and had been promised an interview the next day in the meantime ray said into the microphones we want to thank everyone whose prayers through this day kept our children from harm the keeneys had come back to the house too wanting to be part of the gladness frightened that they had waited to come forward with their information sure that only prayer had made the rescue possible we are all so human so foolish ellen thought she shuddered thinking that her neil had talked to that insane man suppose he had asked neil to get into his car that day nancy sat on the couch tightly holding a peacefully sleeping missy missy smelling of vick and soothed with warm milk and aspirin the ragged blanket she called her bee held securely to her face as she nestled against her mother michael was talking to a gently questioning lendon telling all about it thinking it out his voice at first excitable and rapid was calmer now even a little boastful and i didnt want to go away from that house without missy when the nice man started fighting with the other man and yelled at me to get help so ran back up to missy and called mommy on the phone but then the phone stopped working and i tried to carry missy down the stairs but the bad man came rays arms were around him good boy youre quite a guy mike ray couldnt keep his eyes off nancy and missy nancy s face was discoloured and bruised but so serenely beautiful that he had trouble swallowing over the lump in his throat chief coffin put down his coffee cup and reviewed the statement that he would make to the press professor carl harmon alias courtney parrish was pulled out of the water still alive before he died he was able to make a statement confessing his sole guilt in the murder of his children lisa and peter seven years ago he also admitted that he was responsible for the death of nancy eldredges mother realizing that she would have prevented his marriage to nancy he jammed the steering mechanism of her car while she was in the restaurant with nancy mr john kragopoulos whom professor harmon assaulted today is on the serious list in cape cod hospital with a concussion but is expected to recover the eldredge children have been examined and were not sexually molested although the boy michael suffered a bruise on the side of the face from a violent slap the chief felt fatigue settling into the very marrow of his bones hed give the statement and get home himself delia would be waiting for him wanting to know everything about what had happened this he reflected was the kind of day that made police work worthwhile there was so much grief in this job there were the times when you had to tell parents that their child was dead moments like the one in the lookout when they knew they had found both kids safe were to be cherished tomorrow jed reflected that tomorrow he would have to judge his own culpability this morning he had prejudged nancy because of pique that he hadnt recognized her by prejudging her he hadnt let his mind stay open had ignored what jonathan and ray and the doctor and nancy herself were telling him but at least he had driven the car that got ray to the balcony on the roof of the lookout in that split second of time no one else could have got up that hill on that ice so fast when theyd seen nancy s car crashed into the tree at the bend of the road ray had wanted to stop but jed had kept going some instinct made him feel that nancy had got out of the car and was in the house his hunch had been right for that he could defend himself dorothy quietly refilled lendons cup at his affirmative nod michael would be all right lendon thought hed come down and see them again soon hed talk to the children and to nancy try to help her to completely see the past for what it was and then turn her back on it nancy wouldnt need too much help it was a miracle that shed had the toughness to survive the horror of everything that had happened to her but she was a strong person and would emerge from this last ordeal able to look forward to a normal life there was peace in lendon he had compensated at last for his neglect if he had gone to nancy when priscilla died so much could have been avoided he would have realized there was something wrong with carl harmon and somehow got her away from him but then she wouldnt be here now with this young man who was her husband these children would not be in her arms lendon realized how much he wanted now to get home to allison coffee jonathan repeated dorothys question yes thank you i dont usually have any this late but i dont think many of us will have trouble sleeping tonight he studied dorothy closely how about you you must be pretty tired he watched as an indefinable sadness crept over her face and understood the reason for it i think i must tell you he said firmly that any kind of selfrecrimination you have is intolerable we all ignored facts today in a way that might have contributed to disaster one of the first of these is that every single morning as i walked past this house i have been annoyed by the glint that hit my eyes this very morning i considered asking ray to speak to the tenant at the lookout about whatever he had in the window with my legal training i should have remembered that an investigation would have led us to the lookout very quickly and one irrevocable fact is that if you had not elected to keep that appointment and bring mr kragopoulos to that house carl harmon would not have been deterred in his evil intent he would not have had his attention distracted from missy surely youve been listening to michaels description of what was happening before your call dorothy listened considered and in basic honesty agreed a weight of guilt and remorse dissolved and she felt suddenly lighthearted and glad able to rejoice fully in the reunion thank you jonathan she said simply i did need to hear that unconsciously she clasped his arm consciously he covered her hand with his own the roads are still treacherous he said when youre ready to go home id feel better if i drove you it is over nancy thought it is over her arms tightened around her sleeping child missy stirred murmured mommy and slipped back into even soft breathing nancy looked at michael he was leaning back against ray nancy watched as ray gently pulled him down oh his lap youre getting tired fellow ray said think maybe you kids had better get to bed its been quite a day nancy remembered the feeling when those strong arms had grabbed her held her kept her and missy from falling it would always be like that with ray she would always be safe and today shed seen and known and been in time from the wellspring of her being prayer permeated her mind and heart thank you thank you thank you you have delivered us from evil she realized that the sleet was no longer pelting the windows that the moaning sound of the wind had died mommy michael said and now his voice was sleepy we didnt even have a birthday party for you and i didnt get you your present dont worry mike ray said well celebrate mommys birthday tomorrow and i know just the presents to get for her miraculously the strain and fatigue left his expression and nancy saw a twinkle begin in his eye he looked directly at her ill even tell you what they are honey he volunteered art lessons from a really good teacher from the kids and a colour job at the beauty parlour from me he stood up eased michael back into the chair and came over to her standing over her he studied the part in her hair carefully i have a hunch you make a hell of a redhead honey he said
