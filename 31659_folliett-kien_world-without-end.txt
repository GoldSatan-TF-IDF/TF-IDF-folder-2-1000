ken follett world without end pillars of the earth book for barbara part one november gwenda was eight years old but she was not afraid of the dark when she opened her eyes she could see nothing but that was not what scared her she knew where she was she was at kingsbridge priory in the long stone building they called the hospital lying on the floor in a bed of straw her mother lay next to her and gwenda could tell by the warm milky smell that ma was feeding the new baby who did not yet have a name beside ma was pa and next to him gwendas older brother philemon who was twelve the hospital was crowded and though she could not see the other families lying along the floor squashed together like sheep in a pen she could smell the rank odour of their warm bodies when dawn broke it would be all hallows a sunday this year and therefore an especially holy day by the same token the night before was all hallows eve a dangerous time when evil spirits roamed freely hundreds of people had come to kingsbridge from the surrounding villages as gwendas family had to spend halloween in the sanctified precincts of the priory and to attend the all hallows service at daybreak gwenda was wary of evil spirits like every sensible person but she was more scared of what she had to do during the service she stared into the gloom trying not to think about what frightened her she knew that the wall opposite her had an arched window there was no glass only the most important buildings had glass windows but a linen blind kept out the cold autumn air however she could not see even a faint patch of grey where the window should be she was glad she did not want the morning to come she could see nothing but there was plenty to listen to the straw that covered the floor whispered constantly as people stirred and shifted in their sleep a child cried out as if woken by a dream and was quickly silenced by a murmured endearment now and again someone spoke uttering the halfformed words of sleep talk somewhere there was the sound of two people doing the thing parents did but never spoke of the thing gwenda called grunting because she had no other word for it too soon there was a light at the eastern end of the long room behind the altar a monk came through the door carrying a single candle he put the candle down on the altar lit a taper from it and went around touching the flame to the wall lamps his long shadow reaching up the wall each time like a reflection his taper meeting the shadow taper at the wick of the lamp the strengthening light illuminated rows of humped figures on the floor wrapped in their drab cloaks or huddled up to their neighbours for warmth sick people occupied the cots near the altar where they could get the maximum benefit from the holiness of the place at the opposite end a staircase led to the upper floor where there were rooms for aristocratic visitors the earl of shiring was there now with some of his family the monk leaned over gwenda to light the lamp above her head he caught her eye and smiled she studied his face in the shifting light of the flame and recognized him as brother godwyn he was young and handsome and last night he had spoken kindly to philemon beside gwenda was another family from her village samuel a prosperous peasant with a large landholding and his wife and two sons the younger of whom wulfric was an annoying sixyearold who thought that throwing acorns at girls then running away was the funniest thing in the world gwendas family was not prosperous her father had no land at all and hired himself out as a labourer to anyone who would pay him there was always work in the summer but after the harvest was gathered in and the weather began to turn cold the family often went hungry that was why gwenda had to steal she imagined being caught a strong hand grabbing her arm holding her in an unbreakable grip while she wriggled helplessly a deep cruel voice saying well well a little thief the pain and humiliation of a whipping and then worst of all the agony and loss as her hand was chopped off her father had suffered this punishment at the end of his left arm was a hideous wrinkled stump he managed well with one hand he could use a shovel saddle a horse and even make a net to catch birds but all the same he was always the last labourer to be hired in the spring and the first to be laid off in the autumn he could never leave the village and seek work elsewhere because the amputation marked him as a thief so that people would refuse to hire him when travelling he tied a stuffed glove to the stump to avoid being shunned by every stranger he met but that did not fool people for long gwenda had not witnessed pas punishment it had happened before she was born but she had often imagined it and now she could not help thinking about the same thing happening to her in her mind she saw the blade of the axe coming down on her wrist slicing through her skin and her bones and severing her hand from her arm so that it could never be reattached and she had to clamp her teeth together to keep from screaming out loud people were standing up stretching and yawning and rubbing their faces gwenda got up and shook out her clothes all her garments had previously belonged to her older brother she wore a woollen shift that came down to her knees and a tunic over it gathered at the waist with a belt made of hemp cord her shoes had once been laced but the eyelets were torn and the laces gone and she tied them to her feet with plaited straw when she had tucked her hair into a cap made of squirrel tails she had finished dressing she caught her fathers eye and he pointed surreptitiously to a family across the way a couple in middle age with two sons a little older than gwenda the man was short and slight with a curly red beard he was buckling on a sword which meant he was a manatarms or a knight ordinary people were not allowed to wear swords his wife was a thin woman with a brisk manner and a grumpy face as gwenda scrutinized them brother godwyn nodded respectfully and said good morning sir gerald lady maud gwenda saw what had attracted her fathers notice sir gerald had a purse attached to his belt by a leather thong the purse bulged it looked as if it contained several hundred of the small thin silver pennies halfpennies and farthings that were the english currency as much money as pa could earn in a year if he had been able to find employment it would be more than enough to feed the family until the spring ploughing the purse might even contain a few foreign gold coins florins from florence or ducats from venice gwenda had a small knife in a wooden sheath hanging from a cord around her neck the sharp blade would quickly cut the thong and cause the fat purse to fall into her small hand unless sir gerald felt something strange and grabbed her before she could do the deed godwyn raised his voice over the rumble of talk for the love of christ who teaches us charity breakfast will be provided after the all hallows service he said meanwhile there is pure drinking water in the courtyard fountain please remember to use the latrines outside no pissing indoors the monks and nuns were strict about cleanliness last night godwyn had caught a sixyearold boy peeing in a corner and had expelled the whole family unless they had a penny for a tavern they would have had to spend the cold october night shivering on the stone floor of the cathedrals north porch there was also a ban on animals gwendas threelegged dog hop had been banished she wondered where he had spent the night when all the lamps were lit godwyn opened the big wooden door to the outside the night air bit sharply at gwendas ears and the tip of her nose the overnight guests pulled their coats around them and began to shuffle out when sir gerald and his family moved off pa and ma fell into line behind them and gwenda and philemon followed suit philemon had done the stealing until now but yesterday he had almost been caught at kingsbridge market he had palmed a small jar of expensive oil from the booth of an italian merchant then he had dropped the jar so that everyone saw it mercifully it had not broken when it hit the ground he had been forced to pretend that he had accidentally knocked it off the stall until recently philemon had been small and unobtrusive like gwenda but in the last year he had grown several inches developed a deep voice and become awkward and clumsy as if he could not get used to his new larger body last night after the incident with the jar of oil pa had announced that philemon was now too big for serious thieving and henceforth it was gwendas job that was why she had lain awake for so much of the night philemons name was really holger when he was ten years old he had decided he was going to be a monk so he told everyone he had changed his name to philemon which sounded more religious surprisingly most people had gone along with his wish though ma and pa still called him holger they passed through the door and saw two lines of shivering nuns holding burning torches to light the pathway from the hospital to the great west door of kingsbridge cathedral shadows flickered at the edges of the torchlight as if the imps and hobgoblins of the night were cavorting just out of sight kept at a distance only by the sanctity of the nuns gwenda half expected to see hop waiting outside but he was not there perhaps he had found somewhere warm to sleep as they walked to the church pa made sure they stayed close to sir gerald from behind someone tugged painfully at gwendas hair she squealed thinking it was a goblin but when she turned she saw wulfric her sixyearold neighbour he darted out of her reach laughing then his father growled behave and smacked his head and the little boy began to cry the vast church was a shapeless mass towering above the huddled crowd only the lowest parts were distinct arches and mullions picked out in orange and red by the uncertain torchlight the procession slowed as it approached the cathedral entrance and gwenda could see a group of townspeople coming from the opposite direction there were hundreds of them gwenda thought maybe thousands although she was not sure how many people made a thousand for she could not count that high the crowd inched through the vestibule the restless light of the torches fell on the sculpted figures around the walls making them dance madly at the lowest level were demons and monsters gwenda stared uneasily at dragons and griffins a bear with a mans head a dog with two bodies and one muzzle some of the demons struggled with humans a devil put a noose around a mans neck a foxlike monster dragged a woman by her hair an eagle with hands speared a naked man above these scenes the saints stood in a row under sheltering canopies over them the apostles sat on thrones then in the arch over the main door st peter with his key and st paul with a scroll looked adoringly upwards at jesus christ gwenda knew that jesus was telling her not to sin or she would be tortured by demons but humans frightened her more than demons if she failed to steal sir geralds purse she would be whipped by her father worse there would be nothing for the family to eat but soup made with acorns she and philemon would be hungry for weeks on end mas breasts would dry up and the new baby would die as the last two had pa would disappear for days and come back with nothing for the pot but a scrawny heron or a couple of squirrels being hungry was worse than being whipped it hurt longer she had been taught to pilfer at a young age an apple from a stall a newlaid egg from under a neighbours hen a knife dropped carelessly on a tavern table by a drunk but stealing money was different if she were caught robbing sir gerald it would be no use bursting into tears and hoping to be treated as a naughty child as she had once after thieving a pair of dainty leather shoes from a softhearted nun cutting the strings of a knights purse was no childish peccadillo it was a real grownup crime and she would be treated accordingly she tried not to think about it she was small and nimble and quick and she would take the purse stealthily like a ghost provided she could keep from trembling the wide church was already thronged with people in the side aisles hooded monks held torches that cast a restless red glow the marching pillars of the nave reached up into darkness gwenda stayed close to sir gerald as the crowd pushed forward towards the altar the redbearded knight and his thin wife did not notice her their two boys paid no more attention to her than to the stone walls of the cathedral gwendas family fell back and she lost sight of them the nave filled up quickly gwenda had never seen so many people in one place it was busier than the cathedral green on market day people greeted one another cheerfully feeling safe from evil spirits in this holy place and the sound of all their conversations mounted to a roar then the bell tolled and they fell silent sir gerald was standing by a family from the town they all wore cloaks of fine cloth so they were probably rich wool dealers next to the knight stood a girl about ten years old gwenda stood behind sir gerald and the girl she tried to make herself inconspicuous but to her dismay the girl looked at her and smiled reassuringly as if to tell her not to be frightened around the edges of the crowd the monks extinguished their torches one by one until the great church was in utter darkness gwenda wondered if the rich girl would remember her later she had not merely glanced at gwenda then ignored her as most people did she had noticed her had thought about her had anticipated that she might be scared and had given her a friendly smile but there were hundreds of children in the cathedral she could not have got a very clear impression of gwendas features in the dim light could she gwenda tried to put the worry out of her mind invisible in the darkness she stepped forward and slipped noiselessly between the two figures feeling the soft wool of the girls cloak on one side and the stiffer fabric of the knights old surcoat on the other now she was in a position to get at the purse she reached into her neckline and took the little knife from its sheath the silence was broken by a terrible scream gwenda had been expecting it ma had explained what was going to happen during the service but all the same she was shocked it sounded like someone being tortured then there was a harsh drumming sound as of someone beating on a metal plate more noises followed wailing mad laughter a hunting horn a rattle animal noises a cracked bell in the congregation a child started to cry and others joined in some of the adults laughed nervously they knew the noises were made by the monks but all the same it was a hellish cacophony this was not the moment to take the purse gwenda thought fearfully everyone was tense alert the knight would be sensitive to any touch the devilish noise grew louder then a new sound intervened music at first it was so soft that gwenda was not sure she had really heard it then gradually it grew louder the nuns were singing gwenda felt her body flood with tension the moment was approaching moving like a spirit imperceptible as the air she turned so that she was facing sir gerald she knew exactly what he was wearing he had on a heavy wool robe gathered at the waist by a broad studded belt his purse was tied to the belt with a leather thong over the robe he wore an embroidered surcoat costly but worn with yellowing bone buttons down the front he had done up some of the buttons but not all probably out of sleepy laziness or because the walk from the hospital to the church was so short with a touch as light as possible gwenda put one small hand on his coat she imagined her hand was a spider so weightless that he could not possibly feel it she ran her spider hand across the front of his coat and found the opening she slipped her hand under the edge of the coat and along his heavy belt until she came to the purse the pandemonium faded as the music grew louder from the front of the congregation came a murmur of awe gwenda could see nothing but she knew that a lamp had been lit on the altar illuminating a reliquary an elaborately carved ivoryandgold box holding the bones of st adolphus that had not been there when the lights went out the crowd surged forward everyone trying to get closer to the holy remains as gwenda felt herself squashed between sir gerald and the man in front of him she brought up her right hand and put the edge of the knife to the thong of his purse the leather was tough and her first stroke did not cut it she sawed frantically with the knife hoping desperately that sir gerald was too interested in the scene at the altar to notice what was happening under his nose she glanced upwards and realized she could just about see the outlines of people around her the monks and nuns were lighting candles the light would get brighter every moment she had no time left she gave a fierce yank on the knife and felt the thong give sir gerald grunted quietly had he felt something or was he reacting to the spectacle at the altar the purse dropped and landed in her hand but it was too big for her to grasp easily and it slipped for a terrifying moment she thought she was going to drop it and lose it on the floor among the heedless feet of the crowd then she got a grip on it and held it she felt a moment of joyous relief she had the purse but she was still in terrible danger her heart was beating so loudly she felt as if everyone must be able to hear it she turned quickly so that her back was to the knight in the same movement she stuffed the heavy purse down the front of her tunic she could feel that it made a bulge that would be conspicuous hanging over her belt like an old mans belly she shifted it around to her side where it was partly covered by her arm it would still be visible when the lights brightened but she had nowhere else to put it she sheathed the knife now she had to get away quickly before sir gerald noticed his loss but the crush of worshippers which had helped her take the purse unnoticed now hindered her escape she tried to step backwards hoping to force a gap in the bodies behind her but everyone was still pressing forward to look at the bones of the saint she was trapped unable to move right in front of the man she had robbed a voice in her ear said are you all right it was the rich girl gwenda fought down panic she needed to be invisible a helpful older child was the last thing she wanted she said nothing be careful the girl said to the people around youre squashing this little girl gwenda could have screamed the rich girls thoughtfulness would get gwendas hand chopped off desperate to get away she put her hands on the man in front and shoved pushing herself backwards she succeeded only in getting the attention of sir gerald you cant see anything down there can you said her victim in a kindly voice and to her horror he grasped her under the arms and lifted her up she was helpless his big hand in her armpit was only an inch from the purse she faced forward so that he could see only the back of her head and looked over the crowd to the altar where the monks and nuns were lighting more candles and singing to the longdead saint beyond them a faint light showed through the big rose window at the east end of the building dawn was breaking chasing the evil spirits away the clangour had stopped now and the singing swelled a tall goodlooking monk stepped up to the altar and gwenda recognized him as anthony the prior of kingsbridge raising his hands in a blessing he said loudly and so once again by the grace of christ jesus the evil and darkness of this world are banished by the harmony and light of gods holy church the congregation gave a triumphant roar then began to relax the climax of the ceremony had passed gwenda wriggled and sir gerald got the message and put her down keeping her face turned away from him she pushed past him heading towards the back of the crowd people were no longer so eager to see the altar and she was now able to force her way between the bodies the farther back she went the easier it became until at last she found herself by the great west door and saw her family pa looked expectantly at her ready to be angry if she had failed she pulled the purse out of her shirt and thrust it at him glad to get rid of it he grabbed it turned slightly and furtively looked inside she saw him grin with delight then he passed the purse to ma who quickly shoved it into the folds of the blanket that wrapped the baby the ordeal was over but the risk had not yet passed a rich girl noticed me gwenda said and she could hear the shrill fear in her own voice pas small dark eyes flashed anger did she see what you did no but she told the others not to squash me then the knight picked me up so i could see better ma gave a low groan pa said he saw your face then i tried to keep it turned away still better if he doesnt come across you again pa said we wont return to the monks hospital well go to a tavern for our breakfast ma said we cant hide away all day no but we can melt into the crowd gwenda started to feel better pa seemed to think there was no real danger anyway she was reassured just by his being in charge again and taking the responsibility from her besides he went on i fancy bread and meat instead of the monks watery porridge i can afford it now they went out of the church the sky was pearly grey with dawn light gwenda wanted to hold mas hand but the baby started to cry and ma was distracted then she saw a small threelegged dog white with a black face come running into the cathedral close with a familiar lopsided stride hop she cried and picked him up and hugged him merthin was eleven a year older than his brother ralph but to his intense annoyance ralph was taller and stronger this caused trouble with the parents their father sir gerald was a soldier and could not conceal his disappointment when merthin proved unable to lift the heavy lance or became exhausted before the tree was chopped down or came home crying after losing a fight their mother lady maud made matters worse embarrassing merthin by being overprotective when what he needed her to do was pretend not to notice when father showed his pride in ralphs strength mother tried to compensate by criticizing ralphs stupidity ralph was a bit slow on the uptake but he could not help it and being nagged about it only made him angry so that he got into fights with other boys both parents were tetchy on the morning of all hallows day father had not wanted to come to kingsbridge at all but he had been compelled he owed money to the priory and he could not pay mother said they would take away his lands he was lord of three villages near kingsbridge father reminded her that he was directly descended from the thomas who became earl of shiring in the year that archbishop becket was murdered by king henry ii that earl thomas had been the son of jack builder the architect of kingsbridge cathedral and lady aliena of shiring a nearlegendary couple whose story was told on long winter evenings along with the heroic tales of charlemagne and roland with such ancestry sir gerald could not have his land confiscated by any monk he bellowed least of all that old woman prior anthony when he started shouting a look of tired resignation came over mauds face and she turned away though merthin had heard her mutter the lady aliena had a brother richard who was no good for anything but fighting prior anthony might be an old woman but he had at least been man enough to complain about sir geralds unpaid debts he had gone to geralds overlord the present earl of shiring who happened also to be geralds second cousin earl roland had summoned gerald to kingsbridge today to meet with the prior and work out some resolution hence fathers bad temper then father was robbed he discovered the loss after the all hallows service merthin had enjoyed the drama the darkness the weird noises the music beginning so quietly and then swelling until it seemed to fill the huge church and finally the slow illumination of candles he had also noticed as the lights began to come on that some people had been taking advantage of the darkness to commit minor sins for which they could now be forgiven he had seen two monks hastily stop kissing and a sly merchant remove his hand from the plump breast of a smiling woman who appeared to be someone elses wife merthin was still in an excited mood when they returned to the hospital as they were waiting for the nuns to serve breakfast a kitchen boy passed through the room and went up the stairs carrying a tray with a big jug of ale and a platter of hot salt beef mother said grumpily i would think your relative the earl might invite us to breakfast with him in his private room after all your grandmother was sister to his grandfather father replied if you dont want porridge we can go to the tavern merthins ears pricked up he liked tavern breakfasts of new bread and salt butter but mother said we cant afford it we can father said feeling for his purse and that was when he realized it was gone at first he looked around the floor as if it might have fallen then he noticed the cut ends of the leather thong and he roared with indignation everyone looked at him except mother who turned away and merthin heard her mutter that was all the money we had father glared accusingly at the other guests in the hospital the long scar that ran from his right temple to his left eye seemed to darken with rage the room went quiet with tension an angry knight was dangerous even one who was evidently down on his luck then mother said you were robbed in the church no doubt merthin guessed that must be right in the darkness people had been stealing more than kisses sacrilege too said father i expect it happened when you picked up that little girl mother went on her face was twisted as if she had swallowed something bitter the thief probably reached around your waist from behind he must be found father roared the young monk called godwyn spoke up im very sorry this has happened sir gerald he said i will go and tell john constable right away he can look out for a poor townsman who has suddenly become rich that seemed to merthin a very unpromising plan there were thousands of townspeople and hundreds more visitors the constable could not observe them all but father was slightly mollified the rogue shall hang he said in a voice a little less loud and meanwhile perhaps you and lady maud and your sons would do us the honour of sitting at the table that is being set up in front of the altar godwyn said smoothly father grunted he was pleased merthin knew to be accorded higher status than the mass of guests who would eat sitting on the floor where they had slept the moment of potential violence passed and merthin relaxed a little but as the four of them took their seats he wondered anxiously what would happen to the family now his father was a brave soldier everyone said that sir gerald had fought for the old king at boroughbridge where a lancashire rebels sword had given him the scar on his forehead but he was unlucky some knights came home from battle with booty plundered jewels a cartload of costly flemish cloth and italian silk or the beloved father of a noble family who could be ransomed for a thousand pounds sir gerald never seemed to get much loot but he still had to buy weapons armour and an expensive warhorse to enable him to do his duty and serve the king and somehow the rents from his lands were never enough so against mothers will he had started to borrow the kitchen hands brought in a steaming cauldron sir geralds family were served first the porridge was made with barley and flavoured with rosemary and salt ralph who did not understand the family crisis started to talk excitedly about the all hallows service but the glum silence in which his comments were received shut him up when the porridge was eaten merthin went to the altar behind it he had stashed his bow and arrows people would hesitate to steal something from an altar they might overcome their fears if the reward were tempting enough but a homemade bow was not much of a prize and sure enough it was still there he was proud of it it was small of course to bend a fullsize sixfoot bow took all the strength of a grown man merthins was four foot long and slender but in other respects it was just like the standard english longbow that had killed so many scots mountain men welsh rebels and french knights in armour father had not previously commented on the bow and now he looked at it as if seeing it for the first time where did you get the stave he said theyre costly not this one its too short a bowyer gave it me father nodded apart from that its a perfect stave he said its taken from the inside of the yew where the sapwood meets the heartwood he pointed to the two different colours i know merthin said eagerly he did not often get the chance to impress his father the stretchy sapwood is best for the front of the bow because it pulls back to its original shape and the hard heartwood is best for the inside of the curve because it pushes back when the bow is bent inwards exactly father said he handed the bow back but remember this is not a noblemans weapon knights sons do not become archers give it to some peasant boy merthin was crestfallen i havent even tried it yet mother intervened let them play she said theyre only boys true father said losing interest i wonder if those monks would bring us a jug of ale off you go mother said merthin take care of your brother father grunted more likely to be the other way around merthin was stung father had no idea what went on merthin could look after himself but ralph on his own would get into fights however merthin knew better than to take issue with his father in this mood and he left the hospital without saying anything ralph trailed behind him it was a clear cold november day and the sky was roofed with high palegrey cloud they left the cathedral close and walked down the main street passing fish lane leather yard and cookshop street at the bottom of the hill they crossed the wooden bridge over the river leaving the old city for the suburb called newtown here the streets of timber houses ran between pastures and gardens merthin led the way to a meadow called lovers field there the town constable and his deputies had set up butts targets for archery shooting practice after church was compulsory for all men by order of the king enforcement was not much needed it was no hardship to loose off a few arrows on a sunday morning and a hundred or so of the young men of the town were lining up for their turn watched by women children and men who considered themselves too old or too dignified to be archers some had their own weapons for those too poor to afford a bow john constable had inexpensive practice bows made of ash or hazel it was like a feast day dick brewer was selling tankards of ale from a barrel on a cart and betty baxters four adolescent daughters were walking around with trays of spiced buns for sale the wealthier townspeople were done up in fur caps and new shoes and even the poorer women had dressed their hair and trimmed their cloaks with new braid merthin was the only child carrying a bow and he immediately attracted the attention of other children they crowded around him and ralph the boys asking envious questions the girls looking admiring or disdainful according to temperament one of the girls said how did you know how to make it merthin recognized her she had stood near him in the cathedral she was about a year younger than himself he thought and she wore a dress and cloak of expensive closewoven wool merthin usually found girls of his own age tiresome they giggled a lot and refused to take anything seriously but this one looked at him and his bow with a frank curiosity that he liked i just guessed he said thats clever does it work i havent tried it whats your name caris from the wooler family who are you merthin my father is sir gerald merthin pushed back the hood of his cape reached inside it and took out a coiled bowstring why do you keep the string in your hat so it wont get wet if theres rain its what the real archers do he attached the twine to the notches at either end of the stave bending the bow slightly so that the tension would hold the string in place are you going to shoot at the targets yes another boy said they wont let you merthin looked at him he was about twelve tall and thin with big hands and feet merthin had seen him last night in the priory hospital with his family his name was philemon he had been hanging around the monks asking questions and helping to serve supper of course theyll let me merthin told him why shouldnt they because youre too young thats stupid even as he spoke merthin knew he should not be so sure adults often were stupid but philemons assumption of superior knowledge irritated him especially after he had shown confidence in front of caris he left the children and walked over to a group of men waiting to use a target he recognized one of them an exceptionally tall broadshouldered man called mark webber mark noticed the bow and spoke to merthin in a slow amiable voice where did you get that i made it merthin said proudly look at this elfric mark said to his neighbour hes made a nice job of it elfric was a brawny man with a sly look he gave the bow a cursory glance its too small he said dismissively thatll never fire an arrow to penetrate a french knights armour perhaps not mark said mildly but i expect the lads got a year or two to go before he has to fight the french john constable called out were ready lets get started mark webber youre first the giant stepped up to the line he picked up a stout bow and tested it bending the thick wood effortlessly the constable noticed merthin for the first time no boys he said why not merthin protested never mind why not just get out of the way merthin heard some of the other children snigger theres no reason for it he said indignantly i dont have to give reasons to children john said all right mark take your shot merthin was mortified the oily philemon had proved him wrong in front of everyone he turned away from the targets i told you so said philemon oh shut up and go away you cant make me go away said philemon who was six inches taller than merthin ralph put in i could though merthin sighed ralph was unfailingly loyal but he did not see that for him to fight philemon would only make merthin look like a weakling as well as a fool im leaving anyway said philemon im going to help brother godwyn he walked off the rest of the children began to drift away seeking other curiosities caris said to merthin you could go somewhere else to try the bow she was obviously keen to see what would happen merthin looked around but where if he was seen shooting unsupervised the bow might be taken from him we could go into the forest merthin was surprised children were forbidden to go into the forest outlaws hid there men and women who lived by stealing children might be stripped of their clothes or made into slaves and there were worse dangers that parents only hinted at even if they escaped such perils the children were liable to be flogged by their fathers for breaking the rule but caris did not seem to be afraid and merthin was reluctant to appear less bold than she besides the constables curt dismissal had made him feel defiant all right he said but well have to make sure no one sees us she had the answer to that i know a way she walked towards the river merthin and ralph followed a small threelegged dog tagged along whats your dogs name merthin asked caris hes not mine she said but i gave him a piece of mouldy bacon and now i cant shake him off they walked along the muddy bank of the river past warehouses and wharves and barges merthin covertly studied this girl who had so effortlessly become the leader she had a square determined face neither pretty nor ugly and there was mischief in her eyes which were a greenish colour with brown flecks her lightbrown hair was done in two plaits as was the fashion among affluent women her clothes were costly but she wore practical leather boots rather than the embroidered fabric shoes preferred by noble ladies she turned away from the river and led them through a timber yard and suddenly they were in scrubby woodland merthin felt a pang of unease now that he was in the forest where there might be an outlaw lurking behind any oak tree he regretted his bravado but he would be ashamed to back out they walked on looking for a clearing big enough for archery suddenly caris spoke in a conspiratorial voice you see that big holly bush yes as soon as were past it crouch down with me and keep silent why youll see a moment later merthin ralph and caris squatted behind the bush the threelegged dog sat with them and looked hopefully at caris ralph began to ask a question but caris hushed him a minute later a little girl came by caris jumped out and grabbed her the girl screamed be quiet caris said were not far from the road and we dont want to be heard why are you following us youve got my dog and he wont come back the child sobbed i know you i met you in church this morning caris said to her in a softer voice all right theres nothing to cry about we arent going to do you any harm whats your name gwenda and the dog hop gwenda picked up the dog and he licked her tears well youve got him now youd better come with us in case he runs off again besides you might not be able to find your way back to town on your own they went on merthin said what has eight arms and eleven legs i give up ralph said immediately he always did i know said caris with a grin its us four children and the dog she laughed thats good merthin was pleased people did not always get his jokes girls almost never did a moment later he heard gwenda explaining it to ralph two arms and two arms and two arms and two arms makes eight she said two legs they saw no one which was good the small number of people who had legitimate business in the forest woodcutters charcoal burners iron smelters would not be working today and it would be unusual to see an aristocratic hunting party on a sunday anyone they met was likely to be an outlaw but the chances were slim it was a big forest stretching for many miles merthin had never travelled far enough to see the end of it they came to a wide clearing and merthin said this will do there was an oak tree with a broad trunk on the far edge about fifty feet away merthin stood sideon to the target as he had seen the men do he took out one of his three arrows and fitted the notched end to the bowstring the arrows had been as difficult to make as the bow the wood was ash and they had goosefeather flights he had not been able to get iron for the points so he had simply sharpened the ends then scorched the wood to harden it he sighted on the tree then pulled back on the bowstring it took a great effort he released the arrow it fell to the ground well short of the target hop the dog scampered across the clearing to fetch it merthin was taken aback he had expected the arrow to go winging through the air and embed its point in the tree he realized that he had not bent the bow sufficiently he tried the bow in his right hand and the arrow in his left he was unusual in this respect that he was neither righthanded nor lefthanded but a mixture with the second arrow he pulled on the bowstring and pushed the bow with all his might and succeeded in bending them farther than before this time the arrow almost reached the tree for his third shot he aimed the bow upwards hoping the arrow would fly through the air in an arc and come down into the trunk but he overcompensated and the arrow went into the branches and fell to the ground amid a flurry of dry brown leaves merthin was embarrassed archery was more difficult than he had imagined the bow was probably all right he guessed the problem was his own proficiency or lack of it once again caris seemed not to notice his discomfiture let me have a go she said girls cant shoot ralph said and he snatched the bow from merthin standing sidewayson to the target as merthin had he did not shoot straight away but flexed the bow several times getting the feel of it like merthin he found it harder than he had at first expected but after a few moments he seemed to get the hang of it hop had dropped all three arrows at gwendas feet and now the little girl picked them up and handed them to ralph he took aim without drawing the bow sighting the arrow at the tree trunk while there was no pressure on his arms merthin realized he should have done the same why did these things come so naturally to ralph who could never answer a riddle ralph drew the bow not effortlessly but with a fluid motion seeming to take the strain with his thighs he released the arrow and it hit the trunk of the oak tree sinking an inch or more into the soft outer wood ralph laughed triumphantly hop scampered after the arrow when he reached the tree he stopped baffled ralph was drawing the bow again merthin realized what he was intending to do dont he said but he was a moment too late ralph shot at the dog the arrow hit the back of its neck and sunk in hop fell forward and lay twitching gwenda screamed caris said oh no the two girls ran to the dog ralph was grinning what about that he said proudly you shot her dog merthin said angrily doesnt matter it only had three legs the little girl was fond of it you idiot look at her crying youre just jealous because you cant shoot something caught ralphs eye with a smooth movement he notched another arrow swept the bow round in an arc and fired while it was still moving merthin did not see what he was shooting at until the arrow met its target and a fat hare jumped into the air with the shaft sticking deep into its hindquarters merthin could not hide his admiration even with practice not everyone could hit a running hare ralph had a natural gift merthin was jealous although he would never admit it he longed to be a knight bold and strong and fight for the king as his father did and it dismayed him when he turned out to be hopeless at things such as archery ralph found a stone and crushed the hares skull putting it out of its misery merthin knelt beside the two girls and hop the dog was not breathing caris gently drew the arrow out of its neck and handed it to merthin there was no gush of blood hop was dead for a moment no one spoke in the silence they heard a man shout merthin sprang to his feet heart thudding he heard another shout a different voice there was more than one person both sounded aggressive and angry some kind of fight was going on he was terrified and so were the others as they stood frozen listening they heard another sound the noise made by a man running headlong through woodland snapping fallen branches flattening saplings trampling dead leaves he was coming their way caris spoke first the bush she said pointing to a big cluster of evergreen shrubs probably the home of the hare ralph had shot merthin thought a moment later she was flat on her belly crawling into the thicket gwenda followed cradling the body of hop ralph picked up the dead hare and joined them merthin was on his knees when he realized that they had left a telltale arrow sticking out of the tree trunk he dashed across the clearing pulled it out ran back and dived under the bush they heard the man breathing before they saw him he was panting hard as he ran drawing in ragged lungfuls of air in a way that suggested he was almost done in the shouts were coming from his pursuers calling to each other this way over here merthin recalled that caris had said they were not far from the road was the fleeing man a traveller who had been set upon by thieves a moment later he burst into the clearing he was a knight in his early twenties with both a sword and a long dagger attached to his belt he was well dressed in a leather travelling tunic and high boots with turnedover tops he stumbled and fell rolled over got up then stood with his back to the oak tree gasping for breath and drew his weapons merthin glanced at his playmates caris was white with fear biting her lip gwenda was hugging the corpse of her dog as if that made her feel safer ralph looked scared too but he was not too frightened to pull the arrow out of the hares rump and stuff the dead animal down the front of his tunic for a moment the knight seemed to stare at the bush and merthin felt with terror that he must have seen the hiding children or perhaps he had noticed broken branches and crushed leaves where they had pushed through the foliage out of the corner of his eye merthin saw ralph notch an arrow to the bow then the pursuers arrived they were two menatarms strongly built and thuggishlooking carrying drawn swords they wore distinctive twocoloured tunics the left side yellow and the right green one had a surcoat of cheap brown wool the other a grubby black cloak all three men paused catching their breath merthin was sure he was about to see the knight hacked to death and he suffered a shameful impulse to burst into tears then suddenly the knight reversed his sword and offered it hilt first in a gesture of surrender the older manatarms in the black cloak stepped forward and reached out with his left hand warily he took the proffered sword handed it to his partner then accepted the knights dagger then he said its not your weapons i want thomas langley you know me but i dont know you said thomas if he was feeling any fear he had it well under control by your coats you must be the queens men the older man put the point of his sword to thomass throat and pushed him up against the tree youve got a letter instructions from the earl to the sheriff on the subject of taxes youre welcome to read it this was a joke the menatarms were almost certainly unable to read thomas had a cool nerve merthin thought to mock men who seemed ready to kill him the second manatarms reached under the sword of the first and grasped the wallet attached to thomass belt impatiently he cut the belt with his sword he threw the belt aside and opened the wallet he took out a smaller bag made of what appeared to be oiled wool and drew from that a sheet of parchment rolled into a scroll and sealed with wax could this fight be about nothing more than a letter merthin wondered if so what was written on the scroll it was not likely to be routine instructions about taxes some terrible secret must be inscribed there if you kill me the knight said the murder will be witnessed by whoever is hiding in that bush the tableau froze for a split second the man in the black cloak kept his sword point pressed to thomass throat and resisted the temptation to look over his shoulder the one in green hesitated then looked at the bush at that point gwenda screamed the man in the green surcoat raised his sword and took two long strides across the clearing to the bush gwenda stood up and ran bursting out of the foliage the manatarms leaped after her reaching out to grab her ralph stood up suddenly raised the bow and drew it in one fluid motion and shot an arrow at the man it went through his eye and sank several inches into his head his left hand came up as if to grasp the arrow and pull it out then he went limp and fell like a dropped sack of grain hitting the ground with a thump merthin could feel ralph ran out of the bush and followed gwenda at the edge of his vision merthin perceived caris going after them merthin wanted to flee too but his feet seemed stuck to the ground there was a shout from the other side of the clearing and merthin saw that thomas had knocked aside the sword that threatened him and had drawn from somewhere about his person a small knife with a blade as long as a mans hand but the manatarms in the black cloak was alert and jumped back out of reach then he raised his sword and swung at the knights head thomas dodged aside but not fast enough the edge of the blade came down on his left forearm slicing through the leather jerkin and sinking into his flesh he roared with pain but did not fall with a quick motion that seemed extraordinarily graceful he swung his right hand up and thrust the knife into his opponents throat then his hand continuing in an arc he pulled the knife sideways severing most of the neck blood came like a fountain from the mans throat thomas staggered back dodging the splash the man in black fell to the ground his head hanging from his body by a strip thomas dropped the knife from his right hand and clutched his wounded left arm he sat on the ground suddenly looking weak merthin was alone with the wounded knight two dead menatarms and the corpse of a threelegged dog he knew he should run after the other children but his curiosity kept him there thomas now seemed harmless he told himself the knight had sharp eyes you can come out he called im no danger to you in this state hesitantly merthin got to his feet and pushed his way out of the bush he crossed the clearing and stopped several feet away from the sitting knight thomas said if they find out youve been playing in the forest youll be flogged merthin nodded ill keep your secret if youll keep mine merthin nodded again in agreeing to the bargain he was making no concessions none of the children would tell what they had seen there would be untold trouble if they did what would happen to ralph who had killed one of the queens men would you be kind enough to help me bind up this wound said thomas despite all that had happened he spoke courteously merthin observed the knights poise was remarkable merthin felt he wanted to be like that when he was grown up at last merthins constricted throat managed to produce a word yes pick up that broken belt then and wrap it around my arm if you would merthin did as he was told thomass undershirt was soaked with blood and the flesh of his arm was sliced open like something on a butchers slab merthin felt a little nauseated but he forced himself to twist the belt around thomass arm so that it pulled the wound closed and slowed the bleeding he made a knot and thomas used his right hand to pull it tight then thomas struggled to his feet he looked at the dead men we cant bury them he said id bleed to death before the graves were dug glancing at merthin he added even with you helping me he thought for a moment on the other hand i dont want them to be discovered by some courting couple looking for a place to be alone lets lug the guts into that bush where you were hiding green coat first they approached the body one leg each said thomas with his right hand he grasped the dead mans left ankle merthin took the other limp foot in both hands and heaved together they hauled the corpse into the shrubbery next to hop that will do said thomas his face was white with pain after a moment he bent down and pulled the arrow out of the corpses eye yours he said with a raised eyebrow merthin took the arrow and wiped it on the ground to get rid of some of the blood and brains adhering to the shaft in the same way they dragged the second body across the clearing its loosely attached head trailing behind and left it beside the first thomas picked up the two mens dropped swords and threw them into the bush with the bodies then he found his own weapons now said thomas i have a great favour to ask he proffered his dagger would you dig me a small hole all right merthin took the dagger just here right in front of the oak tree how big thomas picked up the leather wallet that had been attached to his belt big enough to hide this for fifty years screwing up his courage merthin said why dig and ill tell you as much of it as i can merthin scratched a square on the ground and began to loosen the cold earth with the dagger then scoop it up with his hands thomas picked up the scroll and put it into the wool bag then fastened the bag inside the wallet i was given this letter to deliver to the earl of shiring he said but it contains a secret so dangerous that i realized the bearer is sure to be killed to make certain he can never speak of it so i needed to disappear i decided i would take sanctuary in a monastery become a monk ive had enough of fighting and ive a lot of sins to repent as soon as i went missing the people who gave me the letter started to search for me and i was unlucky i was spotted in a tavern in bristol why did the queens men come after you she too would like to prevent the spread of this secret when merthins hole was eighteen inches deep thomas said that will do he dropped the wallet inside merthin shovelled the earth back into the hole on top of the wallet and thomas covered the freshly turned earth with leaves and twigs until it was indistinguishable from the ground around it if you hear that ive died said thomas id like you to dig up this letter and give it to a priest would you do that for me all right until that happens you must tell no one while they know ive got the letter but they dont know where it is theyll be afraid to do anything but if you tell the secret two things will happen first they will kill me then they will kill you merthin was aghast it seemed unfair that he should be in so much danger just because he helped a man by digging a hole im sorry to scare you said thomas but then its not entirely my fault after all i didnt ask you to come here no merthin wished with all his heart that he had obeyed his mothers orders and stayed out of the forest im going to return to the road why dont you go back the way you came i bet youll find your friends waiting somewhere not far from here merthin turned to go whats your name the knight called after him merthin son of sir gerald really thomas said as if he knew father well not a word even to him merthin nodded and left when he had gone fifty yards he vomited after that he felt slightly better as thomas had predicted the others were waiting for him right at the edge of the wood near the timber yard they crowded around him touching him as if to make sure he was all right looking relieved yet ashamed as if they were guilty about having left him they were all shaken even ralph that man he said the one i shot was he badly hurt hes dead merthin said he showed ralph the arrow still stained with blood did you pull it out of his eye merthin would have liked to say he had but he decided to tell the truth the knight pulled it out what happened to the other manatarms the knight cut his throat then we hid the bodies in the bush and he just let you go yes merthin said nothing about the buried letter we have to keep this secret caris urged there will be terrible trouble if anyone finds out ralph said ill never tell we should swear an oath caris said they stood in a little ring caris stuck out her arm so that her hand was in the centre of the circle merthin placed his hand over hers her skin was soft and warm ralph added his hand then gwenda did the same and they swore by the blood of jesus then they walked back into the town archery practice was over and it was time for the midday meal as they crossed the bridge merthin said to ralph when i grow up i want to be like that knight always courteous never frightened deadly in a fight me too said ralph deadly in the old city merthin felt an irrational sense of surprise that normal life was going on all around the sound of babies crying the smell of roasting meat the sight of men drinking ale outside taverns caris stopped outside a big house on the main street just opposite the entrance to the priory precincts she put an arm around gwendas shoulders and said my dog at home has had puppies do you want to see them gwenda still looked frightened and close to tears but she nodded emphatically yes please that was clever as well as kind merthin thought the puppies would be a comfort to the little girl and a distraction too when she returned to her family she would talk about the puppies and be less likely to speak of going into the forest they said goodbye and the girls went into the house merthin found himself wondering when he would see caris again then his other troubles came back to him what was his father going to do about his debts merthin and ralph turned into the cathedral close ralph still carrying the bow and the dead hare the place was quiet the guest house was empty but for a few sick people a nun said to them your father is in the church with the earl of shiring they went into the great cathedral their parents were in the vestibule mother was sitting at the foot of a pillar on the outjutting corner where the round column met the square base in the cold light that came through the tall windows her face was still and serene almost as if she were carved of the same grey stone as the pillar against which she leaned her head father stood beside her his broad shoulders slumped in an attitude of resignation earl roland faced them he was older than father but with his black hair and vigorous manner he seemed more youthful prior anthony stood beside the earl the two boys hung back at the door but mother beckoned them come here she said earl roland has helped us come to an arrangement with prior anthony that solves all our problems father grunted as if he was not as grateful as she for what the earl had done and the priory gets my lands he said therell be nothing for you two to inherit were going to live here in kingsbridge mother went on brightly well be corrodiaries of the priory merthin said whats a corrodiary it means the monks will provide us with a house to live in and two meals a day for the rest of our lives isnt that wonderful merthin could tell that she did not really think it was wonderful she was pretending to be pleased father was clearly ashamed to have lost his lands there was more than a hint of disgrace in this merthin realized father addressed the earl what about my boys earl roland turned and looked at them the big one looks promising he said did you kill that hare lad yes lord ralph said proudly shot it with an arrow he can come to me as a squire in a few years time the earl said briskly well teach him to be a knight father looked pleased merthin felt bewildered big decisions were being made too quickly he was outraged that his younger brother should be so favoured while no mention was made of himself thats not fair he burst out i want to be a knight too his mother said no but i made the bow father gave a sigh of exasperation and looked disgusted you made the bow did you little one the earl said and his face showed disdain in that case you shall be apprenticed to a carpenter cariss home was a luxurious woodframe building with stone floors and a stone chimney there were three separate rooms on the ground floor the hall with the big dining table the small parlour where papa could discuss business privately and the kitchen at the back when caris and gwenda walked in the house was full of the mouthwatering smell of a ham boiling caris led gwenda through the hall and up the internal staircase where are the puppies said gwenda i want to see my mother first caris replied shes ill they went into the front bedroom where mama lay on the carved wooden bedstead she was small and frail caris was already the same height mama looked paler than usual and her hair was not yet dressed so it stuck to her damp cheeks how are you feeling caris said a little weak today the effort of speaking made mama breathless caris felt a familiar painful jumble of anxiety and helplessness her mother had been ill for a year it had started with pains in her joints soon she had ulcers inside her mouth and unaccountable bruises on her body she had felt too weak to do anything last week she had caught a cold now she was running a fever and had trouble in catching her breath is there anything you need caris asked no thank you it was the usual answer but caris felt maddened by powerlessness each time she heard it should i fetch mother cecilia the prioress of kingsbridge was the only person able to bring mama some comfort she had an extract of poppies that she mixed with honey and warm wine that eased the pain for a while caris regarded cecilia as better than an angel no need dear mama said how was the all hallows service caris noticed how pale her mothers lips were scary she said mama paused resting then said what have you been doing this morning watching the archery caris held her breath frightened that mama might guess her guilty secret as she often did but mama looked at gwenda who is your little friend gwenda ive brought her to see the puppies thats lovely mama suddenly looked tired she closed her eyes and turned her head aside the girls crept out quietly gwenda was looking shocked whats wrong with her a wasting disease caris hated to talk about it her mothers illness gave her the unnerving feeling that nothing was certain anything could happen there was no safety in the world it was even more frightening than the fight they had witnessed in the forest if she thought about what might happen and the possibility that her mother might die she suffered a panicky fluttering sensation in her chest that made her want to scream the middle bedroom was used in summer by the italians wool buyers from florence and prato who came to do business with papa now it was empty the puppies were in the back bedroom which belonged to caris and her sister alice they were seven weeks old ready to leave their mother who was growing impatient with them gwenda gave a sigh of joy and immediately got down on the floor with them caris picked up the smallest of the litter a lively female always going off on her own to explore the world this is the one im going to keep she said shes called scrap holding the little dog soothed her and helped her forget about the things that troubled her the other four clambered all over gwenda sniffing her and chewing her dress she picked up an ugly brown dog with a long muzzle and eyes set too close together i like this one she said the puppy curled up in her lap caris said would you like to keep him tears came to gwendas eyes could i were allowed to give them away really papa doesnt want any more dogs if you like him you can have him oh yes gwenda said in a whisper yes please what will you name him something that reminds me of hop perhaps ill call him skip thats a good name skip had already gone to sleep in gwendas lap caris saw the two girls sat quietly with the dogs caris thought about the boys they had met the little redhaired one with the goldenbrown eyes and his tall handsome younger brother what had made her take them into the forest it was not the first time she had yielded to a stupid impulse it tended to happen when someone in authority ordered her not to do something her aunt petranilla was a great rulemaker dont feed that cat well never get rid of it no ball games in the house stay away from that boy his family are peasants rules that constrained her behaviour seemed to drive caris crazy but she had never done something this foolish she felt shaky when she thought of it two men had died but what might have happened was worse the four children might have been killed too she wondered what the fight had been about and why the menatarms had been chasing the knight obviously it was not a simple robbery they had spoken about a letter but merthin had said no more about that probably he had learned nothing further it was just another of the mysteries of adult life caris had liked merthin his boring brother ralph was just like every other boy in kingsbridge boastful and aggressive and stupid but merthin seemed different he had intrigued her right from the start two new friends in one day she thought looking at gwenda the little girl was not pretty she had dark brown eyes set close together above a beaky nose she had picked a dog that looked a bit like her caris realized with amusement gwendas clothes were old and must have been worn by many children before her gwenda was calmer now she no longer looked as if she might burst into tears at any moment she too had been soothed by the puppies there was a familiar lopsided tread in the hall below and a moment later a voice bellowed bring me a flagon of ale for the love of the saints ive got a thirst like a carthorse its my father caris said come and meet him seeing that gwenda looked anxious she added dont worry he always shouts like that but hes really nice the girls went downstairs with their puppies whats happened to all my servants papa roared have they run away to join the fairy folk he came stomping out of the kitchen trailing his twisted right leg as always carrying a big wooden cup slopping over with ale hello my little buttercup he said to caris in a softer voice he sat on the big chair at the head of the table and took a long draft from the cup thats better he said wiping his straggly beard with his sleeve he noticed gwenda a little daisy to go with my buttercup he said whats your name gwenda from wigleigh my lord she said awestruck i gave her a puppy caris explained thats a good idea papa said puppies need affection and no one can love a puppy the way a little girl does on the stool beside the table caris saw a cloak of scarlet cloth it had to be imported for english dyers did not know how to achieve such a bright red following her eye papa said its for your mother shes always wanted a coat of italian red im hoping it will encourage her to get well enough to wear it caris touched it the wool was soft and closewoven as only the italians could make it its beautiful she said aunt petranilla entered from the street she bore some resemblance to papa but was pursemouthed where he was hearty she was more like her other brother anthony the prior of kingsbridge they were both tall imposing figures whereas papa was short barrelchested and lame caris disliked petranilla she was clever as well as mean a deadly combination in an adult caris was never able to outwit her gwenda sensed cariss dislike and looked apprehensively at the newcomer only papa was pleased to see her come in sister he said where are all my servants i cant think why you imagine i should know that having just come from my own house at the other end of the street but if i had to guess edmund i should say that your cook is in the henhouse hoping to find an egg to make you a pudding and your maid is upstairs helping your wife to a closestool which she generally requires about midday as for your apprentices i hope they are both on guard duty at the warehouse by the riverside making sure that no holiday revellers take it into their drunken heads to light a bonfire within a sparks fly of your wool store she often spoke like this giving a little sermon in answer to a simple question her manner was supercilious as always but papa did not mind or pretended not to my remarkable sister he said youre the one who inherited our fathers wisdom petranilla turned to the girls our father was descended from tom builder the stepfather and mentor of jack builder architect of kingsbridge cathedral she said father vowed to give his firstborn to god but unfortunately his firstborn was a girl me he named me after st petranilla who was the daughter of st peter as im sure you know and he prayed for a boy next time but his first son was born deformed and he did not want to give god a flawed gift so he brought edmund up to take over the wool business happily his third child was our brother anthony a wellbehaved and godfearing child who entered the monastery as a boy and is now we are all proud to say the prior she would have become a priest had she been a man but as it was she had done the next best thing and brought up her son godwyn to be a monk at the priory like grandfather wooler she had given a child to god caris had always felt sorry for godwyn her older cousin for having petranilla as a mother petranilla noticed the red coat whose is this she said its the most expensive italian cloth i bought it for rose said papa petranilla stared at him for a moment caris could tell she thought he was a fool to buy such a coat for a woman who had not left the house for a year but all she said was youre very good to her which might have been a compliment or not father did not care go up and see her he urged youll cheer her up caris doubted that but petranilla suffered no such misgivings and she went up the stairs cariss sister alice came in from the street she was eleven a year older than caris she stared at gwenda and said whos she my new friend gwenda said caris shes going to take a puppy but shes got the one i wanted alice protested she had not said that before ooh you never picked one caris said outraged youre just saying that to be mean why should she have one of our puppies papa intervened now now he said weve got more puppies than we need caris should have asked me which one i wanted first yes she should papa said even though he knew perfectly well that alice was only making trouble dont do it again caris yes papa the cook came in from the kitchen with jugs and cups when caris was learning to talk she had called the cook tutty no one knew why but the name had stuck papa said thank you tutty sit at the table girls gwenda hesitated not sure if she was invited but caris nodded at her knowing that papa intended her to be included he generally asked everyone within his range of vision to come to dinner tutty refilled papas cup with ale then gave alice caris and gwenda ale mixed with water gwenda drank all of hers immediately with relish and caris guessed she did not often get ale poor people drank cider made from crab apples next the cook put in front of each of them a thick slice of rye bread a foot square gwenda picked hers up to eat it and caris realized she had never dined at a table before wait she said quietly and gwenda put the bread down again tutty brought in the ham on a board and a dish of cabbage papa took a big knife and cut slices off the ham piling it on their bread trenchers gwenda stared bigeyed at the quantity of meat she was given caris spooned cabbage leaves on top of the ham the chambermaid elaine came hurrying down the stairs the mistress seems worse she said mistress petranilla says we should send for mother cecilia then run to the priory and beg her to come papa said the maid hurried off eat up children said papa and he speared a slice of hot ham with his knife but caris could see that the dinner now had no relish for him and he seemed to be looking at something far away gwenda ate some cabbage and whispered this is food from heaven caris tried it the cabbage was cooked with ginger gwenda had probably never tasted ginger only rich people could afford it petranilla came down put some ham on a wooden platter and took it up for mama but she came back a few moments later with the food untouched she sat at the table to eat it herself and the cook brought her a bread trencher when i was a girl we were the only family in kingsbridge who had meat for dinner every day she said except on fast days my father was very devout he was the first wool merchant in town to deal directly with the italians everyone does now although my brother edmund is still the most important caris had lost her appetite and she had to chew for a long time before she could swallow at last mother cecilia arrived a small vital woman with a reassuringly bossy manner with her was sister juliana a simple person with a warm heart caris felt better as she watched them climb the stairs a chirpy sparrow with a hen waddling behind they would wash mama in rose water to cool her fever and the fragrance would lift her spirits tutty brought in apples and cheese papa peeled an apple absentmindedly with his knife caris remembered how when she was younger he used to feed her peeled slices then eat the skin himself sister juliana came downstairs a worried look on her podgy face the prioress wants brother joseph to come and see mistress rose she said joseph was the senior physician at the monastery he had trained with the masters at oxford ill just go and fetch him juliana said and she ran out through the door to the street papa put his peeled apple down uneaten caris said what is going to happen i dont know buttercup will it rain how many sacks of wool do the florentines need will the sheep catch a murrain is the baby a girl or a boy with a twisted leg we never know do we thats he looked away thats what makes it so hard he gave her the apple caris gave it to gwenda who ate it entire core and pips too brother joseph arrived a few minutes later with a young assistant whom caris recognized as saul whitehead so called because his hair what little he had left after his monkish haircut was ashblond cecilia and juliana came downstairs no doubt to make room for the two men in the small bedroom cecilia sat at the table but did not eat she had a small face with sharp features a little pointed nose bright eyes a chin like the prow of a boat she looked with curiosity at gwenda well now she said brightly who is this little girl and does she love jesus and his holy mother gwenda said im gwenda im cariss friend she looked anxiously at caris as if she feared it might have been presumptuous of her to claim friendship caris said will the virgin mary make my mama better cecilia raised her eyebrows such a direct question i could have guessed youre edmunds daughter everyone prays to her but not everyone gets well caris said and do you know why that is perhaps she never helps anyone and its just that the strong people get well and the weak dont now now dont be silly said papa everyone knows the holy mother helps us thats all right cecilia told him its normal for children to ask questions especially the bright ones caris the saints are always powerful but some prayers are more effective than others do you understand that caris nodded reluctantly feeling not convinced so much as outwitted she must come to our school cecilia said the nuns had a school for the daughters of the nobility and of the more prosperous townspeople the monks ran a separate school for boys papa looked stubborn rose has taught both girls their letters he said and caris knows her numbers as well as i do she helps me in the business she should learn more than that surely you dont want her to spend her life as your servant petranilla put in she has no need of book learning she will marry extremely well there will be crowds of suitors for both sisters sons of merchants even sons of knights will be eager to marry into this family but caris is a wilful child we must take care she doesnt throw herself away on some penniless minstrel boy caris noticed that petranilla did not anticipate trouble with obedient alice who would probably marry whomever they picked for her cecilia said god might call caris to his service papa said grumpily god has already called two from this family my brother and my nephew id have thought he would be satisfied by now cecilia looked at caris what do you think she said will you be a wool merchant a knights wife or a nun the idea of being a nun horrified caris she would have to obey someone elses orders every hour of the day it would be like remaining a child all your life and having petranilla for a mother being the wife of a knight or of anyone else seemed almost as bad for women had to obey their husbands helping papa then perhaps taking over the business when he was too old was the least unattractive option but on the other hand it was not exactly her dream i dont want to be any of those she said is there something you would like cecilia asked there was although caris had not told anyone before in fact had not fully realized it until now but the ambition seemed fully formed and suddenly she knew without doubt that it was her destiny im going to be a doctor she said there was a moment of silence then they all laughed caris flushed not knowing what was so funny papa took pity and said only men can be doctors didnt you know that buttercup caris was bewildered she turned to cecilia but what about you im not a physician cecilia said we nuns care for the sick of course but we follow the instructions of trained men the monks who have studied under the masters understand the humours of the body the way they go out of balance in sickness and how to bring them back to their correct proportions for good health they know which vein to bleed for migraine leprosy or breathlessness where to cup and cauterize whether to poultice or bathe couldnt a woman learn those things perhaps but god has ordained it otherwise caris felt frustrated with the way adults trotted out this truism every time they were stuck for an answer before she could say anything brother saul came downstairs with a bowl of blood and went through the kitchen to the back yard to get rid of it the sight made caris feel weepy all doctors used bloodletting as a cure so it must be effective she supposed but all the same she hated to see her mothers life force in a bowl to be thrown away saul returned to the sick room and a few moments later he and joseph came down ive done what i can for her joseph said solemnly to papa and she has confessed her sins confessed her sins caris knew what that meant she began to cry papa took six silver pennies from his purse and gave them to the monk thank you brother he said his voice was hoarse as the monks left the two nuns went back upstairs alice sat on papas lap and buried her face in his neck caris cried and hugged scrap petranilla ordered tutty to clear the table gwenda watched everything with wide eyes they sat around the table in silence waiting brother godwyn was hungry he had eaten his dinner a stew of sliced turnips with salt fish and it had not satisfied him the monks nearly always had fish and weak ale for dinner even when it was not a fast day not all the monks of course prior anthony had a privileged diet he would dine especially well today for the prioress mother cecilia was to be his guest she was accustomed to rich food the nuns who always seemed to have more money than the monks killed a pig or a sheep every few days and washed it down with gascon wine it was godwyns job to supervise the dinner a hard task when his own stomach was rumbling he spoke to the monastery cook and checked on the fat goose in the oven and the pot of apple sauce bubbling on the fire he asked the cellarer for a jug of cider from the barrel and got a loaf of rye bread from the bakery stale for there was no baking on sunday he took the silver platters and goblets from the locked chest and set them on the table of the hall in the priors house the prior and prioress dined together once a month the monastery and the nunnery were separate institutions with their own premises and different sources of income prior and prioress were independently responsible to the bishop of kingsbridge nevertheless they shared the great cathedral and several other buildings including the hospital where monks worked as doctors and nuns as nurses so there were always details to discuss cathedral services hospital guests and patients town politics anthony often tried to get cecilia to pay costs that should strictly speaking have been divided equally glass windows for the chapter house bedsteads for the hospital the repainting of the cathedrals interior and she usually agreed today however the talk was likely to centre on politics anthony had returned yesterday from two weeks in gloucester where he had assisted at the interment of king edward ii who had lost his throne in january and his life in september mother cecilia would want to hear the gossip while pretending to be above it all godwyn had something else on his mind he wanted to talk to anthony about his future he had been anxiously awaiting the right moment ever since the prior returned home he had rehearsed his speech but had not yet found the opportunity to deliver it he hoped to get a chance this afternoon anthony entered the hall as godwyn was putting a cheese and a bowl of pears on the sideboard the prior looked like an older version of godwyn both were tall with regular features and lightbrown hair and like all the family they had greenish eyes with flecks of gold anthony stood by the fire the room was cold and the old building let in freezing draughts godwyn poured him a cup of cider father prior today is my birthday he said as anthony drank im twentyone so it is said anthony i remember your birth very well i was fourteen years old my sister petranilla screamed like a boar with an arrow in its guts as she brought you into the world he raised his goblet in a toast looking fondly at godwyn and now youre a man godwyn decided that this was his moment ive been at the priory ten years he said is it that long yes as schoolboy novice and monk my goodness i hope ive been a credit to my mother and to you were both very proud of you thank you godwyn swallowed and now i want to go to oxford the city of oxford had long been a centre for masters of theology medicine and law priests and monks went there to study and debate with teachers and other students in the last century the masters had been incorporated into a company or university that had royal permission to set examinations and award degrees kingsbridge priory maintained a branch or cell in the city known as kingsbridge college where eight monks could carry on their lives of worship and selfdenial while they studied oxford said anthony and an expression of anxiety and distaste came over his face why to study its what monks are supposed to do i never went to oxford and im prior it was true but anthony was sometimes at a disadvantage with his senior colleagues in consequence the sacrist the treasurer and several other monastic officials or obedientiaries were graduates of the university as were all the physicians they were quickthinking and skilled in argument and anthony sometimes appeared bumbling by comparison especially in chapter the daily meeting of all the monks godwyn longed to acquire the sharp logic and confident superiority he observed in the oxford men he did not want to be like his uncle but he could not say that i want to learn he said why learn heresy anthony said scornfully oxford students question the teachings of the church in order to understand them better pointless and dangerous godwyn asked himself why anthony was making this fuss the prior had never appeared concerned about heresy before and godwyn was not in the least interested in challenging accepted doctrines he frowned i thought you and my mother had ambitions for me he said dont you want me to advance and become an obedientiary and perhaps one day prior eventually yes but you dont have to leave kingsbridge to achieve that you dont want me to advance too fast in case i outstrip you and you dont want me to leave town in case you lose control of me godwyn thought in a flash of insight he wished he had anticipated this resistance to his plans i dont want to study theology he said what then medicine its such an important part of our work here anthony pursed his lips godwyn had seen the same disapproving expression on his mothers face the monastery cant afford to pay for you anthony said do you realize that just one book costs at least fourteen shillings godwyn was taken by surprise students could hire books by the page he knew but that was not the main point what about the students already there he said who pays for them two are supported by their families and one by the nuns the priory pays for the other three but we cant afford any more in fact there are two places vacant in the college for lack of funds godwyn knew the priory was in financial difficulties on the other hand it had vast resources thousands of acres of land mills and fishponds and woodland and the enormous income from kingsbridge market he could not believe his uncle was refusing him the money to go to oxford he felt betrayed anthony was his mentor as well as a relative he had always favoured godwyn over other young monks but now he was trying to hold godwyn back physicians bring money in to the priory he argued if you dont train young men eventually the old ones will die and the priory will be poorer god will provide this infuriating platitude was always anthonys answer for some years the priorys income from the annual fleece fair had been declining the townspeople had urged anthony to invest in better facilities for the wool traders tents booths latrines even a wool exchange building but he always refused pleading poverty and when his brother edmund told him the fair would eventually decline to nothing he said god will provide godwyn said well then perhaps he will provide the money for me to go to oxford perhaps he will godwyn felt painfully disappointed he had an urge to get away from his home town and breathe a different air at kingsbridge college he would be subject to the same monastic discipline of course but nevertheless he would be far from his uncle and his mother and that prospect was alluring he was not yet ready to give up the argument my mother will be very disappointed if i dont go anthony looked uneasy he did not want to incur the wrath of his formidable sister then let her pray for the money to be found i may be able to get it elsewhere godwyn said extemporizing how would you do that he cast about for an answer and found inspiration i could do what you do and ask mother cecilia it was possible cecilia made him nervous she could be as intimidating as petranilla but she was more susceptible to his boyish charm she might be persuaded to pay for a bright young monks education the suggestion took anthony by surprise godwyn could see him trying to think of an objection but he had been arguing as if money were the main consideration and it was difficult now for him to shift his ground while anthony hesitated cecilia came in she wore a heavy cloak of fine wool her only indulgence she hated to be cold after greeting the prior she turned to godwyn your aunt rose is gravely ill she said her voice was musically precise she may not last the night may god be with her godwyn felt a pang of pity in a family where everyone was a leader rose was the only follower her petals seemed the more fragile for being surrounded by brambles its not a shock he added but my cousins alice and caris will be sad fortunately they have your mother to console them yes consolation was not petranillas strong point godwyn thought she was better at stiffening your spine and preventing you from backsliding but he did not correct the prioress instead he poured her a goblet of cider is it a little chilly in here reverend mother freezing she said bluntly ill build up the fire anthony said slyly my nephew godwyn is being attentive because he wants you to pay for him to go to oxford godwyn glared furiously at him godwyn would have planned a careful speech and chosen the best time to deliver it now anthony had blurted out the request in the most charmless fashion cecilia said i dont think we can afford to finance two more it was anthonys turn to be surprised someone else has asked you for money to go to oxford perhaps i shouldnt say cecilia replied i dont want to get anyone into trouble its of no consequence anthony said huffily then he recollected himself and added we are always grateful for your generosity godwyn put more wood on the fire then went out the priors house was on the north side of the cathedral the cloisters and all the other priory buildings were to the south of the church godwyn walked shivering across the cathedral green to the monastery kitchen he had thought anthony might quibble about oxford saying he should wait until he was older or until one of the existing students graduated for anthony was a quibbler by nature but he was anthonys protege and he had been confident that in the end his uncle would support him anthonys flat opposition had left him feeling shocked he asked himself who else had petitioned the prioress for support of the twentysix monks six were around godwyns age it could be any one of them in the kitchen the subcellarer theodoric was helping the cook could he be the rival for cecilias money godwyn watched him put the goose on a platter with a bowl of apple sauce theodoric had brains enough to study he could be a contender godwyn carried the dinner back to the priors house feeling worried if cecilia decided to help theodoric he did not know what he would do he had no fallback plan he wanted to be prior of kingsbridge one day he felt sure he could do the job better than anthony and if he was a successful prior he might rise higher bishop archbishop or perhaps a royal official or counsellor he had only a vague idea of what he would do with such power but he felt strongly that he belonged in some elevated position in life however there were only two routes to such heights one was aristocratic birth the other education godwyn came from a family of wool merchants his only hope was the university and for that he was going to need cecilias money he put the dinner on the table cecilia was saying but how did the king die he suffered a fall anthony said godwyn carved the goose may i give you some of the breast reverend mother yes please a fall she said sceptically you make the king sound like a doddering old man he was fortythree its what his jailers say having been deposed the exking had been a prisoner at berkeley castle a couple of days ride from kingsbridge ah yes his jailers cecilia said mortimers men she disapproved of roger mortimer the earl of march not only had he led the rebellion against edward ii he had also seduced the kings wife queen isabella they began to eat godwyn wondered whether there would be any left over anthony said to cecilia you sound as if you suspect something sinister of course not but others do there has been talk that he was murdered i know but i saw the corpse naked there were no marks of violence on the body godwyn knew he should not interrupt but he could not resist rumour says that when the king died his screams of agony were heard by everyone in the village of berkeley anthony looked censorious when a king dies there are always rumours this king did not merely die cecilia said he was first deposed by parliament something that has never happened before anthony lowered his voice the reasons were powerful there were sins of impurity he was being enigmatic but godwyn knew what he meant edward had had favourites young men he seemed unnaturally fond of the first peter gaveston had been given so much power and privilege that he aroused jealousy and resentment among the barons and in the end he had been executed for treason but then there had been others it was no wonder people said that the queen took a lover i cannot believe such a thing said cecilia who was a passionate royalist it may be true that outlaws in the forest give themselves up to such foul practices but a man of royal blood could never sink so low is there any more of that goose yes godwyn said concealing his disappointment he cut the last of the meat from the bird and gave it to the prioress anthony said at least there is now no challenge to the new king the son of edward ii and queen isabella had been crowned as king edward iii he is fourteen years old and he has been put on the throne by mortimer said cecilia who will be the real ruler the nobles are glad to have stability especially those of them who are mortimers cronies such as earl roland of shiring you mean he seemed ebullient today youre not suggesting that he had something to do with the kings fall certainly not the prioress ate the last of the meat such an idea would be dangerous to speak of even among friends indeed there was a tap at the door and saul whitehead came in he was the same age as godwyn could he be the rival he was intelligent and capable and he had the great advantage of being a distant relation of the earl of shiring but godwyn doubted whether he had the ambition to go to oxford he was devout and shy the kind of man for whom humility was no virtue because it came naturally but anything was possible a knight has come into the hospital with a sword wound saul said interesting said anthony but hardly shocking enough to justify interrupting the prior and the prioress at dinner saul looked scared i beg your pardon father prior he stammered but there is a disagreement about the treatment anthony sighed well the goose is all gone he said and he got to his feet cecilia went with him and godwyn and saul followed they entered the cathedral by the north transept and walked through the crossing out by the south transept across the cloisters and into the hospital the wounded knight lay on the bed nearest the altar as befitted his rank prior anthony uttered an involuntary grunt of surprise for a moment he showed shock and fear but he recovered his composure quickly and made his face expressionless however cecilia missed nothing do you know this man she asked anthony i believe i do he is sir thomas langley one of the earl of monmouths men he was a handsome man in his twenties broadshouldered and longlegged he was naked to the waist showing a muscular torso crisscrossed with the scars of earlier fights he looked pale and exhausted he was attacked on the road saul explained he managed to fight off his assailants but then he had to drag himself a mile or more to the town hes lost a lot of blood the knights left forearm was split from elbow to wrist a clean cut obviously made by a sharp sword the monasterys senior physician brother joseph stood beside the patient joseph was in his thirties a small man with a big nose and bad teeth he said the wound should be kept open and treated with an ointment to bring on a pus that way evil humours will be expelled and the wound will heal from the inside out anthony nodded so where is the disagreement matthew barber has another idea matthew was a barbersurgeon from the town he had been standing back deferentially but now he stepped forward holding the leather case that contained his expensive sharp knives he was a small thin man with bright blue eyes and a solemn expression anthony did not acknowledge matthew but said to joseph whats he doing here the knight knows him and sent for him anthony spoke to thomas if you want to be butchered why did you come to the priory hospital the ghost of a smile flickered across the knights white face but he seemed too tired to reply matthew spoke up with surprising confidence apparently undeterred by anthonys scorn ive seen many wounds like this on the battlefield father prior he said the best treatment is the simplest wash the wound with warm wine then stitch it closed and bandage it he was not as deferential as he looked mother cecilia interrupted i wonder if our two young monks have opinions on the question she asked anthony looked impatient but godwyn realized what she was up to this was a test perhaps saul was the rival for her money the answer was easy so godwyn got in first brother joseph has studied the ancient masters he said he must know best i dont suppose matthew can even read i can brother godwyn matthew protested and i have a book anthony laughed the idea of a barber with a book was silly like a horse with a hat what book the canon of avicenna the great islamic physician translated from arabic into latin i have read it all slowly and is your remedy proposed by avicenna no but well then matthew persisted but i learned more about healing by travelling with armies and treating the wounded than i ever did from the book mother cecilia said saul whats your view godwyn expected saul to give the same answer so that the contest would be indecisive but although he looked nervous and shy saul contradicted godwyn the barber may be right he said godwyn was delighted saul went on arguing for the wrong side the treatment proposed by brother joseph might be more suitable for crushing or hammering injuries such as we get on building sites where the skin and flesh all around the cut is damaged and to close the wound prematurely might seal evil humours inside the body this is a clean cut and the sooner it is closed the faster it will heal nonsense said prior anthony how could a town barber be right and an educated monk be wrong godwyn smothered a triumphant grin the door flew open and a young man in the robes of a priest strode in godwyn recognized richard of shiring the younger of the two sons of earl roland his nod to the prior and prioress was so perfunctory as to be impolite he went straight to the bedside and spoke to the knight what the devil has happened he said thomas lifted a weak hand and beckoned richard closer the young priest leaned over the patient thomas whispered in his ear father richard drew away as if shocked absolutely not he said thomas beckoned again and the process was repeated another whisper another outraged reaction this time richard said but why thomas did not reply richard said you are asking for something that is not in our power to give thomas nodded firmly as if to say yes it is youre giving us no choice thomas shook his head weakly from side to side richard turned to prior anthony sir thomas wishes to become a monk here at the priory there was a moment of surprised silence cecilia was the first to react but hes a man of violence come on its not unknown richard said impatiently a fighting man sometimes decides to abandon his life of warfare and seek forgiveness for his sins in old age perhaps cecilia said this man is not yet twentyfive hes fleeing some danger she looked hard at richard who threatens his life curb your curiosity richard said rudely he wants to be a monk not a nun so you need not inquire further it was a shocking way to talk to a prioress but the sons of earls could get away with such rudeness he turned to anthony you must admit him anthony said the priory is too poor to take on any more monks unless there were to be a gift that would pay the costs it will be arranged it would have to be adequate to the need it will be arranged very well cecilia was suspicious she said to anthony do you know more about this man than youre telling me i see no reason to turn him away what makes you think hes a genuine penitent everyone looked at thomas his eyes had closed anthony said he will have to prove his sincerity during his novitiate like anyone else she was clearly dissatisfied but for once anthony was not asking her for the money so there was nothing she could do wed better get on with treating this wound she said saul said he refused brother josephs treatment thats why we had to fetch the father prior anthony leaned over the patient in a loud voice as if speaking to someone deaf he said you must have the treatment prescribed by brother joseph he knows best thomas appeared unconscious anthony turned to joseph he is no longer objecting matthew barber said he could lose his arm youd better leave anthony told him looking angry matthew went out anthony said to richard perhaps you would come to the priors house for a cup of cider thank you as they left anthony said to godwyn stay here and help the mother prioress come to me before vespers and tell me how the knight is recovering prior anthony did not normally worry about the progress of individual patients clearly he had a special interest in this one godwyn watched as brother joseph applied ointment to the arm of the nowunconscious knight he thought he had probably ensured cecilias financial support by giving the correct answer to the question but he was keen to get her explicit agreement when brother joseph had done and ceciha was bathing thomass forehead with rose water he said i hope you will consider my request favourably she gave him a sharp look i might as well tell you now that i have decided to give the money to saul godwyn was shocked but i gave the right answer did you surely you didnt agree with the barber she raised her eyebrows i wont be interrogated by you brother godwyn im sorry he said immediately i just dont understand it i know if she was going to be enigmatic there was no point in talking to her godwyn turned away shaking with frustration and disappointment she was giving the money to saul was it because he was related to the earl godwyn thought not she was too independentminded it was sauls showy piety that had tipped the balance he decided but saul would never be leader of anything what a waste godwyn wondered how he was going to break this news to his mother she would be furious but who would she blame anthony godwyn himself a familiar feeling of dread came over him as he pictured his mothers wrath as he thought of her he saw her enter the hospital by the door at the far end a tall woman with a prominent bust she caught his eye and stood by the door waiting for him to come to her he walked slowly trying to figure out what to say your aunt rose is dying petranilla said as soon as he was close may god bless her soul mother cecilia told me you look shocked but you know how ill she is its not aunt rose ive had other bad news he swallowed i cant go to oxford uncle anthony wont pay for it and mother cecilia turned me down too she did not explode immediately to his great relief however her mouth tightened into a grim line but why she said he hasnt got the money and she is sending saul saul whitehead hell never amount to anything well at least hes going to be a physician she looked him in the eye and he shrivelled i think you handled this badly she said you should have discussed it with me beforehand he had feared she would take this line how can you say i mishandled it he protested you should have let me speak to anthony first i would have softened him he still might have said no and before you approached cecilia you should have found out whether anyone else had asked her then you could have undermined saul before speaking to her how he must have a weakness you could have found out what it is and made sure it was brought to her attention then when she was feeling disillusioned you could have approached her yourself he saw the sense of what she was saying i never thought of that he said he bowed his head with controlled anger she said you have to plan these things the way earls plan battles i see that now he said not meeting her eye ill never make the same mistake again i hope not he looked at her what am i going to do im not giving up a familiar expression of determination came over her face i shall provide the money she said godwyn felt a surge of hope but he could not imagine how his mother would fulfil such a promise where will you get it he asked ill give up my house and move in with my brother edmund will he have you edmund was a generous man but he sometimes clashed with his sister i think he will hes going to be a widower soon and hell need a housekeeper not that rose was ever very effective in that role godwyn shook his head youll still need money for what edmund will give me bed and board and pay for the few small necessities i may require in return ill manage his servants and raise his daughters and you shall have the money i inherited from your father she spoke firmly but godwyn could see the bitterness of regret expressed in the twist of her mouth he knew what a sacrifice this would be for her she was proud of her independence she was one of the towns prominent women the daughter of a wealthy man and the sister of the leading wool merchant and she prized that status she loved to invite the powerful men and women of kingsbridge to dine with her and drink the best wine now she was proposing to move into her brothers house and live as a poor relation working as a kind of servant and dependent on him for everything it would be a terrible comedown its too much to sacrifice godwyn said you cant do it her face hardened and she gave a little shake of the shoulders as if preparing to take the weight of a heavy burden oh yes i can she said gwenda told her father everything she had sworn on the blood of jesus that she would keep the secret so now she was going to hell but she was more frightened of her father than of hell he began by asking her where she got skip the new puppy and she was forced to explain how hop had died and in the end the whole story came out to her surprise she was not whipped in fact pa seemed pleased he made her take him to the clearing in the forest where the killings had happened it was not easy to find the place again but she got there and they found the bodies of the two menatarms dressed in greenandyellow livery first pa opened their purses both contained twenty or thirty pennies he was even more pleased with their swords which were worth more than a few pennies he began to strip the dead men which was difficult for him with one hand so he made gwenda help him the lifeless bodies were awkwardly heavy so strange to touch pa made her take off everything they wore even their muddy hose and their soiled underdrawers he wrapped their weapons in the clothing making what looked like a bundle of rags then he and gwenda dragged the naked corpses back into the evergreen bush he was in high spirits as they walked back into kingsbridge he took her to slaughterhouse ditch a street near the river and they went into a large but dirty tavern called the white horse he bought gwenda a cup of ale to drink while he disappeared into the back of the house with the innkeeper whom he addressed as davey boy it was the second time gwenda had drunk ale in one day pa reappeared a few minutes later without the bundle they returned to the main street and found ma philemon and the baby at the bell inn next to the priory gates pa winked broadly at ma and gave her a big handful of money to hide in the babys blankets it was midafternoon and most visitors had left to return to their villages but it was too late to set out for wigleigh so the family would spend the night at the inn as pa kept saying they could afford it now although ma said nervously dont let people know youve got money gwenda felt weary she had got up early and walked a long way she lay down on a bench and quickly fell asleep she was awakened by the inn door banging open violently she looked up startled to see two menatarms walk in at first she thought they were the ghosts of the men who had been killed in the forest and she suffered a moment of sheer terror then she realized they were different men wearing the same uniform yellow on one side and green on the other the younger of the two carried a familiarlooking bundle of rags the older spoke directly to pa youre joby from wigleigh arent you gwenda instantly felt frightened again there was a tone of serious menace in the mans voice he was not posturing just determined but he gave her the impression he would do anything to get his way no pa replied lying automatically youve got the wrong man they ignored that the second man put the bundle on the table and spread it out it consisted of two yellowandgreen tunics wrapped around two swords and two daggers he looked at pa and said where did these come from ive never seen them before i swear by the cross he was stupid to deny it gwenda thought fearfully they would get the truth out of him just as he had got the truth out of her the older manatarms said davey the landlord of the white horse says he bought these from joby wigleigh his voice hardened with threat and the handful of other customers in the room all got up from their seats and quickly slipped out of the inn leaving only gwendas family joby left here a while ago pa said desperately the man nodded with his wife two children and a baby yes the man moved with sudden speed he grabbed pas tunic in a strong hand and pushed him up against the wall ma screamed and the baby began to cry gwenda saw that the mans right hand bore a padded glove covered with chainmail he drew back his arm and punched pa in the stomach ma shouted help murder philemon began to cry pas face turned white with pain and he went limp but the man held him up against the wall preventing him from falling and punched him again this time in the face blood spurted from pas nose and mouth gwenda wanted to scream and her mouth was open wide but no noise would come from her throat she thought her father was allpowerful even though he often slyly pretended to be weak or craven in order to get sympathy or turn aside anger and it terrified her to see him so helpless the innkeeper appeared in the doorway that led to the back of the house he was a big man in his thirties a plump little girl peeped from behind him whats this he said in a voice of authority the manatarms did not look at him you keep out of it he said and he punched pa in the stomach again pa vomited blood stop that said the innkeeper the manatarms said who do you think you are im paul bell and this is my house well then paul bell you mind your own business if you know whats good for you i suppose you think you can do what you like wearing that uniform there was contempt in pauls voice thats about right whose livery is it anyway the queens paul spoke over his shoulder bessie run and fetch john constable if a man is going to be murdered in my tavern i want the constable to witness it the little girl disappeared therell be no killing here the manatarms said joby has changed his mind hes decided to lead me to the place where he robbed two dead men havent you joby pa could not speak but he nodded the man let him go and he fell to his knees coughing and retching the man looked at the rest of the family and the child that witnessed the fight gwenda screamed no he nodded in satisfaction the ratfaced girl obviously gwenda ran to her mother ma said mary mother of god save my child the man grabbed gwendas arm and roughly pulled her away from her mother she cried out he said harshly shut your noise or youll get the same as your miserable father gwenda clamped her jaws together to stop herself screaming get up joby the man dragged pa to his feet pull yourself together youre going for a ride the second man picked up the clothes and the weapons as they left the inn ma called out frantically just do everything they ask the men had horses gwenda rode in front of the older man and pa was mounted in the same position on the other horse pa was helpless groaning so gwenda directed them remembering the way clearly now that she had followed it twice they made rapid progress on horseback but all the same the afternoon was darkening when they reached the clearing the younger man held on to gwenda and pa while the leader pulled the bodies of their comrades out from under the bush that thomas must be a rare fighter to kill harry and alfred together the older man mused looking at the corpses gwenda realized that these men did not know about the other children she would have confessed that she had not been alone and that ralph had killed one of the men but she was too terrified to speak hes nearly cut alfreds head off the man went on he turned and looked at gwenda was anything said about a letter i dont know she said finding her voice i had my eyes shut because i was frightened and i couldnt hear what they were saying its true id tell you if i knew if they got the letter from him in the first place he would have taken it back after he killed them anyway the man said to his comrade he looked at the trees around the clearing as if the letter might have been hanging among the dying leaves he probably has it now at the priory where we cant get at him without violating the sanctity of the monastery the second man said at least we can report exactly what happened and take the bodies home for a christian burial there was a sudden commotion pa wrenched himself out of the grasp of the second man and dashed across the clearing his captor moved to go after him but was stopped by the older manatarms let him go whats the point in killing him now gwenda began to cry quietly what about this child said the younger man they were going to murder her gwenda felt sure she could see nothing through her tears and she was sobbing too hard to plead for her life she would die and go to hell she waited for the end let her go said the older man i wasnt born to kill little girls the younger man released her and gave her a shove she stumbled and fell to the ground she got up wiped her eyes so that she could see and stumbled off go on run away the man called after her its your lucky day caris could not sleep she got up from her bed and went into mamas room papa was sitting on a stool staring at the still figure in the bed mamas eyes were closed and her face glistened in the candlelight with a film of perspiration she seemed to be hardly breathing caris took her pale hand it was terribly cold she held it between her own trying to warm it she said why did they take her blood they think illness sometimes comes from an excess of one of the humours they hope to take it away with the blood but it didnt make her better no in fact she seems worse tears came to cariss eyes why did you let them do it then priests and monks study the works of the ancient philosophers they know more than we do i dont believe that its hard to know what to believe little buttercup if i was a doctor id only do things that made people better papa was not listening he was looking more intently at mama he leaned forward and slipped his hand under the blanket to touch her chest just below her left breast caris could see the shape of his big hand under the fine wool he made a small choking sound in his throat then moved his hand and pressed down more firmly he held it there for a few moments he closed his eyes he seemed to fall slowly forward until he was on his knees beside the bed as if praying with his big forehead resting on mamas thigh and his hand still on her chest she realized he was crying it was the most frightening thing that had ever happened to her much more frightening than seeing a man killed in the forest children cried women cried weak and helpless people cried but papa never cried she felt as if the world was ending she had to get help she let mamas cold hand slip out of her own on to the blanket where it lay motionless she went back to her bedroom and shook the shoulder of the sleeping alice youve got to wake up she said at first alice would not open her eyes papa is crying caris said alice sat upright he cant be she said get up alice got out of bed caris took her older sisters hand and they went together into mamas room papa was standing up now looking down at the still face on the pillow his face wet with tears alice stared at him in shock caris whispered i told you so on the other side of the bed stood aunt petranilla papa saw the girls standing in the doorway he left his station by the bed and came to them he put one arm around each of them drew them both to him and hugged them your mama has gone to be with the angels he said quietly pray for her soul be brave girls said petranilla from now on i will be your mama caris wiped the tears from her eyes and looked up at her aunt oh no you wont she said part two to june on whit sunday in the year that merthin was twentyone a river of rain fell on kingsbridge cathedral great globules of water bounced off the slate roof streams flooded the gutters fountains gushed from the mouths of gargoyles sheets of water unfolded down the buttresses and torrents ran over the arches and down the columns soaking the statues of the saints the sky the great church and the town round about were all shades of wet greypaint whit sunday commemorated the moment when the holy spirit descended on the disciples of jesus the seventh sunday after easter it fell in may or june soon after most of englands sheep had been sheared and so it was always the first day of the kingsbridge fleece fair as merthin splashed through the downpour to the cathedral for the morning service pulling his hood forward over his brow in a vain attempt to keep his face dry he had to pass through the fair on the broad green to the west of the church hundreds of traders had set out their stalls then hastily covered them with sheets of oiled sacking or felted cloth to keep the rain off wool traders were the key figures in the fair from the small operators who collected the produce of a few scattered villagers to the big dealers such as edmund who had a warehouse full of woolsacks to sell around them clustered subsidiary stalls selling just about everything else money could buy sweet wine from the rhineland silk brocade threaded with gold from lucca glass bowls from venice ginger and pepper from places in the east that few people could even name and finally there were the workaday tradespeople who supplied visitors and stallholders with their commonplace needs bakers brewers confectioners fortunetellers and prostitutes the stallholders responded bravely to the rain joking with one another trying to create the carnival atmosphere but the weather would be bad for their profits some people had to do business rain or shine italian and flemish buyers needed soft english wool for thousands of busy looms in florence and bruges but more casual customers would stay at home a knights wife would decide she could manage without nutmeg and cinnamon a prosperous peasant would make his old coat last another winter a lawyer would judge that his mistress did not really need a gold bangle merthin was not going to buy anything he had no money he was an unpaid apprentice living with his master elfric builder he was fed at the family table he slept on the kitchen floor and he wore elfrics castoff clothes but he got no wages in the long winter evenings he carved ingenious toys that he sold for a few pennies a jewel box with secret compartments a cockerel whose tongue poked out when its tail was pressed but in summer there was no spare time for craftsmen worked until dark however his apprenticeship was almost over in less than six months on the first day of december he would become a full member of the carpenters guild of kingsbridge at the age of twentyone he could hardly wait the great west doors of the cathedral were open to admit the thousands of townspeople and visitors who would attend todays service merthin stepped inside shaking the rain off his clothes the stone floor was slippery with water and mud on a fine day the interior of the church would be bright with shafts of sunlight but today it was murky the stainedglass windows dim the congregation shrouded in dark wet clothes where did all the rain go there were no drainage ditches around the church the water thousands and thousands of gallons of it just soaked into the ground did it go on down farther and farther until it fell as rain again in hell no the cathedral was built on a slope the water travelled underground seeping down the hill from north to south the foundations of large stone buildings were designed to let water flow through for a buildup was dangerous all this rain eventually passed into the river on the southern boundary of the priory grounds merthin imagined he could feel the underground rush of the water its drumming vibration transmitted through the foundations and the tiled floor and sensed by the soles of his feet a small black dog scampered up to him wagging its tail and greeted him joyfully hello scrap he said and patted her he looked up to see the dogs mistress caris and his heart skipped a beat she wore a cloak of bright scarlet that she had inherited from her mother it was the only splash of colour in the gloom merthin smiled broadly happy to see her it was hard to say what made her so beautiful she had a small round face with neat regular features midbrown hair and green eyes flecked with gold she was not so different from a hundred other kingsbridge girls but she wore her hat at a jaunty angle there was a mocking intelligence in her eyes and she looked at him with a mischievous grin that promised vague but tantalizing delights he had known her for ten years but it was only in the last few months that he had realized he loved her she drew him behind a pillar and kissed him on the mouth the tip of her tongue running lightly across his lips they kissed every chance they got in church in the market place when they met on the street and best of all when he was at her house and they found themselves alone he lived for those moments he thought about kissing her before he went to sleep and again as soon as he woke up he visited her house two or three times a week her father edmund liked him though her aunt petranilla did not a convivial man edmund often invited merthin to stay for supper and merthin accepted gratefully knowing it would be a better meal than he would get at elfrics house he and caris would play chess or draughts or just sit talking he liked to watch her while she told a story or explained something her hands drawing pictures in the air her face expressing amusement or astonishment acting every part in a pageant but most of the time he was waiting for those moments when he could steal a kiss he glanced around the church no one was looking their way he slipped his hand inside her coat and touched her through the soft linen of her dress her body was warm he held her breast in his palm small and round he loved the way her flesh yielded to the press of his fingertips he had never seen her naked but he knew her breasts intimately in his dreams they went farther then they were alone somewhere a clearing in the woods or the big bedchamber of a castle and they were both naked but strangely his dreams always ended a moment too soon just before he entered her and he would wake up frustrated one day he would think one day they had not yet spoken about marriage apprentices could not marry so he had to wait caris must surely have asked herself what they were going to do when he finished his term but she had not voiced those thoughts she seemed content to take life one day at a time and he had a superstitious fear of talking about their future together it was said that pilgrims should not spend too much time planning their journey for they might learn of so many hazards that they would decide not to go a nun walked past and merthin withdrew his hand guiltily from cariss bosom but the nun did not notice them people did all sorts of things in the vast space of the cathedral last year merthin had seen a couple having sexual congress up against the wall of the south aisle in the darkness of the christmas eve service although they had been thrown out for it he wondered if he and caris could stay here throughout the service dallying discreetly but she had other ideas lets go to the front she said she took his hand and led him through the crowd he knew many of the people there though not all kingsbridge was one of the larger cities in england with about seven thousand inhabitants and no one knew everybody he followed caris to the crossing where the nave met the transepts there they came up against a wooden barrier blocking entrance to the eastern end or chancel which was reserved for clergy merthin found himself standing next to buonaventura caroli the most important of the italian merchants a heavyset man in a richly embroidered coat of thick wool cloth he came originally from florence which he said was the greatest city in the christian world more than ten times the size of kingsbridge but he now lived in london managing the large business his family had with english wool producers the carolis were so rich they loaned money to kings but buonaventura was amiable and unpretentious though people said that in business he could be implacably hard caris greeted the man in a casually familiar way he was staying at her house he gave merthin a friendly nod even though he must have guessed from merthins age and handmedown clothing that he was a mere apprentice buonaventura was looking at the architecture i have been coming to kingsbridge for five years he said making idle conversation but until today i have never noticed that the windows of the transepts are much bigger than those in the rest of the church he spoke french with an admixture of words from the dialect of the italian region of tuscany merthin had no trouble understanding he had grown up like most sons of english knights speaking norman french to his parents and english to his playmates and he could guess the meanings of many italian words because he had learned latin in the monks school i can tell you why the windows are like that he said buonaventura raised his eyebrows surprised that an apprentice should claim such knowledge the church was built two hundred years ago when these narrow lancet windows in the nave and chancel were a revolutionary new design merthin went on then a hundred years later the bishop wanted a taller tower and he rebuilt the transepts at the same time putting in the bigger windows that had by then come into fashion buonaventura was impressed and how do you happen to know this in the monastery library there is a history of the priory called timothys book that tells all about the building of the cathedral most of it was written in the time of the great prior philip but later writers have added to it i read it as a boy at the monks school buonaventura looked hard at merthin for a moment as if memorizing his face then he said casually its a fine building are the buildings very different in italy merthin was fascinated by talk of foreign countries their life in general and their architecture in particular buonaventura looked thoughtful i believe the principles of building are the same everywhere but in england i have never seen domes whats a dome a round roof like half a ball merthin was astonished i never heard of such a thing how is it built buonaventura laughed young man i am a wool merchant i can tell whether a fleece comes from a cotswold sheep or a lincoln sheep just by rubbing the wool between my finger and thumb but i dont know how a henhouse is built let alone a dome merthins master elfric arrived he was a prosperous man and he wore expensive clothes but they always looked as if they belonged to someone else an habitual sycophant he ignored caris and merthin but made a deep bow to buonaventura and said honoured to have you in our city once again sir merthin turned away how many languages do you think there are caris said to him she was always saying crazy things five merthin replied without thinking no be serious she said theres english and french and latin thats three then the florentines and the venetians speak differently though they have words in common youre right he said entering into the game thats five already then theres flemish few people could make out the tongue of the traders who came to kingsbridge from the weaving towns of flanders ypres bruges ghent and danish the arabs have their own language and when they write they dont even use the same letters as we do and mother cecilia told me that all the barbarians have their own tongues that no one even knows how to write down scots welsh irish and probably others that makes eleven and there might be people we havent even heard of merthin grinned caris was the only person he could do this with among their friends of the same age no one understood the thrill of imagining strange people and different ways of life she would ask a random question what is it like to live at the edge of the world are the priests wrong about god how do you know youre not dreaming right now and they would be off on a speculative voyage competing to come up with the most outlandish notions the roar of conversation in the church suddenly quietened and merthin saw that the monks and nuns were seating themselves the choirmaster blind carlus came in last although he could not see he walked without assistance in the church and the monastic buildings moving slowly but as confident as a sighted man familiar with every pillar and flagstone now he sang a note in his rich baritone and the choir began a hymn merthin was quietly sceptical about the clergy priests had power that was not always matched by their knowledge rather like his employer elfric however he liked going to church the services induced a kind of trance in him the music the architecture and the latin incantations enchanted him and he felt as if he were asleep with his eyes open once again he had the fanciful sensation that he could feel the rainwater flowing in torrents far beneath his feet his gaze roamed over the three levels of the nave arcade gallery and clerestory he knew that the columns were made by placing one stone on top of another but they gave a different impression at least at first glance the stone blocks were carved so that each column looked like a bundle of shafts he traced the rise of one of the four giant piers of the crossing from the huge square foot on which it stood up to where one shaft branched north to form an arch across the side aisle on up to the tribune level where another shaft branched west to form the arcade of the gallery on up to the westward springing of a clerestory arch until the last remaining shafts separated like a spray of flowers and became the curving ribs of the ceiling vault far above from the central boss at the highest point of the vault he followed a rib all the way down again to the matching pier on the opposite corner of the crossing as he did so something odd happened his vision seemed momentarily to blur and it looked as if the east side of the transept moved there was a low rumbling sound so deep it was almost inaudible and a tremor underfoot as if a tree had fallen nearby the singing faltered in the chancel a crack appeared in the south wall right next to the pier merthin had been looking at he found himself turning towards caris out of the corner of his eye he saw masonry falling in the choir and the crossing then there was nothing but noise women screaming men shouting and the deafening crash of huge stones hitting the floor it lasted a long moment when silence descended merthin found he was holding caris his left arm around her shoulders pressing her to him his right arm protectively covering her head his body interposed between her and the place where a part of the great church lay in ruins it was obviously a miracle that no one died the worst of the damage was in the south aisle of the chancel which had been empty of people during the service the congregation was not admitted to the chancel and the clergy had all been in the central part called the choir several monks had had narrow escapes which only heightened the talk of miracles and others had bad cuts and bruises from flying chips of stone the congregation suffered no more than a few scratches evidently they had all been supernaturally protected by st adolphus whose bones were preserved under the high altar and whose deeds included many instances of curing the sick and saving people from death however it was generally agreed that god had sent the people of kingsbridge a warning what he was warning them about was not yet clear an hour later four men were inspecting the damage brother godwyn the cousin of caris was the sacrist responsible for the church and all its treasures under him as matricularius in charge of building operations and repairs was brother thomas who had been sir thomas langley ten years ago the contract for cathedral maintenance was held by elfric a carpenter by training and a general builder by trade and merthin tagged along as elfrics apprentice the east end of the church was divided by pillars into four sections called bays the collapse had affected the two bays nearest the crossing the stone vaulting over the south aisle was destroyed completely in the first bay and partially in the second there were cracks in the tribune gallery and stone mullions had fallen from the windows of the clerestory elfric said some weakness in the mortar allowed the vault to crumble and that in turn caused the cracks at higher levels that did not sound right to merthin but he lacked an alternative explanation merthin hated his master he had first been apprenticed to elfrics father joachim a builder of wide experience who had worked on churches and bridges in london and paris the old man had delighted in explaining to merthin the lore of the masons what they called their mysteries which were mostly arithmetical formulas for building such as the ratio between the height of a building and the depth of its foundations merthin liked numbers and lapped up everything joachim could teach him then joachim died and elfric took over elfric believed the main thing an apprentice had to learn was obedience merthin found this difficult to accept and elfric punished him with short rations thin clothing and outdoor work in frosty weather to make matters worse elfrics chubby daughter griselda the same age as merthin was always well fed and warmly dressed three years ago elfrics wife had died and he had married alice the older sister of caris people thought alice was the prettier sister and it was true that she had more regular features but she lacked cariss captivating ways and merthin found her dull alice had always seemed to like merthin almost as much as her sister did and so he had hoped she would make elfric treat him better but the reverse happened alice seemed to think it was her wifely duty to join with elfric in tormenting him merthin knew that many other apprentices suffered in the same way and they all put up with it because apprenticeship was the only way into a wellpaid trade the craft guilds efficiently kept out upstarts no one could do business in a town without belonging to a guild even a priest a monk or a woman who wanted to deal in wool or brew ale for sale would have to get into a guild and outside the towns there was little business to be done peasants built their own houses and sewed their own shirts at the end of the apprenticeship most boys would remain with the master working as journeymen for a wage a few would end up partners taking over the enterprise when the old man died that would not be merthins destiny he hated elfric too much he would leave the moment he could lets look at it from above said godwyn they walked towards the east end elfric said its good to see you back from oxford brother godwyn but you must miss the company of all those learned people godwyn nodded the masters are truly astonishing and the other students they must be remarkable young men i imagine though we hear tales of bad behaviour too godwyn looked rueful im afraid some of those stories are true when a young priest or monk is away from home for the first time he may suffer temptation still were fortunate to have the benefit of universitytrained men here in kingsbridge very kind of you to say so oh but its true merthin wanted to say shut up for pitys sake but this was elfrics way he was a poor craftsman his work inaccurate and his judgement shaky but he knew how to ingratiate himself merthin had watched him do it time and again for elfric could be as charming to people from whom he wanted something as he could be rude to those who had nothing he needed merthin was more surprised at godwyn how could an intelligent and educated man fail to see through elfric perhaps it was less obvious to the person who was the object of the compliments godwyn opened a small door and led the way up a narrow spiral staircase concealed in the wall merthin felt excited he loved to enter the hidden passageways of the cathedral he was also curious about the dramatic collapse and eager to figure out its cause the aisles were singlestorey structures that stuck out either side of the main body of the church they had ribvaulted stone ceilings above the vault a leanto roof rose from the outer edge of the aisle up to the base of the clerestory under that sloping roof was a triangular void its floor the hidden side or extrados of the aisles vaulted ceiling the four men climbed into this void to look at the damage from above it was lit by window openings into the interior of the church and thomas had had the foresight to bring an oil lamp the first thing merthin noticed was that the vaults viewed from above were not exactly the same in each bay the easternmost formed a slightly flatter curve than its neighbour and the next one partly destroyed looked as though it was different again they walked along the extrados staying close to the edge where the vault was strongest until they were as near as they dared go to the collapsed portion the vault was constructed in the same way as the rest of the church of stones mortared together except that ceiling stones were very thin and light the vault was almost vertical at its springing but as it rose it leaned inwards until it met the stonework coming up from the opposite edge elfric said well the first thing to do is obviously to rebuild the vaulting over the first two bays of the aisle thomas said its a long time since anyone in kingsbridge built ribvaulting he turned to merthin could you make the formwork merthin knew what he meant at the edge of the vault where the masonry was almost upright the stones would stay in place by their own weight but higher up as the curve turned towards the horizontal some support was needed to keep everything in place while the mortar dried the obvious method was to make a wooden frame called formwork or centering and lay the stones on top of that it was a challenging job for a carpenter for the curves had to be just right thomas knew the quality of merthins craftsmanship having closely supervised the work merthin and elfric carried out at the cathedral over several years however it was tactless of thomas to address the apprentice rather than the boss and elfric reacted quickly under my supervision he can do it yes he said i can make the formwork merthin said already thinking about how the frame would be supported by the scaffolding and the platform on which the masons would have to stand but these vaults were not built with formwork dont talk nonsense boy elfric said of course they were you know nothing about it merthin knew it was unwise to argue with his employer on the other hand in six months he would be competing with elfric for work and he needed people such as brother godwyn to believe in his competence also he was stung by the scorn in elfrics voice and he felt an irresistible desire to prove his master wrong look at the extrados he said indignantly having finished one bay surely the masons would have reused the same formwork for the next in which case all the vaults would have the same curve but in fact theyre all different obviously they didnt reuse their formwork elfric said irritably why wouldnt they merthin persisted they must have wanted to save on timber not to mention the wages of skilled carpenters anyway its not possible to build vaulting without formwork yes it is merthin said theres a method thats enough elfric said youre here to learn not teach godwyn put in just a minute elfric if the boy is right it could save the priory a lot of money he looked at merthin what were you going to say merthin was half wishing he had not raised this subject there would be hell to pay later but he was committed now if he backed off they would think he did not know what he was talking about its described in a book in the monastery library and its very simple he said as each stone is laid a rope is draped over it one end of the rope is tied to the wall the other weighted with a lump of wood the rope forms a right angle over the edge of the stone and keeps it from slipping off its bed of mortar and falling to the ground there was a moment of silence as they all concentrated trying to visualize the arrangements then thomas nodded it could work he said elfric looked furious godwyn was intrigued what book is this its called timothys book merthin told him i know of it but ive never studied it obviously i should godwyn addressed the others have we seen enough elfric and thomas nodded as the four men left the roof space elfric muttered to merthin do you realize youve just talked yourself out of several weeks work you wont do that when youre your own master ill bet merthin had not thought of that elfric was right by proving that formwork was unnecessary he had also done himself out of a job but there was something badly wrong with elfrics way of thinking it was unfair to allow someone to spend money unnecessarily just to keep yourself in work merthin did not want to live by cheating people they went down the spiral staircase into the chancel elfric said to godwyn ill come to you tomorrow with a price for the work good elfric turned to merthin you stay here and count the stones in an aisle vault bring me the answer at home yes elfric and godwyn left but thomas lingered i got you into trouble he said you were trying to boost me the monk shrugged and made a whatcanyoudo gesture with his right arm his left arm had been amputated at the elbow ten years ago after infection set in to the wound he received in the fight merthin had witnessed merthin hardly ever thought about that strange scene in the forest he had become used to thomas in a monks robe but he recalled it now the menatarms the children hiding in the bush the bow and arrow the buried letter thomas was always kind to him and he guessed it was because of what happened that day ive never told anyone about that letter he said quietly i know thomas replied if you had youd be dead most large towns were run by a guild merchant an organization of the leading citizens under the guild merchant were numerous craft guilds each dedicated to a particular trade masons carpenters leather tanners weavers tailors then there were the parish guilds small groups centred on local churches formed to raise money for priestly robes and sacred ornaments and for the support of widows and orphans cathedral towns were different kingsbridge like st albans and bury st edmunds was ruled by the monastery which owned almost all the land in and around the town the priors had always refused permission for a guild merchant however the most important craftsmen and traders belonged to the parish guild of st adolphus no doubt this had started out in the distant past as a pious group that raised money for the cathedral but it was now the most important organization in town it made rules for the conduct of business and elected an alderman and six wardens to enforce them in the guild hall were kept the measures that standardized the weight of a woolsack the width of a bolt of cloth and the volume of a bushel for all kingsbridge trade nevertheless the merchants could not hold courts and dispense justice the way they did in borough towns the kingsbridge prior retained those powers for himself on the afternoon of whit sunday the parish guild gave a banquet at the guild hall for the most important visiting buyers edmund wooler was the alderman and caris went with him to be hostess so merthin had to amuse himself without her fortunately elfric and alice were also at the banquet so he could sit in the kitchen listening to the rain and thinking the weather was not cold but there was a small fire for cooking and its red glow was cheerful he could hear elfrics daughter griselda moving about upstairs it was a fine house although smaller than edmunds there was just a hall and a kitchen downstairs the staircase led to an open landing where griselda slept and a closed bedroom for the master and his wife merthin slept in the kitchen there had been a time three or four years ago when merthin had been tormented at night by fantasies of climbing the stairs and slipping under the blankets next to griseldas warm plump body but she considered herself superior to him treating him like a servant and she had never given him the least encouragement sitting on a bench merthin looked into the fire and visualized the wooden scaffolding he would build for the masons who would reconstruct the collapsed vaulting in the cathedral wood was expensive and long tree trunks were rare the owners of woodland usually yielded to the temptation of selling the timber before it was fully mature so builders tried to minimize the amount of scaffolding rather than build it up from floor level they saved timber by suspending it from the existing walls while he was thinking griselda came into the kitchen and took a cup of ale from the barrel would you like some she said merthin accepted amazed by her courtesy she surprised him again by sitting on a stool opposite him to drink griseldas paramour thurstan had disappeared three weeks ago no doubt she now felt lonely which would be why she wanted merthins company the drink warmed his stomach and relaxed him searching for something to say he asked what happened to thurstan she tossed her head like a frisky mare i told him i didnt want to marry him why not hes too young for me that did not sound right to merthin thurstan was seventeen griselda twenty but griselda was not notably mature more likely he thought thurstan was too lowclass he had arrived in kingsbridge from nowhere a couple of years ago and had worked as an unskilled labourer for several of the towns craftsmen he had probably got bored with griselda or with kingsbridge and simply moved on where did he go i dont know and i dont care i should marry someone my own age someone with a sense of responsibility perhaps a man who could take over my fathers enterprise one day it occurred to merthin that she might mean him surely not he thought shes always looked down on me then she got up from her stool and came and sat on the bench beside him my father is spiteful to you she said ive always thought that merthin was astonished well its taken you long enough to say so ive been living here six and a half years its hard for me to go against my family why is he so vile to me anyway because you think you know better than him and you cant hide it maybe i do know better see what i mean he laughed it was the first time she had ever made him laugh she shifted closer on the bench so that her thigh in the woollen dress was pressed against his he was in his worn linen shirt which came to midthigh with the undershorts that all men wore but he could feel the warmth of her body through their clothes what had brought this on he looked incredulously at her she had glossy dark hair and brown eyes her face was attractive in a fleshy way she had a nice mouth for kissing she said i like being indoors in a rainstorm it feels cosy he felt himself becoming aroused and looked away from her what would caris think he asked himself if she walked in here now he tried to quell his desire but that only made it worse he looked back at griselda her lips were moist and slightly parted she leaned towards him he kissed her immediately she thrust her tongue into his mouth it was a sudden shocking intimacy that he found thrilling and he responded in the same way this was not like kissing caris that thought arrested him he tore himself away from griselda and stood up she said whats the matter he did not want to tell her the truth so he said you never seemed to like me she looked annoyed ive told you i had to side with my father youve changed very suddenly she stood up and moved towards him he stepped away until his back was to the wall she took his hand and pressed it to her bosom her breasts were round and heavy and he could not resist the temptation to feel them she said have you ever done it the real thing with a girl he found he could not speak but he nodded have you thought about doing it with me yes he managed you can do it to me now if you like while theyre out we can go upstairs and lie on my bed no she pressed her body to his kissing you has made me go all hot and slippery inside he pushed her away the shove was rougher than he intended and she fell backwards landing on her wellcushioned bottom leave me alone he said he was not sure he meant it but she took him at his word go to hell then she swore she got to her feet and stomped upstairs he stayed where he was panting now that he had rejected her he regretted it apprentices were not very attractive to young women who did not want to be forced to wait years before marrying all the same merthin had courted several kingsbridge girls one kate brown had been sufficiently fond of him to let him go all the way one warm summer afternoon a year ago in her fathers orchard then her father had died suddenly and her mother had taken the family to live in portsmouth it was the only time merthin had lain with a woman was he mad to turn down griseldas offer he told himself he had had a lucky escape griselda was a meanspirited girl who did not really like him he should be proud of having resisted temptation he had not followed his instinct like a dumb beast he had made a decision like a man then griselda started to cry her weeping was not loud but all the same he could hear everything he went to the back door like every house in town elfrics had a long narrow strip of land at the back with a privy and a rubbish tip most householders kept chickens and a pig and grew vegetables and fruits but elfrics yard was used to store stacks of lumber and stones coils of rope buckets and barrows and ladders merthin stared at the rain falling on the yard but griseldas sobbing still reached his ears he decided to leave the house and got as far as the front door but then he could not think where to go at cariss house there was only petranilla who would not welcome him he thought of going to his parents but they were the last people he wanted to see when he was in this state he could have talked to his brother but ralph was not due to arrive in kingsbridge until later in the week besides he realized he could not leave the house without a coat not because of the rain he did not mind getting wet but because of the bulge in front of his clothing that would not subside he tried to think of caris she would be sipping wine he thought and eating roast beef and wheat bread he asked himself what she was wearing her best dress was a soft pinkishred with a squarecut neckline that showed off the pale skin of her slender neck but griseldas crying kept intruding on his thoughts he wanted to comfort her to tell her he was sorry to make her feel spurned and explain to her that she was an attractive person but they were not right for one another he sat down then stood up again it was hard to listen to a woman in distress he could not think about scaffolding while that sound filled the house cant stay cant leave cant sit still he went upstairs she was lying face down on the strawfilled palliasse that was her bed her dress was rucked up around her chubby thighs the skin on the back of her legs was very white and looked soft im sorry he said go away dont cry i hate you he knelt down and patted her back i cant sit in the kitchen and listen to you crying she rolled over and looked at him her face wet with tears im ugly and fat and you hate me i dont hate you he wiped her wet cheeks with the back of his hand she took his wrist and drew him to her dont you truly no but she put her hand behind his head pulled him down and kissed him he groaned more aroused than ever he lay beside her on the mattress i will leave her in a moment he told himself ill just comfort her a little more then ill get up and go down the stairs she took his hand and pushed it up her skirt placing it between her legs he felt the wiry hair the soft skin beneath and the moist divide and he knew he was lost he stroked her roughly his finger slipping inside he felt as if he would burst i cant stop he said quickly she said panting she pulled up his shirt and pushed down his drawers and he rolled on to her he felt himself losing control as she guided him inside her the remorse hit him before it was over oh no he said the explosion began with his first thrust and in an instant it was finished he slumped on top of her his eyes closed oh god he said i wish i was dead buonaventura caroli made his shock announcement at breakfast on monday the day after the big banquet at the guild hall caris felt a little unwell as she took her seat at the oak table in the dining hall of her fathers house she had a headache and a touch of nausea she ate a small dish of warm breadandmilk to settle her stomach recalling that she had enjoyed the wine at the banquet she wondered whether she had drunk too much of it was this the morningafter feeling that men and boys joked about when they boasted how much strong drink they could take father and buonaventura were eating cold mutton and aunt petranilla was telling a story when i was fifteen i was betrothed to a nephew of the earl of shiring she said it was considered a good match his father was a knight of the middling sort and mine a wealthy wool merchant then the earl and his only son both died in scotland at the battle of loudon hill my fiance roland became the earl and broke off the engagement he is still the earl today if i had married roland before the battle i would now be the countess of shiring she dipped toast in her ale perhaps it was not the will of god said buonaventura he threw a bone to scrap who pounced on it as if she had not seen food for a week then he said to papa my friend there is something i should tell you before we begin the days business caris felt from his tone of voice that he had bad news and her father must have had the same intuition for he said this sounds ominous our trade has been shrinking for the last few years buonaventura went on each year my family sells a little less cloth each year we buy a little less wool from england business is always like that said edmund it goes up it goes down no one knows why but now your king has interfered it was true edward iii had seen the money being made in wool and had decided that more of it must go to the crown he had introduced a new tax of one pound per woolsack a sack was standardized at pounds weight and sold for about four pounds in money so the extra tax was a quarter of the value of the wool a huge slice buonaventura went on what is worse he has made it difficult to export wool from england i have had to pay large bribes the ban on exports will be lifted shortly edmund said the merchants of the wool company in london are negotiating with royal officials i hope you are right buonaventura said but with things as they are my family feels i no longer need to visit two separate wool fairs in this part of the country quite right said edmund come here and forget about the shiring fair the town of shiring was two days travel from kingsbridge it was about the same size and while it did not have a cathedral or a priory it boasted the sheriffs castle and the county court it held a rival wool fair once a year im afraid i cant find the range of wool here you see the kingsbridge fleece fair seems to be declining more and more sellers go to shiring their fair offers a greater variety of types and qualities caris was dismayed this could be disastrous for her father she put in why would sellers prefer shiring buonaventura shrugged the guild merchant there has made the fair attractive theres no long queue to enter the city gate the dealers can hire tents and booths theres a wool exchange building where everyone can do business when it rains like this we could do all that she said her father snorted if only why not papa shiring is an independent borough with a royal charter the merchant guild there has the power to organize things for the benefit of the wool merchants kingsbridge belongs to the priory petranilla put in for the glory of god no doubt edmund said but our parish guild cant do anything without the priorys approval and priors are cautious and conservative people my brother being no exception the upshot is that most improvement plans get rejected buonaventura went on because of my familys long association with you edmund and your father before you we have continued to come to kingsbridge but in hard times we cant afford to be sentimental then let me ask you a small favour for the sake of that long association edmund said dont make a final decision yet keep an open mind that was clever caris thought she was struck as she often was by how shrewd her father could be in a negotiation he did not argue that buonaventura should reverse his decision for that would just make him dig his heels in the italian was much more likely to agree not to make the decision final that committed him to nothing but left the door open buonaventura found it hard to refuse all right but to what end i want the chance to improve the fair and especially that bridge edmund replied if we could offer better facilities here at kingsbridge than they have at shiring and attract more sellers you would continue to visit us wouldnt you of course then thats what well have to do he stood up ill go and see my brother now caris come with me well show him the queue at the bridge no wait caris go and fetch your clever young builder merthin we might need his expertise hell be working petranilla said just tell his master that the alderman of the parish guild wants the boy petranilla was proud that her brother was alderman and mentioned it at every opportunity but she was right elfric would have to release merthin ill go and find him caris said she put on a cape with a hood and went out it was still raining though not as heavily as yesterday elfric like most of the leading citizens lived on the main street that ran from the bridge up to the priory gates the broad street was crowded with carts and people heading for the fair splashing through puddles and streamlets of rain she was eager to see merthin as always she had liked him ever since all hallows day ten years ago when he had appeared at archery practice with his homemade bow he was clever and funny like her he knew that the world was a bigger and more fascinating place than most kingsbridge citizens could conceive but six months ago they had discovered something that was even more fun than being friends caris had kissed boys before merthin though not often she had never really seen the point with him it was different exciting and sexy he had an impish streak that made everything he did seem mildly wicked she liked it when he touched her body too she wanted to do more but she tried not to think about that more meant marriage and a wife had to be subordinate to her husband who was her master and caris hated that idea fortunately she was not forced to think about it yet for merthin could not marry until his apprenticeship was over and that was half a year away she reached elfrics house and stepped inside her sister alice was in the front room at the table with her stepdaughter griselda they were eating bread with honey alice had changed in the three years since she had married elfric her nature had always been harsh like petranillas and under the influence of her husband she had become more suspicious resentful and ungenerous but she was pleasant enough today sit down sister she said the bread is fresh this morning i cant im looking for merthin alice looked disapproving so early father wants him caris went through the kitchen to the back door and looked into the yard rain fell on a dismal landscape of builders junk one of elfrics labourers was putting wet stones into a barrow there was no sign of merthin she went back inside alice said hes probably at the cathedral hes been making a door caris recalled that merthin had mentioned this the door in the north porch had rotted and merthin was working on a replacement griselda added hes been carving virgins she grinned then put more breadandhoney into her mouth caris knew this too the old door was decorated with carvings illustrating the story jesus told on the mount of olives about the wise and foolish virgins and merthin had to copy it but there was something unpleasant about griseldas grin caris thought almost as if she were laughing at caris for being a virgin herself ill try the cathedral caris said and with a perfunctory wave she left she climbed the main street and entered the cathedral close as she threaded her way through the market stalls it seemed to her that a dismal air hung over the fair was she imagining it because of what buonaventura had said she thought not when she recalled the fleece fairs of her childhood it seemed to her that they had been busier and more crowded in those days the priory precincts had not been large enough to contain the fair and the streets all around had been obstructed by unlicensed stalls often just a small table covered with trinkets plus hawkers with trays jugglers fortune tellers musicians and itinerant friars calling sinners to redemption now it seemed to her there might have been room for a few more stalls within the precincts buonaventura must be right she said to herself the fair is shrinking a trader gave her a strange look and she realized she had spoken her thoughts out loud it was a bad habit people thought she was talking to spirits she had taught herself not to do it but she sometimes forgot especially when she was anxious she walked around the great church to the north side merthin was working in the porch a roomy space where people often held meetings he had the door standing upright in a stout wooden frame that held it still while he carved behind the new work the old door was still in place in the archway cracked and crumbling merthin stood with his back to her so that the light fell over his shoulders on to the wood in front of him he did not see her and the sound of the rain drowned her footsteps so she was able to study him for a few moments unnoticed he was a small man not much taller than she he had a large intelligent head on a wiry body his small hands moved deftly across the carving shaving fine curls of wood with a sharp knife as he shaped the images he had white skin and a lot of bushy red hair hes not very handsome alice had said with a twist of her lip when caris admitted she had fallen in love with him it was true that merthin did not have the dashing good looks of his brother ralph but caris thought his face was quite marvellous irregular and quirky and wise and full of laughter just as he was hello she said and he jumped she laughed its not like you to be so easily spooked you startled me he hesitated then kissed her he seemed a little awkward but that sometimes happened when he was concentrating on his work she looked at the carving there were five virgins on each side of the door the wise ones feasting at the wedding and the foolish ones outside holding their lamps upside down to show that they were empty of oil merthin had copied the design of the old door but with subtle changes the virgins stood in rows five on one side and five on the other like the arches in the cathedral but in the new door they were not exactly alike merthin had given each girl a sign of individuality one was pretty another had curly hair one wept another closed one eye in a mischievous wink he had made them real and the scene on the old door now looked stiff and lifeless by comparison its wonderful caris said but i wonder what the monks will think brother thomas likes it merthin replied what about prior anthony he hasnt seen it but hell accept it he wont want to pay twice that was true caris thought her uncle anthony was unadventurous but parsimonious too the mention of the prior reminded her of her errand my father wants you to meet him and the prior at the bridge did he say why i think hes going to ask anthony to build a new bridge merthin put his tools into a leather satchel and quickly swept the floor brushing sawdust and wood shavings out of the porch then he and caris walked in the rain through the fair and down the main street to the wooden bridge caris told him what buonaventura had said at the breakfast table merthin felt as she did that recent fairs had not been as bustling as those he remembered from childhood despite that there was a long queue of people and carts waiting to get into kingsbridge at the near end of the bridge was a small gatehouse where a monk sat taking a fee of one penny from every trader who entered the city with goods for sale the bridge was narrow so it was not possible for anyone to jump the queue and in consequence people who did not need to pay residents of the town mainly also had to stand in line in addition some of the boards that formed the surface were twisted and broken so carts had to move slowly as they crossed the result was that the queue stretched away along the road between the suburban hovels and disappeared into the rain the bridge was also too short once no doubt both its ends had given on to dry land but either the river had widened or more likely the passage of carts and people over decades and centuries had flattened the banks so that now people had to wade across muddy beaches on both sides caris saw that merthin was studying its structure she knew that look in his eyes he was thinking about how it stayed upright she often caught him staring at something in that way usually in the cathedral but sometimes in front of a house or even something natural a thorn tree in blossom or a sparrowhawk hovering he became very still his gaze bright and sharp as if he were shining a light into a murky place trying to make out what was there if she asked him he told her he was trying to see the insides of things she followed his gaze and strained to imagine what he perceived in the old bridge it was sixty yards from end to end the longest bridge she had ever seen the roadbed was supported by massive oak piers in two rows like the pillars that marched either side of the nave of the cathedral there were five pairs of piers the end ones where the water was shallow were quite short but the three central pairs stood fifteen feet above the water line each pier consisted of four oak beams in a cluster held together by plank braces legend said that the king had given kingsbridge priory the twentyfour best oak trees in england to build the three central pairs of piers the tops were linked by beams in two parallel lines shorter beams crossed from one line to the other forming the roadbed and longitudinal planks had been laid on top to form the road surface on each side was a wooden railing that served as a flimsy parapet every couple of years a drunk peasant would drive a cart through the rail and kill himself and his horse in the river what are you looking at caris asked merthin the cracks i dont see any the timbers on either side of the central pier are splitting you can see where elfric has reinforced them with iron braces now that he pointed them out caris could see the flat metal strips nailed across the cracks you look worried she said to him i dont know why the timbers cracked in the first place does it matter of course it does he was not very talkative this morning she was about to ask him why when he said here comes your father she looked along the street the two brothers made an odd pair tall anthony fastidiously held up the skirts of his monkish robe and stepped gingerly around the puddles wearing an expression of distaste on his pale indoor face edmund more vigorous despite being the elder had a red face and a long untidy grey beard and he walked carelessly dragging his withered leg through the mud speaking argumentatively and gesturing extravagantly with both arms when caris saw her father at a distance the way a stranger might see him she always felt a surge of love the dispute was in full swing when they got to the bridge and they continued without pause look at that queue edmund shouted hundreds of people not trading at the fair because they havent got there yet and you can be sure half of them will meet a buyer or seller while waiting and conduct their business right then and there then go home without even entering the city thats forestalling and its against the law said anthony you could go and tell them that if you could get across the bridge but you cant because its too narrow listen anthony if the italians pull out the fleece fair will never be the same again your prosperity and mine are based on the fair we must not just let it go we cant force buonaventura to do business here but we can make our fair more attractive than shirings we need to announce a big symbolic project right now this week something to convince them all that the fleece fair isnt finished we have to tell them were going to tear down this old bridge and build a new one twice as wide without warning he turned to merthin how long would it take young lad merthin looked startled but he answered finding the trees would be the hard part you need very long timbers well seasoned then the piers have to be driven into the river bed thats tricky because youre working in running water after that its just carpentry you could finish it by christmas anthony said theres no certainty the caroli family will change its plans if we build a new bridge they will edmund said forcefully i guarantee it anyway i cant afford to build a bridge i dont have the money you cant afford not to build a bridge edmund shouted youll ruin yourself as well as the town its out of the question i dont even know where im going to get the money for the repairs in the south aisle so what will you do trust in god those who trust in god and sow a seed may reap a harvest but youre not sowing the seed anthony got irritated i know this is difficult for you to understand edmund but kingsbridge priory is not a commercial enterprise were here to worship god not to make money you wont worship god for long if youve nothing to eat god will provide edmunds red face flushed with anger turning a purplish colour when you were a boy our fathers business fed you and clothed you and paid for your education since youve been a monk the citizens of this town and the peasants of the surrounding countryside have kept you alive by paying you rents tithes charges for market stalls bridge tolls and a dozen other different fees all your life youve lived like a flea on the backs of hardworking people and now you have the nerve to tell us that god provides thats perilously close to blasphemy dont forget that ive known you since you were born anthony you always had a talent for avoiding work edmunds voice so often raised in a shout now dropped a sign caris knew that he was really furious when it was time to empty out the privy you went off to bed so that you would be rested for school the next day fathers gift to god you always had the best of everything and never lifted your hand to earn it strengthening food the warmest bedroom the best clothes i was the only boy who wore his younger brothers castoff outfits and you never let me forget it caris had been waiting for the opportunity to halt the flow and now she took it there ought to be a way around this they both looked at her surprised to be interrupted she went on for example couldnt the townspeople build a bridge dont be ridiculous said anthony the town belongs to the priory a servant doesnt furnish his masters house but if your permission was sought you would have no reason to refuse it anthony did not immediately contradict that which was encouraging but edmund was shaking his head i dont think i could persuade them to put up the money he said it would be in their interests long term of course but people are very reluctant to think in the long term when being asked to part with their money ha said anthony yet you expect me to think long term you deal with eternal life dont you edmund shot back you of all people ought to be able to see beyond the end of next week besides you get a penny toll from everyone who crosses the bridge youd get your money back and youd benefit from the improvement in business caris said but uncle anthony is a spiritual leader and he feels its not his role but he owns the town papa protested hes the only one who can do it then he gave her an inquiring look realizing that she would not have contradicted him without a reason what are you thinking suppose the townspeople built a bridge and were repaid out of the penny tolls edmund opened his mouth to express an objection but could not think of one caris looked at anthony anthony said when the priory was new its only income came from that bridge i cant give it away but think what you would gain if the fleece fair and the weekly market began to return to their former size not just the bridge tolls but stallholders fees the percentage you take of all transactions at the fair and gifts to the cathedral too edmund added and the profits on your own sales wool grain hides books statues of the saints anthony said you planned this didnt you he pointed an accusing finger at his older brother you told your daughter what to say and the lad he would never think up a scheme like this and shes just a woman it has your mark on it this is all a plot to cheat me of my bridge tolls well its failed praise god im not that stupid he turned away and splashed off through the mud edmund said i dont know how my father ever sired someone with so little sense and he too stomped off caris turned to merthin well she said what did you think of all that i dont know he looked away avoiding her eye ed better get back to work he went without kissing her well she said when he was out of earshot what on earth has got into him the earl of shiring came to kingsbridge on the tuesday of fleece fair week he brought with him both his sons various other family members and an entourage of knights and squires the bridge was cleared by his advance men and no one was permitted to cross for an hour before his arrival lest he should suffer the indignity of being made to wait alongside the common people his followers wore his redandblack livery and they all splashed into town with banners flying their horses hooves spattering the citizens with rainwater and mud earl roland had prospered in the last ten years under queen isabella and later her son edward iii and he wanted the world to know it as rich and powerful men generally did in his company was ralph son of sir gerald and brother of merthin at the same time as merthin had been apprenticed to elfrics father ralph had become a squire in the household of earl roland and he had been happy ever since he had been well fed and clothed he had learned to ride and fight and he had spent most of his time hunting and playing sports and games in six and a half years no one had asked him to read or write a word as he rode behind the earl through the huddled stalls of the fleece fair watched by faces both envious and fearful he pitied the merchants and tradesmen grubbing for pennies in the mud the earl dismounted at the priors house on the north side of the cathedral his younger son richard did the same richard was bishop of kingsbridge and the cathedral was theoretically his church however the bishops palace was in the county town of shiring two days journey away this suited the bishop whose duties were political as much as religious and it suited the monks who preferred not to be too closely supervised richard was only twentyeight but his father was a close ally of the king and that counted for more than seniority the rest of the entourage rode to the south end of the cathedral close the earls elder son william lord of caster told the squires to stable the horses while half a dozen knights settled in to the hospital ralph moved quickly to help williams wife lady philippa get down from her horse she was a tall attractive woman with long legs and deep breasts and ralph nurtured a hopeless love for her when the horses were settled ralph went to visit his mother and father they lived rentfree in a small house in the southwest quarter of the town by the river in a neighbourhood made malodorous by the work of leather tanners as he approached the house ralph felt himself shrivelling with shame inside his redandblack uniform he was grateful that lady philippa could not see the indignity of his parents situation he had not seen them for a year and they seemed older there was a lot of grey in his mothers hair and his father was losing his eyesight they gave him cider made by the monks and wild strawberries mother had gathered in the woods father admired his livery has the earl made you a knight yet he asked eagerly it was the ambition of every squire to become a knight but ralph felt it more keenly than most his father had never got over the humiliation ten years ago of being degraded to the position of pensioner of the priory an arrow had pierced ralphs heart that day the pain would not be eased until he had restored the family honour but not all squires became knights nevertheless father always talked as if it were only a matter of time for ralph not yet ralph said but were likely to go to war with france before long and that will be my chance he spoke lightly not wishing to show how badly he yearned for the chance to distinguish himself in battle mother was disgusted why do kings always want war father laughed its what men were made for no its not she said sharply when i gave birth to ralph in pain and suffering i didnt intend that he should live to have his head cut off by a frenchmans sword or his heart pierced by a bolt from a crossbow father flapped a hand at her in a dismissive gesture and said to ralph what makes you say there will be war king philip of france has confiscated gascony ah we cant have that english kings had ruled the western french province of gascony for generations they had given trade privileges to the merchants of bordeaux and bayonne who did more business with london than with paris still there was always trouble ralph said king edward has sent ambassadors to flanders to form alliances allies may want money thats why earl roland has come to kingsbridge the king wants a loan from the wool merchants how much the talk is of two hundred thousand pounds nationwide as an advance against the wool tax mother said bleakly the king should take care not to tax the wool merchants to death father said the merchants have plenty of money just look at their fine clothes there was bitterness in his tone and ralph observed that he had on a worn linen undershirt and old shoes anyway they want us to stop the french navy interfering with their trade over the last year french ships had raided towns on the south coast of england sacking the ports and setting fire to ships in the harbours the french attack us so we attack the french said mother what is the sense of it women will never understand father replied thats the truth she said crisply ralph changed the subject how is my brother hes a fine craftsman said his father and he sounded ralph thought like a horse salesman saying that an undersized pony was a good mount for a woman mother said hes smitten with edmund woolers daughter caris ralph smiled he always liked her we played together as children she was a bossy little minx but merthin never seemed to mind will he marry her i expect so mother said when he finishes his apprenticeship hell have his hands full ralph got up where do you think he is now hes working in the north porch of the cathedral father said but he might be having his dinner ill find him ralph kissed them both and went out he returned to the priory and wandered through the fair the rain had stopped and the sun was shining fitfully glinting in the puddles and raising steam off the stallholders wet covers he saw a familiar profile and the regular footsteps of his heart faltered it was the straight nose and strong jaw of lady philippa she was older than ralph about twentyfive he guessed she was standing at a stall looking at bolts of silk from italy and he drank in the way her light summer dress draped itself lasciviously over the curves of her hips he made her an unnecessarily elaborate bow she glanced up and gave a perfunctory nod beautiful materials he said trying to open a conversation yes at that moment a diminutive figure with untidy carrotcoloured hair approached merthin ralph was delighted to see him this is my clever older brother he said to philippa merthin said to philippa buy the pale green it matches your eyes ralph winced merthin should not have addressed her in such a familiar way however she did not seem to mind too much she spoke in a tone of mild reproof saying when i want a boys opinion ill ask my son but as she said it she gave him a smile that was almost flirtatious ralph said this is the lady philippa you fool i apologize for my brothers cheek my lady whats his name anyway im merthin fitzgerald at your service any time you find yourself hesitating over silks ralph took his arm and led him away before he could say anything else indiscreet i dont know how you do it he said with exasperation and admiration equally mixed it matches her eyes does it if i said something like that shed have me flogged he was exaggerating but it was true that philippa usually responded sharply to insolence he did not know whether to be amused or angry that she had been indulgent to merthin thats me merthin said every womans dream ralph detected bitterness in his tone is anything wrong he said hows caris ive done something stupid merthin replied ill tell you later lets look around while the suns out ralph noticed a stall where a monk with ashblond hair was selling cheese watch this he said to merthin he approached the stall and said this looks tasty brother where does it come from we make it at stjohnintheforest its a small cell or branch of kingsbridge priory im the prior there my name is saul whitehead it makes me hungry to look at it i wish i could buy some but the earl keeps us squires penniless the monk cut a slice off the wheel of cheese and gave it to ralph then you shall have some for nothing in the name of jesus he said thank you brother saul as they walked away ralph grinned at merthin and said see as easy as taking an apple from a child and about as admirable merthin said but what a fool to give his cheese away to anyone with a sob story he probably thinks its better to risk being made a fool of than to deny food to a starving man youre a bit sour today how come youre allowed to cheek a noblewoman but i cant talk a stupid monk into giving me free cheese merthin surprised him with a grin just like when we were boys eh exactly now ralph did not know whether to be angry or amused before he could make up his mind a pretty girl approached him with eggs on a tray she was slim with a small bust under a homespun dress and he imagined her breasts to be pale and round like the eggs he smiled at her how much he said though he had no need of eggs a penny for twelve are they good she pointed at a nearby stall theyre from these hens and have the hens been well serviced by a healthy rooster ralph saw merthin roll up his eyes in mock despair at this sally however the girl played along yes sir she said with a smile lucky hens eh i dont know of course not a maid understands little of these things ralph scrutinized her she had fair hair and a turnedup nose she was about eighteen he guessed she batted her eyelids and said dont stare at me please from behind the stall a peasant no doubt the girls father had called annet come here so your name is annet ralph said she ignored the summons ralph said who is your father perkin from wigleigh really my friend stephen is lord of wigleigh is stephen good to you lord stephen is just and merciful she said dutifully her father called again annet youre wanted here ralph knew why perkin was trying to get her away he would not mind if a squire wanted to marry his daughter that would be a step up the social ladder for her but he feared that ralph wanted to dally with her then discard her and he was right dont go annet wigleigh ralph said not until youve bought what im offering beside them merthin groaned one is as bad as the other ralph said why dont you put down the eggs and come with me we could stroll along the river bank between the river and the wall of the priory grounds there was a wide bank covered at this time of year with wild flowers and bushes where courting couples traditionally went but annet was not that easy my father would be displeased she said lets not worry about him there was not much a peasant could do to oppose the will of a squire especially when the squire was wearing the livery of a great earl it was an insult to the earl to lay hands on one of his servants the peasant might try to dissuade his daughter but it would be risky for him to restrain her forcibly however someone else came to perkins aid a youthful voice said hello annet is all well ralph turned to the newcomer he looked about sixteen but he was almost as tall as ralph with broad shoulders and big hands he was strikingly handsome with regular features that might have been carved by a cathedral sculptor he had thick tawny hair and the beginnings of a beard the same colour ralph said who the hell are you im wulfric from wigleigh sir wulfric was deferential but not afraid he turned back to annet and said ive come to help you sell some eggs the boys muscular shoulder came between ralph and annet his stance protecting the girl and at the same time excluding ralph it was mildly insolent and ralph felt a stirring of anger get out of the way wulfric wigleigh he said youre not wanted here wulfric turned again and gave him a level look im betrothed to this woman sir he said once again the tone was respectful but the attitude fearless perkin spoke up thats true sir they are to be married dont talk to me about your peasant customs ralph said contemptuously i dont care if shes married to the oaf it angered him to be spoken to this way by his inferiors it was not their place to tell him what to do merthin butted in lets go ralph he said im hungry and betty baxter is selling hot pies pies ralph said im more interested in eggs he picked up one of the eggs on her tray and fondled it suggestively then he put it down and touched her left breast it was firm to his fingertips and eggshaped what do you think youre doing she sounded indignant but she did not move away he squeezed gently enjoying the sensation examining the goods on offer take your hands off me in a minute then wulfric shoved him violently ralph was taken by surprise he had not expected to be attacked by a peasant he staggered back stumbled and fell to the ground with a thump he heard someone laugh and amazement gave way to humiliation he sprang to his feet enraged he was not wearing his sword but he had a long dagger at his belt however it would be undignified to use weapons on an unarmed peasant he could lose the respect of the earls knights and the other squires he would have to punish wulfric with his fists perkin stepped from behind his stall speaking rapidly a clumsy mistake sir not intended the lad is deeply sorry i assure you however his daughter seemed unafraid boys boys she said in a tone of mock reprimand but she seemed more pleased than anything else ralph ignored them both he took one step towards wulfric and raised his right fist then when wulfric lifted both arms to defend his face from the blow ralph drove his left fist into the boys belly it was not as soft as he had expected all the same wulfric bent forward his face twisted in agony both hands going to his midriff whereupon ralph hit him full in the face with his right fist catching him high on the cheekbone the punch hurt his hand but brought joy to his soul to his astonishment wulfric hit him back instead of crumpling to the floor and lying there waiting to be kicked the peasant boy came back with a righthanded punch that had all the strength of his shoulders behind it ralphs nose seemed to explode in blood and pain he roared with anger wulfric stepped back seeming to realize what a terrible thing he had done and he dropped both arms holding his palms upwards but it was too late to be sorry ralph hit him with both fists on the face and body a storm of blows that wulfric feebly tried to ward off by holding up his arms and ducking his head as he punched him ralph wondered vaguely why the boy did not run away and guessed he was hoping to take his punishment now rather than face worse later he had guts ralph realized but that made him even angrier he hit him harder again and again and he was filled with an emotion that was both rage and ecstasy merthin tried to intervene for the love of christ enough he said putting a hand on ralphs shoulder but ralph shook him off at last wulfrics hands fell to his sides and he staggered dazed his handsome face covered in blood his eyes closing then he fell down ralph started to kick him then a burly man in leather trousers appeared and spoke with a voice of authority now then young ralph dont murder the boy ralph recognized john the town constable and said indignantly he attacked me well hes not attacking you any more is he sir lying on the ground like that with his eyes shut john put himself in front of ralph id rather do without the trouble of a coroners inquiry people crowded around wulfric perkin annet who was flushed with excitement the lady philippa and several bystanders the ecstatic feeling left ralph and his nose hurt like hell he could breathe only through his mouth he tasted blood that animal punched my nose he said and he sounded like a man with a heavy cold then he shall be punished said john two men who looked like wulfric appeared his father and his elder brother ralph guessed they helped wulfric to his feet shooting angry glances at ralph perkin spoke up he was a fat man with a sly face the squire threw the first punch he said ralph said the peasant deliberately shoved me the squire insulted wulfrics wifetobe the constable said no matter what the squire may have said wulfric should know better than to lay hands on a servant of earl rolands i should think the earl will expect him to be severely dealt with wulfrics father spoke up is there a new law john constable that says a man in livery may do what he likes there was a mutter of agreement from the small crowd now gathered young squires caused a lot of trouble and often escaped punishment because they were wearing the colours of some baron and this was deeply resented by lawabiding tradesmen and peasants lady philippa intervened im the earls daughterinlaw and i saw the whole thing she said her voice was low and melodious but she spoke with the authority of high rank ralph expected her to take his side but to his dismay she went on im sorry to say that this was entirely ralphs fault he fondled the girls body in a most outrageous way thank you my lady john constable said deferentially he lowered his voice to confer with her but i think the earl might not want the peasant lad to go unpunished she nodded thoughtfully we dont want this to be the start of a lengthy dispute put the boy in the stocks for twentyfour hours it wont do him much harm at his age but everyone will know that justice has been done that will satisfy the earl ill answer for him john hesitated ralph could see that the constable did not like taking orders from anyone but his master the prior of kingsbridge however philippas decision would surely satisfy all parties ralph himself would have liked to see wulfric flogged but he was beginning to suspect that he did not come out of this as a hero and he would look worse if he demanded a harsh punishment after a moment john said very well lady philippa if youre willing to take responsibility i am right john took wulfric by the arm and led him away the lad had recovered fast and was able to walk normally his family followed perhaps they would bring him food and drink while he was in the stocks and make sure he was not pelted merthin said to ralph how are you ralph felt as if the middle of his face were swelling like an inflated bladder his vision was blurred his speech was a nasal honk and he was in pain im fine he said never better lets get a monk to look at your nose no ralph was not afraid of fights but he hated the things physicians did bleeding and cupping and lancing boils all i need is a bottle of strong wine take me to the nearest tavern all right merthin said but he did not move he was giving ralph a queer look ralph said whats the matter with you you dont change do you ralph shrugged does anyone godwyn was completely fascinated by timothys book it was a history of kingsbridge priory and like most such histories it began with the creation by god of heaven and earth but mostly it recounted the era of prior philip two centuries ago when the cathedral was built a time now regarded by the monks as a golden age the author brother timothy claimed that the legendary philip had been a stern disciplinarian as well as a man of compassion godwyn was not sure how you could be both on the wednesday of fleece fair week in the study hour before the service of sext godwyn sat on a high stool in the monastery library the book open on a lectern before him this was his favourite place in the priory a spacious room well lit by high windows with almost a hundred books in a locked cupboard it was normally hushed but today he could hear from the far side of the cathedral the muffled roar of the fair a thousand people buying and selling haggling and quarrelling calling their wares and shouting encouragement at cockfighting and bearbaiting at the back of the book later authors had tracked the descendants of the cathedral builders down to the present day godwyn was pleased and frankly surprised to find confirmation of his mothers theory that she was descended from tom builder through toms daughter martha he wondered what family traits might have come down from tom a mason needed to be a shrewd businessman he supposed and godwyns grandfather and his uncle edmund had that quality his cousin caris also showed signs of the same flair perhaps tom had also had the green eyes flecked with yellow that they all shared godwyn also read about tom builders stepson jack the architect of kingsbridge cathedral who had married the lady aliena and fathered a dynasty of earls of shiring he was the ancestor of cariss sweetheart merthin fitzgerald that made sense young merthin was already showing unparalleled ability as a carpenter timothys book even mentioned jacks red hair which had been inherited by sir gerald and merthin though not ralph what interested him most was the books chapter on women it seemed there had been no nuns at kingsbridge in prior philips day women had been strictly forbidden to enter the monastery buildings the author quoting philip said that if possible a monk should never look at a female for his own peace of mind philip disapproved of combined monasterynunneries saying the advantages of shared facilities were outweighed by the opportunities for the devil to introduce temptation where there was a double house the separation of monks and nuns should be as rigid as possible he added godwyn felt the thrill of finding authoritative support for a preexisting conviction at oxford he had enjoyed the allmale environment of kingsbridge college the university teachers were men as were the students without exception he had hardly spoken to a female for seven years and if he kept his eyes on the ground as he walked through the city he could even avoid looking at them on his return to the priory he had found it disturbing to see nuns so frequently although they had their own cloisters refectory kitchen and other buildings he met them constantly in the church the hospital and other communal areas at this moment there was a pretty young nun called mair just a few feet away consulting an illustrated book on medicinal herbs it was even worse to encounter girls from the town with their closefitting clothes and alluring hairstyles casually walking through the priory grounds on everyday errands bringing supplies to the kitchen or visiting the hospital clearly he thought the priory had fallen from philips high standards another example of the slackness that had crept in under the rule of anthony godwyns uncle but perhaps there was something he could do about this the bell rang for sext and he closed the book sister mair did the same and smiled at him her red lips forming a sweet curve as she did so he looked away and hurried out of the room the weather was improving the sun shining fitfully between showers of rain in the church the stainedglass windows brightened and faded as patchy clouds blew across the sky godwyns mind was equally restless distracted from his prayers by thoughts of how he could best use timothys book to inspire a revival in the priory he decided he would raise the subject at chapter the daily meeting of all the monks the builders were getting on quickly with the repairs to the chancel after last sundays collapse he noted the rubble had been cleared away and the area had been roped off there was a growing stack of thin lightweight stones in the transept the men did not stop work when the monks began to sing there were so many services during the course of a normal day that the repairs would have been severely delayed merthin fitzgerald who had temporarily abandoned his work on the new door was in the south aisle constructing an elaborate spider web of ropes branches and hurdles on which the masons would stand as they rebuilt the vaulted ceiling thomas langley whose job it was to supervise the builders was standing in the south transept with elfric pointing with his one arm at the collapsed vault obviously discussing merthins work thomas was effective as matricularius he was decisive and he never let things slip any morning the builders failed to show up a frequent irritation thomas would go and find them and demand to know why if he had a fault it was that he was too independent he rarely reported progress or asked godwyns opinion but got on with the work as if he were his own master rather than godwyns subordinate godwyn had an annoying suspicion that thomas doubted his ability godwyn was younger but only slightly he was thirtyone thomas thirtyfour perhaps thomas thought that godwyn had been promoted by anthony under pressure from petranilla however he showed no other sign of resentment he just did things his own way as godwyn watched murmuring the responses of the service automatically thomass conversation with elfric was interrupted lord william of caster came striding into the church he was a tall blackbearded figure very like his father and equally harsh though people said he was sometimes softened by his wife philippa he approached thomas and waved elfric away thomas turned to william and something in his stance reminded godwyn that thomas had once been a knight and had first arrived at the priory bleeding from the sword wound that had eventually necessitated the amputation of his left arm at the elbow godwyn wished he could hear what lord william was saying william was leaning forward speaking aggressively pointing a finger thomas unafraid answered with equal vigour godwyn suddenly remembered thomas having just such an intense combative conversation ten years ago on the day he arrived here on that occasion he had been arguing with williams younger brother richard then a priest now the bishop of kingsbridge perhaps it was fanciful but godwyn imagined they were quarrelling about the same thing today what could it be could there really be an issue between a monk and a noble family that was still a cause of anger after ten years lord william stamped off evidently unsatisfied and thomas turned back to elfric the argument ten years ago had resulted in thomass joining the priory godwyn recalled that richard had promised a donation to secure thomass admittance godwyn had never heard any more about that donation he wondered if it had ever been paid in all that time no one at the priory seemed to have learned much about thomass former life that was curious monks gossiped constantly living closely together in a small group there were twentysix at present they tended to know almost everything about one another what lord had thomas served where had he lived most knights ruled over a few villages receiving rents that enabled them to pay for horses armour and weapons had thomas had a wife and children if so what had become of them no one knew apart from the mystery of his background thomas was a good monk devout and hardworking it seemed as if this existence suited him better than his life as a knight despite his former career of violence there was something of the woman about him as there was about many monks he was very close to brother matthias a sweetnatured man a few years younger than he but if they were committing sins of impurity they were very discreet about it for no accusation had ever been made towards the end of the service godwyn glanced into the deep gloom of the nave and saw his mother petranilla standing as still as one of the pillars a shaft of sunlight illuminating her proud grey head she was alone he wondered how long she had been there watching lay people were not encouraged to attend the weekday services and godwyn guessed she was here to see him he felt the familiar mixture of pleasure and apprehension she would do anything for him he knew she had sold her house and become her brother edmunds housekeeper just so that he could study at oxford when he thought of the sacrifice that entailed for his proud mother he wanted to weep with gratitude yet her presence always made him anxious as if he were going to be reprimanded for some transgression as the monks and nuns filed out godwyn peeled off from the procession and approached her good morning mama she kissed his forehead you look thin she said with maternal anxiety arent you getting enough to eat salt fish and porridge but theres plenty of it he said what are you so excited about she could always read his mood he told her about timothys book i could read the passage during chapter he said would others support you theodoric and the younger monks would a lot of them find it disturbing to see women all the time after all they have all chosen to live in an allmale community she nodded approvingly this casts you in the role of leader excellent besides they like me because of the hot stones hot stones i introduced a new rule in the winter on frosty nights when we go into church for matins each monk is given a hot stone wrapped in a rag it prevents them getting chilblains in their feet very clever all the same check your support before you make your move of course but it fits in with what the masters teach at oxford which is mankind is fallible so we should not rely on our own reasoning we cannot hope to understand the world all we can do is stand amazed at gods creation true knowledge comes only from revelation we should not question received wisdom mother looked sceptical as lay people often did when educated men tried to explain high philosophy and this is what bishops and cardinals believe yes the university of paris has actually banned the works of aristotle and aquinas because they are based on rationality rather than faith will this way of thinking help you find favour with your superiors that was all she really cared about she wanted her son to be prior bishop archbishop even cardinal he wanted the same but he hoped he was not as cynical as she im sure of it he replied good but thats not why i came to see you your uncle edmund has suffered a blow the italians are threatening to take their custom to shiring godwyn was shocked that will ruin his business but he was not sure why she had made a special visit to tell him edmund thinks he can win them back if we improve the fleece fair and in particular if we tear down the old bridge and build a new wider one let me guess uncle anthony refused but edmund has not given up you want me to talk to anthony she shook her head you cant persuade him but if the subject comes up in chapter you should support the proposal and go against uncle anthony whenever a sensible proposal is opposed by the old guard you must be identified as leader of the reformers godwyn smiled admiringly mama how do you know so much about politics ill tell you she looked away her eyes focusing on the great rose window at the east end her mind in the past when my father started to trade with the italians he was treated as an upstart by the leading citizens of kingsbridge they turned up their noses at him and his family and did everything they could to prevent him implementing his new ideas my mother was dead by then and i was an adolescent so i became his confidante and he told me everything her face normally fixed in an expression of frozen calm twisted now into a mask of bitterness and resentment her eyes narrowed her lip curled and her cheek flushed with remembered shame he decided he would never be free of them until he took control of the parish guild so thats what he set out to do and i helped him she drew a deep breath as if once again gathering her strength for a long war we divided the ruling group set one faction against the other made alliances then shifted them ruthlessly undermined our opponents and used our supporters until it suited us to discard them it took us ten years and at the end of it he was alderman of the guild and the richest man in town she had told him the story of his grandfather before but never in quite such bluntly honest terms so you were his aide as caris is to edmund she gave a short harsh laugh yes except that by the time edmund took over we were the leading citizens my father and i climbed the mountain and edmund just had to walk down the other side they were interrupted by philemon he came into the church from the cloisters a tall scrawnynecked man of twentytwo walking like a bird with short pigeontoed steps he carried a broom he was employed by the priory as a cleaner he seemed excited ive been looking for you brother godwyn petranilla ignored his obvious hurry hello philemon havent they made you a monk yet i cant raise the necessary donation mistress petranilla i come from a humble family but its not unknown for the priory to waive the donation in the case of an applicant who shows devotion and youve been a servant of the priory paid and unpaid for years brother godwyn has proposed me but some of the older monks argued against me godwyn put in blind carlus hates philemon i dont know why petranilla said ill speak to my brother anthony he should overrule carlus youre a good friend to my son id like to see you get on thank you mistress well youre obviously bursting to tell godwyn something that cant be said in front of me so ill take my leave she kissed godwyn remember what i said i will mama godwyn felt relieved as if a storm cloud had passed overhead and gone on to drench some other town as soon as petranilla was out of earshot philemon said its bishop richard godwyn raised his eyebrows philemon had a way of learning peoples secrets what have you found out hes in the hospital right now in one of the private rooms upstairs with his cousin margery margery was a pretty girl of sixteen her parents a younger brother of earl roland and a sister of the countess of marr were both dead and she was rolands ward he had arranged for her to marry a son of the earl of monmouth in a political alliance that would greatly strengthen rolands position as the leading nobleman of southwest england what are they doing godwyn said though he could guess philemon lowered his voice kissing how do you know ill show you philemon led the way out of the church via the south transept through the monks cloisters and up a flight of steps to the dormitory it was a plain room with two rows of simple wooden bedsteads each having a straw mattress it shared a party wall with the hospital philemon went to a large cupboard that contained blankets with an effort he pulled it forward in the wall behind it there was a loose stone momentarily godwyn wondered how philemon had come across this peephole and guessed he might have hidden something in the gap philemon lifted the stone out careful to make no noise and whispered look quick godwyn hesitated in a low voice he said how many other guests have you observed from here all of them philemon replied as if that should have been obvious godwyn thought he knew what he was going to see and he did not relish it peeping at a misbehaving bishop might be all right for philemon but it seemed shamefully underhand however his curiosity urged him on in the end he asked himself what his mother would advise and knew immediately that she would tell him to look the hole in the wall was a little below eye level he stooped and peeked through he was looking into one of the two private guest rooms upstairs at the hospital in one corner stood a priedieu facing a wall painting of the crucifixion there were two comfortable chairs and a couple of stools when there was a crowd of important guests the men took one room and the women the other and this was clearly the womens room for on a small table were several distinctly feminine articles combs ribbons and mysterious small jars and vials on the floor were two straw mattresses richard and margery lay on one of them they were doing more than kissing bishop richard was an attractive man with wavy midbrown hair and regular features margery was not much more than half his age a slender girl with white skin and dark eyebrows they lay side by side richard was kissing her face and speaking into her ear a smile of pleasure played upon his fleshy lips margerys dress was pushed up around her waist she had beautiful long white legs his hand was between her thighs moving with a practised regular motion although godwyn had no experience of women somehow he knew what richard was doing margery looked at richard adoringly her mouth half open panting with excitement her face flushed with passion perhaps it was mere prejudice but godwyn sensed intuitively that richard saw margery as a plaything of the moment whereas margery believed richard was the love of her life godwyn stared at them for a horrified moment richard moved his hand and suddenly godwyn was looking at the triangle of coarse hair between margerys thighs dark against her white skin like her eyebrows quickly he looked away let me see said philemon godwyn moved away from the wall this was shocking but what should he do about it if anything philemon looked through the hole and gave a gasp of excitement i can see her cunt he whispered hes rubbing it come away from there godwyn said weve seen enough too much philemon hesitated fascinated then reluctantly he moved away and replaced the loose stone we must expose the bishops fornication at once he said shut your mouth and let me think godwyn said if he did as philemon suggested he would make enemies of richard and his powerful family and to no purpose but surely there was a way something like this could be turned to advantage godwyn tried to think about it as his mother would if there was nothing to be gained by revealing richards sin was it possible to make a virtue of concealing it perhaps richard would be grateful to godwyn for keeping it secret that was more promising but for it to work richard had to know that godwyn was protecting him come with me godwyn said to philemon philemon moved the cupboard back into place godwyn wondered whether the sound of the wood scraping on the floor was audible in the next room he doubted it and anyway richard and margery were surely too absorbed in what they were doing to notice noises from beyond the wall godwyn led the way down the stairs and through the cloisters there were two staircases to the private rooms one led up from the hospitals ground floor and the other was outside the building permitting important guests to come and go without passing through the common peoples quarters godwyn hurried up the outside stairs he paused outside the room where richard and margery were and spoke to philemon quietly follow me in he said do nothing say nothing leave when i leave philemon put down his broom no godwyn said carry it all right godwyn threw open the door and strode in i want this chamber immaculately clean he said loudly sweep every corner oh i beg your pardon i thought the room was empty in the time it had taken godwyn and philemon to rush from the dormitory to the hospital the lovers had progressed richard now lay on top of margery his long clerical robe lifted in front her shapely white legs stuck straight up in the air either side of the bishops hips there was no mistaking what they were doing richard ceased his thrusting motion and looked at godwyn his expression a mixture of angry frustration and frightened guilt margery gave a cry of shock and she too stared at godwyn with fear in her eyes godwyn drew the moment out bishop richard he said feigning bewilderment he wanted richard to be in no doubt that he had been recognized but how and margery he pretended to understand suddenly forgive me he spun on his heel he shouted at philemon get out now philemon scuttled back through the door still clutching his broom godwyn followed but he turned at the door to make sure richard got a good look at him the two lovers remained frozen in position locked in sexual congress but their faces had changed margerys hand had flown to her mouth in the eternal gesture of surprised guilt richards expression had become frantically calculating he wanted to speak but he could not think what to say godwyn decided to put them out of their misery he had done everything he needed to do he stepped out then before he could close the door a shock made him stop a woman was coming up the stairs he suffered a moment of panic it was philippa the wife of the earls other son he realized instantly that richards guilty secret would lose its value if someone else knew it he had to warn richard lady philippa he said in a loud voice welcome to kingsbridge priory urgent scuffling noises came from behind him out of the corner of his eye he saw richard leap to his feet luckily philippa did not march straight past but stopped and spoke to godwyn perhaps you can help me from where she stood she could not quite see into the room he thought ive lost a bracelet its not precious just carved wood but im fond of it what a shame godwyn said sympathetically ill ask all the monks and nuns to look out for it philemon said i havent seen it godwyn said to philippa perhaps it slipped from your wrist she frowned the odd thing is i havent actually worn it since i got here i took it off when i arrived and put it on the table and now i cant find it perhaps it rolled into a dark corner philemon here will look for it he cleans the guest rooms philippa looked at philemon yes i saw you as i was leaving an hour or so ago you didnt spot it when you swept the room i didnt sweep miss margery came in just as i was getting started godwyn said philemon has just come back to clean your room but miss margery is he looked into the room at prayer he finished margery was kneeling on the priedieu eyes closed begging forgiveness for her sin godwyn hoped richard stood behind her head bowed hands clasped lips moving in a murmur godwyn stepped aside to let philippa enter the room she gave her brotherinlaw a suspicious look hello richard she said its not like you to pray on a weekday he put his finger to his lips in a shushing gesture and pointed to margery on the prayer stool philippa said briskly margery can pray as much as she likes but this is the womens room and i want you out richard concealed his relief and left closing the door on the two women he and godwyn stood face to face in the hallway godwyn could tell that richard did not know what line to take he might be inclined to say how dare you burst into a room without knocking however he was so badly in the wrong that he probably could not summon up the nerve to bluster on the other hand he could hardly beg godwyn to keep quiet about what he had seen for that would be to acknowledge himself in godwyns power it was a moment of painful awkwardness while richard hesitated godwyn spoke no one shall hear of this from me richard looked relieved then glanced at philemon what about him philemon wants to be a monk he is learning the virtue of obedience im in your debt a man should confess his own sins not those of others all the same im grateful brother godwyn the sacrist im the nephew of prior anthony he wanted richard to know that he was sufficiently well connected to make serious trouble but to take the edge off the threat he added my mother was betrothed to your father many years ago before your father became the earl ive heard that story godwyn wanted to add and your father spurned my mother just as youre planning to spurn the wretched margery but instead he said pleasantly we might have been brothers yes the bell rang for dinner relieved of their embarrassment the three men parted company richard to prior anthonys house godwyn to the monks refectory and philemon to the kitchen to help serve godwyn was thoughtful as he walked through the cloisters he was upset by the animal scene he had witnessed but he felt he had handled it well at the end richard had seemed to trust him in the refectory godwyn sat next to theodoric a bright monk a couple of years younger than he theodoric had not studied at oxford and in consequence he looked up to godwyn godwyn treated him as an equal which flattered theodoric ive just read something that will interest you godwyn said he summarized what he had read about the revered prior philips attitude to women in general and nuns in particular its what youve always said he finished in fact theodoric had never expressed an opinion on the subject but he always agreed when godwyn complained about prior anthonys slackness of course theodoric said he had blue eyes and fair skin and now he flushed with excitement how can we have pure thoughts when we are constantly distracted by females but what can we do about it we must confront the prior in chapter you mean godwyn said as if it were theodorics idea rather than his own yes excellent plan but would others support us the younger monks would young men probably agreed with more or less any criticism of their elders godwyn thought but he also knew that many monks shared his own preference for a life in which women were absent or at least invisible if you talk to anyone between now and chapter let me know what they say he said that would encourage theodoric to go around whipping up support the dinner arrived a stew of salt fish and beans before godwyn could begin to eat he was prevented by friar murdo friars were monks who lived among the people instead of secluding themselves in monasteries they felt that their selfdenial was more rigorous than that of institutional monks whose vow of poverty was compromised by their splendid buildings and extensive landholdings traditionally friars had no property not even churches although many had slipped from this ideal after pious admirers gave them land and money those who still lived by the original principles scrounged their food and slept on kitchen floors they preached in market places and outside taverns and were rewarded with pennies they did not hesitate to sponge on ordinary monks for food and lodging any time it suited their convenience not surprisingly their assumption of superiority was resented friar murdo was a particularly unpleasant example fat dirty greedy often drunk and sometimes seen in the company of prostitutes but he was also a charismatic preacher who could hold a crowd of hundreds with his colourful theologically dubious sermons now he stood up uninvited and began to pray in a loud voice our father bless this food to our foul corrupt bodies as full of sin as a dead dog is full of maggots murdos prayers were never short godwyn put down his spoon with a sigh there was always a reading in chapter usually from the rule of st benedict but often from the bible and occasionally other religious books as the monks were taking their places on the raked stone benches around the octagonal chapter house godwyn sought out the young monk who was due to read today and told him quietly but firmly that he godwyn would be reading instead then when the moment came he read the crucial page from timothys book he felt nervous he had returned from oxford a year ago and he had been quietly talking to people about reforming the priory ever since but until this moment he had not openly confronted anthony the prior was weak and lazy and needed to be shocked out of his lethargy furthermore st benedict had written all must be called to chapter for the lord often reveals to a younger member what is best godwyn was perfectly entitled to speak out in chapter and call for stricter compliance with monastic rules all the same he suddenly felt he was running a risk and wished he had taken longer to think about his tactics in using timothys book but it was too late for regrets he closed the book and said my question to myself and my brethren is this have we slipped below the standards of prior philip in the matter of separation between monks and females he had learned in student debates to put his argument in the form of a question whenever he could giving his opponent as little as possible to argue against the first to reply was blind carlus the subprior anthonys deputy some monasteries are located far from any centre of population on an uninhabited island or deep in the forest or perched on a lonely mountain top he said his slow deliberate speech made godwyn fidget with impatience in such houses the brothers seclude themselves from all contact with the secular world he went on unhurriedly kingsbridge has never been like that were in the heart of a great city the home of seven thousand souls we care for one of the most magnificent cathedrals in christendom many of us are physicians because st benedict said special care must be taken of the sick so that in very deed they be looked after as if it were christ himself the luxury of total isolation has not been granted to us god has given us a different mission godwyn had expected something like this carlus hated furniture to be moved for then he would stumble over it and he opposed any other kind of change out of a parallel anxiety about coping with the unfamiliar theodoric had a quick answer to carlus all the more reason for us to be strict about the rules he said a man who lives next door to a tavern must be extra careful to avoid drunkenness there was a murmur of pleased agreement the monks enjoyed a smart riposte godwyn gave a nod of approval the fairskinned theodoric blushed with gratification emboldened a novice called juley said in a loud whisper women dont bother carlus he cant see them several monks laughed though others shook their heads in disapproval godwyn felt it was going well he seemed to be winning the argument so far then prior anthony said exactly what are you proposing brother godwyn he had not been to oxford but he knew enough to press for his opponents real agenda reluctantly godwyn put his cards on the table we might consider reverting to the position as it was in the time of prior philip anthony persisted what do you mean by that exactly no nuns yes but where would they go the nunnery could be removed to another location and become a remote cell of the priory like kingsbridge college or stjohnintheforest that shocked them there was a clamour of comment which the prior suppressed with difficulty the voice that emerged from the hubbub was that of joseph the senior physician he was a clever man but proud and godwyn was wary of him how would we run a hospital without nuns he said his bad teeth caused him to slur his sibilants making him sound drunk but he spoke with no less authority they administer medicines change dressings feed the incapable comb the hair of senile old men theodoric said monks could do all that then what about childbirth joseph said we often deal with women who are having difficulty bringing a baby into the world how could monks help them without nuns to do the actual handling several men voiced their agreement but godwyn had anticipated this question and now he said suppose the nuns removed to the old lazar house the leper colony or lazar house was on a small island in the river on the south side of the town in the old days it had been full of sufferers but leprosy seemed to be dying out and now there were only two occupants both elderly brother cuthbert who was a wit muttered i wouldnt want to be the one to tell mother cecilia shes being moved to a leper colony there was a ripple of laughter women should be ruled by men said theodoric prior anthony said and mother cecilia is ruled by bishop richard he would have to make a decision such as this heaven forbid that he should said a new voice it was simeon the treasurer a thin man with a long face he spoke against every proposal that involved spending money we could not survive without the nuns he said godwyn was taken by surprise why not he said we dont have enough money simeon said promptly when the cathedral needs repair who do you think pays the builders not us we cant afford it mother cecilia pays she buys supplies for the hospital parchment for the scriptorium and fodder for the stables anything used communally by both monks and nuns is paid for by her godwyn was dismayed how can this be why are we dependent on them simeon shrugged over the years many devout women have given the nunnery land and other assets that was not the whole story godwyn felt sure the monks also had extensive resources they collected rent and other charges from just about every citizen of kingsbridge and they held thousands of acres of farmland too the way the wealth was husbanded must be a factor but there was no point going into that now he had lost the argument even theodoric was silent anthony said complacently well that was a most interesting discussion thank you godwyn for asking the question and now let us pray godwyn was too angry for prayer he had gained nothing of what he wanted and he was unsure where he had gone wrong as the monks filed out theodoric gave him a frightened look and said i didnt know the nuns paid for so much none of us knew godwyn said he realized he was glaring at theodoric and made amends hastily adding but you were splendid you debated better than many an oxford man it was just the right thing to say and theodoric looked happy this was the hour for monks to read in the library or walk in the cloisters meditating but godwyn had other plans something had been nagging him all through dinner and chapter he had thrust it to the back of his mind because more important things had intervened but now it came back he thought he knew where lady philippas bracelet might be there were few hiding places in a monastery the monks lived communally no one but the prior had a room to himself even in the latrine they sat side by side over a trough that was continuously flushed by a stream of piped water they were not permitted to have personal possessions so no one had his own cupboard or even box but today godwyn had seen a hiding place he went upstairs to the dormitory it was empty he pulled the blanket cupboard away from the wall and removed the loose stone but he did not look through the hole instead he put his hand into the gap exploring he felt the top bottom and sides of the hole to the right there was a small fissure godwyn eased his fingers inside and touched something that was neither stone nor mortar scrabbling with his fingertips he drew the object out it was a carved wooden bracelet godwyn held it to the light it was made of some hard wood probably oak the inner surface was smoothly polished but the outside was carved with an interlocking design of bold squares and diagonals executed with pleasing precision godwyn could see why lady philippa was fond of it he put it back restored the loose stone and returned the cupboard to its usual position what did philemon want with such a thing he might be able to sell it for a penny or two though that would be dangerous because it was so recognizable but he certainly could not wear it godwyn left the dormitory and went down the stairs to the cloisters he was in no mood for study or meditation he needed to talk over the days events he felt the need to see his mother the thought made him apprehensive she might berate him for his failure in chapter but she would praise him for his handling of bishop richard he felt sure and he was eager to tell her the story he decided to go in search of her strictly speaking this was not allowed monks were not supposed to roam about the streets of the town at will they needed a reason and in theory they were supposed to ask the priors permission before leaving the precincts but in practice the obedientiaries monastic officials had dozens of excuses the priory did business constantly with merchants buying food cloth shoes parchment candles garden tools tack for horses all the necessities of everyday life the monks were landlords owning almost the entire city and any one of the physicians might be called to see a patient who was unable to walk to the hospital so it was common to see monks in the streets and godwyn the sacrist was not likely to be asked to explain what he was doing out of the monastery nevertheless it was wise to be discreet and he made sure he was not observed as he left the priory he passed through the busy fair and went quickly along the main street to his uncle edmunds house as he hoped edmund and caris were out doing business and he found his mother alone but for the servants this is a treat for a mother she said to see you twice in one day and it gives me a chance to feed you up she poured him a big tankard of strong ale and told the cook to bring a plate of cold beef what happened in chapter she said he told her the story i was in too much of a hurry he said at the end she nodded my father used to say never call a meeting until the outcome is a foregone conclusion godwyn smiled i must remember that all the same i dont think youve done any harm that was a relief she was not going to be angry but i lost the argument he said you also established your position as leader of the reformist younger group even though i made a fool of myself better than being a nonentity he was not sure she was right about that but as usual when he doubted the wisdom of his mothers advice he did not challenge her but resolved to think about it later something very odd happened he said and he told her about richard and margery leaving out the gross physical details she was surprised richard must be mad she said the wedding will be called off if the earl of monmouth finds out that margery isnt a virgin earl roland will be furious richard could be unfrocked but a lot of bishops have mistresses dont they thats different a priest may have a housekeeper who is his wife in all but name a bishop may have several but to take the virginity of a noblewoman shortly before her wedding even the son of an earl might find it difficult to survive as a clergyman after that what do you think i should do nothing youve handled it perfectly so far he glowed with pride she added one day this information will be a powerful weapon just remember it theres one more thing i wondered how philemon had come across the loose stone and it occurred to me that he might have used it initially as a hiding place i was right and i found a bracelet that lady philippa had lost interesting she said i have a strong feeling that philemon will be useful to you hell do anything you see he has no scruples no morals my father had an associate who was always willing to do his dirty work start rumours spread poisonous gossip foment strife such men can be invaluable so you dont think i should report the theft certainly not make him give the bracelet back if you think its important he can just say he found it while sweeping but dont expose him youll reap the benefit i guarantee so i should protect him as you would a mad dog that mauls intruders hes dangerous but hes worth it on thursday merthin completed the door he was carving he had finished work in the south aisle for the present the scaffolding was in place there was no need for him to make formwork for the masons as godwyn and thomas were determined to save money by trying merthins method of building without it so he returned to his carving and realized there was little left to do he spent an hour improving a wise virgins hair and another on a foolish virgins silly smile but he was not sure he was making them any better he found it difficult to make decisions because his mind kept wandering to caris and griselda he had hardly been able to bring himself to speak to caris all week he felt so ashamed of himself every time he saw caris he thought of how he had embraced griselda and kissed her and done with her the most loving act of human life a girl he did not like let alone love although he had formerly spent many happy hours imagining the moment when he would do that with caris now the prospect was filled with dread there was nothing wrong with griselda well there was but that was not what disturbed him he would have felt the same if it had been any woman other than caris he had taken away the meaning of the act by doing it with griselda and now he could not face the woman he loved while he was staring at his work trying to stop thinking about caris and decide whether the door was finished or not elizabeth clerk walked into the north porch she was a pale thin beauty of twentyfive with a cloud of fair curls her father had been the bishop of kingsbridge before richard he had lived like richard in the bishops palace at shiring but on his frequent visits to kingsbridge he had fallen for a serving wench at the bell elizabeths mother because of her illegitimacy elizabeth was sensitive about her social position alert to the least slight and quick to take offence but merthin liked her because she was clever and because when he was eighteen she had kissed him and let him feel her breasts which were high on her chest and flat as if moulded from shallow cups with nipples that hardened at the gentlest touch their romance had ended over something that seemed trivial to him and unforgivable to her a joke he had made about randy priests but he still liked her she touched his shoulder and looked at the door her hand went to her mouth and she drew in her breath they seem alive she said he was thrilled her praise was not lightly given all the same he felt an impulse to be modest its only that ive made each one individual on the old door the virgins were identical its more than that they look as if they might step forward and talk to us thank you but its so different from everything else in the cathedral what will the monks say brother thomas likes it what about the sacrist godwyn i dont know what hell think but if theres a fuss ill appeal to prior anthony who wont want to commission another door and pay twice well she said thoughtfully the bible doesnt say that they were all alike of course just that five had the sense to get ready well in advance and the other five left arrangements until the last minute and ended up missing the party but what about elfric its not for him hes your master he only cares about getting the money she was not convinced the problem is that youre a better craftsman than he thats been obvious for a couple of years and everyone knows it elfric would never admit it but thats why he hates you he may make you regret this you always see the black side do i she was offended well well see if im right i hope im wrong she turned to go elizabeth yes im really pleased you think its good she did not reply but she seemed a bit mollified she waved goodbye and left merthin decided the door was finished he wrapped it in coarse sacking he would have to show it to elfric and now was as good a time as any the rain had stopped for a while at least he got one of the labourers to help him carry the door the builders had a technique for carrying heavy awkward objects they laid two stout poles on the ground parallel then placed boards crosswise on the poles in the centre to provide a firm base they manhandled the object on to the boards then they stood between the poles one man at each end and lifted the arrangement was called a stretcher and it was also used for carrying sick people to the hospital even so the door was very heavy however merthin was used to difficult lifting elfric had never allowed him to make an excuse of his slight stature and the result was that he had become surprisingly strong the two men reached elfrics house and carried the door inside griselda was sitting in the kitchen she seemed to be getting more voluptuous by the day her large breasts appeared to be growing even bigger merthin hated to be at odds with people so he tried to be friendly do you want to see my door he said as they passed her why would i want to look at a door its carved the story of the wise and foolish virgins she gave a humourless laugh dont tell me about virgins they carried it through to the yard merthin did not understand women griselda had been cold to him ever since they had made love if that was how she felt why had she done it she was making it clear she did not want to do it again he could have reassured her that he felt the same way in fact he loathed the prospect but that would be insulting so he said nothing they put down the stretcher and merthins helper left elfric was in the yard his brawny body bent over a stack of timber counting planks tapping each beam with a piece of squarecut wood a couple of feet long sticking his tongue into his cheek as he did whenever he faced a mental challenge he glared at merthin and carried on so merthin said nothing but unwrapped the door and stood it up against a pile of stone blocks he was extraordinarily proud of what he had done he had followed the traditional pattern but at the same time he had done something original that made people gasp he could hardly wait to see the door installed in the church fortyseven elfric said then he turned to merthin i finished the door merthin said proudly what do you think elfric looked at the door for a moment he had a big nose and his nostrils twitched in surprise then without warning he hit merthin across the face with the stick he had been using to count it was a solid piece of wood and the blow was hard merthin cried out in sudden agony staggered back and fell to the ground you piece of filth elfric yelled you defiled my daughter merthin tried to sputter a protest but his mouth was full of blood how dare you elfric bellowed as if at a signal alice appeared from inside the house snake she screamed you slithered into our home and deflowered our little girl they were pretending to be spontaneous but they must have planned this merthin thought he spat blood and said deflowered she was no virgin elfric lashed out again with his improvised club merthin rolled out of the way but the blow landed painfully on his shoulder alice said how could you do this to caris my poor sister when she finds out it will break her heart merthin was stung into a response and youll be sure to tell her wont you you bitch well youre not going to marry griselda in secret alice said merthin was astonished marry im not marrying her she hates me with that griselda appeared i certainly dont want to marry you she said but ill have to im pregnant merthin stared at her thats not possible we only did it once elfric laughed harshly it only takes once you young fool im still not marrying her if you dont youll be sacked elfric said you cant do that why not i dont care im not going to marry her elfric dropped the club and picked up an axe merthin said jesus christ alice took a step forward elfric dont commit murder get out of the way woman elfric lifted the axe merthin still on the ground scooted away in fear of his life elfric brought the axe down not on merthin but on his door merthin shouted no the sharp blade sank into the face of the longhaired virgin and split the wood along the grain merthin yelled stop it elfric lifted the axe again and brought it down even harder it split the door in two merthin got to his feet to his horror he felt his eyes fill with tears you have no right he was trying to shout but his voice came out in a whisper elfric lifted the axe and turned towards him stay back boy dont tempt me merthin saw a mad light in elfrics eye and backed away elfric brought the axe down on the door again merthin stood and watched with tears pouring down his face the two dogs skip and scrap greeted one another with joyful enthusiasm they were from the same litter though they did not look similar skip was a brown boy dog and scrap a small black female skip was a typical village dog lean and suspicious whereas the citydwelling scrap was plump and contented it was ten years since gwenda had picked skip out of a litter of mongrel puppies on the floor of cariss bedroom in the wool merchants big house the day cariss mother died since then gwenda and caris had become close friends they met only two or three times a year but they shared their secrets gwenda felt she could tell caris everything and the information would never get back to her parents or anyone else in wigleigh she assumed caris felt the same because gwenda did not talk to any other kingsbridge girls there could be no risk of her letting something slip in a careless moment gwenda arrived in kingsbridge on the friday of fleece fair week her father joby went to the fairground in front of the cathedral to sell the furs of squirrels he had trapped in the forest near wigleigh gwenda went straight to cariss house and the two dogs were reunited as always gwenda and caris talked about boys merthin is in a strange mood caris said on sunday he was his normal self kissing me in church then on monday he could hardly look me in the eye hes feeling guilty about something gwenda said immediately its probably connected with elizabeth clerk shes always had her eye on him though shes a cold bitch and much too old for him have you and merthin done it yet done what you know when i was little i used to call it grunting because that was the noise grownups made while they were doing it oh that no not yet why not i dont know dont you want to yes but dont you worry about spending your life doing some mans bidding gwenda shrugged i dont like the idea but on the other hand i dont worry about it what about you have you done it yet not properly i said yes to a boy from the next village years ago just to see what it was like its a nice warm glow like drinking wine that was the only time but id let wulfric do it any time he liked wulfric this is new i know i mean ive known him since we were small when he used to pull my hair and run away then one day soon after christmas i looked at him as he came into church and i realized hed become a man well not just a man but a really gorgeous man he had snow in his hair and a sort of mustardcoloured scarf around his neck and he just looked glowing do you love him gwenda sighed she did not know how to say what she felt it was not just love she thought about him all the time and she did not know how she could live without him she daydreamed about kidnapping him and locking him up in a hut deep in the forest so that he could never escape from her well the look on your face answers my question caris said does he love you gwenda shook her head he never even speaks to me i wish hed do something to show that he knows who i am even if it was only pulling my hair but hes in love with annet the daughter of perkin shes a selfish cow but he adores her her father and his are the two wealthiest men in the village her father raises laying hens and sells them and his father has fifty acres you make it sound hopeless i dont know whats hopeless annet might die wulfric might suddenly realize hes always loved me my father might be made earl and order him to marry me caris smiled youre right love is never hopeless id like to see this boy gwenda stood up i was hoping youd say that lets go and find him they left the house the dogs following at their heels the rainstorms that had lashed the town earlier in the week had given way to occasional showers but the main street was still a stream of mud because of the fair the mud was mixed with animal droppings rotten vegetables and all the litter and filth of a thousand visitors as they splashed through the disgusting puddles caris asked about gwendas family the cow died gwenda said pa needs to buy another but i dont know how hes going to do it he only has a few squirrel furs to sell a cow costs twelve shillings this year caris said with concern thats a hundred and fortyfour silver pennies caris always did arithmetic in her head she had learned arabic numbers from buonaventura caroli and she said that made it easy for the last few winters that cow has kept us alive especially the little ones the pain of extreme hunger was familiar to gwenda even with the cow to give milk four of mas babies had died no wonder philemon had longed to be a monk she thought it was worth almost any sacrifice to have hearty meals provided every day without fail caris said what will your father do something underhand its difficult to steal a cow you cant slip it into your satchel but hell have a crafty scheme gwenda was sounding more confident than she felt pa was dishonest but not clever he would do anything he could legal or not to get another cow but he might just fail they passed through the priory gates into the wide fairground the traders were wet and miserable on the sixth day of bad weather they had exposed their stock to the rain and got little in return gwenda felt awkward she and caris almost never talked about the disparity in wealth between the two families every time gwenda visited caris would quietly give her a present to take home a cheese a smoked fish a bolt of cloth a jar of honey gwenda would thank her and she was always profoundly grateful but no more would be said when pa tried to make her take advantage of cariss trust by stealing from the house gwenda would argue that she would then be unable to visit again whereas this way she came home with something two or three times a year even pa could see the sense of that gwenda looked for the stall where perkin would be selling his hens annet would probably be there and wherever annet was wulfric would not be far away gwenda was right there was perkin fat and sly greasily polite to his customers curt to everyone else annet was carrying a tray of eggs smiling coquettishly the tray pulling her dress tight against her breasts her fair hair straying from her hat in wisps that played around her pink cheeks and her long neck and there was wulfric looking like an archangel who had lost his way and wandered among humankind by mistake there he is gwenda murmured the tall one with i can tell which one he is caris said he looks good enough to eat you see what i mean hes a bit young isnt he sixteen im eighteen annet is eighteen too all right i know what youre thinking gwenda said hes too handsome for me no handsome men never fall for ugly women do they youre not ugly ive seen myself in a glass the memory was painful and gwenda grimaced i cried when i realized what i looked like i have a big nose and my eyes are too close together i resemble my father caris protested you have beautiful soft brown eyes and wonderful thick hair but im not in wulfrics class wulfric was standing sideon to gwenda and caris giving them a good view of his carved profile they both admired him for a moment then he turned and gwenda gasped the other side of his face was completely different bruised and swollen with one eye closed she ran up to him what happened to you she cried he was startled oh hello gwenda i had a fight he half turned away obviously embarrassed who with some squire of the earls youre hurt he looked impatient dont worry im fine he did not understand why she was concerned of course perhaps ne even thought she was revelling in his misfortune then caris spoke which squire she said wulfric looked at her with interest realizing from her dress that she was a wealthy woman his name is ralph fitzgerald oh merthins brother caris said was he hurt i broke his nose wulfric looked proud werent you punished a night in the stocks gwenda gave a little cry of anguish poor you it wasnt so bad my brother made sure no one pelted me even so gwenda was horrified the idea of being imprisoned in any way seemed to her the worst kind of torture annet finished with a customer and joined in the conversation oh its you gwenda she said coldly wulfric might be oblivious to gwendas feelings but annet was not and she treated gwenda with a mixture of hostility and scorn wulfric fought a squire who insulted me she said unable to conceal her satisfaction he was just like a knight in a ballad gwenda said sharply i wouldnt want him to get his face hurt for my sake fortunately thats not very likely is it annet smiled triumphantly caris said one never knows what the future may hold annet looked at her startled by the interruption and showed surprise that gwendas companion was so expensively dressed caris took gwendas arm such a pleasure to meet you wigleigh folk she said graciously goodbye they walked on gwenda giggled you were terribly condescending to annet she annoyed me her kind give women a bad name she was so pleased that wulfric got beaten up for her sake id like to poke out her eyes caris said thoughtfully apart from his good looks what is he actually like strong proud loyal just the type to get into a fight on someone elses behalf but hes the kind of man who will provide tirelessly for his family year in and year out until the day he drops dead caris said nothing gwenda said he doesnt appeal to you does he you make him sound a bit dull if youd grown up with my father you wouldnt think a good provider was dull i know caris squeezed gwendas arm i think hes wonderful for you and to prove it im going to help you get him gwenda was not expecting that how come with me they left the fairground and walked to the north end of the town caris led gwenda to a small house in a side street near st marks parish church a wise woman lives here she said leaving the dogs outside they ducked through a low doorway the single narrow downstairs room was divided by a curtain in the front half were a chair and a bench the fireplace had to be at the back gwenda thought and she wondered why someone would want to hide whatever went on in the kitchen the room was clean and there was a strong smell herby and slightly acid hardly a perfume but not unpleasant caris called out mattie its me after a moment a woman of about forty pulled aside the curtain and came through she had grey hair and pale indoor skin she smiled when she saw caris then she gave gwenda a hard look and said i see your friend is in love but the boy hardly speaks to her gwenda gasped how did you know mattie sat on the chair heavily she was stout and short of breath people come here for three reasons sickness revenge and love you look healthy and youre too young for revenge so you must be in love and the boy must be indifferent to you otherwise you wouldnt need my help gwenda glanced at caris who looked pleased and said i told you she was wise the two girls sat on the bench and looked expectantly at the woman mattie went on he lives close to you probably in the same village but his family are wealthier than yours all true gwenda was amazed no doubt mattie was guessing but she was so accurate it seemed as if she must have second sight is he handsome very but hes in love with the prettiest girl in the village if you like that type and her family too is wealthier than yours yes mattie nodded a familiar story i can help you but you must understand something i have nothing to do with the spirit world only god can work miracles gwenda was puzzled everyone knew that the spirits of the dead controlled all of lifes hazards if they were pleased with you they would guide rabbits to your traps give you healthy babies and make the sun shine on your ripening corn but if you did something to anger them they could put worms in your apples cause your cow to give birth to a deformed calf and make your husband impotent even the physicians at the priory admitted that prayers to the saints were more efficacious than their medicines mattie went on dont despair i can sell you a love potion im sorry i have no money i know but your friend caris is extraordinarily fond of you and she wants you to be happy she came here prepared to pay for the potion however you must administer it correctly can you get the boy alone for an hour ill find a way put the potion in his drink within a short time he will become amorous thats when you must be alone with him if there is another girl in sight he may fall for her instead so keep him away from other women and be very sweet to him he will think you the most desirable woman in the world kiss him tell him hes wonderful and if you want make love to him after a while he will sleep when he wakes up he will remember that he spent the happiest hour of his life in your arms and hell want to do it again as soon as he can but wont i need another dose no the second time your love and desire and femininity will be enough a woman can make any man blissfully happy if he gives her the chance the very thought made gwenda feel lustful i cant wait then lets make up the mixture mattie heaved herself out of the chair you can come behind the curtain she said gwenda and caris followed her its only there for the ignorant the kitchen had a clean stone floor and a big fireplace equipped with stands and hooks for cooking and boiling far more than one woman would need for her own food there was a heavy old table stained and scorched but scrubbed clean a shelf with a row of pottery jars and a locked cupboard presumably containing the more precious ingredients used in matties potions hanging on the wall was a large slate with numbers and letters scratched on it presumably recipes why do you need to hide all this behind a curtain gwenda said a man who makes ointments and medicines is called an apothecary but a woman who does the same runs the risk of being called a witch theres a woman in town called crazy nell who goes around shouting about the devil friar murdo has accused her of heresy nell is mad its true but theres no harm in her all the same murdo is insisting on a trial men like to kill a woman every now and again and murdo will give them an excuse and collect their pennies afterwards as alms thats why i always tell people that only god works miracles i dont conjure spirits i just use the herbs of the forest and my powers of observation while mattie talked caris was moving about the kitchen as freely as if she were at home she put a mixing bowl and a vial on the table mattie handed her a key and she opened the cupboard put three drops of essence of poppies into a spoonful of distilled wine mattie said we must be careful not to make the mixture overstrong or he will go to sleep too soon gwenda was astonished are you going to make the potion caris i sometimes help mattie dont say anything to petranilla she would disapprove i wouldnt tell her if her hair was on fire cariss aunt disliked gwenda probably for the same reason she would disapprove of mattie they were both lowclass and such things mattered to petranilla but why was caris the daughter of a wealthy man working like an apprentice in the kitchen of a sidestreet medicine woman while caris made up the mixture gwenda recalled that her friend had always been intrigued by illness and cures as a little girl caris had wanted to be a physician not understanding that only priests were allowed to study medicine gwenda remembered her saying after her mother had died but why do people have to fall sick mother cecilia had told her it was because of sin edmund had said that no one really knew neither response had satisfied caris perhaps she was still seeking the answer here in matties kitchen caris poured the liquid into a tiny jar stoppered it and bound the stopper tightly with cord tying the ends in a knot then she handed the jar to gwenda gwenda tucked it into the leather purse attached to her belt she wondered how on earth she was going to get wulfric on his own for an hour she had glibly said that she would find a way but now that she had the love potion in her possession the task seemed nearly impossible he showed signs of restlessness if she merely spoke to him he wanted to be with annet any free time he had what reason would gwenda give for needing to be alone with him i want to show you a place where we can get wild duck eggs but why would she show him and not her father wulfric was a little naive but not stupid he would know she was up to something caris gave mattie twelve silver pennies two weeks wages for pa gwenda said thank you caris i hope youll come to my wedding caris laughed thats what i like to see confidence they left mattie and headed back to the fair gwenda decided to begin by finding out where wulfric was staying his family were too well off to claim poverty so they could not stay free at the priory they would probably be lodging in a tavern she could just casually ask him or his brother and follow up with a question about the standard of accommodation as if she were interested to know which of the towns many inns was the best a monk passed by and gwenda realized with a guilty start that she had not even thought about trying to see her brother philemon pa would not visit him for they had hated one another for years but gwenda was fond of him she knew that he was sly untruthful and malicious but all the same he loved her they had been through many hungry winters together she would seek him out later she resolved after she had seen wulfric again but before she and caris reached the fairground they met gwendas father joby was near the priory gates outside the bell with him was a roughlooking man in a yellow tunic with a pack on his back and a brown cow he waved gwenda over ive found a cow he said gwenda looked more closely it was two years old and thin with a badtempered look but it appeared healthy it seems fine she said this is sim chapman he said jerking a thumb at the yellow tunic a chapman travelled from village to village selling small necessities needles buckles hand mirrors combs he might have stolen the cow but that would not bother pa if the price was right gwenda said to her father where did you get the money im not paying exactly he replied looking shifty gwenda had expected him to have some scheme what then its more of a swap what are you giving him in exchange for the cow you said pa dont be silly she said and then she felt a loop of rope dropped over her head and tightened around her body pinning her arms to her sides she felt bewildered this could not be happening she struggled to free herself but sim just pulled the rope tighter now dont make a fuss pa said she could not believe they were serious what do you think youre doing she said incredulously you cant sell me you fool sim needs a woman and i need a cow pa said its very simple sim spoke for the first time shes ugly enough your daughter this is ridiculous gwenda said sim smiled at her dont worry gwenda he said ill be good to you as long as you behave yourself and do as youre told they meant it gwenda saw they actually thought they could make this exchange a cold needle of fear entered her heart as she realized it might even happen caris spoke up this joke has gone on long enough she said in a loud clear voice release gwenda immediately sim was not intimidated by her air of command and who are you to give orders my father is alderman of the parish guild but youre not sim said and even if you were youd have no authority over me or my friend joby you cant trade a girl for a cow why not said sim its my cow and the girl is his daughter their raised voices attracted the attention of passersby who stopped to stare at the girl tied up with a rope someone said whats happening another replied hes sold his daughter for a cow gwenda saw a look of panic cross her fathers face he was wishing he had done this up a quiet alley but he was not smart enough to have foreseen the public reaction gwenda realized the bystanders might be her only hope caris waved to a monk who came out of the priory gates brother godwyn she called come and settle an argument please she looked triumphantly at sim the priory has jurisdiction over all bargains agreed at the fleece fair she said brother godwyn is the sacrist i think youll have to accept his authority godwyn said hello cousin caris whats the matter sim grunted with disgust your cousin is he godwyn gave him a frosty look whatever the dispute is here i shall try to give a fair judgement as a man of god you can depend on me for that i hope and very glad to hear it sir sim said becoming obsequious joby was equally oily i know you brother my son philemon is devoted to you youve been the soul of kindness to him all right enough of that godwyn said whats going on caris said joby here wants to sell gwenda for a cow tell him he cant joby said shes my daughter sir and shes eighteen years old and a maid so shes mine to do with what i will godwyn said all the same it seems a shameful business selling your children joby became pathetic i wouldnt do it sir only ive three more at home and im a landless labourer with no means to feed the children through the winter unless i have a cow and our old one has died there was a sympathetic murmur from the growing crowd they knew about winter hardship and the extremes to which a man might have to go to feed his family gwenda began to despair sim said shameful you may think it brother godwyn but is it a sin he spoke as if he already knew the answer and gwenda guessed he might have had this argument before in a different place with obvious reluctance godwyn said the bible does appear to sanction selling your daughter into slavery the book of exodus chapter twentyone well there you are then said joby its a christian act caris was outraged the book of exodus she said scornfully one of the bystanders joined in we are not the children of israel she said she was a small chunky woman with an underbite that gave her jaw a determined look although dressed poorly she was assertive gwenda recognized her as madge the wife of mark webber there is no slavery today madge said sim said then what of apprentices who get no pay and may be beaten by their master or novice monks and nuns or those who skivvy for bed and board in the palaces of the nobility madge said their life may be hard but they cant be bought and sold can they brother godwyn i dont say that the trade is lawful godwyn responded i studied medicine at oxford not law but i can find no reason in holy scripture or the teachings of the church to say that what these men are doing is a sin he looked at caris and shrugged im sorry cousin madge webber folded her arms across her chest well chapman how are you going to take the girl out of town at the end of a rope he said same way i brought the cow in ah but you didnt have to get the cow past me and these people gwendas heart leaped with hope she was not sure how many of the bystanders supported her but if it came to a fight they were more likely to side with madge who was a townswoman than with sim an outsider ive dealt with obstinate women before sim said and his mouth twisted as he spoke theyve never given me much trouble madge put her hand on the rope perhaps youve been lucky he snatched the rope away keep your hands off my property and you wont get hurt deliberately madge put a hand on gwendas shoulder sim shoved madge roughly and she staggered back but there was a murmur of protest from the crowd a bystander said you wouldnt do that if youd seen her husband there was a ripple of laughter gwenda recalled madges husband mark a gentle giant if only he would show up but it was john constable who arrived his welldeveloped nose for trouble bringing him to any crowd almost as soon as it gathered well have no shoving he said are you causing trouble chapman gwenda became hopeful again chapmen had a bad reputation and the constable was assuming sim was the cause of the trouble sim turned obsequious something he could obviously do quicker than changing his hat beg pardon master constable he said but when a man has paid an agreed price for his purchase he must be allowed to leave kingsbridge with his goods intact ot course john had to agree a market town depended on its reputation for fair dealing but what have you bought this girl oh john looked thoughtful who sold her i did said joby im her father sim went on and this woman with the big chin threatened to stop me taking the girl away so i did said madge for ive never heard of a woman being bought and sold in kingsbridge market and nor has anyone else around here joby said a man may do as he will with a child of his own he looked around the crowd appealingly is there anyone here who will disagree with that gwenda knew that no one would some people treated their children kindly and some harshly but all were agreed that the father must have absolute power over the child she burst out angrily you wouldnt stand there deaf and dumb if you had a father like him how many of you were sold by your parents how many of you were made to steal when you were children and had hands small enough to slide into folks wallets joby started to look worried shes raving now master constable he said no child of mine ever stole never mind that said john everyone listen to me i shall make a ruling on this those who disagree with my decision can complain to the prior if theres any shoving by anyone or any other kind of rough stuff i shall arrest everyone involved in it i hope thats clear he looked around belligerently no one spoke they were eager to hear his decision he went on i know of no reason why this trade is unlawful therefore sim chapman is allowed to go his way with the girl joby said i told you so didnt shut your damn mouth joby you fool said the constable sim get going and make it quick madge webber if you raise a hand ill put you in the stocks and your husband wont stop me either and not a word from you caris wooler please you may complain to your father about me if you wish before john had finished speaking sim jerked hard on the rope gwenda was tipped forward and stuck a foot out in front of her to keep from falling to the ground then somehow she was moving along stumbling and half running down the street out of the corner of her eye she saw caris alongside her then john constable seized caris by the arm she turned to protest to him and a moment later she disappeared from gwendas sight sim walked quickly down the muddy main street hauling on the rope keeping gwenda just off balance as they approached the bridge she began to feel desperate she tried jerking back on the rope but he responded with an extra strong heave that threw her down in the mud her arms were still pinioned so she could not use her hands to protect herself and she fell flat bruising her chest her face squelching into the ooze she struggled to her feet giving up all resistance roped like an animal hurt frightened and covered in filthy mud she staggered after her new owner across the bridge and along the road that led into the forest sim chapman led gwenda through the suburb of newtown to the crossroads known as gallows cross where criminals were hanged there he took the road south towards wigleigh he tied her rope to his wrist so that she could not break away even when his attention wandered her dog skip followed them but sim threw stones at him and after one hit him full on the nose he retreated with his tail between his legs after several miles as the sun began to set sim turned into the forest gwenda had seen no feature beside the road to mark the spot but sim seemed to have chosen carefully for a few hundred paces into the trees they came upon a pathway looking down gwenda could see the neat impressions of dozens of small hooves in the earth and she realized it was a deer path it would lead to water she guessed sure enough they came to a little brook the vegetation on either side trodden into mud sim knelt beside the stream filled his cupped hands with clear water and drank then he moved the rope so that it was around her neck freeing her hands and motioned her to the water she washed her hands in the stream then drank thirstily wash your face he ordered youre ugly enough by nature she did as she was told wondering wearily why he cared how she looked the path continued on the farther side of the drinking hole they walked on gwenda was a strong girl capable of walking all day but she was defeated and miserable and scared and that made her feel exhausted whatever fate awaited her at their destination it was probably worse than this but all the same she yearned to get there so that she could sit down darkness was falling the deer path wound through trees for a mile then petered out at the foot of a hill sim stopped beside a particularly massive oak tree and gave a low whistle a few moments later a figure materialized out of the halflit woodland and said all right sim all right jed what you got there a fruit tart you shall have a slice jed same as the others so long as youve got sixpence gwenda realized what sim had planned he was going to prostitute her the realization hit her like a blow and she staggered and fell to her knees sixpence eh jeds voice seemed to come from far away but all the same she could hear the excitement in his voice how old is she her father claimed she was eighteen sim jerked on the rope stand up you lazy cow were not there yet gwenda got to her feet thats why he wanted me to wash my face she thought and for some reason the realization made her cry she wept hopelessly as she stumbled along in sims footsteps until they came to a clearing with a fire in the middle through her tears she perceived fifteen or twenty people lying around the edge of the clearing most of them wrapped in blankets or cloaks almost all those watching her in the firelight were male but she caught sight of a white female face hard in expression but smoothchinned that stared at her briefly then disappeared back into a bundle of ragged bedding an upturned wine barrel and a scattering of wooden cups testified to a drunken party gwenda realized that sim had brought her to a den of outlaws she groaned how many of them would she be forced to submit to as soon as she asked herself the question she knew the answer all of them sim dragged her across the clearing to a man who was sitting upright his back against a tree all right tam said sim gwenda knew instantly who the man must be the most famous outlaw in the county he was called tam hiding he had a handsome face though it was reddened by drink people said he was nobleborn but they always said that about famous outlaws looking at him gwenda was surprised by his youth he was in his midtwenties but then to kill an outlaw was no crime so in all probability few lived to be old tam said all right sim i traded alwyns cow for a girl well done tams speech was only slightly slurred were going to charge the boys sixpence but of course you can have a free go i expect youd like to be first tam peered at her with bloodshot eyes perhaps it was wishful thinking but she imagined she saw a hint of pity in his look he said no thanks sim you go ahead and let the boys have a good time though you might want to leave it until tomorrow we got a barrel of good wine from a pair of monks who were taking it to kingsbridge and most of the lads are dead drunk now gwendas heart leaped with hope perhaps her torture would be postponed ill have to consult alwyn sim said doubtfully thanks tam he turned away pulling gwenda behind him a few yards away a broadshouldered man was struggling to his feet sim said all right alwyn the phrase seemed to serve the outlaws as a greeting and a recognition code alwyn was at the badtempered phase of drunkenness what have you got a fresh young girl alwyn took gwendas chin in his hand gripping unnecessarily hard and turned her face to the firelight she was forced to look into his eyes he was young like tam hiding but with the same unhealthy air of dissipation his breath smelled of drink by christ you picked an ugly one he said for once gwenda was happy to be thought ugly perhaps alwyn would not want to do anything to her i took what i could get sim said testily if the man had a beautiful daughter he wouldnt sell her for a cow would he hed marry her to the son of a rich wool merchant instead the thought of her father made gwenda angry he must have known or suspected that this would happen how could he do it to her all right all right it doesnt matter alwyn said to sim with only two women in the group most of the lads are desperate tam said we should wait until tomorrow because theyre all too drunk tonight but its up to you tams right half of them are asleep already gwendas fear retreated a little anything could happen overnight good sim said im dogtired anyway he looked at gwenda lie down you he never called her by her name she lay down and he used the rope to tie her feet together and her hands behind her back then he and alwyn lay down either side of her in a few moments both men were asleep gwenda was exhausted but she had no thought of sleep with her arms behind her back every position was painful she tried to move her wrists within the rope but sim had pulled it tight and knotted it well all she achieved was to break her skin so that the rope burned her flesh despair turned to helpless rage and she pictured herself taking revenge on her captors lashing them all with a whip as they cowered in front of her it was a pointless fantasy she turned her mind to practical means of escape first she would have to make them untie her that done she would have to get away ideally she would somehow ensure they could not follow her and recapture her it seemed impossible gwenda was cold when she woke up it was midsummer but the weather was cool and she had no covering but her light dress the sky was turning from black to grey she looked around the clearing in the faint light no one was moving she needed to pee she thought of doing it there and soaking her dress if she made herself disgusting so much the better almost as soon as the thought occurred to her she dismissed it that would be giving up she was not giving up but what was she going to do alwyn was sleeping beside her with his long dagger in its sheath still attached to his belt and that gave her the glimmer of an idea she was not sure she had the nerve to carry out the plan that was forming in her mind but she refused to think about how scared she was she just had to do it although her ankles were tied together she could move her legs she kicked alwyn at first he did not seem to feel it she kicked him again and he moved the third time he sat upright was that you he said blearily i have to pee she said not in the clearing its one of tams rules go twenty paces for a piss fifty for a shit so even outlaws live by rules he stared uncomprehendingly at her the irony escaped him he was not a clever man she realized that was helpful but he was strong and mean she would have to be very cautious she said i cant go anywhere tied up grumbling he undid the rope around her ankles the first part of her plan had worked now she was even more frightened she struggled to her feet all the muscles of her legs ached from a night of constriction she took a step stumbled and fell down again its so hard with my hands tied she said he ignored that the second part of her plan had not worked she would have to keep trying she got up again and walked into the trees with alwyn following her he was counting paces on his fingers the first time he got to ten he started again the second time he said far enough she looked at him helplessly i cant lift my dress she said would he fall for this he stared dumbly at her she could almost hear his brain working rumbling like the gears of a water mill he could lift her dress while she peed but that was the kind of thing a mother did for a toddler and he would find it humiliating alternatively he could untie her hands with hands and feet free she might make a run for it but she was small weary and cramped there was no way she could outrun a man with long muscular legs he must be thinking that the risk was not serious he untied the rope around her wrists she looked away from him so that he would not see her look of triumph she rubbed her forearms to restore the circulation she wanted to poke his eyeballs out with her thumbs but instead she smiled as sweetly as she could and said thank you as if he had performed an act of kindness he said nothing but stood watching her waiting she expected him to look away when she hitched up the skirt of her dress and squatted but he only stared more intensely she held his gaze unwilling to act ashamed while she did what was natural his mouth opened slightly and she could tell he was breathing harder now came the hardest part she stood up slowly letting him get a good look before she dropped her dress he licked his lips and she knew she had him she went closer and stood in front of him will you be my protector she said using a littlegirl voice that did not come naturally to her he showed no sign of suspicion he did not speak but grasped her breast in his rough hand and squeezed she gasped with pain not so hard she took his hand in hers be more gentle she moved his hand against her breast rubbing the nipple so that it stood up its nicer if youre gentle he grunted but continued to rub softly then he took the neckline of her dress in his left hand and drew his dagger the knife was a foot long with a point and the blade gleamed with recent sharpening he obviously intended to cut her dress off that would not do it would leave her naked she took his wrist in a light grip restraining him momentarily you dont need the knife she said look she stepped back undid her belt and with a quick movement pulled the dress off over her head it was her only garment she stretched it out on the ground then lay on it she tried to smile at him she felt sure the result was a horrible grimace then she parted her legs he hesitated only for a moment keeping the knife in his right hand he pushed down his underdrawers and knelt between her thighs he pointed the dagger at her face and said any trouble and ill slice your cheek open you wont need to do that she said she was trying desperately to think what words such a man would like to hear from a woman my big strong protector she said he showed no reaction to that he lay over her thrusting blindly not so fast she said gritting her teeth against the pain of his clumsy stabs she reached between her legs and guided him inside throwing her legs up to make the entrance easier he reared over her taking his weight on his arms he put the dagger on the grass beside her head covering the hilt with his right hand he groaned as he moved inside her she moved with him keeping up the pretence of willingness watching his face forcing herself not to glance sideways at the dagger waiting for her moment she was both scared and disgusted but a small part of her mind remained calm and calculating he closed his eyes and lifted his head like an animal scenting the breeze his arms were straight holding him up she risked a look at the knife he had moved his hand slightly so that it only partly covered the hilt she could grab it now but how fast would he react she looked at his face again his mouth was twisted in a rictus of concentration he thrust faster and she matched his motion to her dismay she felt a glow spread through her loins she was appalled at herself the man was a murdering outlaw little better than a beast and he was planning to prostitute her for sixpence a time she was doing this to save her life not for enjoyment yet there was a gush of moisture inside her and he thrust faster she sensed that his moment of climax was near it was now or never he gave a groan that sounded like surrender and she moved she snatched the knife from under his hand there was no change in the expression of ecstasy on his face he had not noticed her movement terrified that he would see what she was doing and stop her at the last moment she did not hesitate but jabbed upwards jerking her shoulders up from the lying position as she did so he sensed her movement and opened his eyes shock and fear showed on his face stabbing wildly she stuck the knife into his throat just below the jaw she cursed knowing she had missed the most vulnerable parts of the neck the breathingpipe and the jugular vein he roared with pain and rage but he was not incapacitated and she knew she was as close to death as she had ever been she moved instinctively without forethought using her left arm she struck at the inside of his elbow he could not prevent the bending of his arm and involuntarily he slumped she pushed harder at the footlong dagger and his weight dragged him down on to the blade as the knife entered his head from below blood gushed from his open mouth falling on her face and she jerked her head aside reflexively but she kept pushing on the knife the blade met resistance for a moment then slipped through until his eyeball seemed to explode and she saw the point emerge from the eye socket in a spray of blood and brains he slumped on top of her dead or nearly so his weight knocked the breath out of her it was like being stuck under a fallen tree for a moment she was helpless to move to her horror she felt him ejaculate inside her she was filled with superstitious terror he was more frightening like this than when he had threatened her with a knife panicking she wriggled out from under him she scrambled to her feet shakily breathing hard she had his blood on her breasts and his seed on her thighs she glanced fearfully towards the outlaws camp had anyone been awake to hear alwyns shout if they had all been asleep had the sound wakened any of them trembling she pulled her dress over her head and buckled her belt she had her wallet and her own small knife mainly used for eating she hardly dared take her eyes off alwyn she had a dreadful feeling he might still be alive she knew she should finish him off but she could not bring herself to do it a sound from the direction of the clearing startled her she needed to get away fast she looked around getting her bearings then headed in the direction of the road there was a sentry near the big oak tree she recalled with a sudden start of fear she walked softly through the woods careful to make no sound as she approached the tree then she saw the sentry jed his name was fast asleep on the ground she tiptoed past him it took all her will power not to break into a mad run but he did not stir she found the deer path and followed it to the brook it seemed there was no one on her tail she washed the blood off her face and chest then splashed cold water on her private parts she drank deeply knowing she had a long walk ahead feeling slightly less frantic she continued along the deer path as she walked she listened how soon would the outlaws find alwyn she had not even tried to conceal the body when they figured out what had happened they would surely come after her for they had given a cow for her and that was worth twelve shillings half a years pay for a labourer such as her father she reached the road for a woman travelling alone the open road was almost as hazardous as a forest track tam hidings group were not the only outlaws and there were plenty of other men squires peasant boys bands of menatarms who might take advantage of a defenceless woman but her first priority was to get away from sim chapman and his cronies so speed was paramount which direction should she take if she went home to wigleigh sim might follow her there and claim her back and there was no telling how her father would deal with that she needed friends she could trust caris would help her she set off for kingsbridge it was a clear day but the road was muddy from many days of rain and walking was that much more difficult after a while she reached the top of a hill looking back she could see along the road for about a mile at the far limit of her vision she saw a lone figure striding along he wore a yellow tunic sim chapman she broke into a run the case against crazy nell was heard in the north transept of the cathedral on saturday at noon bishop richard presided over the ecclesiastical court with prior anthony on his right and on his left his personal assistant archdeacon lloyd a dour blackhaired priest who was said to do all the actual work of the bishopric there was a big crowd of townspeople a heresy trial was good entertainment and kingsbridge had not seen one for years many craftsmen and labourers finished work at midday on saturdays outside the fleece fair was coming to an end tradespeople dismantling their stalls and packing up their unsold goods buyers preparing for the journey home or arranging to consign their purchases by raft downriver to the sea port of melcombe waiting for the trial to begin caris thought gloomily of gwenda what was she doing now sim chapman would force her to have sex with him for sure but that might not be the worst thing to happen to her what else would she have to do as his slave caris had no doubt gwenda would try to escape but would she succeed and if she failed how would sim punish her caris realized she might never find out it had been a strange week buonaventura caroli had not changed his mind the florentine buyers would not return to kingsbridge at least until the priory improved facilities for the fleece fair cariss father and the other leading wool merchants had spent half the week shut up with earl roland merthin continued in a strange mood withdrawn and gloomy and it was raining again nell was dragged into church by john constable and friar murdo her only garment was a sleeveless surcoat fastened at the front but revealing her bony shoulders she had no hat or shoes she struggled feebly in the mens grasp shouting imprecations when they got her quietened down a series of townspeople came forward to attest that they had heard her call upon the devil they were telling the truth nell threatened people with the devil all the time for refusing to give her a handout for standing in her way on the street for wearing a good coat or for no reason at all each witness related some misfortune that had followed the curse a goldsmiths wife had lost a valuable brooch an innkeepers chickens had all died a widow developed a painful boil on her bottom a complaint that caused laughter but also carried conviction for witches were known to have a malicious sense of humour while this was going on merthin appeared beside caris this is so stupid caris said to him indignantly ten times the number of witnesses could come forward to say that nell cursed them and nothing bad ensued merthin shrugged people just believe what they want to believe ordinary people perhaps but the bishop and the prior should know better they are educated ive got something to tell you merthin said caris perked up perhaps she was about to learn the reason for his bad mood she had been looking at him sidelong but now she turned and saw that he had a huge bruise on the left side of his face what happened to you the crowd roared with laughter at some interjection of nells and archdeacon lloyd had to call repeatedly for quiet when merthin could be heard again he said not here can we go somewhere quiet she almost turned to leave with him but something stopped her all week long he had bewildered and wounded her by his coldness now at last he had decided he was ready to say what was on his mind and she was expected to jump at his command why should he set the timetable he had made her wait five days why should she not make him wait an hour or so no she said not now he looked surprised why not because it doesnt suit my convenience she said now let me listen as she turned from him she saw a hurt look cross his face and straight away she wished she had not been so cold but it was too late and she was not going to apologize the witnesses had finished bishop richard said woman do you say that the devil rules the earth caris was outraged heretics worshipped satan because they believed he had jurisdiction over the earth and god only ruled heaven crazy nell could not even understand such a sophisticated credo it was disgraceful that richard was going along with friar murdos ridiculous accusation nell shouted back you can shove your prick up your arse the crowd laughed delighted by this coarse insult to the bishop richard said if thats her defence archdeacon lloyd intervened someone should speak on her behalf he said he spoke respectfully but he seemed comfortable correcting his superior no doubt the lazy richard relied on lloyd to remind him of the rules richard looked around the transept who will speak for nell he called out caris waited but no one volunteered she could not allow this to happen someone must point out how irrational this whole procedure was when no one else spoke caris stood up nell is mad she said everyone looked around wondering who was foolish enough to side with nell there was a murmur of recognition most people knew caris but no great sense of surprise for she had a reputation for doing the unexpected prior anthony leaned over and said something in the bishops ear richard said caris the daughter of edmund wooler tells us that the accused woman is mad we had reached that conclusion without her assistance caris was goaded by his cool sarcasm nell has no idea what she is saying she calls upon the devil the saints the moon and the stars it has no more meaning than the barking of a dog you might as well hang a horse for neighing at the king she could not keep the note of scorn from her voice though she knew it was unwise to let your contempt show when addressing the nobility some of the crowd murmured agreement they liked a spirited argument richard said but you have heard people testify to the damage done by her curses i lost a penny yesterday caris rejoined i boiled an egg and it was bad my father lay awake all night coughing but no one cursed us bad things just happen there was much headshaking at this most people believed there was some malign influence behind every misfortune great or small caris had lost the support of the crowd prior anthony her uncle knew her views and had argued with her before now he leaned forward and said surely you dont believe that god is responsible for illness and misfortune and loss no who then caris imitated anthonys prissy tone surely you dont believe that every misfortune in life is the responsibility of either god or crazy nell archdeacon lloyd said sharply speak respectfully to the prior he did not realize anthony was cariss uncle the townspeople laughed they knew the prim prior and his independentminded niece caris finished i believe nell is harmless mad yes but harmless suddenly friar murdo was on his feet my lord bishop men of kingsbridge friends he said in his sonorous voice the evil one is everywhere among us tempting us to sin to lying greed of food drunkenness with wine puffedup pride and fleshly lust the crowd liked this murdos descriptions of sin called to the imagination delightful scenes of indulgence that were sanctified by his brimstone disapproval but he cannot go unobserved murdo went on his voice rising with excitement as the horse presses his hoofprints into the mud as the kitchen mouse makes dainty tracks across the butter as the lecher deposits his vile seed to grow in the womb of the deceived maid so the devil must leave his mark they shouted their approval they knew what he meant and so did caris the servants of the evil one may be known by the mark he leaves upon them for he sucks their hot blood as a child sucks the sweet milk from its mothers swollen breasts and like the child he needs a teat from which to suck a third nipple he had the audience rapt caris observed he began each sentence in a low quiet voice then built it up piling one emotive phrase on another to his climax and the crowd responded eagerly listening in silence while he spoke then shouting their approval at the end this mark is dark in colour ridged like a nipple and rises from the clear skin around it it may be on any part of the body sometimes it lies in the soft valley between a womans breasts the unnatural manifestation cruelly mimicking the natural but the devil best likes it to be in the secret places of the body in the groin on the private parts especially bishop richard said loudly thank you friar murdo you need go no farther you are demanding that the womans body be examined for the devils mark yes my lord bishop for all right no need for further argument your point is well made he looked around is mother cecilia close by the prioress was sitting on a bench on one side of the court with sister juliana and some of the senior nuns crazy nells naked body could not be examined by men so women would have to do it in private and report back the nuns were the obvious choice caris did not envy them their task most townspeople washed their hands and faces every day and the smellier parts of their bodies once a week allover bathing was at best a twiceayear ritual necessary though dangerous to the health however crazy nell never seemed to wash at all her face was grimy her hands were filthy and she smelled like a dunghill cecilia stood up richard said please take this woman to a private room remove her clothing examine her body carefully and come back to report faithfully what you find the nuns got up immediately and approached nell cecilia spoke soothingly to the mad woman and took her gently by the arm but nell was not fooled she twisted away throwing her arms into the air at that point friar murdo shouted i see it i see it four of the nuns managed to hold nell still the friar said no need to take off her clothes just look under her right arm as nell started to wriggle again he strode over to her and lifted her arm himself holding it high above her head there he said pointing into her armpit the crowd surged forward i see it someone shouted and others repeated the cry caris could see nothing other than normal armpit hair and she was unwilling to commit the indignity of peering she had no doubt that nell had some kind of blemish or growth there lots of people had marks on their skin especially the elderly archdeacon lloyd called for order and john constable beat the crowd back with a stick when at last the church was quiet richard stood up crazy nell of kingsbridge i find you guilty of heresy he said you shall now be tied to the back of a cart and whipped through the town then taken to the place known as gallows cross where you shall be hanged by the neck until you die the crowd cheered caris turned away in disgust with justice like this no woman was safe her eye lit on merthin waiting patiently for her all right she said badtemperedly what is it its stopped raining he said come down to the river the priory had a string of ponies for the senior monks and nuns to use when travelling plus some carthorses for transporting goods these were kept along with the mounts of prosperous visitors in a run of stone stables at the south end of the cathedral close the nearby kitchen garden was manured with the straw from the stalls ralph was in the stable yard with the rest of earl rolands entourage their horses were saddled ready to begin the twoday journey back to rolands residence at earlscastle near shiring they were waiting only for the earl ralph was holding his horse a bay called griff and talking to his parents i dont know why stephen was made lord of wigleigh while i got nothing he said were the same age and hes no better than i am at riding or jousting or fencing every time they met sir gerald asked the same hopeful questions and ralph had to give him the same inadequate answers ralph could have borne his disappointment more easily had it not been for his fathers pathetic eagerness to see him elevated griff was a young horse he was a hunter a mere squire did not merit a costly warhorse but ralph liked him he responded gratifyingly well when ralph urged him on in the hunt griff was excited by all the activity in the yard and impatient to get going ralph murmured in his ear quiet my lovely lad you shall stretch your legs later the horse calmed down at the sound of his voice be constantly on the alert for ways to please the earl sir gerald said then he will remember you when there is a post to be filled that was all very well ralph thought but the real opportunities came only in battle however war might be a little nearer today than it had been a week ago ralph had not been in on the meetings between the earl and the wool merchants but he gathered that the merchants were willing to lend money to king edward they wanted the king to take some decisive action against france in retaliation for french attacks on the south coast ports meanwhile ralph longed for some way to distinguish himself and begin to win back the honour the family had lost ten years ago not just for his father but for his own pride griff stamped and tossed his head to calm him ralph began to walk him up and down and his father walked with him his mother stood apart she was upset about his broken nose with father he walked past lady philippa who was holding the bridle of a spirited courser with a firm hand while she talked to her husband lord william she wore closefitting clothes which were suitable for a long ride but also emphasized her full bosom and long legs ralph was always on the lookout for excuses to talk to her but it did him no good he was just one of her fatherinlaws followers and she never spoke to him unless she had to as ralph watched she smiled at her husband and tapped him on the chest with the back of her hand in a gesture of mock reprimand ralph was filled with resentment why should it not be him with whom she was sharing such a moment of private amusement no doubt she would if he were lord of forty villages as william was ralph felt that his life was all aspiration when would he actually achieve something he and his father walked the length of the yard then turned and came back he saw a onearmed monk come out of the kitchen and cross the yard and was struck by how familiar the man looked a moment later he remembered how he knew the face this was thomas langley the knight who had killed one of the menatarms in the forest ten years ago ralph had not seen the man since that day but his brother merthin had for the knightbecomemonk was now responsible for supervising repairs to the priory buildings thomas wore a drab robe instead of the fine clothes of a knight and had his head shaved in the monkish tonsure he was heavier around the waist but still carried himself like a fighting man as thomas walked past ralph said casually to lord william there he goes the mystery monk william said sharply what do you mean brother thomas he used to be a knight and no one knows why he joined the monastery what the devil do you know of him williams tone showed anger although ralph had said nothing offensive perhaps he was in a bad mood despite the affectionate smiles of his beautiful wife ralph wished he had not begun the conversation i was here the day he came to kingsbridge he said he hesitated recalling the oath the children had sworn that afternoon because of that and because of williams inexplicable annoyance ralph did not tell the whole story he staggered into town bleeding from a sword wound he went on a boy remembers such things philippa said how curious she looked at her husband do you know what brother thomass story is certainly not william snapped how would i know a thing like that she shrugged and turned away ralph walked on glad to get away lord william was lying he said to his father in a low voice i wonder why dont ask any more questions about that monk father said anxiously its obviously a touchy subject at last earl roland appeared prior anthony was with him the knights and squires mounted up ralph kissed his parents and swung himself into the saddle griff danced sideways eager to be off the motion made ralphs broken nose hurt like fire he gritted his teeth there was nothing he could do but endure it roland went up to his horse victory a black stallion with a white patch over one eye he did not mount but took the bridle and began to walk still in conversation with the prior william called out sir stephen wigleigh and ralph fitzgerald ride ahead and clear the bridge ralph and stephen rode across the cathedral green the grass was trampled and the ground muddy from the fleece fair a few stalls were still doing business but most were closing and many had already gone they passed out through the priory gates on the main street ralph saw the boy who had given him a broken nose wulfric his name was and he came from stephens village of wigleigh the left side of his face was bruised and swollen where ralph had repeatedly punched him wulfric was outside the bell inn with his father mother and brother they appeared to be about to leave youd better hope you never meet me again ralph thought he tried to think of some insult to shout but he was distracted by the sound of a crowd as he and stephen rode down the main street their horses stepping adroitly through the mud they saw ahead of them a mob of people half way down the hill they were forced to stop the street was jammed by hundreds of men women and children shouting laughing and jostling for space they all had their backs to ralph he looked over their heads at the front of this unruly procession was a cart drawn by an ox tied to the back of the cart was a halfnaked woman ralph had seen this kind of thing before to be whipped through the town was a common punishment the woman wore only a skirt of rough wool secured at the waist by a cord her face when he could see it was begrimed and her hair was filthy so that at first he thought she was old then he saw her breasts and realized she was only in her twenties her hands were bound together and attached by the same rope to the back end of the cart she stumbled along behind it sometimes falling and being dragged writhing through the mud until she managed to get back on her feet the town constable followed vigorously lashing her bare back with a bull whip a strip of leather at the end of a stick the crowd led by a knot of young men were taunting the woman shouting insults laughing and throwing mud and rubbish she delighted them by responding screaming imprecations and spitting at anyone who got near her ralph and stephen urged their horses into the crowd ralph raised his voice clear the way he shouted at the top of his voice make way for the earl stephen did the same no one took any notice to the south of the priory the ground sloped steeply down to the river the bank on that side was rocky unsuitable for loading barges and rafts so all the wharves were on the more accessible south side in the suburb of newtown the quiet north side bloomed at this time of year with shrubbery and wild flowers merthin and caris sat on a low bluff overlooking the water the river was swollen with rain it moved faster than it used to merthin noticed and he could see why the channel was narrower than formerly that was because of the development of the riverside when he was a child most of the south bank had been a wide muddy beach with a swampy field beyond the river then had flowed at a stately pace and as a boy he had floated on his back from one side to the other but the new wharves protected from flooding by stone walls squeezed the same quantity of water into a smaller funnel through which it hurried as if eager to get past the bridge beyond the bridge the river widened and slowed around leper island ive done something terrible merthin said to caris unfortunately she looked particularly lovely today she wore a dark red linen dress and her skin seemed to glow with vitality she had been angry at the trial of crazy nell but now she just seemed worried and that gave her a vulnerable look that tugged at merthins heart she must have noticed how he had been unable to meet her eye all week but what he had to tell her was probably worse than anything she had imagined he had spoken to no one about this since the row with griselda elfric and alice no one even knew that his door had been destroyed he was longing to unburden himself but he had held back he did not want to talk to his parents his mother would be judgemental and his father would just tell him to be a man he might have talked to ralph but there had been a coolness between them since the fight with wulfric merthin thought ralph had behaved like a bully and ralph knew it he dreaded telling caris the truth for a moment he asked himself why it was not that he was afraid of what she would do she might be scornful she was good at that but she could not say anything worse than the things he said to himself constantly what he truly feared he realized was hurting her he could bear her anger it was her pain he could not face she said do you still love me he was not expecting the question but he answered without hesitation yes and i love you anything else is just a problem we can solve together he wished she were right he wished it so badly that tears came to his eyes he looked away so that she would not see a mob of people was moving on to the bridge following a slowmoving cart and he realized this must be crazy nell being whipped through the town on her way to gallows cross in newtown the bridge was already crowded with departing stallholders and their carts and the traffic was almost at a standstill whats the matter caris said are you crying i lay with griselda merthin said abruptly cariss mouth dropped open griselda she said unbelievingly im so ashamed i thought it must be elizabeth clerk shes too proud to offer herself cariss reaction to that surprised him oh so you would have done it with her too if shed suggested it thats not what i meant griselda dear st mary i thought i was worth more than that you are lupa she said using the latin word for a whore i dont even like her i hated it is that supposed to make me feel better are you saying you wouldnt be so sorry if youd enjoyed it no merthin was dismayed caris seemed determined to misinterpret everything he said whatever got into you she was crying oh for gods sake do you do that to every girl you see crying of course not i was just trying to explain to you how it happened even though i really didnt want it to her scorn got worse with everything he said dont talk rubbish she said if you hadnt wanted it to happen it wouldnt have listen to me please he said frustratedly she asked me and i said no then she cried and i put my arm around her to comfort her then oh spare me the sickening details i dont want to know he began to feel resentful he knew he had done wrong and he expected her to be angry but her contempt stung all right he said and he shut up but silence was not what she wanted she stared at him in dissatisfaction then said what else he shrugged whats the point in my speaking you just pour scorn on everything i say i dont want to listen to pathetic excuses but theres something you havent told me i can feel it he sighed shes pregnant cariss reaction surprised him again all the anger left her her face until now taut with indignation seemed to collapse only sadness remained a baby she said griselda is going to have your baby it may not happen he said sometimes caris shook her head griselda is a healthy girl well fed theres no reason she should miscarry not that id wish it he said though he was not quite sure that was true but what will you do she said it will be your child you will love it even if you hate its mother ive got to marry her caris gasped marry but that would be for ever ive fathered a child so i should take care of it but to spend your whole life with griselda i know you dont have to she said decisively think elizabeth clerks father didnt marry her mother he was a bishop theres maud roberts in slaughterhouse ditch she has three children and everyone knows the father is edward butcher hes already married and has four other children with his wife im saying they dont always force people to marry you could just carry on as you are no i couldnt elfric would throw me out she looked thoughtful so youve already talked to elfric talked merthin touched his bruised cheek i thought he was going to kill me and his wife my sister she screamed at me so she knows yes she said i have to marry griselda she never wanted me to be with you anyway i dont know why caris muttered she wanted you for herself that was news to merthin it seemed unlikely that the haughty alice would be attracted to a lowly apprentice i never saw any sign of that only because you never looked at her thats what made her so cross she married elfric in frustration you broke my sisters heart and now youre breaking mine merthin looked away he barely recognized this picture of himself as a heartbreaker how had things gone so wrong caris went quiet merthin stared moodily along the river to the bridge the crowd had come to a standstill he saw a heavy cart loaded with woolsacks was stuck at the southern end probably with a broken wheel the can pulling nell had stopped unable to pass the crowd were swarming around both carts and some people had climbed on to the woolsacks for a better view earl roland was also trying to leave he was at the town end of the bridge on horseback with his entourage but even they were having trouble getting the citizens to give way merthin spotted his brother ralph on his horse chestnutcoloured with a black mane and tail prior anthony who had evidently come to see the earl off stood wringing his hands with anxiety while rolands men forced their horses into the mob trying in vain to clear a passage merthins intuition rang an alarm something was badly wrong he felt sure though at first he did not know what he looked more closely at the bridge he had noticed on monday that the massive oak beams stretching from one piling to another across the length of the bridge were showing cracks on the upstream side and that the beams had been strengthened with iron braces nailed across the cracks merthin had not been involved in this job which was why he had not previously looked hard at the work on monday he had wondered why the beams were cracking the weakness was not half way between the uprights as he would have expected if the timbers had simply deteriorated over time rather the cracks were near the central pier where the strain should have been less he had not thought about it since monday there was too much else on his mind but now an explanation occurred to him it was almost as if that central pier was not supporting the beams but dragging them down that would mean that something had undermined the foundation beneath the pier and as soon as that thought occurred to him he realized how it could have happened it must be the faster flow of the river scouring the river bed from under the pier he remembered walking barefoot on a sandy beach as a child and noticing that when he stood at the seas edge letting the water wash over his feet the outgoing waves would suck the sand from under his toes that kind of phenomenon had always fascinated him if he was right the central pier with nothing underneath to support it was now hanging from the bridge hence the cracks elfrics iron braces had not helped in fact they might have worsened the problem by making it impossible for the bridge to settle slowly into a new stable position merthin guessed that the other pier of the pair on the farther downstream side of the bridge was still grounded the current surely spent most of its force on the upstream pier and attacked the second of the pair with reduced violence only one pier was affected and it seemed that the rest of the structure was knitted together strongly enough for the entire bridge to stay upright as long as it was not subjected to extraordinary strain but the cracks seemed wider today than on monday and it was not difficult to guess why hundreds of people were on the bridge a much greater load than it normally took and there was a heavily laden wool cart with twenty or thirty people sitting on the sacks of wool to add to the burden fear gripped merthins heart he did not think the bridge could withstand that level of strain for long he was vaguely aware that caris was speaking but her meaning did not penetrate his thoughts until she raised her voice and said youre not even listening theres going to be a terrible accident he said what do you mean we have to get everyone off the bridge are you mad theyre all tormenting crazy nell even earl roland cant get them to move theyre not going to listen to you i think it could collapse oh look said caris pointing can you see someone running along the road from the forest approaching the south end of the bridge merthin wondered what that had to do with anything but he followed her pointing finger sure enough he saw the figure of a young woman running her hair flying caris said it looks like gwenda behind her in hot pursuit was a man in a yellow tunic gwenda was more tired than she had ever been in her life she knew that the fastest way to cover a long distance was to run twenty paces then walk twenty paces she had started to do that half a day ago when she spotted sim chapman a mile behind her for a while she lost sight of him but when once again the road provided her with a long rearward view she saw that he too was walking and running alternately as mile succeeded mile and hour followed hour he gained on her by midmorning she had known that at this rate he would catch her before she reached kingsbridge in desperation she had taken to the forest but she could not stray far from the road for fear of losing her way eventually she heard running steps and heavy breathing and peered through the undergrowth to see sim go by on the road she realized that as soon as he came to a long clear stretch he would guess what she had done sure enough some time later she saw him come back she had pressed on through the forest stopping every few minutes to stand in silence and listen for a long time she had evaded him and she knew he would have to search the woods on both sides of the road to make sure she was not in hiding but her progress was also slow for she had to fight her way through the summer undergrowth and keep checking that she had not strayed too far from the road when she heard the sound of a distant crowd she knew she could not be far from the city and she thought she was going to escape after all she made her way to the road and cautiously looked out from a bush the way was clear in both directions and a quarter of a mile to the north she could see the tower of the cathedral she was almost there she heard a familiar bark and her dog skip emerged from the bushes at the side of the road she bent to pat him and he wagged joyfully licking her hands tears came to her eyes sim was not in sight so she risked the open road she wearily resumed her twenty paces of running and twenty of walking now with skip trotting happily beside her thinking this was a new game each time she switched she looked back over her shoulder the third time she did so she saw sim he was only a couple of hundred yards behind despair washed over her like a tidal wave she wanted to lie down and die but she was in the suburbs now and the bridge was only a quarter of a mile away she forced herself to keep going she tried to sprint but her legs refused to obey orders a staggering jog was the best she could manage her feet hurt looking down she saw blood seeping through the holes in her tattered shoes as she turned the corner at gallows cross she saw a huge crowd on the bridge ahead of her they were all looking at something and no one noticed her running for her life with sim chapman close behind she had no weapons other than her eating knife which would just about cut through a baked hare but would hardly disable a man she wished with all her heart that she had had the nerve to pull alwyns long dagger out of his head and bring it away with her now she was virtually defenceless she had a row of small bouses on one side of her the suburban homes of people too poor to live in the city and on the other side the pasture called lovers field owned by the priory sim was so close behind her that she could hear his breathing harsh and ragged like her own terror gave her a last burst of energy skip barked but there was more fear than defiance in his note he had not forgotten the stone that hit him on the nose the approach to the bridge was a swamp of sticky mud churned up by boots hooves and cartwheels gwenda waded through it desperately hoping that the heavier sim would be hampered even more than she at last she reached the bridge she pushed into the crowd which was less dense at this end they were all looking the other way where a heavy cart loaded with wool was blocking the passage of an oxcart she had to get to cariss house almost in sight now on the main street let me through she screamed fighting her way forward only one person seemed to hear her a head turned to look and she saw the face of her brother philemon his mouth dropped open in alarm and he tried to move towards her but the crowd resisted him as it resisted her gwenda tried to push past the team of oxen drawing the wool cart but an ox tossed its massive head and knocked her sideways she lost her footing and at that moment a big hand grasped her arm in a powerful grip and she knew she was recaptured ive got you you bitch sim gasped he pulled her to him and slapped her across the face as hard as he could she had no strength left to resist him skip snapped ineffectually at his heels you wont get away from me again he said despair engulfed her it had all been for nothing seducing alwyn murdering him running for miles she was back where she had started the captive of sim then the bridge seemed to move merthin saw the bridge bend over the central pier on the near side the entire roadbed sagged like a horse with a broken back the people tormenting nell suddenly found the surface beneath their feet unsteady they staggered grabbing their neighbours for support one fell backwards over the parapet into the river then another then another the shouts and catcalls directed at nell were quickly drowned out by yells of warning and screams of fright merthin said oh no caris screamed whats happening all those people he wanted to say people we grew up with women who have been kind to us men we hate children who admire us mothers and sons uncles and nieces cruel masters and sworn enemies and panting lovers theyre going to die but he could not get any words out for a moment less than a breath merthin hoped the structure might stabilize in the new position but he was disappointed the bridge sagged again this time the interlocked timbers began to tear free of their joints the longitudinal planks on which the people were standing sprang from their wooden pegs the transverse joints that supported the roadbed twisted out of their sockets and the iron braces that elfric had hammered across the cracks were ripped out of the wood the central part of the bridge seemed to lurch downward on the side nearest merthin the upstream side the wool cart tilted and the spectators standing and sitting on the piled woolsacks were hurled into the river great timbers snapped and flew through the air killing everyone they struck the insubstantial parapet gave way and the cart slid slowly off the edge its helpless oxen lowing in terror it fell with nightmare slowness through the air and hit the water with a thunderclap suddenly there were dozens of people jumping or falling into the river then scores of them those already in the water were struck by the falling bodies of those who came after and by the disintegrating timbers some small some huge horses fell with and without riders and carts fell on top of them merthins first thought was of his parents neither of them had gone to the trial of crazy nell and they would not have wanted to watch her punishment his mother thought such public spectacles beneath her dignity and his father was not interested when there was no more at stake than the life of a mad woman instead they had gone to the priory to say goodbye to ralph but ralph was now on the bridge merthin could see his brother fighting to control his horse griff which was rearing and kicking out with its front hooves ralph he yelled uselessly then the timbers under griff fell into the water no merthin shouted as horse and rider disappeared from view merthins gaze flashed to the other end where caris had spotted gwenda and he saw her struggling with a man in a yellow tunic then that part gave way and both ends of the bridge were dragged into the water by the collapsing middle the river was now a mass of writhing people panicking horses splintered timbers smashed carts and bleeding bodies merthin realized that caris was no longer by his side when he saw her hurrying along the bank towards the bridge clambering over rocks and running along the muddy strand she looked back at him and yelled hurry up what are you waiting for come and help this must be what a battlefield is like ralph thought the screaming the random violence the people falling the horses mad with fear it was the last thought he had before the ground dropped away beneath him he suffered a moment of sheer terror he did not understand what had happened the bridge had been there under his horses hooves but now it was not and he and his mount were tumbling through the air then he could no longer feel the familiar bulk of griff between his thighs and he realized they had separated an instant later he hit the cold water he went under and held his breath the panic left him now he felt scared but calm he had played in the sea as a child a seaside village nad been among his fathers domains and he knew he would rise to the surface though it might seem to take a long time he was weighed down by his thick travelling clothes now saturated and by his sword if he had been wearing armour he would have sunk to the bottom and stayed there for ever but at last his head broke the surface and he gasped for breath he had swum a good deal as a boy but that was many years ago all the same the technique came back to him more or less and he was able to keep his head above water he began to thrash his way towards the north bank beside him he recognized the chestnut coat and black mane of griff doing the same as he was swimming for the nearest shore the horses gait changed and he realized it had found its footing ralph let his feet drift down to the river bed and found that he too could stand he waded through the shallows the sticky mud of the bottom seemed to be trying to suck him back into midstream griff hauled himself on to a narrow strip of beach below the priory wall ralph did the same he turned and looked back there were several hundred people in the water many bleeding many screaming many dead near the edge he saw a figure wearing the redandblack livery of the earl of shiring floating face down he stepped back into the water grabbed the man by the belt and hauled him ashore he turned the heavy body over and his heart lurched with recognition it was his friend stephen the face was unmarked but stephens chest appeared to have caved in his eyes were wide open showing no sign of life there was no breath the body was too damaged even for ralph to feel for a heartbeat a few minutes ago i was envying him ralph thought now im the lucky one feeling irrationally guilty he closed stephens eyes he thought of his parents only a few minutes ago he had left them in the stable yard even if they had followed him they could not have reached the bridge yet they must be safe where was lady philippa ralph cast his mind back to the scene on the bridge just before the collapse lord william and philippa had been at the rear of the earls procession and had not yet ridden on to the bridge but the earl had ralph could picture the scene quite clearly earl roland had been close behind him impatiently urging his horse victory forward through the gap in the crowd made by ralph on griff roland must have fallen close to ralph ralph heard again his fathers words be constantly on the alert for ways to please the earl perhaps this was the big chance he had been looking for he thought excitedly he might not have to wait for a war he could distinguish himself today he would save earl roland or even just victory the thought energized him he scanned the river the earl had been wearing a distinctive purple robe and a black velvet surcoat it was hard to pick out an individual in the seething mass of bodies alive and dead then he saw a black stallion with a distinctive white patch over one eye and his heart leaped it was rolands mount victory was thrashing around in the water apparently unable to swim in a straight line probably having broken one or more legs floating next to the horse was a tall figure in a purple robe this was ralphs moment he threw off his outer clothing it would hamper his swimming wearing only his underdrawers he plunged back into the river and swam towards the earl he had to force his way through a mass of men women and children many of the living grabbed desperately at him delaying his progress he fought them off ruthlessly with merciless blows of his fists at last he reached victory the beasts struggles were weakening it was still for a moment and started to sink then when its head dipped into the water it began to struggle again easy boy easy ralph said into its ear but he felt sure it was going to drown roland was floating on his back eyes closed unconscious or dead one foot was caught in a stirrup and that seemed to be what was keeping his body from going down he had lost his hat and the top of his head was a bloody mess ralph could not see how a man could live after such an injury all the same he would rescue him there would surely be some reward just for the corpse when it was that of an earl he tried to pull rolands foot from the stirrup but he found the strap was twisted tight around the ankle he felt for his knife and realized it was attached to his belt which he had left on the shore with the rest of his outer clothing but the earl had weapons ralph fumbled rolands dagger from its sheath victorys convulsions made it difficult for ralph to cut the strap each time he caught hold of the stirrup the dying horse jerked it from his grasp before he could bring the knife to bear on the leather he cut the back of his own hand in the struggle finally he braced himself against the horses side with both feet for stability and in that position he was able to slice through the stirrup strap now he had to drag the unconscious earl to the bank ralph was not a strong swimmer and he was already panting with exhaustion to make matters worse he could not breathe through his broken nose so his mouth kept filling with river water he paused for a moment leaning his weight on the doomed victory trying to catch his breath but the earls body now unsupported began to sink and ralph realized he could not rest he grabbed rolands ankle in his right hand and started to swim for the shore he found it harder to keep his head above the surface when he had only one hand free for swimming he did not look back at roland if the earls head went under water there was nothing ralph could do about it after a few seconds he was gasping for air and his limbs were aching he was not used to this he was young and strong and his whole life was spent hunting jousting and fencing he could ride all day then win a wrestling match the same evening but now he seemed to be relying on disused muscles his neck hurt from the effort of keeping his head up he could not help breathing water in and that made him cough and choke he flapped his left arm madly and just managed to keep himself afloat he heaved at the bulky body of the earl made heavier by its watersoaked clothing he approached the shore with agonizing slowness at last he was close enough to put his feet on the river bed gulping air he began to wade still dragging roland when the water was thighhigh he turned and picked up the earl in his arms and carried him the last few steps to the shore he put the body on the ground and collapsed beside it exhausted with the last of his energy he felt the chest there was a strong heartbeat earl roland was alive the collapse of the bridge paralysed gwenda with fear then an instant later the sudden immersion in cold water shocked her back to normal when her head came above the surface she found herself surrounded by brawling yelling people some had found a piece of wood to keep them afloat but every other man tried to keep himself above water by leaning on someone else those leaned upon felt themselves being pushed under and lashed out with their fists to get free many of the blows missed those that connected were returned it was like being outside a kingsbridge tavern at midnight it would have been comical except that people were dying gwenda gasped air and went under she could not swim she came up again to her horror sim chapman was immediately in front of her blowing water out of his mouth like a fountain he began to go under obviously as unable to swim as she was in desperation he grabbed her shoulder and tried to use her for support she immediately sank finding her inadequate to keep him on the surface he let her go under the water holding her breath fighting off panic she thought i cant drown now after all ive been through next time she surfaced she felt herself shoved aside by a heavy body and she saw out of the corner of her eye the ox that had knocked her over a moment before the bridge fell apart it was apparently unharmed and swimming strongly she reached out kicking her feet and managed to get hold of one of its horns she pulled its head sideways for a moment then the powerful neck pulled back and its head came upright again gwenda managed to hang on her dog skip appeared beside her swimming effortlessly and yelped for joy to see her face the ox was heading for the suburban shore gwenda clung to its horn even though her arm felt as if it was about to drop off someone grabbed her and she looked over her shoulder to see sim again trying to use her to keep himself afloat he pulled her under without letting go of the ox she pushed sim off with her free hand he dropped back his head close to her feet taking careful aim she kicked him as hard as she could in the face he gave a cry of pain that was quickly silenced as his head went under the ox found its footing and lumbered out of the water splashing and snorting gwenda let go as soon as she could stand on the bottom skip gave a frightened bark and gwenda looked around warily sim was not on the bank she scanned the river looking for the flash of a yellow tunic among the bodies and the floating timbers she saw him keeping himself afloat by holding on to a plank kicking with his legs and coming straight towards her she could not run she had no strength left and her dress was waterlogged on this side of the river there was no place to hide and now that the bridge was down there was no way to cross to the kingsbridge side but she was not going to let him take her she saw that he was struggling and that gave her hope the plank would have kept him afloat if he had remained still but he was kicking for the shore and his thrashing destabilized him he would push down on the plank to lift himself up then kick to swim for shore and his head would go under again he might not make it to the bank she realized she could make certain of that she looked around quickly the water was full of bits of wood from huge loadbearing timbers to splinters her eye lit on a stout timber about a yard long she stepped into the water and grabbed it then she waded out into the river to meet her owner she had the satisfaction of seeing the light of fear in his eyes he paused in his paddling ahead of him was the woman he had tried to enslave angry determined and wielding a formidable club behind him death by drowning he came forward gwenda stood up to her waist in water and waited for her moment she saw sim pause again and guessed from his movements that he was trying to find the bottom with his feet now or never gwenda raised the wood over her head and stepped forward sim saw what she was about to do and scrabbled desperately to get out of the way but he was off balance neither swimming nor wading and he could not dodge gwenda brought the timber down on top of his head with all her might sims eyes rolled up and he slumped unconscious she reached forward and grabbed him by the yellow tunic she was not going to let him float away he might survive she pulled him to her then took his head in both hands and pushed it under the water it was more difficult than she had imagined to keep a body under even though he was out cold his greasy hair was slippery she had to grasp his head under her arm then lift her feet off the bottom so that her weight carried them both down she began to feel she might have overcome him how long did it take to drown a man she had no idea sims lungs must be filling with water already how would she know when she could let go suddenly he twisted she tightened her grip on his head for a moment she struggled to hold him she was not sure whether he had come round or was undergoing an unconscious convulsion his spasms were strong but seemed random her feet found the bottom again and she braced herself and held on she looked around no one was watching they were all too busy saving themselves after a few moments sims movements became weaker soon he was still gradually she relaxed her grip sim sank slowly to the bottom he did not come up again panting for breath gwenda waded to the shore she sat down heavily on the muddy ground she felt for the leather purse on her belt it was still there the outlaws had not got around to stealing it from her and she had kept it through all her trials it contained the precious love potion made by mattie wise she opened the purse to check and found nothing but shards of pottery the little vial had been smashed she started to cry the first person caris saw doing anything sensible was merthins brother ralph he was wearing nothing but a soaking wet pair of underdrawers he was uninjured apart from his red and swollen nose which he had had before ralph pulled the earl of shiring out of the water and laid him on the shore next to a body in the earls livery the earl had a grisly head injury that might be fatal ralph appeared exhausted by his efforts and unsure what to do next caris considered what she should tell him she looked around on this side the river bank consisted of small muddy beaches separated by rocky outcrops there was not much room to lay out the dead and injured here they would have to be taken elsewhere a few yards away a flight of stone steps led up from the river to a gate in the priory wall caris made a decision pointing she said to ralph take the earl that way into the priory lay him down carefully in the cathedral then run to the hospital tell the first nun you see to fetch mother cecilia immediately ralph seemed glad to have someone decisive to obey and did as he was told right away merthin started to wade into the water but caris stopped him look at that crowd of idiots she said pointing to the city end of the ruined bridge dozens of people were standing gawping at the scene of carnage in front of them get all the strong men down here she went on they can start pulling people out of the water and carrying them to the cathedral he hesitated they cant get down here from there caris saw his point they would have to clamber over the wreckage and that would probably lead to more injuries but the houses on this side of the main street had gardens that backed up against the priory walls and the house on the corner belonging to ben wheeler had a small door in the wall so that he could come to the river directly from his garden merthin was thinking the same he said ill bring them through bens house and across his yard good he clambered over the rocks pushed open the door and disappeared caris looked across the water a tall figure was wading on to the bank nearby and she recognized philemon gasping he said have you seen gwenda yes just before the bridge collapsed caris replied she was running from sim chapman i know but where is she now i dont see her the best thing you can do is start pulling people out of the water i want to find my sister if shes alive shell be among those who need to get out of the river all right philemon splashed back into the water caris was desperate to find out where her own family were but there was too much to do here she promised herself she would look for her father as soon as possible ben wheeler emerged from his gate a squat man with big shoulders and a thick neck he was a carter and got through life more by the use of his muscles than his brain he scrambled down to the beach then looked around not knowing what to do on the ground at cariss feet was one of earl rolands men wearing the redandblack livery apparently dead she said ben carry this man into the cathedral bens wife lib appeared carrying a toddler she was a little brighter than her husband and she asked shouldnt we deal with the living first we have to get them out of the water before we can tell whether theyre dead or alive and we cant leave bodies here on the bank because they will get in the way of rescuers take him to the church lib saw the sense of that youd better do as caris says ben she said ben picked up the body effortlessly and moved off caris realized they could move the bodies more quickly if they carried them on the kind of stretchers the builders used the monks could organize those where were the monks she had told ralph to alert mother cecilia but so far no one had appeared the injured would need wound dressings ointments and cleansing fluids every nun and monk would be needed matthew barber must be summoned there would be many broken bones to set and mattie wise to give potions to the injured to ease their pain caris needed to raise the alarm but she was reluctant to leave the riverside before the rescue operation was properly organized where was merthin a woman was crawling to the shore caris stepped into the water and pulled her to her feet it was griselda her wet dress clung to her and caris could see her full breasts and the swell of her thighs knowing that she was pregnant caris said anxiously are you all right i think so youre not bleeding no thank god caris looked around and was grateful to see merthin coming from ben wheelers garden at the head of a line of men some of them wearing the earls livery she called to him take griseldas arm help her up the steps to the priory she should sit down and rest for a while she added reassuringly shes all right though both merthin and griselda looked at her strangely and she realized in a flash how peculiar this situation was the three of them stood for a moment in a frozen triangle the mothertobe the father of her child and the woman who loved him then caris turned away breaking the spell and began to give orders to the men gwenda cried for a few moments then stopped it was not really the broken vial that made her so sad mattie could make up another love potion and caris would pay for it if either of them was still alive her tears were for everything she had been through in the last twentyfour hours from her fathers treachery to her bleeding feet she had no regrets about the two men she had killed sim and alwyn had tried to enslave her then prostitute her they deserved to die killing them was not even murder for it was no crime to do away with an outlaw all the same she could not stop her hands shaking she was exultant that she had beaten her enemies and won her freedom and at the same time she felt sickened by what she had done she would never forget the way the dying body of sim had twitched at the end and she feared that the vision of alwyn with the point of his own knife sticking out of his eye socket might appear in her dreams she could not help trembling in the grip of such strong contradictory feelings she tried to put the killings out of her mind who else was dead her parents had been planning to leave kingsbridge yesterday but what about her brother philemon caris her greatest friend wulfric the man she loved she looked across the river and was immediately reassured about caris she was on the far side with merthin and they appeared to be organizing a gang of men to pull people out of the water gwenda felt a surge of gratitude at least she had not been left completely alone in the world but what about philemon he was the last person she had seen before the collapse he should have fallen near her all other things being equal but she could not see him now and where was wulfric she doubted whether he would have cared to watch the spectacle of a witch being flogged through the town however he had been planning to return home to wigleigh with his family today and it was possible god forbid she thought that they had been crossing the bridge on their way home when the collapse happened she scanned the surface frantically looking for his distinctive tawny hair praying that she would see him swimming vigorously for the shore rather than floating face down but she could not see him at all she decided to cross over she could not swim but she thought that if she had a sizeable piece of wood to keep her afloat she might be able to kick herself across she found a plank pulled it from the water and walked fifty yards upstream to get well clear of the mass of bodies then she reentered the water skip followed fearlessly it was more taxing than she had expected and her wet dress was a drag on progress but she reached the far shore she ran to caris and they embraced caris said what happened i escaped and sim he was an outlaw was hes dead caris looked startled gwenda added hastily killed when the bridge collapsed she did not want even her best friend to know the exact circumstances she went on have you seen any of my family your parents left town yesterday i saw philemon a few moments ago hes looking for you thank god what about wulfric i dont know he hasnt been brought out of the river his fiancee left yesterday but his parents and his brother were in the cathedral this morning at the trial of crazy nell i have to look for him good luck gwenda ran up the steps to the priory and across the green a few of the stallholders were still packing up their effects and it seemed incredible to her that they could go about their normal business when hundreds of people had just been killed in an accident until she realized that they probably did not yet know it had happened only minutes ago though it felt like hours she passed through the priory gates into the main street wulfric and his family had been staying at the bell she ran inside an adolescent boy stood beside the ale barrel looking frightened gwenda said im looking for wulfric wigleigh theres no one here the boy said im the apprentice they left me to guard the beer someone had summoned everyone to the riverside gwenda guessed she ran out again as she passed through the doorway wulfric appeared she was so relieved that she threw her arms around him youre alive thank god she cried someone said the bridge collapsed he said is it true then yes its dreadful where are the rest of your family they left a while ago i stayed behind to collect a debt he held up a small leather money bag i hope they werent on the bridge when it fell i know how we can find out gwenda said come with me she took his hand he let her lead him into the priory precincts without withdrawing his hand she had never touched him for so long his hand was large the fingers rough with work the palm soft it sent thrills through her despite all that had happened she took him across the green and inside the cathedral theyre pulling people out of the river and bringing them here she explained there were already twenty or thirty bodies on the stone floor of the nave with more arriving continually a handful of nuns attended to the injured dwarfed by the mighty pillars around them the blind monk who normally led the choir seemed to be in charge put the dead on the north side he called out as gwenda and wulfric entered the nave wounded to the south suddenly wulfric let out a cry of shock and dismay gwenda followed his gaze and saw david his brother lying among the wounded they both knelt beside him on the floor david was a couple of years older than wulfric and the same large build he was breathing and his eyes were open but he seemed not to see them wulfric spoke to him dave he said in a low urgent voice dave its me wulfric gwenda felt something sticky and realized david was lying in a pool of blood wulfric said dave where are ma and pa there was no response gwenda looked around and saw wulfrics mother she was on the far side of the nave in the north aisle where blind carlus was telling people to put the dead wulfric gwenda said quietly what your ma he stood up and looked oh no he said they crossed the wide church wulfrics mother was lying next to sir stephen the lord of wigleigh his equal now she was a petite woman it was amazing that she had given birth to two such big sons in life she had been wiry and full of energy but now she looked like a fragile doll white and thin wulfric put his hand on her chest feeling for a heartbeat when he pressed down a trickle of water came from her mouth she drowned he whispered gwenda put her arm around his wide shoulders trying to console him with her touch she could not tell whether he noticed a manatarms wearing earl rolands redandblack livery came up carrying the lifeless body of a big man wulfric gasped again it was his father gwenda said lay him here next to his wife wulfric was stunned he said nothing seeming unable to take it in gwenda herself was bewildered what could she say to the man she loved in these circumstances every phrase that came to mind seemed stupid she was desperate to give him some kind of comfort but she did not know how as wulfric stared at the bodies of his mother and father gwenda looked across the church at his brother david seemed very still she walked quickly to his side his eyes were staring up blindly and he was no longer breathing she felt his chest no heartbeat how could wulfric bear it she wiped tears from her own eyes and returned to him there was no point in hiding the truth david is dead too she said wulfric looked blank as if he did not understand the dreadful thought occurred to gwenda that the shock might have caused him to lose his mind but he spoke at last all of them he said in a whisper all three all dead he looked at gwenda and she saw tears come to his eyes she put her arms around him and felt his big body shake with helpless sobs she squeezed him tightly poor wulfric she said poor beloved wulfric thank god ive still got annet he said an hour later the bodies of the dead and wounded covered most of the floor of the nave blind carlus the subprior stood in the middle of it all with thinfaced simeon the treasurer beside him to be his eyes carlus was in charge because prior anthony was missing brother theodoric is that you he said apparently recognizing the tread of the fairskinned blueeyed monk who had just walked in find the gravedigger tell him to get six strong men to help him were going to need at least a hundred new graves and in this season we dont want to delay burial right away brother said theodoric caris was impressed by how effectively carlus could organize things despite his blindness caris had left merthin efficiently managing the rescue of bodies from the water she had made sure the nuns and monks were alerted to the disaster then she had found matthew barber and mattie wise finally she had checked on her own family only uncle anthony and griselda had been on the bridge at the time of the collapse she had found her father at the guild hall with buonaventura caroli edmund had said theyll have to build a new bridge now then he had gone limping down to the river bank to help pull people out of the water the others were safe aunt petranilla had been at home cooking cariss sister alice had been with elfric at the bell inn her cousin godwyn had been in the cathedral checking on the repairs to the south side of the chancel griselda had now gone home to rest anthony was still unaccounted for caris was not fond of her uncle but she would not wish him dead and she looked anxiously for him every time a new body was brought into the nave from the river mother cecilia and the nuns were washing wounds applying honey as an antiseptic affixing bandages and giving out restorative cups of hot spiced ale matthew barber the briskly efficient battlefield surgeon was working with a panting overweight mattie wise mattie administering a calming medicine a few minutes before matthew set the broken arms and legs caris walked to the south transept there away from the noise the bustle and the blood in the nave the senior physicianmonks were clustered around the stillunconscious figure of the earl of shiring his wet clothes had been removed and he had been covered with a heavy blanket hes alive said brother godwyn but his injury is very serious he pointed to the back of the head part of his skull has shattered caris peered over godwyns shoulder she could see the skull like a broken pie crust stained with blood through the gaps she could see grey matter underneath surely nothing could be done for such a dreadful injury brother joseph the oldest of the physicians felt the same he rubbed his large nose and spoke through a mouth full of bad teeth we must bring the relics of the saint he said slurring his sibilants like a drunk as always they are his best hope for recovery caris had little faith in the power of the bones of a longdead saint to heal a living mans broken head she said nothing of course she knew she was peculiar in this respect and she kept her views to herself most of the time the earls sons lord william and bishop richard stood looking on william with his tall soldierly figure and black hair was a younger version of the unconscious man on the table richard was fairer and rounder merthins brother ralph was with them i pulled the earl out of the water he said it was the second time caris had heard him say it yes well done said william williams wife philippa was as dissatisfied as caris with brother josephs pronouncement isnt there something you can do to help the earl she said godwyn replied prayer is the most effective cure the relics were kept in a locked compartment under the high altar as soon as godwyn and joseph left to fetch them matthew barber bent over the earl peering at the head wound it will never heal like that he said not even with the help of the saint william said sharply what do you mean caris thought he sounded just like his father the skull is a bone like any other matthew answered it can mend itself but the pieces need to be in the right place otherwise it will grow back crooked do you think you know better than the monks my lord the monks know how to call upon the help of the spirit world i only set broken bones and where did you get this knowledge i was surgeon with the kings armies for many years i marched alongside your father the earl in the scottish wars i have seen broken heads before what would you do for my father now matthew was nervous under williams aggressive questioning caris felt but he seemed sure of what he was saying i would take the pieces of broken bone out of the brain clean them and try to fit them together again caris gasped she could hardly imagine such a bold operation how did matthew have the nerve to propose it and what if it went wrong william said and he would recover i dont know matthew replied sometimes a head wound has strange effects impairing a mans ability to walk or speak all i can do is mend his skull if you want miracles ask the saint so you cant promise success only god is allpowerful men must do what they can and hope for the best but i believe your father will die of this injury if it remains untreated but joseph and godwyn have read the books written by the ancient medical philosophers and i have seen wounded men die or recover on the battlefield its for you to decide whom to trust william looked at his wife philippa said let the barber do what he can and ask st adolphus to help him william nodded all right he said to matthew go ahead i want the earl lying on a table matthew said decisively near the window where a strong light will fall on his injury william snapped his fingers at two novice monks do whatever this man asks he ordered matthew said all i need is a bowl of warm wine the monks brought a trestle table from the hospital and set it up below the big window in the south transept two squires lifted earl roland on to the table face down please said matthew they turned him over matthew had a leather satchel containing the sharp tools from which barbers got their name he first took out a small pair of scissors he bent over the earls head and began to cut away the hair around the wound the earl had thick black hair that was naturally oily matthew snipped the locks and tossed them aside so that they landed on the floor when he had clipped a circle around the wound the damage was more clearly visible brother godwyn reappeared carrying the reliquary the carved ivoryandgold box containing the skull of st adolphus and the bones of one arm and a hand when he saw matthew operating on earl roland he said indignantly what is going on here matthew looked up if you would place the holy relics on the earls back as close as possible to his head i believe the saint will steady my hands godwyn hesitated clearly angry that a mere barber had taken charge lord william said do as he says brother or the death of my father may be laid at your door still godwyn did not obey instead he spoke to blind carlus standing a few yards away brother carlus i am ordered by lord william to i heard what lord william said carlus interrupted youd better do as he wishes it was not the answer godwyn had been hoping for his face showed angry frustration with evident distaste he placed the sacred container on earl rolands broad back matthew picked up a fine pair of forceps with a delicate touch he grasped the visible edge of a piece of bone and lifted it without touching the grey matter beneath caris watched entranced the bone came right away from the head with skin and hair attached matthew put it gently into the bowl of warm wine he did the same with two more small pieces of bone the noise from the nave the groans of the wounded and the sobs of the bereaved seemed to recede into the background the people watching matthew stood silent and still in a circle around him and the unconscious earl next he worked on the shards that remained attached to the rest of the skull in each case he snipped away the hair washed the area carefully with a piece of linen dipped in wine then used the forceps to press the bone gently into what he thought was its original position caris could hardly breathe the tension was so great she had never admired anyone as much as she admired matthew barber at this moment he had such courage such skill such confidence and he was performing this inconceivably delicate operation on an earl if it went wrong they would probably hang him yet his hands were as steady as the hands of the angels carved in stone over the cathedral doorway finally he replaced the three detached shards that he had put in the bowl of wine fitting them together as if he were mending a broken jar he pulled the skin of the scalp across the wound and sewed it together with swift precise stitches now rolands skull was complete the earl must sleep for a day and a night he said if he wakes give him a strong dose of mattie wises sleeping draught then he must lie still for forty days and forty nights if necessary strap him down then he asked mother cecilia to bandage the head godwyn left the cathedral and ran down to the river bank feeling frustrated and annoyed there was no firm authority carlus was letting everyone do as they wished prior anthony was weak but he was better than carlus he had to be found most of the bodies were out of the water now those who were merely bruised and shocked had walked away most of the dead and wounded had been carried to the cathedral those left were somehow entangled with the wreckage godwyn was both excited and frightened by the thought that anthony might be dead he longed for a new regime at the priory a stricter interpretation of benedicts rule along with meticulous management of the finances but at the same time he knew that anthony was his patron and that under another prior he might not continue to be promoted merthin had commandeered a boat he and two other young men were out in midstream where most of what had been the bridge was now floating in the water wearing only their underdrawers the three were trying to lift a heavy beam in order to free someone merthin was small in stature but the other two looked strong and well fed and godwyn guessed they were squires from the earls entourage despite their evident fitness they were finding it difficult to get leverage on the heavy timbers standing as they were in the well of a small rowingboat godwyn stood with a crowd of townspeople watching torn by fear and hope as the two squires raised a heavy beam and merthin pulled a body from beneath it after a short examination he called out marguerite jones dead marguerite was an elderly woman of no account impatiently godwyn shouted out cant you see prior anthony a look passed between the men on the boat and godwyn realized he had been too peremptory but merthin called back i can see a monks robe then its the prior godwyn shouted anthony was the only monk still unaccounted for can you tell how he is merthin leaned over the side of the boat apparently unable to get close enough from there he eased himself into the water eventually he called out still breathing godwyn felt both elated and disappointed then get him out quickly he shouted please he added there was no acknowledgement of what he said but he saw merthin duck under a partly submerged plank then relay instructions to the other two they eased the beam they were holding to one side letting it slip gently into the water then they leaned over the prow of the little boat to get hold of the plank merthin was under merthin seemed to be struggling to detach anthonys clothing from a tangle of boards and splinters godwyn watched frustrated that he could do nothing to speed the process he spoke to two of the bystanders go to the priory and get two monks to bring a stretcher tell them godwyn sent you the two men went up the steps and into the priory grounds at last merthin managed to pull the unconscious figure from the wreckage he drew him close then the other two heaved the prior into the boat merthin scrambled in after and they poled to the bank eager volunteers took anthony from the boat and put him on the stretcher brought by the monks godwyn examined the prior quickly he was breathing but his pulse was weak his eyes were closed and his face was ominously white his head and chest were only bruised but his pelvis seemed smashed and he was bleeding the monks picked him up godwyn led the way across the priory grounds into the cathedral make way he shouted he took the prior along the nave and into the chancel the holiest part of the church he told the monks to lay the body in front of the high altar the sodden robe clearly outlined anthonys hips and legs which were twisted so far out of shape that only his top half looked human within a few moments all the monks had gathered around the unconscious body of their prior godwyn retrieved the reliquary from earl roland and placed it at anthonys feet joseph placed a jewelled crucifix on his chest and wrapped anthonys hands around it mother cecilia knelt beside anthony she wiped his face with a cloth soaked in some soothing liquid she said to joseph he seems to have broken many bones do you want matthew barber to look at him joseph shook his head silently godwyn was glad the barber would have defiled the holy sanctuary better to leave the outcome to god brother carlus performed the last rites then led the monks in a hymn godwyn did not know what to hope for for some years he had been looking forward to the end of priory anthonys rule but in the last hour he had got a glimpse of what might replace anthony joint rule by carlus and simeon they were anthonys cronies and would be no better suddenly he saw matthew barber at the edge of the crowd looking over the monks shoulders studying anthonys lower half godwyn was about to order him indignantly to leave the chancel when he gave an almost imperceptible shake of the head and walked away anthony opened his eyes brother joseph cried praise god the prior seemed to want to speak mother cecilia who was still kneeling beside him leaned over his face to catch his words godwyn saw anthonys mouth move and wished he could hear after a moment the prior fell silent cecilia looked shocked is that true she said they all stared godwyn said what did he say mother cecilia she did not answer anthonys eyes closed a subtle change came over him he went very still godwyn bent over his body there was no breath he placed a hand over anthonys heart and felt no beat he grasped the wrist feeling for a pulse nothing he stood up prior anthony has left this world he said may god bless his soul and welcome him into his holy presence all the monks said amen godwyn thought now there will have to be an election part three june to december kingsbridge cathedral was a place of horror wounded people groaned in pain and cried out for help to god or the saints or their mothers every few minutes someone searching for a loved one would find him or her dead and would scream with the shock of sudden grief the living and the dead were grotesquely twisted with broken bones covered in blood their clothing ripped and sodden the stone floor of the church was slippery with water blood and riverside mud in the middle of the horror a small zone of calm and efficiency was centred on the figure of mother cecilia like a small quick bird she went from one horizontal figure to the next she was followed by a little flock of hooded nuns among them her longtime assistant sister juliana now respectfully known as old julie as she examined each patient she gave orders for washing for ointments for bandages for herbal medicines in the more serious cases she would summon mattie wise matthew barber or brother joseph she always spoke quietly but clearly her instructions simple and decisive she left most patients soothed and their relatives reassured and hopeful it reminded caris with dreadful vividness of the day her mother died there had been terror and confusion then though only in her heart in the same way mother cecilia had seemed to know what to do mama had died despite cecilias help just as many of todays wounded would die but there had been an orderliness about the death a sense that everything possible had been done some people appealed to the virgin and the saints when someone was sick but that only made caris more uncertain and frightened for there was no way to know if the spirits would help or even whether they had heard mother cecilia was not as powerful as the saints the tenyearold caris had known but all the same her assured practical presence had given caris both hope and resignation in a combination that brought peace to her soul now caris became part of cecilias entourage without really making a decision or even thinking about it she followed the commands of the most assertive person in the vicinity just as people had obeyed her directions at the riverside immediately after the collapse when no one else seemed to know what to do cecilias brisk practicality was infectious and those around her acquired some of the same cool competence caris found herself holding a small bowl of vinegar while a beautiful novice nun called mair dipped a rag in it and washed the blood from the face of susanna chepstow the timber merchants wife after that it was nonstop until well after dark thanks to the long summer evening all the floating bodies were retrieved from the river before nightfall though perhaps no one would ever know how many drowned people had sunk to the bottom or drifted downstream there was no trace of crazy nell who must have been pulled under by the cart to which she was tied unjustly friar murdo had survived having suffered nothing worse than a twisted ankle and had limped off to the bell to recuperate with hot ham and strong ale however the treatment of the injured continued after nightfall by candlelight some of the nuns became exhausted and had to stop others were overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy and fell apart misunderstanding what they were told and becoming clumsy so that they had to be dismissed but caris and a small core group carried on until there was no more to do it must have been midnight when the last knot was tied in the last bandage and caris staggered across the green to her fathers house papa and petranilla sat together in the dining hall holding hands grieving for the death of their brother anthony edmunds eyes were wet with tears and petranilla was crying inconsolably caris kissed them both but she could think of nothing to say if she had sat down she would have gone to sleep in the chair so she climbed the stairs she got into bed next to gwenda who was staying with her as always gwenda was deep in an exhausted sleep and did not stir caris closed her eyes her body weary and her heart aching with sorrow her father was mourning one person among the many but she felt the weight of them all she thought of her friends neighbours and acquaintances lying dead on the cold stone floor of the cathedral and she imagined the sadness of their parents their children their brothers and sisters and the sheer volume of grief overwhelmed her she sobbed into her pillow without speaking gwenda put an arm around her and hugged her after a few moments exhaustion overtook her and she fell asleep she got up again at dawn leaving gwenda still fast asleep she returned to the cathedral and continued the work most of the injured were sent home those who still needed to be watched over such as the stillunconscious earl roland were moved into the hospital the dead bodies were laid out in neat rows in the chancel the eastern end of the church to await burial the time flew by with hardly a moment to rest then late on sunday afternoon mother cecilia told caris to take a break she looked around and realized that most of the work was done that was when she started to think of the future until that moment she had felt unconsciously that ordinary life was over and she was living in a new world of horror and tragedy now she realized that this like everything else would pass the dead would be buried the injured would heal and somehow the town would struggle back to normal and she remembered that just before the bridge collapsed there had been another tragedy violent and devastating in its own way she found merthin down by the river with elfric and thomas langley organizing the cleanup with the help of fifty or more volunteers merthins quarrel with elfric had clearly been set aside in the emergency most of the loose timber had been retrieved from the water and stacked on the bank but much of the woodwork was still joined together and a mass of interlocked timber floated on the surface moving slightly on the rise and fall of the water with the innocent tranquillity of a great beast after it has killed and eaten the men were trying to break up the wreckage into manageable proportions it was a dangerous job with a constant risk that the bridge would collapse further and injure the volunteers they had tied a rope around the central part of the bridge now partly submerged and a team of men stood on the bank hauling on the rope in a boat in midstream were merthin and giant mark webber with an oarsman when the men on the bank rested the boat was rowed in close to the wreckage and mark directed by merthin attacked the beams with a huge foresters axe then the boat moved to a safe distance elfric gave a command and the rope team pulled again as caris watched a big section of the bridge came free everyone cheered and the men dragged the tangled woodwork to the shore the wives of some of the volunteers arrived with loaves of bread and jugs of ale thomas langley ordered a break while the men were resting caris got merthin on his own you cant marry griselda she said without preamble the sudden assertion did not surprise him i dont know what to do he said i keep thinking about it will you walk with me all right they left the crowd at the riverside and went up the main street after the bustle of the fleece fair the town was graveyard quiet everyone was staying indoors tending the sick or mourning the dead there cant be many families in town that dont have someone dead or injured she said there must have been a thousand people on the bridge either trying to leave town or tormenting crazy nell there are more than a hundred bodies in the church and weve treated about four hundred wounded and five hundred lucky ones merthin said we could have been on the bridge or near it you and i might be lying on the floor of the chancel now cold and still but weve been given a gift the rest of our lives and we mustnt waste that gift because of one mistake its not a mistake he said sharply its a baby a person with a soul youre a person with a soul too an exceptional one look at what youve been doing just now three people are in charge down there at the river one is the towns most prosperous builder another is the matricularius at the priory and the third is a mere apprentice not yet twentyone yet the townsmen obey you as readily as they obey elfric and thomas that doesnt mean i can shirk my responsibilities they turned into the priory close the green in front of the cathedral was rutted and trampled by the fair and there were boggy patches and wide puddles in the three great west windows of the church caris could see the reflection of a watery sun and ripped clouds a picture divided like a threesided altarpiece a bell began to ring for evensong caris said think how often youve talked of going to see the buildings of paris and florence will you give all that up i suppose so a man cant abandon his wife and child so youre already thinking of her as your wife he rounded on her ill never think of her as my wife he said bitterly you know who i love for once she could not think of a clever answer she opened her mouth to speak but no words came to her instead she felt a constriction in her throat she blinked away tears and looked down to hide her emotions he grasped her arms and pulled her close to him you know dont you she forced herself to meet his eye do i her vision blurred he kissed her mouth it was a new kind of kiss different from anything she had experienced before his lips moved gently but insistently against hers as if he was determined to remember the moment and she realized with dread that he was thinking this would be their last kiss she clung to him wanting it to go on for ever but all too soon he drew away i love you he said but im going to marry griselda life and death went on children were born and old people died on sunday emma butcher attacked her adulterous husband edward with his largest cleaver in a fit of jealous rage on monday one of bess hamptons chickens went missing and was found boiling in a pot over glynnie thompsons kitchen fire whereupon glynnie was stripped and flogged by tohn constable on tuesday howell tyler was working on the roof of st marks church when a rotten beam gave way beneath him and he fell crashing through the ceiling to the floor below and died immediately by wednesday the wreckage of the bridge had been cleared all but the stumps of two of the main piers and the timber was stacked on the bank the waterway was open and barges and rafts were able to leave kingsbridge for melcombe with wool and other goods from the fleece fair consigned to flanders and italy when caris and edmund went to the riverside to check on progress merthin was using the salvaged timbers to build a raft to ferry people across the river its better than a boat he explained livestock can walk on and off and carts can be driven on too edmund nodded gloomily it will have to do for the weekly market fortunately we should have a new bridge by the time of the next fleece fair i dont think so merthin said but you told me it would take nearly a year to build a new bridge a wooden bridge yes but if we build another wooden one it too will fall down why let me show you merthin took them to a pile of timber he pointed to a group of mighty posts these formed the piers theyre probably the famous twentyfour best oak trees in the land given to the priory by the king notice the ends caris could see that the huge posts had originally been sharpened into points though their outlines had been softened by years under water merthin said a timber bridge has no foundations the posts are simply driven into the river bed thats not good enough but this bridge has stood for hundreds of years edmund said indignantly he always sounded quarrelsome when he argued merthin was used to him and paid no attention to his tone of voice and now it has fallen down he said patiently something has changed wooden piers were once firm enough but no longer what can have changed the river is the river well for one thing you built a barn and a jetty on the bank and protected the property with a wall several other merchants did the same the old mud beach where i used to play on the south shore has mostly gone so the river can no longer spread itself into the fields as a result the water flows faster than it used to especially after the kind of heavy rain weve had this year so it will have to be a stone bridge yes edmund looked up and saw elfric standing by listening merthin says a stone bridge will take three years elfric nodded three building seasons most building was done in the warmer months caris knew merthin had explained to her that stone walls could not be constructed when there was a risk that the mortar might freeze before it had begun to set elfric went on one season for the foundations one for the arches and one for the roadbed after each stage the mortar must be left for three or four months to set hard before the next stage can be laid on top of it three years with no bridge edmund said gloomily four years unless you get started right away youd better prepare an estimate of the cost for the priory ive already started but its a long job it will take me another two or three days quick as you can edmund and caris left the riverside and walked up the main street edmund with his energetically lopsided stride he would never lean on anyones arm despite his withered leg to keep his balance he swung his arms as if he were sprinting the townspeople knew to give him plenty of room especially when he was in a hurry three years he said as they walked it will do terrible damage to the fleece fair i dont know how long it will take us to get back to normal three years when they got home they found cariss sister alice there her hair was tied up in her hat in an elaborate new style copied from lady philippa she was sitting at the table with aunt petranilla caris knew immediately from the looks on their faces that they had been talking about her petranilla went to the kitchen and came back with ale bread and fresh butter she filled a cup for edmund petranilla had cried on sunday but since then she had shown little sign of bereavement for her dead brother anthony surprisingly edmund who had never liked anthony seemed to grieve more tears would come to his eyes at unexpected moments during the day though they would disappear just as quickly now he was full of news of the bridge alice was inclined to question merthins judgement but edmund dismissed that notion impatiently the boys a genius he said he knows more than many master builders yet he isnt out of his apprenticeship caris said bitterly all the more shame that hes going to spend his life with griselda alice leaped to the defence of her stepdaughter theres nothing wrong with griselda yes there is caris said she doesnt love him she seduced him because her boyfriend left town thats all is that the story merthins telling you alice laughed sarcastically if a man doesnt want to do it he doesnt do it take my word edmund grunted men can be tempted he said oh so youre siding with caris are you papa alice said i shouldnt be surprised you usually do its not a question of taking sides edmund replied a man may not want to do a thing beforehand and he may regret it afterwards yet for a brief moment his wishes may change especially when a woman uses her wiles wiles why do you assume that she threw herself at him i didnt say that but i understand it began when she cried and he comforted her caris herself had told him this alice made a disgusted sound youve always had a soft spot for that insubordinate apprentice caris ate some bread with butter but she had no appetite she said i suppose theyll have half a dozen fat children and merthin will inherit elfrics business and become just another town tradesman building houses for merchants and fawning on clergymen for contracts just like his fatherinlaw petranilla said and very lucky so to do hell be one of the leading men of the town hes worthy of a better destiny is he really petranilla said in mock amazement and him the son of a knight who fell from grace and hasnt a shilling to buy shoes for his wife what exactly do you believe him to be destined for caris was stung by this mockery it was true that merthins parents were poor corrodiaries dependent on the priory for their food and drink for him to inherit a successful building business would indeed mean a jump up the social ladder yet she still felt he deserved better she could not say exactly what future she had in mind for him she just knew that he was different from everyone else in town and she could not bear the thought of his becoming like the rest on friday caris took gwenda to see mattie wise gwenda was still in town because wulfric was there attending to the burial of his family elaine edmunds housemaid had dried gwendas dress in front of the fire and caris had bandaged her feet and given her an old pair of shoes caris felt that gwenda was not telling the full truth about her adventure in the forest she said that sim had taken her to the outlaws and she had escaped he had chased after her and he had died in the bridge collapse john constable was satisfied with that story outlaws were outside the law as their name indicated so there was no question of sim bequeathing his property gwenda was free but something else had happened in the forest caris felt sure something gwenda did not want to talk about caris did not press her friend some things were best buried funerals were the business of the town this week the extraordinary manner of the deaths made little difference to the rituals of interment the bodies had to be washed the shrouds sewn for the poor the coffins nailed lor the rich the graves dug and the priests paid not all the monks were qualified as priests but several were and they worked in shifts all day every day conducting obsequies in the cemetery on the north side of the cathedral there were half a dozen small parish churches in kingsbridge and their priests were also busy gwenda was helping wulfric with the arrangements performing the traditional womans tasks washing the bodies and making the shrouds doing what she could to comfort him he was in a kind of daze he managed the details of the burial well enough but spent hours gazing into space with a slightly puzzled frown as if trying to make sense of a massive conundrum by friday the funerals were over but the acting prior carlus had announced a special service on sunday for the souls of all those killed so wulfric was staying until monday gwenda reported to caris that he seemed grateful for the company of someone from his own village but showed animation only when talking about annet caris offered to buy her another love potion they found mattie wise in her kitchen brewing medicines the little house smelled of herbs oil and wine i used just about everything i had on saturday and sunday she said i need to restock you must have made some money anyway gwenda said yes if i can collect it caris was shocked do people welsh on you some do i always try to collect the fee in advance while theyre still in pain but if they havent got the money there and then its hard to refuse them treatment most pay up afterwards but not all caris felt indignant on behalf of her friend what do they say all sons of things they cant afford it the potion did them no good they were given it against their will anything but dont worry there are enough honest people for me to continue whats on your mind gwenda lost her love potion in the accident thats easily remedied why dont you prepare it for her while caris was making up the mixture she asked mattie how many pregnancies end in a miscarriage gwenda knew why she was asking caris had told her all about merthins dilemma the two girls had spent most of their time together discussing either wulfrics indifference or merthins high principles caris had even been tempted to buy a love potion herself and use it on merthin though something held her back mattie gave her a sharp look but answered noncommittally no one knows many times a woman misses one month but comes on again the next did she get pregnant and lose the baby or was there some other reason its impossible to tell oh neither of you is pregnant though if thats what youre worried about gwenda said quickly how do you know by looking at you a woman changes almost immediately not just her belly and her breasts but her complexion her way of moving her mood i see these things better than most people thats why they call me wise so who is pregnant griselda elfrics daughter oh yes ive seen her shes three months gone caris was astonished how long three months or very nearly take a look at her she was never a thin girl but shes even more voluptuous now so why are you so shocked i suppose its merthins baby is it mattie always guessed these things gwenda said to caris i thought you told me it happened recently merthin didnt say exactly when but he gave me the impression it was not long ago and it only happened once now it seems hes been doing it to her for months mattie frowned why would he lie to make himself look not so bad gwenda suggested how could it be worse men are peculiar the way they think im going to ask him caris said right now she put down the jar and the measuring spoon gwenda said what about my love potion ill finish making it mattie said caris is in too much of a hurry thank you caris said and she went out she marched down to the riverside but for once merthin was not there she failed to find him at elfrics house either she decided he must be in the masons loft in the west front of the cathedral neatly fitted into one of the towers was a work room for the master mason caris reached it by climbing a narrow spiral staircase in a buttress of the tower it was a wide room well lit by tall lancet windows all along one wall were stacked the beautifully shaped wooden templates used by the original cathedral stone carvers carefully preserved and used now for repairs underfoot was the tracing floor the floorboards were covered with a layer of plaster and the original master mason jack builder had scratched his plans in the mortar with iron drawing instruments the marks thus made were white at first but they faded over time and new drawings could be scratched on top of the old when there were so many designs that it became hard to tell the new from the old a fresh layer of plaster was laid on top and the process began again parchment the thin leather on which monks copied out the books of the bible was much too expensive to be used for drawings in cariss lifetime a new writing material had appeared paper but it came from the arabs so monks rejected it as a heathen muslim invention anyway it had to be imported from italy and was no cheaper than parchment and the tracing floor had another advantage a carpenter could lay a piece of wood on the floor on top of the drawing and carve his template exactly to the lines drawn by the master mason merthin was kneeling on the floor carving a piece of oak in accordance with a drawing but he was not making a template he was carving a cog wheel with sixteen teeth on the floor close by was another smaller wheel and merthin stopped carving for a moment to put the two together and see how well they fitted caris had seen such cogs or gears in water mills connecting the mill paddle to the grindstone he must have heard her footsteps on the stone staircase but he was too absorbed in his work to glance up she regarded him for a second anger competing with love in her heart he had the look of total concentration that she knew so well his slight body bent over his work his strong hands and dextrous fingers making fine adjustments his face immobile his gaze unwavering he had the perfect grace of a young deer bending its head to drink from a stream this was what a man looked like she thought when he was doing what he was born to do he was in a state like happiness but more profound he was fulfilling his destiny she burst out why did you lie to me his chisel slipped he cried out in pain and looked at his finger christ he said and put his finger in his mouth im sorry caris said are you hurt nothing much when did i lie to you you gave me the impression that griselda seduced you one time the truth is that the two of you have been at it for months no we havent he sucked his bleeding finger shes three months pregnant she cant be it happened two weeks ago she is you can tell by her figure can you mattie wise told me why did you lie he looked her in the eye but i didnt lie he said it happened on the sunday of fleece fair week that was the first and only time then how could she be sure shes pregnant after only two weeks i dont know how soon can women tell anyway dont you know ive never asked anyway three months ago griselda was still with oh god caris said a spark of hope flared in her breast she was still with her old boyfriend thurstan the spark blazed into a flame it must be his baby thurstans not yours youre not the father is it possible merthin seemed hardly to dare to hope of course it explains everything if she had suddenly fallen in love with you shed be after you every chance she gets but you said she hardly speaks to you i thought that was because i was reluctant to marry her shes never liked you she just needed a father for her baby thurstan ran away probably when she told him she was pregnant and you were right there in the house and stupid enough to fall for her trick oh thank god thank mattie wise said merthin she caught sight of his left hand blood was welling from a finger oh i made you hurt yourself she cried she took his hand and examined the cut it was small but deep im so sorry its not that bad but it is she said not knowing whether she was talking about the cut or something else she kissed his hand feeling his hot blood on her lips she put his finger in her mouth sucking the wound clean it was so intimate that it felt like a sexual act and she closed her eyes feeling ecstatic she swallowed tasting his blood and shuddered with pleasure a week after the bridge collapsed merthin had built a ferry it was ready at dawn on saturday morning in time for the weekly kingsbridge market he had worked on it by lamplight all friday night and caris guessed he had not had time to speak to griselda and tell her he knew the baby was thurstans caris and her father came down to the riverside to see the new sensation as the first traders arrived women from the surrounding villages with baskets of eggs peasants with cartloads of butter and cheese and shepherds with flocks of lambs caris admired merthins work the raft was large enough to carry a horse and cart without taking the beast out of the shafts and it had a firm wooden railing to keep sheep from falling overboard new wooden platforms at water level on both banks made it easy for carts to roll on and off passengers paid a penny collected by a monk the ferry like the bridge belonged to the priory most ingenious was the system merthin had devised for moving the raft from one bank to the other a long rope ran from the south end of the raft across the river around a post back across the river around a drum and back to the raft where it was attached again at the north end the drum was connected by wooden gears to a wheel turned by a pacing ox caris had seen merthin carving the gears yesterday a lever altered the gears so that the drum turned in either direction depending on whether the raft was going or coming back and there was no need to take the ox out of its traces and turn it around its quite simple merthin said when she marvelled at it and it was when she looked closely the lever simply lifted one large cog wheel up out of the chain and moved into its place two smaller wheels the effect being to reverse the direction in which the drum turned all the same no one in kingsbridge had seen anything like it during the course of the morning half the town came to look at merthins amazing new machine caris was bursting with pride in him elfric stood by explaining the mechanism to anyone who asked taking the credit for merthins work caris wondered where elfric got the nerve he had destroyed merthins door an act of violence that would have scandalized the town had it not been overtaken by the greater tragedy of the bridge collapse he had beaten merthin with a stick and merthin still had the bruise on his face and he had colluded in a deception intended to make merthin marry griselda and raise another mans child merthin had continued to work with him feeling that the emergency outweighed their quarrel but caris did not know how elfric could continue to hold his head up the ferry was brilliant but inadequate edmund pointed this out on the far side of the river carts and traders were queuing all along the road through the suburbs as far as the eye could see it would go faster with two oxen merthin said twice as fast not quite no i could build another ferry theres already a second one edmund said pointing he was right ian boatman was rowing foot passengers across ian could not take carts he refused livestock and he charged two pence normally he had trouble scraping a living he took a monk across to leper island twice a day and found little other business but today he too had a queue merthin said well youre right in the end a ferry is not a bridge this is a catastrophe edmund said buonaventuras news was bad enough but this this could kill the town then you must have a new bridge its not me its the priory the prior is dead and theres no telling how long they will take to elect a new one well just have to pressure the acting prior to make a decision ill go and see carlus now come with me caris they walked up the street and entered the priory most visitors had to go to the hospital and tell one of the servants that they wanted to speak to a monk but edmund was too important a personage and too proud to beg the favour of an audience in that way the prior was lord of kingsbridge but edmund was alderman of the guild leader of the merchants who made the town what it was and he treated the prior as a partner in the governance of the town besides for the last thirteen years the prior had been his younger brother so he went straight to the priors house on the north side of the cathedral it was a timberframed house like edmunds with a hall and a parlour on the ground floor and two bedrooms upstairs there was no kitchen for the priors meals were prepared in the monastery kitchen many bishops and priors lived in palaces and the bishop of kingsbridge had a fine place in shiring but the prior of kingsbridge lived modestly however the chairs were comfortable the wall was hung with tapestries of bible scenes and there was a big fireplace to keep the house cosy in winter caris and edmund arrived midmorning the time when younger monks were supposed to labour and their elders to read edmund and caris found blind carlus in the hall of the priors house deep in conversation with simeon the treasurer we must talk about the new bridge edmund said immediately very well edmund carlus said recognizing him by his voice the welcome was not warm caris noted and she wondered if they had come at a bad time edmund was just as sensitive as she to atmosphere but he always blustered through now he took a chair and said when do you think youll hold the election for the new prior you can sit down too caris said carlus she had no idea how he knew she was there no date has been set for the election he went on earl roland has the right to nominate a candidate but he has not yet recovered consciousness we cant wait edmund said caris thought he was being too abrupt but this was his way so she said nothing we have to start work on the new bridge right away her father continued timbers no good we have to build in stone its going to take three years four if we delay a stone bridge its essential ive been talking to elfric and merthin another wooden bridge would fall down like the old but the cost about two hundred and fifty pounds depending on the design thats elfrics calculation brother simeon said a new wooden bridge would cost fifty pounds and prior anthony rejected that a week ago because of the price and look at the result a hundred people dead many more injured livestock and carts lost the prior dead and the earl at deaths door carlus said stiffly i hope you dont mean to blame all that on the late prior anthony we cant pretend his decision worked out well god has punished us for sin edmund sighed caris felt frustrated whenever they were in the wrong monks would bring god into the argument edmund said it is hard for us mere men to know gods intentions but one thing we do know is that without a bridge this town will die were already losing out to shiring unless we build a new stone bridge as fast as we possibly can kingsbridge will soon become a small village that may be gods plan for us edmund began to show his exasperation is it possible that god is so displeased with you monks for believe me if the fleece fair and the kingsbridge market die there will not be a priory here with twentyfive monks and forty nuns and fifty employees and a hospital and a choir and a school there may not be a cathedral either the bishop of kingsbridge has always lived in shiring what if the prosperous merchants there offer to build him a splendid new cathedral in their own town out of the profits from their evergrowing market no kingsbridge market no town no cathedral no priory is that what you want carlus looked dismayed clearly it had not occurred to him that the longterm consequences of the bridge collapse could actually affect the status of the priory but simeon said if the priory cant afford to build a wooden bridge theres certainly no prospect of a stone one but you must will the masons work free certainly not they have to feed their families but weve already explained how the townspeople could raise the money and lend it to the priory against the security of the bridge tolls and take away our income from the bridge simeon said indignantly youre back to that swindle are you caris put in youve got no bridge tolls at all now on the contrary were collecting fares on the ferry you found the money to pay elfric for that a lot less than a bridge and even so it emptied our coffers the fares will never amount to much the ferry is too slow the time may come in the future when the priory is able to build a new bridge god will send the means if he wishes it and then we will still have the tolls edmund said god has already sent the means he inspired my daughter to dream up a way of raising the money that has never been thought of before carlus said primly please leave it to us to decide what god has done very well edmund stood up and caris did the same im very sorry youre taking this attitude its a catastrophe for kingsbridge and everyone who lives here including the monks i must be guided by god not you edmund and caris turned to leave one more thing if i may said carlus edmund turned at the door of course its not acceptable for lay people to enter priory buildings at will next time you wish to see me please come to the hospital and send a novice or a priory servant to seek me out in the usual way im alderman of the parish guild edmund protested ive always had direct access to the prior no doubt the fact that prior anthony was your brother made him reluctant to impose the usual rules but those days are over caris looked at her fathers face he was repressing fury very well he said tightly god bless you edmund went out and caris followed they walked across the muddy green together passing a pitifully small cluster of market stalls caris felt the weight of her fathers obligations most people just worried about feeding their families edmund worried about the entire town she glanced at him and saw that his expression was twisted into an anxious frown unlike carlus edmund would not throw his hands in the air and say that gods will would be done he was racking his brains for a solution to the problem she felt a surge of compassion for him straining to do the right thing with no help from the powerful priory he never complained of the responsibility he just took it on it made her want to weep they left the precincts and crossed the main street as they came to their front door caris said what are we going to do its obvious isnt it said her father weve got to make sure carlus doesnt get elected prior godwyn wanted to be prior of kingsbridge he longed for it with all his heart he itched to reform the priorys finances tightening up the management of its lands and other assets so that the monks no longer had to go to mother cecilia for money he yearned for the stricter separation of monks from nuns and both from townspeople so that they might all breathe the pure air of sanctity but as well as these irreproachable motives there was something else he lusted for the authority and distinction of the title at night in his imagination he was already prior clean up that mess in the cloister he would say to a monk yes father prior right away godwyn loved the sound of father prior good day bishop richard he would say not obsequiously but with friendly courtesy and bishop richard would reply as one distinguished clergyman to another and a good day to you too prior godwyn i trust everything is to your satisfaction archbishop he might say more deferentially this time but still as a junior colleague of the great man rather than as an underling oh yes godwyn youve done extraordinarily well here your reverence is very kind and perhaps one day strolling in the cloister side by side with a richly dressed potentate your majesty does us great honour to visit our humble priory thank you father godwyn but i come to ask your advice he wanted this position but he was not sure how to get it he pondered the question all week as he supervised a hundred burials and planned the big sunday service that would be both anthonys funeral and a remembrance for the souls of all the kingsbridge dead meanwhile he spoke to no one of his hopes it was only ten days ago that he had learned the price of being guileless he had gone to the chapter with timothys book and a strong argument for reform and the old guard had turned on him with perfect coordination as if they had rehearsed it and squashed him like a frog under a cartwheel he would not let that happen again on sunday morning as the monks were filing into the refectory for breakfast a novice whispered to godwyn that his mother would like to see him in the north porch of the cathedral he slipped away discreetly he felt apprehensive as he passed quietly through the cloisters and the church he could guess what had happened something had occurred yesterday to trouble petranilla she had lain awake half the night worrying about it this morning she had woken up at dawn with a plan of action and he was part of it she would be at her most impatient and domineering her plan would probably be good but even if it was not she would insist he carried it out she stood in the gloom of the porch in a wet cloak it was raining again my brother edmund came to see blind carlus yesterday she said he tells me carlus is acting as ii he is already prior and the election is a mere formality there was an accusing note in her voice as if this was godwyns fault and he answered defensively the old guard swung behind carlus before uncle anthonys body was cold they wont hear talk of rival candidates hm and the youngsters they want me to run of course they liked the way i stood up to prior anthony over timothys book even though i was overruled but ive said nothing any other candidates thomas langley is the outsider some disapprove of him because he used to be a knight and has killed people by his own admission but hes capable does his job with quiet efficiency never bullies the novices his mother looked thoughtful whats his story why did he become a monk godwyns apprehension began to ease it seemed she was not going to berate him for inaction thomas just says he always hankered for the sanctified life and when he came here to get a sword wound attended to he resolved never to leave i remember that it was ten years ago but i never did hear how he got the wound nor i he doesnt like to talk about his violent past who paid for his admission to the priory oddly enough i dont know godwyn often marvelled at his mothers ability to ask the revealing question she might be tyrannical but he had to admire her it might have been bishop richard i recall him promising the usual gift but he wouldnt have had the resources personally he wasnt a bishop then just a priest perhaps he was speaking for earl roland find out godwyn hesitated he would have to look through all the charters in the priorys library the librarian brother augustine would not presume to question the sacrist but someone else might then godwyn would have the awkwardness of inventing a plausible story to explain what he was doing if the gift had been cash rather than land or other property unusual but possible he would have to go through the account rolls whats the matter his mother said sharply nothing youre right he reminded himself that her domineering attitude was a sign of her love for him perhaps the only way she knew how to express it there must be a record come to think of it what a gift like that is usually trumpeted the prior announces it in church and calls down blessings on the head of the donor then preaches a sermon on how people who give lands to the priory are rewarded in heaven but i dont remember anything like that happening at the time thomas came to us all the more reason to seek out the charter i think thomas is a man with a secret and a secret is always a weakness ill look into it what do you think i should say to people who want me to stand for election petranilla smiled slyly i think you should tell them youre not going to be a candidate breakfast was over by the time godwyn left his mother latecomers were not allowed to eat by a longstanding rule but the kitchener brother reynard could always find a morsel for someone he liked godwyn went to the kitchen and got a slice of cheese and a heel of bread he ate it standing up while around him the priory servants brought the breakfast bowls back from the refectory and scrubbed out the iron pot in which the porridge had been cooked as he ate he mulled over his mothers advice the more he thought about it the cleverer it seemed once he had announced he would not stand for election everything else he said would carry the authority of a disinterested commentator he could manipulate the election without being suspected of selfish motives then he could make his move at the last moment he felt a warm glow of loving gratitude for the shrewdness of his mothers restless brain and the loyalty of her indomitable heart brother theodoric found him there theodorics fair complexion was flushed with indignation brother simeon spoke to us at breakfast about carlus becoming prior he said it was all about continuing the wise traditions of anthony hes not going to change anything that was sly godwyn thought simeon had taken advantage of godwyns absence to say with authority things that godwyn would have challenged if he had been present he said sympathetically thats disgraceful i asked whether the other candidates would be permitted to address the monks at breakfast in the same way godwyn grinned good for you simeon said there was no need for other candidates were not holding an archery contest he said in his view the decision has already been made prior anthony chose carlus as his successor by making him subprior thats complete rubbish exactly the monks are furious this was very good godwyn thought carlus had offended even his supporters by trying to take away their right to vote he was undermining his own candidacy theodoric went on i think we should press carlus to withdraw himself from the contest godwyn wanted to say are you mad he bit his tongue and tried to look as if he were mulling over what theodoric had said is that the best way to deal with it he asked as if genuinely unsure theodoric was surprised by the question what do you mean you say the brothers are all furious with carlus and simeon if this goes on they wont vote for carlus but if carlus withdraws the old guard will come up with another candidate they could make a better choice the second time it might be someone popular brother joseph for example theodoric was thunderstruck i never thought of it that way perhaps we should hope that carlus remains the choice of the old guard everyone knows hes against any kind of change the reason hes a monk is that he likes to know that every day will be the same hell walk the same paths sit in the same seats eat and pray and sleep in the same places perhaps its because of his blindness though i suspect he might have been like that anyway the cause doesnt matter he believes that nothing here needs changing now there arent many monks who are that contented which makes carlus relatively easy to beat a candidate who represented the old guard but advocated a few minor reforms would be much more likely to win godwyn realized he had forgotten to seem tentative and had started laying down the law backtracking quickly he added i dont know what do you think i think youre a genius said theodoric im not a genius godwyn thought but i learn fast he went to the hospital where he found philemon sweeping out the private guest rooms upstairs lord william was still here watching over his father waiting for him to wake up or die lady philippa was with him bishop richard had returned to his palace in shiring but was expected back today for the big funeral service godwyn took philemon to the library philemon could barely read but he would be useful for getting out the charters the priory had more than a hundred charters most were deeds to landholdings the majority near kingsbridge some scattered around far parts of england and wales other charters entitled the monks to establish their priory to build a church to take stone from a quarry on the earl of shirings land without payment to parcel the land around the priory into house plots and rent them out to hold courts to have a weekly market to charge a toll for crossing the bridge to have an annual fleece fair and to ship goods by river to melcombe without paying taxes to the lords of any of the lands through which the river passed the documents were written with pen and ink on parchment thin leather painstakingly cleaned and scraped and bleached and stretched to form a writing surface longer ones were rolled up and tied with a fine leather thong they were kept in an ironbound chest the chest was locked but the key was in the library in a small carved box godwyn frowned with disapproval when he opened the chest the charters were not lined up in neat stacks but tumbled in the box in no apparent order some had small rips and frayed edges and all were covered with dust they should be kept in date sequence he thought each one numbered and the numbered list fixed to the inside of the lid so that any particular charter could be quickly located if i become prior philemon took the charters out one by one blew off the dust and laid them on a table for godwyn most people disliked philemon one or two of the older monks mistrusted him but godwyn did not it was hard to mistrust someone who treated you like a god most of the monks were just used to him he had been around for so long godwyn remembered him as a boy tall and awkward always hanging around the priory asking the monks which saint was best to pray to and had they ever witnessed a miracle most of the charters had originally been written out twice on a single sheet the word chirograph had been written in large letters between the two copies then the sheet had been cut in half with a zigzag line through the word each of the parties kept half the sheet and the match between the zigzags was taken as proof that both documents were genuine some of the sheets had holes probably where the living sheep had been bitten by an insect others appeared to have been nibbled at some point in their history presumably by mice they were written in latin of course the more recent ones were easier to read but the older style of handwriting was sometimes hard for godwyn to decipher he scanned each until he came to a date he was looking for something written soon after all hallows day ten years ago he examined every sheet and found nothing the nearest was a deed dated some weeks later in which earl roland gave permission to sir gerald to transfer his lands to the ownership of the priory in exchange for which the priory would forgive geralds debts and support him and his wife for the rest of their lives godwyn was not really disappointed rather the contrary either thomas had been admitted without the usual gift which would in itself be curious or the charter was kept somewhere else away from prying eyes either way it seemed increasingly likely that petranillas instinct was right and thomas had a secret there were not many private places in a monastery monks were supposed to have no personal property and no secrets although some wealthy monasteries had built private cells for the senior monks at kingsbridge they slept in one big room all except the prior himself almost certainly the charter that had secured thomass admission was in the priors house which was now occupied by carlus that made things difficult carlus would not let godwyn search the place searching might hardly be necessary there was probably a box or satchel somewhere in plain sight containing the late prior anthonys personal documents a notebook from his novice days a friendly letter from the archbishop some sermons carlus had probably had the contents examined after anthony died but he had no reason to permit godwyn to do the same godwyn frowned thinking could someone else search edmund or petranilla might ask to see their late brothers possessions and it would be hard for carlus to deny such a request but he might remove any priory documents beforehand no the search had to be clandestine the bell rang for terce the morning office godwyn realized that the only time he could be certain carlus would not be in the priors house was during a service in the cathedral he would have to skip terce he could think up a plausible excuse it would not be easy he was the sacrist the one person who should never skip services but there was no alternative i want you to come to me in the church he said to philemon all right said philemon though he looked worried priory employees were not supposed to enter the chancel during worship come right after the verse whisper in my ear it doesnt matter what you say take no notice of my reaction just continue philemon frowned anxiously but he nodded assent he would do anything for godwyn godwyn left the library and joined the procession into the church there was only a handful of people standing in the nave most of the town would come later in the day to attend the mass for the victims or the bridge collapse the monks took their places in the chancel and the ritual began o god incline unto mine aid godwyn said along with the rest they finished the verse and began the first hymn and philemon appeared all the monks stared at him as people always did stare at anything out of the ordinary that occurred during a familiar rite brother simeon frowned disapprovingly carlus conducting the singing sensed a disturbance and looked puzzled philemon came to godwyns seat and bent over blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly he whispered godwyn pretended to be surprised and continued to listen while philemon recited psalm number one after a few moments he shook his head vigorously as if denying a request then he listened some more he was going to have to think up an elaborate story to account for this pantomime perhaps he would say that his mother had insisted on speaking to him immediately about the funeral of her brother prior anthony and that she was threatening to come into the chancel herself unless philemon took a message to godwyn petranillas overbearing personality combined with family grief made the story just about credible as philemon finished the psalm godwyn made a resigned face and got up and followed philemon out of the chancel they hurried around the cathedral to the priors house a young employee was sweeping the floor he would not dare to question a monk he might tell carlus that godwyn and philemon had been here but it would be too late then godwyn thought the priors house was a disgrace it was smaller than uncle edmunds home in the main street a prior should have a palace befitting his station as the bishop did there was nothing glorious about this building a few tapestries covered the walls depicting biblical scenes and keeping out the draughts but overall the decor was dull and unimaginative rather like the late anthony they searched the place quickly and soon found what they were looking for upstairs in the bedroom in a chest beside the priedieu was a large wallet it was made of soft gingerbrown goatskin and beautifully sewn with scarlet thread godwyn felt sure it had been a pious gift from one of the towns leather workers watched intently by philemon he opened it inside were about thirty sheets of parchment laid flat and interleaved with protective linen cloths godwyn examined them quickly several bore study notes on the psalms anthony must at some time have contemplated writing a book of commentaries but the work appeared to have been abandoned the most surprising was a love poem in latin headed virent oculi it was addressed to a man with green eyes uncle anthony had green eyes flecked with gold like all his family godwyn wondered who had written it not many women could write latin well enough to compose a poem had a nun loved anthony or was the poem from a man the parchment was old and yellowing the love affair if such it was had happened in anthonys youth but he had kept the poem perhaps he had not been quite as dull as godwyn had imagined philemon said what is it godwyn felt guilty he had peeped into a deeply private corner of his uncles life and he wished he had not nothing he said just a poem he picked up the next sheet and struck gold it was a charter dated christmas ten years ago it concerned a landholding of five hundred acres near lynn in norfolk the lord had recently died the deed assigned the vacant lordship to kingsbridge priory and specified the annual dues grain fleeces calves and chickens payable to the priory by the serfs and tenants who farmed the land it nominated one of the peasants to be a bailiff with the responsibility of delivering the produce to the priory annually it also assigned money payments that could be offered instead of the actual produce a practice that was now predominant especially where the land was many miles from the residence of the lord it was a typical charter every year after the harvest representatives of dozens of similar communities made the pilgrimage to the priory to deliver what they owed those from nearby showed up early in the autumn others came at intervals through the winter with a few from long distances not arriving until after christmas the deed also specified that the gift was given in consideration of the priorys accepting sir thomas langley as a monk that too was routine but one feature of this document was not commonplace it was signed by queen isabella that was interesting isabella was the unfaithful wife of king edward ii she had rebelled against her royal husband and installed in his place their fourteenyearold son shortly afterwards the deposed king had died and prior anthony had been present at his burial in gloucester thomas had come to kingsbridge at around the same time for a few years the queen and her lover roger mortimer had ruled england but before long edward iii had asserted his authority despite his youth the new king was now twentyfour and firmly in control mortimer was dead and isabella now fortytwo lived in opulent retirement at castle rising in norfolk not far from lynn this is it godwyn said to philemon it was queen isabella who arranged for thomas to become a monk philemon frowned but why though uneducated philemon was shrewd why indeed godwyn answered presumably she wanted to reward him or silence him or perhaps both and this happened in the year of her coup he must have performed some service for her godwyn nodded he carried a message or opened the gates of a castle or betrayed the kings plans to her or secured for her the support of some important baron but why is it a secret its not said philemon the treasurer must know about it and everyone in lynn the bailiff must talk to a few people when he comes here but no one knows that the whole arrangement was made for the benefit of thomas unless they have seen this charter so thats the secret that queen isabella made this gift for thomass sake exactly godwyn packed up the documents carefully interleaving the sheets of parchment with linen cloths and replaced the wallet in the chest philemon asked but why is it a secret theres nothing dishonest or shameful about such an arrangement it happens all the time i dont know why its a secret and perhaps we dont need to know the fact that people want to keep it hidden may be sufficient for our purpose lets get out of this house godwyn felt satisfied thomas had a secret and godwyn knew about it that gave godwyn power now he felt confident enough to risk putting thomas forward as a candidate for prior he also felt apprehensive thomas was no fool they returned to the cathedral the office of terce ended a few moments later and godwyn began to prepare the church for the big funeral service on his instructions six monks lifted anthonys coffin and placed it on a stand in front of the altar then surrounded it with candles townspeople began to gather in the nave godwyn nodded to his cousin caris who had covered her everyday headgear in black silk then he spotted thomas carrying in a large ornate chair with the help of a novice this was the bishops throne or cathedra that gave the church its special cathedral status godwyn touched thomass arm let philemon do that thomas bristled thinking that godwyn was offering help because of his missing arm i can manage i know you can i want a word thomas was older he was thirtyfour godwyn thirtyone but godwyn was his superior in the monastic hierarchy all the same godwyn was always a little afraid of thomas the matricularius usually showed the appropriate deference to the sacrist but all the same godwyn felt he was getting just as much respect as thomas thought he merited and no more though thomas conformed in every way to the discipline of st benedicts rule nevertheless he seemed to have brought into the priory with him a quality of independence and selfsufficiency that he never lost it would not be easy to deceive thomas but that was exactly what godwyn planned to do thomas allowed philemon to take his side of the throne and godwyn drew him into the aisle theyre talking about you as possibly the next prior godwyn said theyre saying the same about you thomas rejoined i shall refuse to stand thomas raised his eyebrows you surprise me brother two reasons godwyn said one i think you would do a better job thomas looked more surprised he probably had not suspected godwyn of such modesty he was right godwyn was lying two godwyn continued youre more likely to win now godwyn was telling the truth the youngsters like me but youre popular across the range of all ages thomass handsome face looked quizzical he was waiting for the catch i want to help you godwyn said i believe the only important thing is to have a prior who will reform the monastery and improve its finances i think i could do that but what do you want in return for your support godwyn knew better than to ask for nothing thomas would not believe that he invented a plausible lie id like to be your subprior thomas nodded but did not immediately consent how would you help me first by gaining you the support of the townspeople just because edmund wooler is your uncle its not that simple the townspeople are worried about the bridge carlus wont say when hell begin building if ever theyre desperate to stop him becoming prior if i tell edmund that youll start work on the bridge as soon as youre elected youll have the whole town behind you that wont win me the votes of many monks dont be so sure remember the monks choice has to be ratified by the bishop most bishops are prudent enough to consult local opinion and richard is as keen as anyone to avoid trouble if the townspeople come out for you it will make a difference godwyn could see that thomas did not trust him the matricularius studied him and godwyn felt a bead of sweat trickle down his spine as he fought to remain expressionless under that keen gaze but thomas was listening to his arguments theres no doubt we need a new bridge he said carlus is foolish to prevaricate so you would be promising something you intend to do anyway youre very persuasive godwyn held up his hands in a defensive gesture i dont mean to be you must do what you feel is gods will thomas looked sceptical he did not believe that godwyn was so dispassionate but he said all right then he added ill pray about it godwyn sensed he would get no stronger commitment out of thomas today and it might be counterproductive to push any harder so will i he said and he turned away thomas would do exactly what he had promised and pray about it he had little in the way of personal desires if he thought it was gods will he would stand as prior and if not not godwyn could do no more with him for the moment there was now a blaze of candles around anthonys coffin the nave was filling with townspeople and peasants from the surrounding villages godwyn raked the crowd for the face of caris which he had spotted a few minutes earlier he located her in the south transept looking at merthins scaffolding in the aisle he had affectionate memories of caris as a child when he had been her allknowing grownup cousin she had been looking glum since the bridge collapse he had noticed but today she seemed cheerful he was glad he had a soft spot for her he touched her elbow you look happy i am she smiled a romantic knot just came untangled but you wouldnt understand of course not you have no idea he thought how many romantic tangles there are among monks but he said nothing lay people were best left in ignorance of sins that took place in the priory he said your father should speak to bishop richard about rebuilding the bridge really she said sceptically as a child she had heroworshipped him but nowadays she was less in awe whats the point its not his bridge the monks choice for prior has to be approved by the bishop richard could let it be known that he wont approve anyone who refuses to rebuild the bridge some monks might be defiant but others will say theres no point in voting for someone who isnt going to be ratified i see you really think my father could help absolutely then ill suggest it thank you the bell rang godwyn slipped out of the church and again joined the procession forming up in the cloisters it was midday he had done a good mornings work wulfric and gwenda left kingsbridge early on monday morning to walk the long road back to their village of wigleigh caris and merthin watched them cross the river on merthins new ferry merthin was pleased by how well it was working the wooden gears would wear out quite quickly he knew iron gears would be better but caris had other thoughts gwenda is so much in love she sighed she has no chance with wulfric merthin said you never know shes a determined girl look how she escaped from sim chapman but wulfrics engaged to that annet who is much prettier good looks arent everything in a romance for which i thank god every day she laughed i love your funny face but wulfric fought my brother over annet he must love her gwendas got a love potion merthin gave her a disapproving look so you think its all right for a girl to manoeuvre a man into marrying her when he loves someone else she was struck silent for a moment the soft skin of her throat turned pink i never thought of it that way she said is it really the same thing its similar but shes not coercing him she just wants to make him love her she should try to do that without a potion now i feel ashamed of helping her too late wulfric and gwenda were getting off the ferry on the far side they turned to wave then headed along the road through the suburbs with skip the dog at their heels merthin and caris walked back up the main street caris said you havent spoken to griselda yet im going to do it now i dont know whether im looking forward to it or dreading it youve got nothing to fear shes the one who lied thats true he touched his face the bruise had almost healed i just hope her father doesnt get violent again do you want me to come with you he would have been glad of her support but he shook his head i made this mess and i have to straighten it out they stopped outside elfrics house caris said good luck thanks merthin kissed her lips briefly resisted the temptation to kiss her again and walked in elfric was sitting at the table eating bread and cheese a cup of ale stood in front of him beyond him merthin could see alice and the maid in the kitchen there was no sign of griselda elfric said where have you been merthin decided that if he had nothing to fear he had better act fearlessly he ignored elfrics question wheres griselda still in bed merthin shouted up the stairs griselda i want to talk to you elfric said no time for that weve got work to do again merthin ignored him griselda youd better get up now hey elfric said who do you think you are to give orders you want me to marry her dont you so what so shed better get used to doing what her husband tells her he raised his voice again get down here now or youll just have to hear what ive got to say from someone else she appeared at the top of the stairs im coming she said irritably whats all the fuss about merthin waited for her to come down then said ive found out who the father of the baby is fear flashed in her eyes dont be stupid its you no its thurstan i never lay with thurstan she looked at her father honestly i didnt elfric said she doesnt lie alice came out of the kitchen thats right she said merthin said i lay with griselda on the sunday of fleece fair week fifteen days ago griselda is three months pregnant im not merthin looked hard at alice you knew didnt you alice looked away merthin went on and yet you lied even to caris your own sister elfric said you dont know how long pregnant she is look at her merthin replied you can see the bulge in her belly not much but its there what do you know of such things youre just a boy yes you were all relying on my ignorance werent you and it almost worked elfric wagged his finger you lay with griselda and now youll marry griselda oh no i wont she doesnt love me she lay with me to get a father for her baby after thurstan ran away i know i did wrong but im not going to punish myself for the rest of my life by marrying her elfric stood up you are you know no youve got to no elfrics face turned red and he shouted you will marry her merthin said how long do you want me to keep on saying no elfric realized he was serious in that case youre dismissed he said get out of my house and never come back merthin had been expecting this and it came as a relief it meant the argument was over all right he tried to step past elfric elfric blocked his way where do you think youre going to the kitchen to get my things your tools you mean yes theyre not yours i paid for them an apprentice is always given his tools at the end of his merthin tailed off you havent finished your apprenticeship so you dont get your tools merthin had not expected this ive done six and a half years youre supposed to do seven without tools merthin could not earn his living thats unfair ill appeal to the carpenters guild i look forward to it elfric said smugly it will be interesting to hear you argue that an apprentice who is sacked for lying with his masters daughter should be rewarded with a free set of tools the carpenters in the guild have all got apprentices and most of them have daughters theyll throw you out on your arse merthin realized he was right alice said there you are youre in real trouble now arent you yes merthin said but whatever happens it wont be as bad as life with griselda and her family later that morning merthin went to st marks church for the funeral of howell tyler he attended because he hoped someone there would give him a job looking up at the timber ceiling the church did not have a stone vault merthin could see a manshaped hole in the painted wood grim testament to the manner of howells death everything up there was rotten the builders at the funeral said knowingly but they said it after the accident their sagacity coming too late to save howell it was now clear that the roof was too weak to be repaired but must be demolished completely and rebuilt from scratch that meant closing the church st marks was a poor church it had a pitiful endowment a single farm ten miles away that was kept by the priests brother and just about managed to feed the family the priest father joffroi had to get his income from the eight or nine hundred citizens of his parish in the poorer north end of town those who were not actually destitute generally pretended to be so their tithes brought in only a modest sum he made his living by christening marrying and burying them charging a lot less than the monks at the cathedral his parishioners married early had many children and died young so there was plenty of work for him and in the end he did well enough but if he closed the church his income would dry up and he would not be able to pay the builders consequently the work on the roof had stopped all the towns builders came to the funeral including elfric merthin tried to look unashamed as he stood in the church but it was difficult most of them knew he had been dismissed he had been unjustly treated but unfortunately he was not completely innocent howell had had a young wife who was friendly with caris and now caris walked in with the widow and the bereaved family merthin moved next to caris and told her what had happened with elfric father joffroi conducted the service dressed in an old robe merthin thought about the roof it seemed to him there must be a way to dismantle it without closing the church the standard approach when repairs had been postponed too long and the timbers were too badly rotted to bear the weight of workmen was to build scaffolding around the church and knock the timbers down into the nave the building was then open to the elements until the new roof was finished and tiled but it should be possible to build a swivelling hoist supported by the thick side wall of the church which would lift the roof timbers up one by one instead of pushing them down and swing them across the wall and down into the graveyard that way the wooden ceiling could be left intact and replaced only after the roof had been rebuilt at the graveside he looked at the men one by one wondering which of them was most likely to employ him he decided to approach bill watkin the towns second largest builder and no admirer of elfrics bill had a bald dome with a fringe of black hair a natural version of the monkish tonsure he did most of the house building in kingsbridge like elfric he employed a stonemason and a carpenter a handful of labourers and one or two apprentices howell had not been prosperous and his body was lowered into the grave in a shroud without a coffin when father joffroi had departed merthin approached bill watkin good day master watkin he said formally bills response was not warm well young merthin ive parted company with elfric i know that said bill and i know why youve heard elfrics side of the story ive heard all i need to hear elfric had been talking to people before and during the service merthin realized he was sure elfric had left out of his account the fact that griselda had tried to make merthin the substitute father for thurstans baby but he felt he would do himself no good by making excuses better to admit his fault i realize i did wrong and im sorry but im still a good carpenter bill nodded agreement the new ferry testifies to that merthin was encouraged will you hire me as what as a carpenter you said i was a good one but where are your tools elfric wouldnt give them to me and he was right because you havent finished your apprenticeship then take me on as an apprentice for six months and give you a new set of tools for nothing at the end of it i cant afford that kind of generosity tools were expensive because iron and steel were costly ill work as a labourer and save up to buy my own tools it would take a long time but he was desperate no why not because ive got a daughter too this was outrageous im not a menace to maidens you know youre an example to apprentices if you get away with this whats to stop the others trying their luck that is so unjust bill shrugged you might think so but ask any other master carpenter in town i think youll find they feel as i do but what am i to do i dont know you should have thought of that before you shagged her you dont care about losing a good carpenter bill shrugged again all the more work for the rest of us merthin turned away that was the trouble with guilds he thought bitterly it was in their interest to exclude people for good or bad reasons a shortage of carpenters would just drive up their wages they had no incentive to be fair howells widow left accompanied by her mother caris liberated from her duty of commiseration came over to merthin why do you look unhappy she said you hardly knew howell i may have to leave kingsbridge he said she went pale why on earth would you do that he told her what bill watkin had said so you see no one in kingsbridge will hire me and i cant work on my own account for ive no tools i could live with my parents but i cant take the food from their mouths so ill have to seek work some place where no one knows about griselda in time perhaps i can save up enough money to buy a hammer and chisel and then move to another town and try to gain admittance to the carpenters guild as he explained this to caris he began to appreciate the full misery of the situation he saw her familiar features as if for the first time and he was enchanted again by her sparkling green eyes her small neat nose and the determined set of her jaw her mouth he realized did not quite fit the rest of her face it was too wide and the lips were too full it unbalanced the regularity of her physiognomy the way her sensual nature subverted her tidy mind it was a mouth made for sex and the thought that he might have to go away and never kiss it again filled him with despair caris was furious this is iniquitous they have no right thats what i think but there seems to be nothing i can do about it i just have to accept it wait a minute lets think about this you can live with your parents and have your dinner at my house i dont want to become a dependant like my father nor should you you can buy howell tylers tools his widow was just telling me shes asking a pound for them i havent any money ask my father for a loan hes always liked you im sure hell do it but its against the rules for anyone to employ a carpenter who isnt in the guild rules can be broken there must be someone in town desperate enough to defy the guild merthin realized he had allowed the old men to quench his spirit and he was grateful to caris for refusing to accept defeat she was right of course he should stay in kingsbridge and fight this unjust ruling and he knew someone who was in desperate need of his talents father joffroi he said is he desperate why merthin explained about the roof lets go and see him caris said the priest lived in a small house next to the church they found him preparing a dinner of salt fish in a stew with spring greens joffroi was in his thirties built like a soldier tall with broad shoulders his manner was brusque but he had a reputation for sticking up for the poor merthin said i can repair your roof without closing your church joffroi looked wary youre an answer to prayer if you can ill build a hoist that will lift the roof timbers and deposit them in the graveyard elfric sacked you the priest shot an embarrassed look in cariss direction she said i know what happened father merthin said he dismissed me because i would not marry his daughter but the child she is bearing is not mine joffroi nodded some say you were treated unjustly i can believe it i have no great love for the guilds their decisions are rarely unselfish all the same you havent completed your apprenticeship can any member of the carpenters guild repair your roof without closing your church i heard you havent even got any tools leave that problem to me to solve joffroi looked thoughtful how much do you want to be paid merthin stuck his neck out four pence a day plus the cost of materials thats a journeyman carpenters wage if i dont have the skill of a qualified carpenter you shouldnt hire me youre cocky im just saying what i can do arrogance is not the worst sin in the world and i can afford four pence a day if i can keep my church open how long will it take you to build your hoist two weeks at the most im not going to pay you until i can be sure it will work merthin breathed in he would be penniless but he could cope with that he could live with his parents and eat at edmund woolers table he would get by pay for the materials and save my wages up until the first roof timber is removed and safely brought to ground joffroi hesitated ill be unpopular but i have no choice he held out his hand merthin shook it all the way from kingsbridge to wigleigh a distance of twenty miles a full days walk gwenda was hoping for a chance to use the love potion but she was disappointed it was not that wulfric was wary on the contrary he was open and friendly he talked about his family and told her how he wept every morning when he woke up and realized their deaths were not a dream he was considerate asking whether she was tired and needed to rest he told her that he felt land was a trust something a man held for a lifetime then passed to his heirs and that when he improved his land by weeding fields fencing sheepfolds or clearing stones from pasture he was fulfilling his destiny he even patted skip by the end of the day she was more in love with him than ever unfortunately he showed no sign of feeling anything for her more than a kind of camaraderie caring but not passionate in the forest with sim chapman she had wished with all her heart that men were not so much like wild beasts but now she wanted wulfric to have a bit more of the beast in him all day she did little things to arouse his interest as if by accident she let him see her legs which were firm and shapely when the terrain was hilly she made it an excuse to take deep breaths and stick out her chest at every opportunity she brushed against him touched his arm or put a hand on his shoulder none of it had the least effect she was not pretty she knew but there was something about her that often made men look hard at her and breathe through their mouths but it was not working on wulfric they stopped for a rest at noon and ate the bread and cheese they carried with them but they drank water from a clear stream using their hands as cups and she had no opportunity to give him the potion all the same she was happy she had him all to herself for a whole day she could look at him talk to him make him laugh sympathize with him and occasionally touch him she pretended to herself that she could kiss him any time she liked but that at the moment she was not so disposed it was almost like being married and it was over too soon they arrived in wigleigh early in the evening the village stood on a rise its fields sloping away to all sides and it was always windy after two weeks in the bustle of kingsbridge the familiar place seemed small and quiet just a scatter of rough dwellings along the road that led to the manor house and the church the manor was as large as a kingsbridge merchants home with bedrooms on an upper floor the priests house was also a fine dwelling and a few of the peasant houses were substantial but most of the homes were tworoom hovels one room normally being occupied by livestock and the other serving as kitchen and bedroom for all the family only the church was built of stone the first of the more substantial houses belonged to wulfrics family its doors and shutters were closed giving it a desolate look he walked past it to the second big house which was where annet lived with her parents he gave gwenda a casual wave of farewell and went inside smiling in anticipation she felt the sharp tug of loss as if she had just woken out of a delightful dream she swallowed her discontent and set out across the fields the earlyjune rain had been good for the crops and the wheat and barley were green but now they needed sunshine to ripen them village women were moving along the rows of grain bent double pulling up weeds some waved to her as she approached her home gwenda felt a mixture of apprehension and anger she had not seen her parents since the day her father had sold her to sim chapman for a cow almost certainly pa thought she was still with sim her appearance would come as a shock what would he say when he saw her and what was she going to say to the father who had betrayed her trust she felt sure her mother knew nothing of the sale pa had probably told ma some story about gwenda running off with a boy ma was going to fly into a fearsome rage she felt happy at the prospect of seeing the little ones cath joanie and eric she realized now how much she had missed them on the far side of the hundredacre field half hidden in the trees at the edge of the forest was her home it was even smaller than the peasants hovels having only one room which was shared with the cow at night it was made of wattleanddaub tree branches stuck upright in the ground with twigs interwoven basketfashion the gaps plugged with a sticky mixture of mud straw and cow dung there was a hole in the thatched roof to let out the smoke of the fire in the middle of the earth floor such houses lasted only a few years then had to be rebuilt it now seemed meaner than ever to gwenda she was determined not to spend her life in such a place having babies every year or two most of whom died for lack of food she would not live like her mother she would rather die when she was still a hundred yards from the house she saw her father coming towards her he was carrying a jug probably going to buy ale from peg perkins annets mother who was the village brewster pa always had money at this time of year for there was plenty of work to be had in the fields at first he did not see her she studied his thin figure as he walked along the narrow gap between two field strips he wore a long smock that came to his knees a battered cap and homemade sandals tied to his feet with straw his gait managed to be both furtive and jaunty he always looked like a nervous foreigner defiantly pretending to be at home his eyes were set closely either side of a big nose and he had a wide jaw with a knob of a chin so that his face looked like a lumpy triangle gwenda knew that she resembled him in that he glanced sidelong at the women he passed in the field as if he did not want them to know he was observing them as he came close he threw her one of his sneaky looks up from under his lowered eyelids he looked down instantly then looked up again she lifted her chin and stared back at him haughtily astonishment spread across his face you he said what happened sim chapman wasnt a tinker he was an outlaw and where is he now hes in hell pa youll meet him there did you kill him no she had long ago decided to lie about this god killed him the bridge at kingsbridge collapsed while sim was crossing it god punished him for his sin has he punished you yet god forgives good christians is that all you have to say to me that god forgives good christians how did you escape i used my wits a crafty look came over his face youre a good girl he said she stared at him suspiciously what mischief are you planning now youre a good girl he repeated go in to your mother now you shall have a cup of ale with your supper he walked on gwenda frowned pa did not seem afraid of what ma would say when she learned the truth perhaps he thought gwenda would not tell her out of shame well he was wrong cath and joanie were outside the house playing in the dirt when they saw gwenda they jumped up and ran to her skip barked hysterically gwenda hugged her sisters remembering how she had thought she would never see them again and at that moment she was fiercely glad she had stuck a long knife into alwyns head she went inside ma was sitting on a stool giving little eric some milk helping him hold the cup steady so that he did not spill any she gave a cry of joy when she saw gwenda she put down the cup stood up and embraced her gwenda began to weep once she had started crying it was hard to stop she cried because sim had led her out of town on a rope and because she had let alwyn fuck her and for all the people who had died when the bridge collapsed and because wulfric loved annet when her sobs subsided enough for her to speak again she said pa sold me ma he sold me for a cow and i had to go with outlaws that was wrong her mother said it was worse than wrong hes wicked evil hes a devil ma withdrew from the embrace dont say such things theyre true hes your father a father doesnt sell his children like livestock i have no father hes fed you for eighteen years gwenda stared uncomprehendingly how can you be so hard he sold me to outlaws and he got us a cow so theres milk for eric even though my breasts have dried up and youre here arent you gwenda was shocked youre defending him hes all ive got gwenda hes not a prince hes not even a peasant hes a landless labourer but hes done everything he can for this family for almost twentyfive years he worked when he could and thieved when he had to he kept you alive and your brother and with a fair wind hell do the same for cath and joanie and eric whatever his faults wed be worse off without him so dont you call him a devil gwenda was struck dumb she had hardly got used to the idea that her father had betrayed her now she had to face the fact that her mother was as bad she felt disoriented it was like when the bridge had moved under her feet she could hardly understand what was happening to her her father came into the house carrying the jug of ale he seemed not to notice the atmosphere he took three wooden cups from the shelf over the fireplace now then he said cheerfully lets drink to the return of our big girl gwenda was hungry and thirsty after walking all day she took the cup and drank deeply but she knew her father in this mood what are you planning she said well now he said its the shiring fair next week isnt it so what well we could do it again she could hardly believe what she was hearing do what again i sell you you go with the buyer then you escape and come home youre none the worse none the worse and weve got a cow worth twelve shillings why it takes me near half a year of labouring to earn twelve shillings and after that what then well theres other fairs winchester gloucester i dont know how many he refilled her cup from the ale jug why this could be better than the year you stole sir geralds purse she did not drink there was a bitter taste in her mouth as if she had eaten something corrupt she thought of arguing with him harsh words came to her lips angry accusations curses but she did not speak them the way she felt was beyond rage what was the point of having a row she could never trust her father again and because ma refused to be disloyal to him gwenda could not trust her either what am i to do she said aloud but she did not want an answer from anyone in the room the question was to herself in this family she had become a commodity to be sold at city fairs if she was not prepared to accept that what could she do she could leave she realized with a shock that this house was no longer a home to her the blow shook the foundations of her existence she had lived here since before she could remember now she did not feel safe here she had to get out not next week she realized not even tomorrow morning she had to go now she had nowhere to go but that made no difference to stay here and eat the bread her father put on the table would be to yield to his authority she would be accepting his evaluation of her as a commodity to be sold she was sorry she had drunk the first cup of ale her only chance was to reject him immediately and get out from under his roof gwenda looked at her mother youre wrong she said he is a devil and the old stories are right when you make a bargain with the devil you end up paying more than you thought ma looked away gwenda stood up the refilled cup was still in her hand she tipped it pouring the ale on the floor skip immediately started to lick it up her father said angrily i paid a farthing for this jug of ale goodbye said gwenda and she walked out on the following sunday gwenda attended the court hearing that would decide the fate of the man she loved the manorial court was held in the church after the service it was the forum in which the village took collective action some of the questions it addressed were disputes arguments over field boundaries accusations of theft or rape quarrels about debts but more often it made pragmatic decisions such as when to begin ploughing with the communal eightox team in theory the lord of the manor sat in judgement over his serfs but norman law brought to england by invaders from france almost three centuries earlier compelled lords to follow the customs of their predecessors and in order to find out what those customs were they had to formally consult twelve men of good standing in the village a jury so in practice the proceedings often became a negotiation between lord and villagers on this particular sunday wigleigh had no lord sir stephen had been killed in the collapse of the bridge gwenda had brought this news to the village she also reported that earl roland who had the task of appointing stephens replacement had been gravely injured on the day before she left kingsbridge the earl had recovered consciousness for the first time but he had woken into a fever so violent that he was unable to speak a coherent sentence so there was no prospect of a new lord of wigleigh yet this was not an unusual circumstance lords were frequently away at war in parliament fighting lawsuits or just attending on their earl or the king earl roland always appointed a deputy usually one of his sons but in this case he had not been able to do so in the absence of an overlord the bailiff had to manage the landholding as best he could the job of a bailiff or reeve was in theory to carry out the lords decisions but this inevitably gave him a degree of power over his fellows exactly how much power depended on the lords personal preference some held tight control others were lax sir stephen had kept a loose rein but earl roland was notoriously strict nate reeve had been bailiff to sir stephen and to sir henry before him and would presumably be bailiff to whoever came next he was a hunchback a small bent figure thin and energetic he was shrewd and greedy careful to make the most of his limited power by demanding bribes from the villagers at every opportunity gwenda disliked nate it was not his greed she objected to all bailiffs had that vice but nate was a man twisted by resentment as much as by his physical defect his father had been bailiff to the earl of shiring but nate had not inherited that grand position and he blamed his hump for the fact that he had ended up in the small village of wigleigh he seemed to hate all young strong handsome people in his leisure hours he liked to drink wine with perkin annets father who always paid for the liquor the question before the court today was what to do about wulfrics familys land it was a large holding peasants were not all equal and they did not have equal lands the standard was a virgate which was thirty acres in this part of england in theory a virgate was the area of land one man could farm and normally yielded enough to feed one family however most wigleigh peasants had a halfvirgate fifteen acres or thereabouts they were obliged to find additional means of support for their families netting birds in the woods trapping fish in the stream that ran through brookfield making belts or sandals from cheap leather offcuts weaving cloth from yarn for kingsbridge merchants or poaching the kings deer in the forest a few had more than a virgate perkin had a hundred acres and wulfrics father samuel had had ninety such wealthy peasants needed help to farm their land either from their sons and other relatives or from hired labourers such as gwendas father when a serf died his land might be inherited by his widow his sons or a married daughter in any event the handover had to be licensed by the lord and a stiff tax called a heriot was due in normal circumstances samuels land would automatically have been inherited by his two sons and there would have been no need for a court hearing they would have clubbed together to pay the heriot then either divided up the land or farmed it together and made some arrangement for their mother but one of samuels sons had died with him which complicated matters every adult in the village attended the court in general gwenda had a particular interest today wulfrics future would be decided and the fact that he planned to spend that future with another woman did not dampen gwendas concern perhaps she should have wished him a miserable life with annet she sometimes thought but she could not she wanted him to be happy when the service was over a large wooden chair and two benches were brought in from the manor house nate took the chair and the jurymen sat on the benches everyone else stood wulfric spoke simply my father held ninety acres of the lord of wigleigh he said fifty acres were held by his father before him and forty by his uncle who died ten years ago as my mother is dead and so is my brother and i have no sisters i am the sole heir how old are you said nate sixteen years you cant even call yourself a man yet it seemed nate was going to make things difficult gwenda knew why he wanted a bribe but wulfric had no money years arent everything wulfric said im taller and stronger than most grown men aaron appletree one of the jurors said david johns inherited from his father when he was eighteen nate said eighteen isnt sixteen i dont recall an instance where a sixteenyearold was allowed to inherit david johns was not a juror and he was standing next to gwenda i didnt have no ninety acres neither he said and there was a ripple of laughter david had a halfvirgate like most of them another juror spoke ninety acres is too much for one man let alone a boy why it was farmed by three until now the speaker was billy howard a man in his middle twenties who had wooed annet unsuccessfully which might be why he wanted to side with nate in putting obstacles in wulfrics way ive got forty acres and i have to hire labourers at harvest time several of the men nodded agreement gwenda began to feel pessimistic it was not going wulfrics way i can get help wulfric said nate said have you got money to pay labourers wulfric looked a bit desperate and gwendas heart went out to him my fathers purse was lost when the bridge collapsed and i spent what money i had on the funeral he said but i can offer my labourers a share of the harvest nate shook his head everyone in the village is already working full time on their own lands and those who have no land are already employed and no one is likely to give up a job that pays cash for one that offers a share of an uncertain crop i will get the harvest in wulfric said with passionate determination i can work day and night if i have to ill prove to you all that i can handle it there was so much yearning on his handsome face that gwenda wanted to jump up and shout her support for him but the men were shaking their heads everyone knew that one man could not harvest ninety acres on his own nate turned to perkin hes engaged to your daughter cant you do something for him perkin looked thoughtful perhaps you should transfer the land to me for the time being i could pay the heriot then when he marries annet he could take over his land no wulfric said immediately gwenda knew why he was so against the idea perkin was nothing if not sly he would spend every waking minute between now and the wedding trying to figure out a way of keeping wulfrics land for himself nate said to wulfric if you have no money how will you pay the heriot ill have money when i get the harvest in if you get the harvest in and then it may not be enough your father paid three pounds for his fathers lands and two pounds for his uncles gwenda gasped five pounds was a fortune it seemed impossible that wulfric could raise so much money it would probably have taken all his familys savings nate went on besides the heriot is normally paid before the inheritor takes possession not after the harvest aaron appletree said in the circumstances nate you might show leniency on that point might i a lord may show leniency for he holds sway over his own possessions but if a bailiff shows leniency hes giving away someone elses gold but we will only be making a recommendation in any case nothing will be final until approved by the new lord of wigleigh whoever he may be that was true strictly speaking gwenda thought but in practice it was unlikely a new lord would overturn an inheritance from father to son wulfric said sir my fathers heriot was not so much as five pounds we must check the rolls nates response was so quick that gwenda guessed he had been waiting for wulfric to challenge the amount nate often engineered a pause of some kind in the middle of a hearing she reflected she presumed it was to give the parties an opportunity to offer him a bribe perhaps he thought wulfric was concealing some money two jurors brought from the vestry the chest containing the manorial rolls the record of the manor courts decisions written on long strips of parchment rolled into cylinders nate could read and write a bailiff had to be literate in order to compile accounts for the lord he searched through the box for the right one gwenda felt that wulfric was doing badly his plain speaking and evident honesty were not enough nate wanted above all else to make sure he collected the lords heriot perkin was manoeuvring to get the land for himself billy howard wanted to do wulfric down out of sheer malice and wulfric had no money for a bribe he was also guileless he believed that if he stated his case he would get justice he had no sense of managing the situation perhaps she could help him a child of jobys could not grow up without learning something about guile wulfric had not appealed to the villagers selfinterest in his arguments she would do so for him she turned to david johns standing beside her im surprised you men arent more worried about this she said he gave her a shrewd look what are you getting at lass despite the sudden deaths this is an inheritance from father to son if you let nate quibble about this one hell question them all he can always dream up some reason for arguing about a legacy arent you afraid hell interfere with your own sons rights david looked worried you might have a point there girl he said and he turned to talk to his neighbour on the other side gwenda also felt it was a mistake for wulfric to demand a final ruling today better to ask for a temporary judgement which the jurymen would grant more readily she went to speak to wulfric he was arguing with perkin and annet when gwenda appeared perkin looked suspicious and annet put her nose in the air but wulfric was as courteous as ever hello my travelling companion he said i heard you left your fathers house he threatened to sell me a second time as many times as i could escape he thinks hes found a bottomless purse where are you living widow huberts took me in and ive been working for the bailiff on the lords lands a penny a day sunrise to sunset nate likes his labourers to go home tired do you think hell give you what you want wulfric made a face he seems reluctant a woman would handle it so differently he looked surprised how so annet glared at her but gwenda ignored the look a woman would not demand a ruling especially when everyone knows that todays decision isnt final she would not risk a no for the chance of a maybe wulfric looked thoughtful what would she do she would just ask to be allowed to continue working the land for now she would let the binding decision wait until the new lord is appointed she would know that in the interim everyone would get used to her being in possession so that when the new lord showed up his approval would seem like a formality she would gain her objective without giving people much chance to argue about it wulfric was not sure well its not what you want but its the most you can get today and how can nate refuse you when he has no one else to bring in the harvest wulfric nodded he was working out the possibilities people would see me reaping the crop and become accustomed to the idea after that it would seem unjust to deny me the inheritance and id be able to pay the heriot or some of it youd be a lot closer to your goal than you are now thank you youre very wise he touched her arm then turned back to annet she said something sharp to him in an undertone her father looked annoyed gwenda turned away dont tell me im wise she thought tell me im what beautiful never the love of your life thats annet a true friend to hell with that so what do i want why am i desperate to help you she had no answer she noticed david johns speaking emphatically to one of the jurors aaron appletree nate flourished the manor roll wulfrics father samuel paid thirty shillings to inherit from his father and a pound to inherit from his uncle a shilling was twelve pennies there was no shilling coin but everyone talked about shillings just the same twenty shillings made a pound the sum nate had announced was exactly half what he had originally said david johns spoke up a mans lands should go to his son he said we dont want to give our new lord whoever he may be the impression that he can pick and choose who shall inherit there was a murmur of agreement wulfric stepped forward bailiff i know you cant make a final decision today and im content to wait until the new lord is appointed all i ask is that i should be allowed to continue to work the land i will bring in the harvest i swear it but nothing is lost to you if i fail and nothing is promised to me if i succeed when the new lord comes i will throw myself on his mercy nate looked cornered gwenda felt sure he had been hoping for some way of making money out of this perhaps he had expected a bribe from perkin wulfrics prospective fatherinlaw she watched nates face as he tried to think of a way to refuse wulfrics more modest request as he hesitated one or two villagers began to mutter and he realized he was doing himself no good by revealing his reluctance very well he said with a show of grace that was not very convincing what does the jury say aaron appletree conferred briefly with his fellow jurors then said wulfrics request is modest and reasonable he should occupy the lands of his father until the new lord of wigleigh is appointed gwenda sighed with relief nate said thank you jurymen the court broke up and people began to head home for dinner most of the villagers could afford to eat meat once a week and sunday was the usual day they chose even joby and ethna could generally manage a stew of squirrel or hedgehog and at this time of year there were plenty of young rabbits to be caught widow huberts had a neck of mutton in a pot on the fire gwenda caught wulfrics eye as they were leaving the church well done she said as they strolled out together he couldnt refuse you though he seemed to want to it was your idea he said admiringly you knew exactly what i needed to say i dont know how to thank you she resisted the temptation to tell him they walked through the graveyard she said how will you manage the harvest i dont know why dont you let me come and labour for you ive no money i dont care ill work for food he stopped at the gate turned and gave her a candid look no gwenda i dont think that would be a good plan annet wouldnt like it and to be frank shed be right gwenda found herself blushing there was no doubt what he meant if he had wanted to reject her because she might be too weak or something there would have been no need for the direct look nor for the mention of his fiancees name he knew she realized with mortification that she was in love with him and he was refusing her offer of help because he did not want to encourage her hopeless passion all right she whispered looking down whatever you say he smiled warmly but thank you for the offer she made no reply and after a moment he turned and walked away gwenda got up while it was still dark she slept in the straw on the floor of widow hubertss house somehow her sleeping mind knew the time and woke her just before dawn the widow lying next to her did not stir when gwenda unwrapped her blanket and stood up finding her way by touch she opened the back door and stepped into the yard skip followed her shaking himself she stood still for a moment there was a fresh breeze as always in wigleigh the night was not totally black and she could make out vague shapes the duck house the privy the pear tree she could not see the neighbouring house which was wulfrics but she heard a low growl from his dog tethered outside the small sheepfold and she murmured a quiet phrase so that it would recognize her voice and be reassured it was a peaceful time but nowadays there were too many such moments in her day all her life she had lived in a tiny house full of babies and children and at any instant at least one of them was clamouring for food crying because of a minor hurt shouting a protest or screaming with helpless infantile rage she would never have guessed she might miss that but she did living with the quiet widow who chatted amiably enough but was equally comfortable with silence sometimes gwenda longed to hear a child cry just so that she could pick it up and comfort it she found the old wooden bucket and washed her hands and face then went back inside she located the table in the dark opened the bread box and cut a thick slice from the weekold loaf then she set out eating the bread as she walked the village was silent she was the first up peasants worked from sunup to sundown and at this time of year it was a long weary day they treasured every moment of rest only gwenda also used the hour between dawn and sunrise and the hour of twilight at the end of the day dawn broke as she left the houses behind and set out across the fields wigleigh had three great fields hundredacre brookfield and longfield different crops were grown on each in a threeyear cycle wheat and rye the most valuable grains were sown in the first year then lesser crops such as oats barley peas and beans in the second year and in the third year the field was left fallow this year hundredacre was in wheat and rye brookfield in various secondary crops and longfield was fallow each field was divided into strips of about one acre and each serfs land consisted of a number of strips scattered across all three fields gwenda went to hundredacre and began weeding one of wulfrics strips pulling up the persistent new growth of dockweed marigolds and dogfennel from between his stalks of wheat she was happy working on his land helping him whether he knew about it or not every time she bent down she was saving his back the same effort every time she pulled a weed she made his crop greater it was like giving him presents as she worked she thought of him picturing his face when he laughed hearing his voice the deep voice of a man yet with the eagerness of a boy she touched the green shoots of his wheat and imagined she was stroking his hair she weeded until sunrise then moved to the demesne lands those strips farmed by the lord or his labourers and worked for pay although sir stephen was dead his crops still had to be reaped and his successor would demand a strict account of what had been done with the proceeds at sundown having earned her daily bread gwenda would move to another part of wulfrics holding and work there until dark longer if there was a moon she had said nothing to wulfric but in a village of only two hundred people few things remained secret for long widow huberts had asked her with gentle curiosity what she hoped to achieve hes going to marry perkins girl you know you cant prevent that i just want him to succeed gwenda had replied he deserves it hes an honest man with a good heart and hes willing to work until he drops i want him to be happy even if he does marry that bitch today the demesne workers were in brookfield harvesting the lords early peas and beans and wulfric was nearby digging a drainage ditch the land was swampy after the heavy rain of early june gwenda watched him working wearing only his drawers and boots his broad back bending over the spade he moved as tirelessly as a millwheel only the sweat glistening on his skin betrayed the effort he was making at midday annet came to him looking pretty with a green ribbon in her hair carrying a jug of ale and some bread and cheese wrapped in a piece of sacking nate reeve rang a bell and everyone stopped work and retreated to the fringe of trees at the north end of the field nate gave out cider bread and onions to the demesne workers dinner was included in their remuneration gwenda sat with her back against a hornbeam tree and studied wulfric and annet with the fascination of a condemned man watching the carpenter build the gallows at first annet was her usual flirtatious self tilting her head batting her eyelids playfully striking wulfric in mock punishment for something he said then she became serious speaking to him insistently while he seemed to protest innocence they both looked at gwenda and she guessed they were talking about her she presumed annet had found out about her working on wulfrics strips in the mornings and evenings eventually annet left looking petulant and wulfric finished his dinner in thoughtful solitude after eating everyone rested for the remainder of the dinner hour the older people lay full length on the ground and dozed while the youngsters chatted wulfric came to where gwenda sat and crouched beside her youve been weeding my strips he said gwenda was not going to apologize i suppose annet scolded you she doesnt want you working for me what would she like me to do put the weeds back in the earth he glanced around and lowered his voice not wanting others to hear although everyone could surely guess what he and gwenda were saying to one another i know you mean well and im grateful but its causing trouble she enjoyed being this close to him he smelled of earth and sweat you need help she said and annet isnt much use please dont criticize her in fact dont speak of her at all all right but you cant get the harvest in alone he sighed if only the sun would shine automatically he looked up at the sky a peasant reflex there was thick cloud from horizon to horizon all the grain crops were struggling in the cool damp weather let me work for you gwenda begged tell annet you need me a man is supposed to be master of his wife not the other way around ill think about it he said but the next day he hired a labourer he was a travelling man who showed up at the end of the afternoon the villagers gathered around him in the twilight to hear his story his name was gram and he came from salisbury he said his wife and children had been killed when his house burned down he was on his way to kingsbridge where he hoped to get employment perhaps at the priory his brother was a monk there gwenda said i probably know him my brother philemon has worked at the priory for years whats your brothers name john there were two monks called john but before gwenda could ask which was grams brother he went on when i started out i had a little money to buy food along the way then i was robbed by outlaws and now im penniless there was a lot of sympathy for the man wulfric invited him to sleep at his house the next day saturday he started to work for wulfric accepting board and lodging and a share of the harvest as his remuneration gram worked hard all day saturday wulfric was shallowploughing his fallow land in longfield to destroy thistles it was a twoman job gram led the horse whipping it on when it flagged while wulfric guided the plough on sunday they rested in church on sunday gwenda burst into tears when she saw cath joanie and eric she had not realized how badly she missed them she held eric through the service afterwards her mother spoke harshly to her youre breaking your heart for that wulfric weeding his strips wont make him love you hes crosseyed for that worthless annet i know gwenda said but i want to help him anyway you should leave the village theres nothing for you here she knew her mother was right i will she said ill leave the day after their wedding ma lowered her voice if you must stay watch out for your father he hasnt given up hope of another twelve shillings what do you mean gwenda asked ma just shook her head he cant sell me now gwenda said ive left his house he doesnt feed or shelter me i work for the lord of wigleigh im not pas to dispose of any longer just watch out said ma and she would say no more outside the church the travelling man gram talked to gwenda asking her questions about herself and suggested they take a stroll together after dinner she guessed what he meant by a stroll and turned him down flat but later she saw him with yellowhaired joanna the daughter of david johns who was only fifteen and stupid enough to fall for the blandishments of a travelling man on monday gwenda was weeding wulfrics wheat on hundredacre in the halflight before sunrise when wulfric came across the field towards her at a run his face was grim with fury she had continued to defy his wishes working on his lands every morning and evening and it looked as if she had driven him too far what would he do beat her up after the way she had provoked him he could probably do violence to her with impunity people would say she had asked for it and she had no one to stick up for her now that she had left her parents home she felt scared she had seen wulfric break ralph fitzgeralds nose then she told herself not to be foolish although he had been in many fights she had never known him to strike a woman or a child all the same his anger made her tremble but it was nothing like that as soon as he got within hailing distance he shouted have you seen gram no why he came closer and stopped breathing hard how long have you been here i got up before dawn wulfrics shoulders slumped then if he came this way hes out of reach by now whats happened hes disappeared and so has my horse that explained wulfrics rage a horse was a valuable asset only wealthy peasants such as his father could afford one gwenda recalled how quickly gram had changed the subject when she said she might know his brother he did not have a brother at the priory of course nor had he lost his wife and child in a fire he was a liar who had wormed his way into the confidence of the villagers with the intention of stealing what fools we were to listen to his story she said and i the biggest fool of all to take him into my house wulfric said bitterly he stayed just long enough for the animals to get to know him so that the horse was willing to go with him and the dog didnt bark when he left gwendas heart ached for wulfric losing the horse at a time when he needed it most i dont think he came this way she said thoughtfully he cant have left before me the night was too dark and if he had followed me i would have seen him there was only one road into and out of the village and it deadended at the manor house but there were numerous pathways across the fields he probably took the lane between brookfield and longfield its the quickest way into the forest the horse cant move very fast in the woods i might catch him yet wulfric turned and ran back the way he had come good luck gwenda called after him and he waved acknowledgement without turning his head however he did not have good luck late that afternoon as gwenda was carrying a sack of peas from brookfield to the lords barn she walked past longfield and saw wulfric again he was digging over his fallow land with a spade obviously he had not caught up with gram nor retrieved his horse she put down the sack and crossed the field to speak to him you cant do this she said youve got thirty acres here and youve ploughed what ten no man can dig over twenty acres he did not meet her eye he carried on digging his face set i cant plough he said ive no horse put yourself in harness she said youre strong and its a light plough youre only killing thistles ive no one to guide the plough yes you have he stared at her ill do it she said he shook his head she said youve lost your family and now youve lost your horse you cant manage on your own you have no choice you have to let me help you he looked away across the fields towards the village and she knew he was thinking about annet ill be ready first thing tomorrow morning gwenda said his gaze returned to her his face worked with emotion he was torn between love of the land and a desire to please annet ill knock on your door gwenda said well plough the rest together she turned and walked away then stopped and looked back he did not say yes but he did not say no they ploughed for two days then made hay then picked spring vegetables now that gwenda was no longer earning money to pay widow huberts for bed and board she needed somewhere else to sleep so she moved into wulfrics cowshed she explained the reason and he made no objection after the first day annet ceased to bring wulfrics dinner at midday so gwenda would prepare food for them both from his cupboard bread ale in a jug boiled eggs or cold bacon and spring onions or beets once again wulfric accepted the change without comment she still had the love potion the little pottery vial was in a tiny leather bag attached to a thong around her neck it hung between her breasts hidden from view she could have dosed his ale at any dinner time but she would not be able to take advantage of its effects out in the fields in the middle of the day every evening he went to perkins house and had supper with annet and her family so gwenda sat alone in his kitchen when he returned he often looked grim but he said nothing to gwenda so she assumed he must have overruled annets objections he went to bed without taking anything more to eat or drink so she was not able to use the potion on the saturday after gram ran off gwenda made herself a supper of greens boiled with salt pork wulfrics house was stocked with food for four adults so there was plenty to eat the evenings were cool even though it was now july and after she had eaten she put another log on the kitchen fire and sat watching it catch alight thinking of the simple predictable life she had led until a few short weeks ago marvelling at how that life had collapsed as completely as the bridge at kingsbridge when the door opened she thought it was wulfric coming home she always retired to the cowshed when he came back but she enjoyed the few friendly words they exchanged before going to bed she looked up eagerly expecting to see his handsome face but she suffered an unpleasant shock it was not wulfric but her father with him was a roughlooking stranger she leaped to her feet full of fear what do you want skip gave a hostile bark but retreated from joby in fear joby said now then my little girl no need to be afraid im your pa she recalled with dismay her mothers vague warning in church who is he she said pointing at the stranger this here is jonah from abingdon a dealer in hides jonah might once have been a merchant gwenda thought grimly and he might even come from abingdon but his boots were worn his clothes were filthy and his matted hair and straggly beard showed that he had not visited a city barber for some years showing more courage than she felt gwenda said get away from me i told you she was feisty joby said to jonah but shes a good girl and strong jonah spoke for the first time not to worry he said he licked his lips as he studied gwenda and she wished she were wearing more than her light wool dress ive broken in a few fillies in my time he added gwenda had no doubt that her father had carried out his threat and sold her again she had thought that leaving his house would make her safe surely the villagers would not permit the abduction of a labourer employed by one of their number but it was dark now and she might be far away before anyone realized what had happened there was no one to help her all the same she was not going without a fight she looked around desperately searching for a weapon the log she had put on a few minutes ago was blazing at one end but it was about eighteen inches long and the other end stuck out invitingly she bent quickly and snatched it up now then no need for that sort of thing said joby you dont want to hurt your old pa do you he stepped closer a rush of rage overwhelmed her how dare he speak of himself as her old pa when he was trying to sell her suddenly she did want to hurt him she leaped at him screaming with rage thrusting the burning log at his face he jumped back but she kept coming mad with fury skip yapped frantically joby lifted his arms to protect himself trying to knock the brand away but she was strong too his flailing arms failed to stop her rush and she pushed the redhot end of the log into his face he screamed in pain as it scorched his cheek his dirty beard caught fire and there was a sickening smell of roasting flesh then gwenda was grabbed from behind jonahs arms encircled her pinning her own arms to her side she dropped the burning log plames leaped up immediately from the straw on the floor skip terrified of fire ran out of the house gwenda struggled wriggling in jonahs grasp throwing herself from side to side but he was surprisingly strong he lifted her off her feet a tall figure appeared in the doorway gwenda saw only the shape then it disappeared again gwenda felt herself thrown to the ground for a moment she was stunned when she came to her senses jonah was kneeling on her tying her hands with a rope the tall figure reappeared and gwenda recognized wulfric this time he was carrying a big oak bucket swiftly he emptied the bucket on to the burning straw putting out the flames then he changed his grip swung the bucket and hit the kneeling jonah a mighty blow on top of the head jonahs grip on gwenda relaxed she pulled her wrists apart and felt the rope loosen wulfric swung the bucket and hit jonah a second time even harder jonahs eyes closed and he slumped to the floor joby put out the flames of his burning beard by pressing his sleeve against it then sank to his knees moaning in agony wulfric picked up the unconscious jonah by his tunic front who on earth is this his name is jonah my father wanted to sell me to him wulfric lifted the man by the belt carried him to the front door and threw him out into the road joby groaned help me my face is burned help you said wulfric youve set fire to my house and attacked my labourer and you want me to help you get out joby got to his feet moaning piteously and staggered to the front door gwenda searched her heart and found no compassion what little love she might have had left for him had been destroyed tonight as he went out through the door she hoped he would never speak to her again perkin came to the back door carrying a rush light what happened he said i thought i heard a scream gwenda saw annet hovering behind him wulfric answered the question joby came here with another ruffian they tried to take gwenda away perkin grunted you seem to have dealt with the problem without difficulty wulfric realized he still had the bucket in his hand and he put it down annet said are you hurt not in the least do you need anything i just want to go to sleep perkin and annet took the hint and went away no one else seemed to have heard the commotion wulfric closed the doors he looked at gwenda in the firelight how do you feel shaky she sat on the bench and leaned her elbows on the kitchen table he went to the cupboard drink a little wine to steady yourself he took out a small barrel put it on the table and got two cups off the shelf gwenda was suddenly alert could this be her chance she tried to pull herself together she would have to act quickly wulfric poured wine into the cups then returned the barrel to the cupboard gwenda had only a second or two while his back was turned she reached into her bosom and pulled out the bag that hung around her neck on its leather thong she fumbled the vial from the bag with a trembling hand she unstoppered it and emptied it into his cup he turned around as she was pushing the bag back into her neckline she patted herself as if she had merely been straightening her clothing typical man he noticed nothing amiss and sat opposite her at the table she picked up her cup and raised it in a toast you saved me she said thank you your hand is shaking he said youve had a nasty shock they both drank gwenda wondered how long the potion would take to have its effect wulfric said you saved me by helping me in the fields thank you they drank again i dont know whats worse gwenda said to have a father like mine or to be like you and have no father at all i feel sorry for you wulfric said thoughtfully at least i have good memories of my parents he emptied his cup i dont usually drink wine i dont like that woozy feeling but this is great she watched him carefully mattie wise had said that he would become amorous gwenda looked for the signs sure enough he soon began to stare as if seeing her for the first time after a while he said you know youve got such a nice face theres a lot of kindness in it now she was supposed to use her feminine wiles to seduce him but she realized with a panicky feeling she had had no practice at this women such as annet did it all the time however when she thought of the things annet did smilingly coyly touching her hair fluttering her eyelashes she could not bring herself even to try she would just feel stupid youre kind she said talking to gain time but your face shows something else what strength the kind that comes not from big muscles but from determination i feel strong tonight he grinned you said no man could dig over twenty acres but i feel as if i could right now she put her hand over his on the table enjoy your rest she said theres plenty of time for digging he looked at her small hand on his large one weve got different colour skin he said as if discovering an amazing fact look yours is brown mines pink different skin different hair different eyes i wonder what our babies would be like he smiled at the thought then his expression changed as he realized something was wrong with what she had said abruptly his face became grave the change might have been comical if she had not cared so much about his feelings for her he said solemnly were not going to have babies he took his hand away lets not think about that she said desperately dont you sometimes wish he tailed off what dont you sometimes wish the world could be different from the way it is she got up walked around the table and sat close to him dont wish she said were alone and its night you can do anything you want she looked directly into his eyes anything he stared back at her she saw the yearning in his face and realized with a thrill of triumph that he desired her it had required a potion to bring it out but it was unmistakably genuine right now he wanted nothing in the world other than to make love to her still he made no move she took his hand he did not resist as she drew it to her lips she held the big rough fingers then pressed the palm to her mouth she kissed it then licked it with the tip of her tongue then she pressed his hand to one breast his hand closed over it making it seem very small his mouth opened a fraction and she could see that he was breathing hard she tilted her head back ready to be kissed but he did nothing she stood up and quickly pulled her dress up over her head and threw it to the floor she stood naked in front of him in the firelight he gazed at her eyes wide mouth open as if he were witnessing a miracle she took his hand again this time she touched it to the soft place between her thighs it covered the triangle of hair there she was so wet that his finger slipped inside her and she gave an involuntary groan of pleasure but he did nothing of his own volition and she understood that he was paralysed by indecision he wanted her but he had not forgotten annet gwenda could move him like a puppet all night perhaps even have sex with his inert body but that would change nothing she needed him to take the initiative she leaned forward still holding his hand against her groin kiss me she said she moved her face closer to his please she said she was an inch away from his mouth she would not get nearer he had to close the gap suddenly he moved he withdrew his hand turned away from her and stood up this is wrong he said and she knew that she had lost tears came to her eyes she picked up her dress from the floor and held it in front of her covering her nakedness im sorry he said i shouldnt have done any of those things i misled you ive been cruel no you havent she thought ive been cruel ive misled you but you were too strong youre too loyal too faithful youre too good for me but she said nothing he kept his gaze steadfastly away from her you must go to the cowshed he said go to sleep well feel differently in the morning it might be all right then she ran out through the back door not bothering to get dressed it was moonlight but there was no one to see her and she would not have cared anyway she was inside the cowshed in seconds at one end of the wooden building was a raised loft where clean straw was kept that was where she made her bed each night she climbed the ladder and threw herself down too miserable to care about the sharp prickle of straw on her bare skin she wept with disappointment and shame when eventually she calmed down she stood up and put her dress on then wrapped a blanket around her as she did so she thought she heard a step outside she looked through a gap in the rough wattleanddaub of the wall the moon was almost full and she could see clearly wulfric was outside he walked towards the door of the cowshed gwendas heart leaped perhaps it was not all over yet but he hesitated at the door then walked away he returned to the house turned at the kitchen door came back to the cowshed and turned again she watched him pace up and down her heart thudding but she did not move she had done all she could to encourage him he had to take the last step himself he stopped at the kitchen door his body was profiled by the moonlight a silver line running from his forelock to his boots she saw clearly as he reached into his drawers she knew what he was going to do she had seen her older brother do the same thing she heard wulfric groan as he began to rub himself with the motion that caricatured lovemaking she stared at him beautiful in the moonlight wasting his desire and she felt as if her heart would break godwyn moved against blind carlus on the sunday before the birthday of st adolphus on that sunday every year a special service was held in kingsbridge cathedral the bones of the saint were carried around the church by the prior followed by the monks in procession and they prayed for good harvest weather as always it was godwyns job to prepare the church for the service placing candles getting incense ready and moving furniture helped by novices and employees such as philemon the feast of st adolphus required a secondary altar an elaborately carved wooden table set on a platform that could be moved about the church as required godwyn placed this altar on the eastern edge of the crossing and put on it a pair of silvergilt candlesticks as he did so he anxiously mulled over his position now that he had persuaded thomas to stand for election as prior his next step was to eliminate the opposition carlus ought to be an easy target but in a way that was a disadvantage for godwyn did not want to appear callous he placed in the centre of the altar a reliquary cross a bejewelled gold crucifix with a core of wood from the true cross this the actual timber upon which christ was killed had been miraculously found a thousand years ago by helena the mother of constantine the great and pieces of it had found their way to churches all over europe as godwyn was arranging the ornaments on the altar he saw mother cecilia nearby and broke off from his work to speak to her i understand that earl roland has recovered his mind he said praise god amen she said the fever was on him so long that we feared for his life some evil humour must have entered his brain after his skull was fractured nothing he said made sense then this morning he woke up and spoke normally you cured him god cured him still he should be grateful to you she smiled youre young brother godwyn youll learn that men of power never show gratitude whatever we give them they accept as their right her condescension annoyed godwyn but he concealed his irritation at any rate we can now hold the election for prior at last who will win ten monks have promised firmly to vote for carlus and only seven for thomas with the candidates own votes that makes the score eleven to eight with six uncommitted so it could go either way but carlus is in the lead thomas could do with your support mother cecilia i dont have a vote but you have influence if you were to say that the monastery needs stricter control and a measure of reform and you felt thomas was more likely to deliver such a programme it would sway some of the waverers i ought not to take sides perhaps not but you could say that you will not continue to subsidize the monks unless they manage their money better what could be wrong with that her bright eyes glittered with amusement she was not so easily persuaded that would be a coded message of support for thomas yes i am strictly neutral i will happily work with whomever the monks choose and thats my last word brother he bowed his head deferentially i respect your decision of course she nodded and moved away godwyn was pleased he had never expected her to endorse thomas she was conservative everyone assumed she favoured carlus but godwyn could now spread the word that she would be content with either candidate in effect he had undermined her implicit support for carlus she might even be cross when she heard what use he was making of her words but she would not withdraw her statement of neutrality i am so clever he thought i really deserve to be prior neutralizing cecilia was helpful but it would not be enough to crush carlus godwyn needed to give the monks a vivid demonstration of how incompetent carlus was to lead them he was hoping anxiously for such an opportunity today carlus and simeon were in the church now rehearsing the service carlus was the acting prior so he had to lead the procession carrying the ivoryandgold reliquary that contained the bones of the saint simeon the treasurer and carluss crony was walking him through it and godwyn could see carlus counting his paces so that he would be able to do it on his own the congregation was impressed when carlus moved around confidently despite his blindness it seemed like a minor miracle the procession always began at the east end of the church where the relics were stored under the high altar the prior would unlock the cupboard and remove the reliquary he would carry it along the north aisle of the chancel around the north transept down the north aisle of the nave across the west end and back up the centre of the nave and into the crossing there he would climb two steps to place it on the second altar that godwyn had put in position ready the holy relics would remain there for the congregation to stare at throughout the service looking around the church godwyns eye fell on the repairs in the south aisle of the chancel and he stepped closer to see how they were coming along merthin was no longer involved having been sacked by elfric but his startlingly simple method was still being operated instead of expensive wooden formwork supporting the new masonry while the mortar set each stone was held in place by a simple rope draped over the long edge of the stone and weighted with a rock the system could not be used to build the ribs of the vault which were composed of long slender stones laid end to end so formwork had to be made for those elements but all the same merthin had saved the priory a small fortune in carpentry godwyn recognized merthins genius but still felt uneasy with him and preferred to work with elfric elfric could be trusted always to be a willing tool never to make trouble whereas merthin was all too likely to walk his own road carlus and simeon left the church was ready for the service godwyn sent away the men who had been helping him all but philemon who was sweeping the floor of the crossing for a moment the great cathedral was empty but for the two of them this was godwyns chance the plan he had half formulated now appeared complete in his mind he hesitated for it was dreadfully risky but he decided to gamble he beckoned to philemon now he said quickly move the platform forward a yard much of the time the cathedral was no more than a place of work to godwyn it was a space to be used a building to be repaired a source of income and at the same time a financial burden but on an occasion such as this its majesty was renewed the candle flames flickered their reflections glinting on the gold of the candlesticks the robed monks and nuns glided between the ancient stone pillars and the voices of the choir soared to the high vault no wonder the crowd of hundreds of townspeople were hushed as they stood watching carlus led the procession as the monks and nuns sang he opened the compartment under the high altar working by touch and took out the ivoryandgold reliquary holding it high he began to process around the church he was the picture of a holy innocent with his white beard and unseeing eyes would he fall into godwyns trap it was so simple it seemed too easy godwyn following a few paces behind carlus bit his lip and tried to remain calm the congregation was awestruck godwyn never failed to marvel at how willing they were to be manipulated they could not see the bones and if they had they could not have distinguished them from any other human remains but because of the costly extravagance of the box the eerie beauty of the singing the uniform robes of the monks and nuns and the towering architecture that dwarfed them all they felt the presence of something holy godwyn watched carlus carefully as he reached the precise midpoint of the westernmost bay of the north aisle he turned sharply left simeon stood ready to correct him if he misjudged but it was not necessary good the more confident carlus was the more likely he was to stumble at the crucial moment counting his paces carlus marched to the exact centre of the nave then turned again heading straight for the altar on cue the singing stopped and the procession carried on in a reverent hush it must be a bit like finding your way to the latrine in the middle of the night godwyn thought carlus had followed this route several times a year for most of his life he was now doing it as leader of the procession which must make him tense but he appeared calm only the slight movement of his lips betraying the fact that he was counting but godwyn had ensured that his count would be wrong would he make a fool of himself or would he somehow recover the congregation fell back fearfully as the sacred bones went by touching the casket could work miracles they knew but they also believed that any disrespect shown to the relics would have disastrous consequences the spirits of the dead were ever present watching over their remains while they waited for the day of judgement and those who had led holy lives enjoyed almost unlimited powers to reward or punish the living the thought crossed godwyns mind that st adolphus might be displeased with him for what was about to happen in kingsbridge cathedral he shivered with momentary terror then he reassured himself that he was acting for the good of the priory that housed the sacred bones and that the allwise saint who could see into mens hearts would understand that this was for the best carlus slowed as he approached the altar but his paces were the same measured length godwyn stopped breathing carlus seemed to hesitate as he took the step that should by his own calculations bring him just short of the platform on which the altar stood godwyn watched helplessly dreading some lastmoment change of routine then confidently carlus walked on his foot struck the edge of the platform a yard sooner than expected in the silence the sound of his sandal on the hollow wood resounded loudly he let out a cry of shock and fear his momentum carried him forward godwyns heart was lifted by a surge of triumph but it lasted only an instant then disaster struck simeon reached out to grab carluss arm but he was too late the casket flew from carluss hands the congregation gave a collective gasp of horror the precious box hit the stone floor and burst open scattering the bones of the saint carlus crashed into the heavy carvedwood altar pushing it back off the platform sending its ornaments and candles tumbling to the floor godwyn was horrified this was much worse than he had intended the skull of the saint rolled across the floor and came to rest at godwyns feet his plan had worked but too well he had wanted carlus to fall and appear helpless but he had not intended the holy remains to be desecrated he stared horrified at the skull on the ground and its empty eyes seemed to look back at him accusingly what dreadful punishment would befall him could he ever make restitution for such a crime because he had been expecting an incident he was slightly less shocked than everyone else and he regained his composure first standing over the bones he raised both arms in the air and shouted over the hubbub everyone on your knees we must pray those at the front knelt down and the rest quickly followed suit godwyn began a familiar prayer and the monks and nuns joined in as the chanting filled the church he righted the reliquary which seemed undamaged then moving with theatrical slowness he picked up the skull in both hands he was shaking with superstitious dread but he managed to hold it speaking the latin words of the prayer he carried the skull to the casket and placed it inside he saw that carlus was struggling to his feet he pointed at two nuns help the subprior to the hospital he said brother simeon mother cecilia will you go with him he picked up another bone he was frightened knowing that he more than carlus was to blame for what had happened but his intentions had been pure and he still hoped to mollify the saint at the same time he was aware that his actions must look good in the eyes of everyone present he was taking charge in a crisis like a true leader however this moment of awe and horror could not be allowed to last too long he needed to gather up the bones more quickly brother thomas he said brother theodoric come and help me philemon stepped forward but godwyn waved him back he was not a monk and only men of god should touch the bones carlus limped out of the church helped by simeon and cecilia leaving godwyn the undisputed master of the occasion godwyn beckoned philemon and another employee otho and told them to right the altar they set it straight on the platform otho picked up the candlesticks and philemon the jewelled crucifix they placed them reverently on the altar then retrieved the scattered candles all the bones were picked up godwyn tried to close the lid of the reliquary but it had buckled and did not quite fit making the best of it he ceremoniously placed the casket on the altar godwyn remembered just in time that he was seeking to show thomas not himself in the light of leader of the priory for the present he picked up the book simeon had been carrying and handed it to thomas thomas did not need to be told what to do he opened the book found the correct page and read the verse the monks and nuns formed lines either side of the altar then thomas led them in singing the psalm somehow they got through the service godwyn began to tremble again as soon as he got out of the church it had been a neardisaster but he seemed to have got away with it the monks burst into excited chatter as the procession reached the cloisters and broke up godwyn leaned against a pillar struggling to regain his composure he listened to the comments of the monks some felt the desecration of the relics was a sign that god did not want carlus to be prior the reaction godwyn had intended but to his dismay most expressed compassion for carlus that was not what godwyn wanted he realized he might have given carlus the benefit of a sympathetic backlash he pulled himself together and hurried to the hospital he needed to get to carlus while the man was still demoralized and before he got wind of the monks understanding the subprior was sitting up in bed with one arm in a sling and a bandage around his head he was pale and looked shaken and every few moments his face would twitch nervously simeon was sitting beside him simeon gave godwyn a filthy look i suppose youre pleased he said godwyn ignored him brother carlus youll be glad to know that the relics of the saint have been restored to their usual place with hymns and prayers the saint will surely forgive us all for this tragic accident carlus shook his head there are no accidents he said everything is ordained by god godwyns hopes lifted this was promising simeons thoughts followed the same lines and he tried to restrain carlus dont say anything hasty brother its a sign carlus said god is telling us he does not want me to be prior this was what godwyn had been hoping for simeon said nonsense he picked up a cup from a table beside the bed godwyn guessed it contained warm wine and honey mother cecilias prescription for most ills simeon put the cup into carluss hand drink carlus drank but he was not to be diverted from his theme it would be a sin to ignore such a portent portents are not so easily interpreted simeon protested perhaps not but even if youre right will the brothers vote for a prior who cant carry the relics of the saint without falling over godwyn said some of them might in fact be drawn to you in commiseration rather than repelled simeon shot him a puzzled look wondering what he was up to simeon was right to be suspicious godwyn was playing devils advocate because he wanted more than vague expressions of doubt from carlus could he possibly extract a definite withdrawal as he hoped carlus argued with him a man should be made prior because the brothers respect him and believe he can lead them wisely not out of pity he spoke with the bitter conviction of a lifetime of disability i suppose thats true godwyn said with feigned reluctance as if the admission had been wrung from him against his will taking a risk he added but perhaps simeon is right and you should postpone any final decision until you feel more yourself im as well as im ever going to be carlus retorted refusing to admit to weakness in front of young godwyn nothing is going to change ill feel tomorrow the way i feel today i will not stand for election as prior those were the words godwyn had been waiting for he stood up abruptly and bowed his head as if in acknowledgement hiding his face for fear he might reveal his sense of triumph you are as clear as always brother carlus he said i will convey your wishes to the rest of the monks simeon opened his mouth to protest but he was forestalled by mother cecilia coming into the room from the stairwell she looked flustered earl roland is demanding to see the subprior she said hes threatening to get out of bed but he must not move for his skull may not yet be fully healed but brother carlus should not move either godwyn looked at simeon well go he said they went together up the stairs godwyn was feeling good carlus did not even know that he had been routed of his own accord he had withdrawn himself from the contest leaving only thomas and godwyn could eliminate thomas any time he liked the plan had been astonishingly successful so far earl roland was lying on his back and his head was thickly bandaged but all the same he managed to look like a man in power the barber must have visited him for his face was shaved and his black hair as much of it as was not covered by the bandage had been neatly trimmed he wore a short purple tunic and new hose the two legs fashionably dyed different colours one red and one yellow despite lying in bed he wore a belt with a dagger and short leather boots his elder son william and williams wife philippa stood by the bed his young secretary father jerome in priestly robes sat at a nearby writing desk with pens and sealing wax ready the message was clear the earl was back in charge is the subprior there he said in a clear strong voice godwyn was quickerthinking than simeon and he replied first subprior carlus has suffered a fall and is himself lying here in this hospital lord he said i am the sacrist godwyn and with me is the treasurer simeon we thank god for your miraculous recovery for he guided the hands of the physicianmonks who have been attending you it was the barber who mended my broken head said roland thank him because the earl was lying on his back looking up at the ceiling godwyn could not see his face well but he had the impression that the earls expression was curiously blank and he wondered whether the injury had done some permanent damage he said do you have everything you need to make you comfortable if i dont youll soon know now listen my niece margery is to marry monmouths younger son roger i presume you know this yes godwyn had a sudden flash of memory margery lying on her back in this very room her white legs in the air fornicating with her cousin richard the bishop of kingsbridge the wedding has been unduly delayed by my injuries that was not true godwyn reflected the collapse of the bridge had taken place only a month ago the truth was probably that the earl needed to prove that the injury had not diminished him and he was still a power worthy of an alliance with the earl of monmouth roland went on the wedding will take place in kingsbridge cathedral three weeks from today strictly speaking the earl should have made a request not issued a command and an elected prior might have bristled at his highhandedness but of course there was no prior anyway godwyn could think of no reason why roland should not have his wish very well my lord he said i will make the necessary preparations i want the new prior installed in time for the service roland went on simeon grunted in surprise godwyn quickly calculated that haste would suit his plans remarkably well very good he replied there were two candidates but today subprior carlus withdrew his name leaving only brother thomas the matricularius we can hold the election as soon as you like he could hardly believe his luck simeon knew he was looking defeat in the face wait a minute he said but roland was not listening i dont want thomas he said godwyn had not been expecting that simeon grinned pleased at this lastminute reprieve shocked godwyn said but my lord roland did not permit him to interrupt summon my nephew saul whitehead from stjohnintheforest he said godwyns heart filled with foreboding saul was his contemporary as novices they had been friends they had gone to oxford together but there they had grown apart saul becoming more devout and godwyn more worldly saul was now the competent prior of the remote cell of st john he took very seriously the monastic virtue of humility and he would never have put forward his own name but he was bright devout and liked by everyone get him here as soon as possible said roland i shall nominate him as the next prior of kingsbridge merthin sat on the roof of st marks church at the north end of kingsbridge from here he could see the whole town to the southeast a bend in the river cradled the priory in the crook of its elbow a quarter of the town was taken up by the priory buildings and the grounds around them cemetery market place orchard and vegetable garden with the cathedral rising from its surroundings like an oak in a field of nettles he could see priory employees picking vegetables in the garden mucking out a stable and unloading barrels from a cart the centre of town was the wealthy neighbourhood especially the main street climbing the slope from the river as the first monks must have climbed it hundreds of years ago several wealthy merchants identifiable by the glowing colours of their fine wool coats walked purposefully along the street merchants were always busy another wide thoroughfare the high street ran west to east through the middle of the town bisecting the main street at right angles near the northwest corner of the priory on the same corner he could see the broad roof of the guild hall the largest building in town outside the priory on the main street next to the bell were the priory gates with cariss house opposite taller than most of the other buildings outside the bell merthin could see a crowd gathered around friar murdo the friar who did not seem to be attached to any particular fraternal order had stayed in kingsbridge after the bridge collapse shocked and bereaved people were particularly susceptible to his emotional roadside sermons and he was raking in the silver halfpennies and farthings merthin thought he was a fraud his holy anger faked and his tears a cover for cynicism and greed but merthin was in a minority at the bottom of the main street the stumps of the bridge still stuck up out of the water and next to them merthins ferry was crossing the water bearing a cart loaded with tree trunks to the southwest was the industrial sector where large houses on broad plots encompassed abattoirs tanneries breweries bakeries and workshops of all kinds too smelly and dirty for the towns leading citizens but nevertheless a district where plenty of money was made the river widened there dividing into two channels either side of leper island merthin could see ian boatman rowing his small craft to the island his passenger a monk probably carrying food to the one remaining leper the south bank of the river was lined with wharves and warehouses and rafts and barges were being unloaded at several of them beyond was the suburb of newtown where rows of poor houses ran between orchards pastures and gardens in which priory employees produced food for the monks and nuns the north end of town where st marks stood was the poor quarter and the church was surrounded by the huddled homes of labourers widows the unsuccessful and the old it was a poor church luckily for merthin four weeks ago a desperate father joffroi had hired merthin to build a hoist and repair his roof caris had persuaded edmund to lend merthin the money to buy tools merthin had hired a fourteenyearold boy jimmie to labour for a halfpenny a day and today the hoist was finished somehow word had got around that merthin was about to try out a new machine everyone had been impressed by his ferry and people were fascinated to see what he had come up with now down in the graveyard a small crowd had gathered mostly idlers but including father joffroi edmund and caris and some of the towns builders notably elfric if merthin failed today he would fail in front of his friends and enemies that was not the worst of it this job had saved him from the need to leave town in search of work but such a fate still hung over him if the hoist went wrong people would conclude that hiring merthin brought bad luck they would say that the spirits did not want him in town he would be under greater pressure to leave he would have to say goodbye to kingsbridge and to caris over the last four weeks as he had shaped the wood and joined the pieces of his hoist he had for the first time seriously thought about losing her and it dismayed him he had realized that she was all the joy in his world if the weather was fine he wanted to walk in the sunshine with her if he saw something beautiful he wanted to show it to her if he heard something funny his first thought was to tell her and see her smile his work gave him pleasure especially when he came up with clever solutions to intractable problems but it was a cold cerebral satisfaction and he knew that his life would be a long winter without caris he stood up it was time to put his skill to the test he had built a normal hoist with one innovative feature like all hoists it had a rope that ran through a series of pulleys on top of the church wall at the edge of the roof merthin had built a timber structure like a gallows with an arm that reached across the roof the rope ran out to the end of the arm at the other end of the rope on the ground in the graveyard was a treadwheel which wound up the rope when operated by the boy jimmie all this was standard the innovation was that the gallows incorporated a swivel so that the arm could swing to save himself from the fate of howell tyler merthin had a belt under his arms that was tied to a sturdy stone pinnacle if he fell he would not fall far so protected he had removed the slates from a section of the roof then tied the rope of the hoist to a timber now he called down to jimmie turn the wheel then he held his breath he was sure it would work it had to but all the same this was a moment of high anxiety jimmie inside the great treadmill on the ground began to walk the wheel could move only one way it had a brake pressing on its asymmetric teeth one side of each tooth was gently angled so that the brake moved gradually along the slope but the other side was vertical so that any reverse movement was immediately arrested as the wheel turned the roof timber rose when the timber was clear of the roof structure merthin shouted whoa jimmie stopped the brake engaged and the timber hung in the air swinging gently so far so good the next part was where things might go wrong merthin turned the hoist so that its arm began to swing he watched it holding his breath new strains were brought to bear on the structure as the weight of the load moved its position the wood of the hoist creaked the arm swung through half a circle bringing the timber from its original location over the roof to a new point over the graveyard there was a collective murmur of wonder from the crowd they had never seen a hoist that could swivel let it down merthin called jimmie operated the brake allowing the load to fall jerkily a foot at a time as the wheel turned and the rope unwound everyone watched in silence when the timber touched the ground there was a round of applause jimmie detached the timber from the rope merthin permitted himself a moment of triumph it had worked he climbed down the ladder the crowd cheered caris kissed him father joffroi shook his hand its a marvel the priest said ive never seen anything like it no one has merthin said proudly i invented it several more men congratulated him everyone was pleased to have been among the first to witness the phenomenon all but elfric looking cross at the back of the crowd merthin ignored him he said to father joffroi our agreement was that you would pay me if it worked gladly said joffroi i owe you eight shillings so far and the sooner i have to pay you for removing the rest of the timbers and rebuilding the roof the happier ill be he opened the wallet at his waist and took out some coins tied up in a rag elfric said loudly wait a moment everyone looked at him you cant pay this boy father joffroi he said hes not a qualified carpenter surely this could not happen merthin thought he had done the work it was too late now to deny him the wages but elfric cared nothing for fairness nonsense said joffroi hes done what no other carpenter in town could do all the same hes not in the guild i wanted to join merthin put in you would not admit me thats the prerogative of the guild joffroi said i say thats unjust and many people in town would agree hes done six and a half years of his apprenticeship with no wages but his food and a bed on the kitchen floor and everyone knows hes been doing the work of a qualified carpenter for years you should not have turned him out without his tools there was a murmur of assent from the men gathered around elfric was generally thought to have gone a bit too far elfric said with due respect to your reverence that is for the guild to decide not you all right joffroi folded his arms you tell me not to pay merthin even though he is the only man in town who can repair my church without closing it i defy you he handed the coins to merthin now you can take the case to court the priors court elfrics face twisted in spite when a man has a grievance against a priest is he likely to get a fair hearing in a court run by monks there was some sympathy in the crowd for this they knew of too many instances where the priors court had unjustly favoured the clergy but joffroi shot back can an apprentice get a fair hearing in a guild run by masters the crowd laughed at that they appreciated clever arguments elfric looked crushed whatever the court he could win a dispute between himself and merthin but he could not so easily prevail against a priest resentfully he said its a bad day for the town when apprentices defy their masters and priests support the boys but he sensed he had lost and he turned away merthin felt the weight of the coins in his hand eight shillings ninetysix silver pennies twofifths of a pound he knew he should count them but he was too happy to bother he had earned his first wages he turned to edmund this is your money he said pay me five shillings now the rest later edmund said generously keep some money for yourself you deserve it merthin smiled that would leave him three shillings to spend more money than he had ever had in his life he did not know what to do with it perhaps he would buy his mother a chicken it was midday and the crowd began to disperse heading home for dinner merthin went with caris and edmund he felt his future was secure he had proved himself as a carpenter and few people would hesitate to employ him now that father joffroi had set the precedent he could earn a living he could have a house of his own he could get married petranilla was waiting for them as merthin counted out five shillings tor edmund she put on the table a fragrant dish of fish baked with herbs in celebration of merthins triumph edmund poured sweet rhenish wine into cups for all of them but edmund was not a man to linger over the past we must get on with the new bridge he said impatiently five weeks have gone by and nothing has been done petranilla said i hear the earls health is rapidly returning to normal so perhaps the monks will hold the election soon i must ask godwyn but i havent seen him since yesterday when blind carlus fell over during the service id like to have a bridge design ready edmund said then work could begin as soon as the new prior is elected merthins ears pricked up what have you got in mind we know it has to be a stone bridge i want it wide enough for two carts to pass merthin nodded and it should be ramped at both ends so that people will step off the bridge on to dry ground not a muddy beach yes excellent caris said but how do you build stone walls in the middle of a river edmund said ive no idea but it must be possible there are lots of stone bridges merthin said ive heard men talk about this you have to build a special structure called a coffer dam to keep the water out of the area where youre building its quite simple but they say you have to be very careful to make sure its watertight godwyn came in looking anxious he was not supposed to make social calls in the town in theory he could leave the priory only on a specific errand merthin wondered what had happened carlus withdrew his name from the election he said good news edmund said have a cup of this wine dont celebrate yet godwyn said why not that leaves thomas as the only candidate and thomas wants to build the new bridge our problem is solved thomas is no longer the only candidate the earl is nominating saul whitehead oh edmund was thoughtful is that necessarily bad yes saul is well liked and has shown himself a competent prior of stjohnintheforest if he accepts the nomination hes likely to get the votes of former supporters of carlus which means he could win then as the earls nominee and his cousin too saul is likely to do his sponsors bidding and the earl may oppose the building of the new bridge on the grounds that it might take business away from shiring market edmund looked worried is there anything we can do i hope so someone has to go to st john to tell saul the news and bring him to kingsbridge ive volunteered for that job and im hoping theres some way i can persuade him to refuse petranilla spoke that may not solve the problem she said merthin listened carefully to her he did not like her but she was clever she went on the earl might nominate another candidate any nominee of his could oppose the bridge godwyn nodded agreement so assuming i can keep saul out of the contest we must make sure the earls second choice is someone who cant possibly get elected who do you have in mind his mother asked friar murdo excellent caris said but hes awful exactly godwyn said greedy drunken a sponger a selfrighteous rabblerouser the monks will never vote for him thats why we want him to be the earls candidate godwyn was like his mother merthin realized in having a talent for this kind of plotting petranilla said how shall we proceed first we need to persuade murdo to put his name forward that wont be hard just tell him hes in with a chance hed love to be prior agreed but i cant do it murdo would immediately suspect my motives everyone knows im backing thomas ill speak to him said petranilla ill tell him you and i are at odds and i dont want thomas ill say the earl is looking for someone to nominate and murdo could be the right man hes popular in the town especially among the poor and ignorant who labour under the delusion that hes one of them all he needs to do to get the nomination is make it clear that hes willing to be the earls pawn good godwyn stood up ill try to be present when murdo speaks to earl roland he kissed his mothers cheek and went out the fish was all gone merthin ate his bread trencher rich with juices edmund offered him more wine but he declined he was afraid he might fall off the roof of st marks this afternoon if he drank too much petranilla went into the kitchen and edmund retired to the parlour to sleep merthin and caris were left alone he moved to sit on the bench next to her and kissed her she said im so proud of you he glowed he was proud of himself he kissed her again this time with a long moist kiss that gave him an erection he touched her breast through the linen of her robe squeezing her nipple gently with his fingertips she touched his erection and giggled do you want me to bring you off she whispered she did that sometimes late in the evening when her father and petranilla were asleep and merthin and she were alone on the ground floor of the house but this was broad daylight and someone could walk in at any moment no he said i could do it quickly she tightened her grasp im too embarrassed he stood up and moved to the other side of the table im sorry well maybe we wont have to do this much longer do what hide and worry about people walking in she looked hurt dont you like it of course i do but it would be nicer for us to be alone i could take a house now that im getting paid youve only been paid once thats true but you seem very pessimistic all of a sudden have i said something wrong no but why do you want to change the way things are he was baffled by this question i just want more of the same in private she looked defiant im happy now well so am i but nothing goes on for ever why not he felt as if he were explaining something to a child because we cant spend the rest of our lives living with our parents and stealing kisses when no ones looking we have to get a home of our own and live as man and wife and sleep together every night and have real sex instead of bringing each other off and raise a family why she said i dont know why he said in exasperation thats the way it is and im not going to try to explain any more because i think youre determined not to understand or at least to pretend you dont understand all right and besides i have to go back to work go on then this was incomprehensible he had been frustrated during the last half year by not being able to marry caris and he had assumed she felt the same now it seemed she did not indeed she resented his assumption but did she really believe that they could continue this adolescent relationship indefinitely he looked at her trying to read her face and saw only a sulky obstinacy there he turned away and went out through the door he hesitated on the street outside perhaps he should go back in and make her say what was on her mind but remembering the look on her face he knew this was not the moment to try to make her do anything so he walked on heading for st marks thinking how did such a wonderful day turn so bad godwyn was preparing kingsbridge cathedral for the big wedding the church had to look its best in addition to the earl of monmouth and the earl of shiring there would be several barons and hundreds of knights in attendance broken flagstones had to be replaced chipped masonry repaired crumbling mouldings carved anew walls whitewashed pillars painted and everything scrubbed clean and i want the repairs to the south aisle of the chancel finished godwyn said to elfric as they walked through the church im not sure thats possible it must be done we cant have scaffolding in the chancel during a wedding of this importance he saw philemon waving urgently at him from the south transept door excuse me i havent got the men elfric called after him you shouldnt be so quick to sack them godwyn said over his shoulder philemon was looking excited friar murdo is asking to see the earl he said good petranilla had spoken to the friar last night and this morning godwyn had instructed philemon to lurk near the hospital and watch out for murdo he had been expecting an early visit he hurried to the hospital with philemon in tow he was relieved to see that murdo was still waiting in the big room on the ground floor the fat friar had smartened up his appearance his face and hands were clean the fringe of hair around his tonsure was combed and he had sponged the worst of the stains off his robe he did not look like a prior but he almost looked like a monk godwyn ignored him and went up the stairs standing guard outside the earls room he saw merthins brother ralph who was one of the earls squires ralph was handsome except for a broken nose a recent injury squires were always breaking bones hello ralph godwyn said amiably what happened to your nose i had a fight with a peasant bastard you should have got it set properly did that friar come up here yes they asked him to wait whos with the earl lady philippa and the clerk father jerome ask if theyll see me lady philippa says the earl must not see anyone godwyn gave ralph a mantoman grin but shes only a woman ralph grinned back then opened the door and put his head inside brother godwyn the sacrist he said there was a pause and then lady philippa stepped out and closed the door behind her i told you no visitors she said angrily earl roland is not getting the rest he needs ralph said i know my lady but brother godwyn wouldnt bother the earl unnecessarily something in ralphs tone made godwyn look at him although ralphs words were mundane the expression on his face was adoring godwyn noticed then how voluptuous philippa was she wore a darkred dress belted at the waist and the fine wool clung to her breasts and hips she looked like a statue representing temptation godwyn thought and he wished yet again that he could find a way to ban women from the priory it was bad enough if a squire fell in love with a married woman but for a monk to do the same would be a catastrophe i regret the need to trouble the earl godwyn said but theres a friar waiting downstairs to see him i know murdo is his business so urgent on the contrary but i need to forewarn the earl what to expect so you know what the friar is going to say i believe i do well i think its best if the two of you see the earl together godwyn said but then pretended to stifle a protest philippa looked at ralph get the friar up here please ralph summoned murdo and philippa ushered him and godwyn into the room earl roland was on the bed fully dressed as before but this time he was sitting up his bandaged head cushioned with feather pillows whats this he said with his usual bad temper a meeting of the chapter what do you monks want looking at his visage directly for the first time since the bridge collapse godwyn was shocked to see that the entire right side of his face was paralysed the eyelid drooped the cheek hardly moved and the mouth was slack what made it so startling was that the left side was animated when roland spoke the left side of his forehead frowned his left eye opened wide and seemed to blaze with authority and he spoke vehemently out of the left side of his mouth the doctor in godwyn was fascinated he knew that head injuries could have unpredictable effects but he had never heard of this particular manifestation dont gawk at me the earl said impatiently you look like a pair of cows staring over a hedge state your business godwyn pulled himself together he had to tread carefully over the next few minutes he knew that roland would reject murdos application to be nominated as prior all the same he wanted to plant in rolands mind the idea of murdo as a possible alternative to saul whitehead therefore godwyns job was to strengthen murdos application he would do this paradoxically by objecting to murdo thereby showing roland that murdo would owe no allegiance to the monks for roland wanted a prior who served him alone but on the other hand godwyn must not protest too strongly for he did not want the earl to realize what a truly hopeless candidate murdo actually was it was a tortuous path to walk murdo spoke first in his sonorous pulpit voice my lord i come to ask you to consider me for the position of prior of kingsbridge i believe not so loud for the love of the saints roland protested murdo lowered his voice my lord i believe that i why do you want to be prior roland said interrupting him again i thought a friar was a monk without a church by definition this point of view was oldfashioned friars originally were travellers who held no property but nowadays some of the fraternal orders were as wealthy as traditional monks roland knew this and was just being provocative murdo gave the standard answer i believe that god accepts both forms of sacrifice so youre willing to turn your coat i have come to think that the talents he gave me could be put to better use in a priory so yes i would be happy to embrace the rule of st benedict but why should i consider you i am also an ordained priest no shortage of those and i have a following in kingsbridge and the surrounding countryside such that if i may be allowed to boast i must be the most influential man of god in the area father jerome spoke for the first time he was a confident young man with an intelligent face and godwyn sensed that he was ambitious its true he said the friar is extraordinarily popular he was not popular with the monks of course but neither roland nor jerome knew that and godwyn was not about to enlighten them nor was murdo he bowed his head and said unctuously i thank you from my heart father jerome godwyn said he is popular with the ignorant multitude as was our saviour murdo shot back monks should lead lives of poverty and selfdenial godwyn said roland put in the friars clothes look poor enough and as for selfdenial it seems to me that kingsbridge monks eat better than many peasants friar murdo has been seen drunk in taverns godwyn protested murdo said st benedicts rule permits monks to drink wine only if they are sick or labouring in the fields i preach in the fields murdo was a formidable opponent in an argument godwyn noted he was glad that he did not actually want to win this one he turned to roland all i can say is that as the sacrist here i strongly counsel your lordship against nominating murdo as prior of kingsbridge noted roland said coldly philippa gave godwyn a look of mild surprise and he realized he had yielded a little too easily but roland had not noticed he did not deal in nuances murdo had not finished the prior of kingsbridge must serve god of course but in all things temporal he should be guided by the king and the kings earls and barons that was about as plain as could be godwyn thought murdo might as well have said i will be your man it was an outrageous declaration the monks would be horrified it would wipe out any support there might have been among them for murdos candidacy godwyn made no comment but roland looked inquiringly at him anything to say to that sacrist im sure the friar did not mean to say that the priory of kingsbridge should be in subjection to the earl of shiring in any matter temporal or otherwise did you murdo i have said what i have said murdo replied in his pulpit voice enough said roland bored now with the game youre wasting your time both of you i shall nominate saul whitehead off you go stjohnintheforest was a miniature version of kingsbridge priory the church was small as were the stonebuilt cloisters and dormitory the rest of the buildings were simple woodframe structures there were eight monks and no nuns in addition to their lives of prayer and meditation they grew most of their own food and made a goats cheese that was famous throughout southwest england godwyn and philemon had been riding for two days and it was early evening when the road emerged from the forest and they saw a wide acreage of cleared land with the church in the middle godwyn knew at once that his fears were true and reports that saul whitehead was doing a good job as prior of this cell were if anything understated there was a look of order and neatness about everything the hedges trimmed the ditches straight the trees planted at measured intervals in the orchard the fields of ripening grain free of weeds he felt sure he would find that the services were held at the correct times and conducted reverently he had to hope that sauls evident fitness for leadership had not made him ambitious as they rode along the path through the fields philemon said why is the earl so keen to make his cousin prior of kingsbridge for the same reason that he had his younger son made bishop of kingsbridge godwyn replied bishops and priors are powerful the earl wants to make sure that any influential man in his neighbourhood is an ally not an enemy what might they quarrel about godwyn was interested to see that young philemon was beginning to be intrigued by the chess game of power politics land taxes rights privileges for example the prior might want to build a new bridge at kingsbridge to bring more business to the fleece fair and the earl might oppose such a scheme on the grounds that it would take business away from his own fair at shiring but i dont really see how the prior could fight against the earl a prior has no soldiers a clergyman can influence the mass of the people if he preaches a sermon against the earl or calls upon the saints to bring misfortune to the earl people will begin to believe that the earl is cursed then they will discount his power mistrust him and expect all his projects to be doomed it can be very hard for a nobleman to oppose a truly determined cleric look what happened to king henry ii after the murder of thomas becket they rode into the farmyard and dismounted the horses immediately drank from the trough there was no one about but a monk with his robe hitched up mucking out a pigsty behind the stables he was sure to be a youngster doing a job like that godwyn called to him hey you lad come and help us with our horses righto the monk called back he finished cleaning out the sty with a few more passes of his rake then leaned the tool up against the stable wall and walked towards the newcomers godwyn was about to tell him to get a move on when he recognized the blond fringe of saul godwyn disapproved a prior should not muck out a pigsty ostentatious humility was after all ostentation however in this case sauls meekness might suit godwyns purpose he gave saul a friendly smile hello brother i didnt mean to order the prior to unsaddle my horse why not said saul someone must do it and youve been travelling all day saul led the horses into the stable the brothers are in the fields he called out but theyll be back soon for evensong he reemerged come into the kitchen they had never been close godwyn could not help feeling criticized by sauls piety saul was never unfriendly but with quiet determination he simply did things differently godwyn had to take care not to become irritated he felt stressed enough already godwyn and philemon followed saul across the farmyard and into a onestorey building with a high roof although made of wood it had a stone fireplace and chimney they sat gratefully on a rough bench at a scrubbed table saul drew two generous cups of ale from a large barrel he sat opposite them philemon drank thirstily but godwyn just sipped saul offered no food and godwyn guessed they would get nothing more until after evensong he felt too tense to eat anyway this was another delicate moment he reflected anxiously he had had to protest against murdos nomination in such a way as not to dissuade roland now he had to invite saul to stand in a way that he could not possibly accept he knew what he was going to say but he had to say it right if he made a false step saul would become suspicious and then anything could happen saul gave him no time for further worry what brings you here brother he said earl roland has recovered his wits i thank god this means we can hold the election for prior good we should not go too long without one but who should it be saul sidestepped the question have any names been put forward brother thomas the matricularius hed be a good manager no one else godwyn told a halftruth not formally what about carlus when i came to kingsbridge for prior anthonys funeral the subprior was the leading candidate he feels he is not capable of the job because of his blindness perhaps saul did not know about carlus falling over during the service for st adolphuss birthday godwyn decided not to tell him at any rate he has thought and prayed about it and made his decision has the earl not made a nomination hes thinking about it godwyn hesitated thats why were here the earl is considering nominating you this was not really a lie godwyn told himself just a misleading emphasis im honoured godwyn studied him but not completely surprised perhaps saul flushed forgive me the great philip was in charge here at st john and then became prior of kingsbridge and others have followed the same route that is not to say that im worthy as they were of course but the thought had crossed my mind i confess nothing to be ashamed of how would you feel about being nominated how would i feel saul seemed mystified why ask that if the earl wishes he will nominate me and if my brethren want me theyll vote for me and i will consider myself called by god it makes no difference how i feel about it this was not the answer godwyn wanted he needed saul to make up his own mind talk of gods will was counterproductive its not quite so simple he said you dont have to accept the nomination thats why the earl sent me here its not like roland to ask where he might command godwyn almost winced never forget how shrewd saul is he told himself he backpedalled hastily no indeed however if you think you might refuse he needs to know as soon as possible so that he can nominate someone else that was probably true though roland had not said it i didnt realize it was done this way it was not done this way godwyn thought but he said last time it happened when prior anthony was elected you and i were both novices so we didnt know what went on true do you feel you have the ability to fill the role of prior of kingsbridge certainly not ah godwyn pretended disappointment though he had been relying on sauls humility to produce that answer however what with gods help who knows what might be accomplished how true godwyn concealed his annoyance the humble answer had just been a formality the truth was that saul thought he could do the job of course you should reflect and pray about it tonight im sure ill think of little else they heard distant voices the brothers are returning from their work we can talk again in the morning godwyn said if you decide to be a candidate you must come back to kingsbridge with us very well there was a serious danger of sauls accepting godwyn feared but he had one more arrow to shoot something else you might bear in mind in your prayers he said a nobleman never offers a free gift saul looked worried what do you mean earls and barons dispense titles land positions monopolies but these things always have a price and in this case if you are elected roland will expect you to make recompense you are his cousin anyway and youll owe your position to him you will be his voice in chapter making sure the priorys actions dont interfere with his interests will he make that an explicit condition of the nomination explicit no but when you return with me to kingsbridge he will question you and the questions will be designed to reveal your intentions if you insist that you will be an independent prior showing no special favour to your cousin and sponsor he will nominate someone else i had not thought of that of course you may simply give him the answers he wants to hear and then change your mind after the election but that would be dishonest some would think so god would think so thats something for you to pray about tonight a group of young monks came into the kitchen muddy from the fields talking loudly saul got up to serve them ale but the worried look remained on his face it stayed there when they went into the little church with its wall painting of the day of judgement over the altar for evensong it was still there when at last the evening meal was served and godwyns hunger was assuaged by the delicious cheese the monks made godwyn lay awake that night although he ached from two days on horseback he had confronted saul with an ethical dilemma most monks would have been willing to shade their position while talking to roland and speak words which promised a degree of subservience to the earl much greater than they really intended but not saul he was driven by moral imperatives would he find a way through the dilemma and accept the nomination godwyn did not see how he could saul still wore the worried look when the monks got up at first light for the service of lauds after breakfast he told godwyn he could not accept the nomination godwyn could not get used to earl rolands face it was the strangest thing to look at the earl was now wearing a hat to cover the bandages on his head but by making his appearance more normal the hat emphasized the paralysis of the right side of his face roland also seemed even more badtempered than usual and godwyn guessed he was still suffering severe headaches where is my cousin saul he said as soon as godwyn walked into the room still at st john my lord i gave him your message message it was a command lady philippa standing beside the bed said softly dont excite yourself lord you know it makes you feel ill godwyn said brother saul simply said that he cannot accept the nomination why the devil not he thought and prayed of course he prayed thats what monks do what reason did he give for defying me he does not feel himself capable of such a challenging role nonsense what challenge hes not being asked to lead a thousand knights into battle just make sure a handful of monks sing their hymns at the right times of day that was rubbish so godwyn bowed his head and said nothing the earls tone changed suddenly ive just realized who you are youre the son of petranilla arent you yes lord that petranilla whom you jilted godwyn thought she was sly and ill bet you are too how do i know you didnt talk saul out of accepting you want thomas langley to be prior dont you my plan is a lot more devious than that you fool godwyn thought he said saul did ask me what you might want in return for nominating him ah now we come to it what did you tell him that you would expect him to listen to one who was his cousin his sponsor and his earl and he was too pigheaded to accept that i suppose right that settles it i shall nominate that fat friar now get out of my sight godwyn had to hide his elation as he bowed out of the room the penultimate stage of his plan had worked perfectly earl roland had not the least suspicion of how he had been nudged into nominating the most hopeless candidate godwyn could think of now for the final step he left the hospital and entered the cloisters it was the hour of study before the midday service of sext and most of the monks were standing or sitting around reading being read to or meditating godwyn spotted theodoric his young ally and summoned him with a jerk of the head in a low voice he said earl roland has nominated friar murdo as prior theodoric said loudly what hush its impossible of course it is no one will vote for him thats why im pleased understanding dawned on theodorics face oh i see so its good for us really godwyn wondered why he always had to explain these things even to intelligent men no one saw below the surface except him and his mother go around telling everyone quietly no need to show your outrage theyll get angry enough without encouragement should i say that this is good for thomas absolutely not right said theodoric i understand he evidently did not but godwyn felt he could be trusted to follow instructions godwyn left him and went in search of philemon he found him sweeping out the refectory do you know where murdo is he asked probably in the kitchen find him and ask him to meet you in the priors house when all the monks are in church for sext i dont want anyone to see you there with him all right what do i tell him first of all you say brother murdo no one must ever know that i told you this is that clear no one must ever know that i told you this all right then show him the charter we found you remember where it is in the bedroom beside the priedieu theres a chest with a gingercoloured leather wallet inside is that all point out that the land thomas brought to the priory belonged originally to queen isabella and that this fact has been kept secret for ten years philemon looked puzzled but we dont know what thomas is trying to hide no but theres always a reason for a secret dont you think murdo will try to use this information against thomas of course what will murdo do i dont know but whatever it is its sure to be bad for thomas philemon frowned i thought we were supposed to be helping thomas godwyn smiled thats what everyone thinks the bell rang for sext philemon went off in search of murdo and godwyn joined the rest of the monks in church in unison with the others he said o god incline unto mine aid on this occasion he prayed with unusual earnestness despite the confidence he had shown philemon he knew he was gambling he had staked everything on thomass secret but he did not know what the face of the card would show when he turned it up however it was clear he had succeeded in stirring up the monks they were restless and talkative and carlus had to call for quiet twice during the psalms they disliked friars in general for taking an attitude of moral superiority on the question of earthly possessions while at the same time sponging off those they condemned and they disliked murdo in particular for being pompous greedy and drunk they would have anyone rather than him as they left the church after the service simeon spoke to godwyn we cannot have the friar he said i agree carlus and i will not be putting forward another name if the monks appear divided the earl will be able to present his candidate as a necessary compromise we must sink our differences and rally round thomas if we show the world a united front it will be difficult for the earl to oppose us godwyn stopped and faced simeon thank you brother he said forcing himself to look humble and hide the exultation he felt were doing it for the good of the priory i know but i appreciate your generosity of spirit simeon nodded and walked away godwyn smelled victory the monks went into the refectory for dinner murdo joined them he missed services but not meals all monasteries had a general rule that any monk or friar was welcome at the table though few people exploited the practice as thoroughly as murdo godwyn studied his face the friar looked excited as if he had news he was bursting to share however he contained himself while dinner was served and remained silent throughout the meal listening to a novice read the passage chosen was the story of susanna and the elders godwyn disapproved the story was too sexy to be read aloud in a celibate community but today even the attempts of two lascivious old men to blackmail a woman into having sex with them failed to capture the monks attention they kept whispering among themselves looking sidelong at murdo when the food was finished and the prophet daniel had saved susanna from execution by interrogating the elders separately and showing that they told inconsistent stories the monks got ready to leave at that moment murdo spoke to thomas when you came here brother thomas you had a sword wound i believe he spoke loudly enough for everyone to hear and the other monks stopped to listen thomas looked at him stonily yes the wound that eventually caused you to lose your left arm i wonder did you receive that wound in the service of queen isabella thomas turned pale ive been a monk of kingsbridge for ten years my previous life is forgotten murdo carried on unperturbed i ask because of the parcel of land that you brought with you when you joined the priory a very productive little village in norfolk five hundred acres near lynn where the queen lives godwyn interrupted pretending to be indignant what does an outsider know of our property oh ive read the charter murdo said these things arent secret godwyn looked at carlus and simeon sitting side by side both men looked startled as subprior and treasurer they knew already they must be wondering how murdo had got sight of the deed simeon opened his mouth to speak murdo said or at least theyre not supposed to be secret simeon closed his mouth again if he demanded to know how murdo had found out he would himself face questions about why he had kept the secret murdo went on and the farm at lynn was donated to the priory by he paused for dramatic effect queen isabella he finished godwyn looked around there was consternation among the monks all but carlus and simeon who both looked stonefaced friar murdo leaned across the table green herbs from the dinnertime stew adhered to his teeth i ask you again he said aggressively did you receive your wound in the service of queen isabella thomas said everyone knows what i did before i was a monk i was a knight i fought battles i killed men i have confessed and received absolution a monk may put his past behind him but the prior of kingsbridge carries a heavier burden he may be asked who he killed and why and most importantly what reward he received thomas stared back at murdo without speaking godwyn tried to read thomass face it was rigidly set in an expression of some strong emotion but what there was no sign of guilt or even embarrassment whatever the secret was thomas did not feel he had done something shameful the look was not rage either murdos sneering tone might have provoked many men to violence but thomas did not look as if he were about to lash out no what thomas seemed to be feeling was something different colder than embarrassment quieter than rage it was godwyn realized at last fear thomas was afraid of murdo hardly no he feared something that might happen because of murdo some consequence of murdos having discovered the secret murdo continued like a dog with a bone if you dont answer the question here in this room it will be asked elsewhere godwyns calculations called for thomas to give up at this point but it was not a certainty thomas was tough for ten years he had shown himself to be quiet patient and resilient when approached by godwyn to stand as prior he must have decided that the past could be buried he must now realize he had been wrong but how would he react to that realization would he see his mistake and back away or would he grit his teeth and see it through godwyn bit his lip and waited thomas spoke at last i think you may be right about the question being asked elsewhere he said or at least i think you will do everything in your power no matter how unbrotherly or dangerous to make your forecast come true i dont know if youre implying you need say no more thomas said rising abruptly to his feet murdo recoiled thomass height and soldierly physique combined with a sharp rise in his voice achieved the rare result of silencing the friar i have never answered questions about my past thomas said his voice was quiet again and every monk in the room was still and silent straining to hear i never will he pointed at murdo but this slug makes me realize that if i became your prior such questions would never cease a monk may keep his past to himself but a prior is different i now see a prior may have enemies and any mystery is a weakness and then of course by the leaders vulnerability the institution itself is threatened my brain should have led me where friar murdos malice led him to the conclusion that a man who does not want to answer questions about his past cannot be a prior therefore young theodoric said no therefore i now withdraw my candidacy in the coming election godwyn breathed a long sigh of satisfaction he had achieved his object thomas sat down murdo looked smug and everyone else tried to speak at the same time carlus banged the table and slowly they quietened down he said friar murdo as you dont have a vote in this election i must ask you to leave us now murdo slowly walked out looking triumphant when he had gone carlus said this is a catastrophe murdo the only candidate theodoric said thomas cannot be allowed to withdraw but he has simeon said there must be another candidate yes said carlus and i propose simeon no said theodoric let me speak said simeon we must choose the one among us who is most certain to unite the brethren against murdo that is not myself i know i dont have enough backing among the youngsters i think we all know who would gather most support from all sections he turned and looked at godwyn yes theodoric said godwyn the younger monks cheered and the older ones looked resigned godwyn shook his head as if reluctant even to respond to them they began to bang the tables and chant his name godwyn godwyn at last he stood up his heart was full of elation but he kept his face straight he held up his hands for quiet then when the room was silent he said in a low modest voice i shall obey the will of my brethren the room erupted in cheering godwyn delayed the election earl roland was going to be angry at the result and godwyn wanted to give him as little time as possible to fight the decision before the wedding the truth was that godwyn was frightened he was going up against one of the most powerful men in the kingdom there were only thirteen earls together with about forty lesser barons twentyone bishops and a handful of others they governed england when the king summoned parliament they were the lords the aristocratic group by contrast with the commons who were knights gentry and merchants the earl of shiring was one of the more powerful and prominent men of his class and yet brother godwyn age thirtyone son of the widow petranilla who had risen no higher than sacrist of kingsbridge priory was in conflict with the earl and what was even more dangerous he was winning so he dithered but six days before the wedding roland put his foot down and said tomorrow guests were already arriving for the nuptials the earl of monmouth had moved into the hospital using the private room next to rolands lord william and lady philippa had had to remove to the bell inn bishop richard was sharing the priors house with carlus lesser barons and knights filled the taverns along with their wives and children squires and servants and horses the town enjoyed a surge of spending much needed after the disappointing profits from the raindrenched fleece fair on the morning of the election godwyn and simeon went to the treasury a small windowless room behind a heavy oak door off the library the precious ornaments used for special services were there locked in an ironbound chest simeon as treasurer held the keys the election was a foregone conclusion or so thought everyone except earl roland no one suspected godwyns hidden hand he had suffered one tense moment when thomas had wondered aloud how friar murdo got to know about the isabella charter he cant have discovered it accidentally hes never been seen reading in the library and anyway that deed isnt kept with the others thomas had said to godwyn someone must have told him about it but who only carlus and simeon knew of it why would they have let the secret out they didnt want to help murdo godwyn had said nothing and thomas had remained baffled godwyn and simeon dragged the treasure chest into the light of the library the cathedral jewels were wrapped in blue cloth and cushioned in protective sheets of leather as they sorted through the box simeon unwrapped some of the items admiring them and checking that they were undamaged there was a plaque a few inches wide made of ivory delicately carved showing the crucifixion of st adolphus at which the saint had asked god to grant good health and long life to all those who venerated his memory there were numerous candlesticks and crucifixes all of gold or silver most decorated with precious stones in the strong light from the tall library windows the gems glittered and the gold glowed these things had been given to the priory over the centuries by devout worshippers their combined value was awesome there was more wealth here than most people ever saw in one place godwyn had come for a ceremonial crosier or shepherds crook made of wood encased in gold with an elaborately jewelled handle this was ritually handed to the new prior at the end of the election process the crook was at the bottom of the chest not having been used for thirteen years as godwyn drew it out simeon let out an exclamation godwyn looked up sharply simeon was holding a large crucifix on a stand intended to be placed on an altar whats the matter godwyn said simeon showed him the back of the cross and pointed to a shallow cupshaped indentation just below the crosspiece godwyn immediately saw that a ruby was missing it must have fallen out he said he glanced around the library they were alone they were both worried as treasurer and sacrist they shared responsibility they would be blamed for any loss together they examined every item in the chest they unwrapped each one and shook out every blue cloth they looked at all the leather sheets frantically they scrutinized the empty box and the floor all around the ruby was nowhere to be seen simeon said when was the crucifix last used at the feast of st adolphus when carlus fell he knocked it off the table perhaps the ruby fell out then but how is it possible that no one noticed the stone was on the back of the cross but surely someone would have seen it on the floor who picked up the crucifix i dont remember godwyn said quickly the situation was confused in fact he remembered perfectly well it was philemon godwyn could picture the scene philemon and otho together had righted the altar setting it squarely on its platform then otho had picked up the candlesticks and philemon the cross with a growing feeling of dismay godwyn recalled the disappearance of lady philippas bracelet had philemon stolen again he trembled to think how it might affect him everyone knew that philemon was godwyns unofficial acolyte such a dreadful sin stealing a jewel from a sacred ornament would bring shame on everyone associated with the perpetrator it could easily upset the election simeon obviously did not recollect the scene exactly and he accepted without question godwyns feigned inability to remember who had picked up the cross but others among the monks would surely recall seeing it in philemons hands godwyn had to put this right quickly before suspicion could fall on philemon but first he had to get simeon out of the way we must search for the ruby in the church simeon said but the service was two weeks ago godwyn protested a ruby cant have lain on the floor unnoticed for that length of time its unlikely but we must check godwyn saw that he had to go with simeon and wait for an opportunity to get away from him and seek out philemon of course he said they put the ornaments away and locked the treasury door as they left the library godwyn said i suggest we say nothing about this until were sure the jewel has been lost no point in bringing blame on our heads prematurely agreed they hurried around the cloisters and entered the church they stood in the centre of the crossing and scanned the ground all around them a month ago the idea that a ruby could lie hidden somewhere on the church floor would have been more plausible but recently the flagstones had been repaired and the cracks and chips had disappeared a ruby would have stood out simeon said now that i come to think of it wasnt it philemon who picked up the crucifix godwyn looked at simeons face was there accusation in the expression he could not tell it may have been philemon godwyn said then he saw a chance to get away ill go and fetch him he suggested perhaps he will be able to recall exactly where he was standing at the time good idea ill wait here simeon got down on his knees and began to pat the floor with his hands as if the ruby might be found by touch more easily than by sight godwyn hurried out he went first to the dormitory the blanket cupboard was in the same place he pulled it away from the wall found the loose stone and removed it he put his hand into the hideyhole where philemon had stashed lady philippas bracelet he found nothing there he cursed it was not going to be that easy ill have to dismiss philemon from the monastery he thought as he strode through the priory buildings looking for him if he has stolen this ruby i cant cover up for him again hes out then he realized with a shock of dismay that he could not dismiss philemon not now perhaps not ever it was philemon who had told friar murdo about the isabella charter if dismissed philemon could confess what he had done and reveal that he had done it at godwyns instigation and he would be believed godwyn recalled thomass puzzling over who had told murdo the secret and why philemons revelation would gain conviction by answering that question there would be an outcry at such underhand work even if the disclosure were made after the election it would undermine godwyns authority and cripple his ability to lead the monks the ominous truth dawned on him that he now had to protect philemon in order to protect himself he found philemon sweeping the hospital floor he beckoned him outside and led him around to the back of the kitchen where it was unlikely that anyone would see them he looked philemon in the eye and said theres a ruby missing philemon looked away how terrible its from the altar crucifix that was knocked to the floor when carlus fell over philemon pretended innocence how could it have gone missing the ruby may have become dislodged when the crucifix hit the floor but its not on the floor now ive just looked someone found it and kept it surely not godwyn felt angered by philemons false air of innocence you fool everyone saw you pick up that crucifix philemons voice rose to a higher pitch i know nothing about it dont waste time lying to me we have to put this right i could lose the election on your account godwyn pushed philemon up against the wall of the bakehouse where is it to his astonishment philemon began to cry for the love of the saints godwyn said disgustedly stop this nonsense youre a grown man philemon continued to sob im sorry he said im sorry if you dont stop that godwyn checked himself nothing was to be gained by berating philemon the man was truly pathetic speaking more gently he said try to pull yourself together where is the ruby i hid it yes in the refectory chimney godwyn immediately turned away heading for the refectory mary save us it could fall into the fire philemon followed his tears drying theres no fire in august i would have moved it before the cold weather they entered the refectory at one end of the long room was a wide fireplace philemon put his arm up the chimney and fumbled for a moment then he produced a ruby the size of a sparrows egg covered with soot he wiped it clean on his sleeve godwyn took it now come with me he said what are we going to do simeon is going to find this they went to the church simeon was still searching on hands and knees now godwyn said to philemon try to remember exactly where you were when you picked up the crucifix simeon looked at philemon and seeing signs of emotion on his face spoke kindly to him dont be afraid lad youve done nothing wrong philemon positioned himself on the east side of the crossing close to the steps leading up to the chancel i think it was here he said godwyn climbed the two steps and looked under the choir stalls pretending to search surreptitiously he placed the ruby under one of the rows of seats close to the near end where it was not visible to a casual glance then as if changing his mind about the likeliest place to look he moved to the south side of the chancel come and search under here philemon he said as he had hoped simeon then moved to the north side and got down on his knees to look under the stalls murmuring a prayer as he did so godwyn expected simeon to see the ruby immediately he pretended to search the south aisle waiting for simeon to find it he began to think there must be something wrong with simeons eyesight he might have to go over there and find it himself then at last simeon called out oh here godwyn pretended to be excited have you found it yes hallelujah where was it here under the choir stalls praise be to god said godwyn godwyn told himself not to be frightened of earl roland as he climbed the stone stairs of the hospital to the guest rooms he asked himself what the earl could do to him even if roland had been capable of getting out of his bed and drawing a sword he would not be foolish enough to attack a monk within the precincts of a monastery even a king would hardly get away with that ralph fitzgerald announced him and he went into the room the earls sons stood either side of the bed tall william in soldierly brown hose and muddy boots his hair already receding from his forehead and richard in bishops purple his growing roundness of figure evidence of a sybaritic nature and the means to indulge it william was thirty a year younger than godwyn he had his fathers strength of will but it was sometimes softened by the influence of his wife philippa richard was twentyeight and presumably took after his late mother for he had little of the earls imposing bearing and forcefulness well monk said the earl speaking out of the left side of his mouth have you held your little election godwyn suffered a moment of resentment for this discourteous form of address one day he vowed silently roland would call him father prior indignation gave him the courage he needed to tell the earl the news we have lord he said i have the honour to tell you that the monks of kingsbridge have chosen me as their prior what the earl bellowed you godwyn bowed his head in an affectation of humility no one could be more surprised than i youre nothing but a boy the insult stung godwyn into a rejoinder im older than your son the bishop of kingsbridge how many votes did you get twentyfive and how many for friar murdo none the monks were unanimous none roland roared there must have been a conspiracy this is treason the election was held in strict accordance with the rules i dont care a pigs prick for your rules i wont be ignored by a bunch of effeminate monks i am the choice of my brothers my lord the inauguration ceremony will be held this coming sunday before the wedding the monks choice must be ratified by the bishop of kingsbridge and i can tell you he will not ratify you rerun the election and this time bring me the result i want very good earl roland godwyn went to the door he had several more cards in his hand but he was not going to lay them on the table all at once he turned and addressed richard my lord bishop when you wish to speak to me about this you will find me in the priors house he stepped outside youre not the prior roland shouted as he shut the door godwyn was trembling roland was formidable especially when angry and he was often angry but godwyn had stood his ground petranilla would be proud of him he went down the stairs on shaky legs and made his way to the priors house carlus had already moved out for the first time in fifteen years godwyn would have a bedroom to himself his pleasure was only slightly damped by having to share the place with the bishop who traditionally stayed there while visiting the bishop was technically the abbot of kingsbridge ex officio and though his power was limited his status was above that of the prior richard was rarely in the house during the day but returned every night to sleep in the best bedroom godwyn entered the groundfloor hall and sat in the big chair waiting it would not be long before bishop richard appeared his ears burning with his fathers scorching instructions richard was a rich and powerful man but not frightening in the way the earl was all the same it was a bold monk who defied his bishop however godwyn had an advantage in this confrontation for he knew something shameful about richard and that was as good as a knife up his sleeve richard bustled in a few minutes later showing a confidence that godwyn knew to be faked ive struck a bargain for you he said without preamble you can be subprior under murdo youll be in charge of daytoday management of the priory murdo doesnt want to be an administrator anyway he just wants the prestige youll have all the power but my father will be satisfied let me get this straight said godwyn murdo agrees to make me his subprior then we tell the rest of the monks that he is the only one youll ratify and you think they will accept that they have no choice i have an alternative suggestion tell the earl that the monks will not have anyone but me and that i must be ratified before the wedding otherwise the monks will not take part in the nuptials the nuns too will refuse godwyn did not know whether the monks would go along with this let alone mother cecilia and the nuns but he was too far gone for caution they wouldnt dare im afraid they would richard looked panicky my father wont be bullied godwyn laughed small chance of that but i hope he may be made to see reason hell say the wedding must go ahead anyway im the bishop i can marry the couple i dont need monks to help me of course but there will be no singing no candles no psalms no incense just you and archdeacon lloyd they will still be married how will the earl of monmouth feel about such a mean wedding for his son hell be furious but hell accept it the alliance is the important thing that was probably right godwyn thought and he felt the cold draught of imminent failure it was time to draw his concealed knife you owe me a kindness he said at first richard pretended not to know what he was talking about do i i concealed a sin you committed dont pretend to have forgotten it was only a couple of months ago ah yes that was generous of you i saw with my own eyes you and margery on the bed in the guest room hush for pitys sake now is your chance to repay me that kindness intercede with your father tell him to give in argue that the wedding is more important insist on ratifying me richards face showed desperation he looked crushed by opposing forces i cant he said and there was panic in his voice my father wont be defied you know what hes like try ive already tried i forced him to concede that you could be subprior godwyn doubted that roland had conceded any such thing richard had almost certainly made it up knowing that such a promise could easily be broken all the same godwyn said i thank you for that then he added but its not enough just think about it richard pleaded thats all i ask i will and i suggest you ask your father to do the same oh god richard groaned this is going to be a catastrophe the wedding was scheduled for sunday on the saturday in place of the service of sext godwyn ordered a rehearsal beginning with the ceremony of inauguration of the new prior and continuing with the marriage service outside it was another sunless day the sky full of low grey cloud heavy with rain and the inside of the cathedral was gloomy after the rehearsal as the monks and nuns headed off for dinner and the novices began to tidy up the church godwyn was approached by carlus and simeon both looking solemn i think that went very smoothly dont you godwyn said brightly simeon said is there actually going to be an inauguration for you absolutely we hear the earl has ordered the election to be rerun do you think he has the right to do that indeed not said simeon he has the power of nomination thats all but he says bishop richard will not ratify you as prior has richard told you that not himself no i thought not trust me the bishop will ratify me godwyn heard his own voice sounding sincere and confident and wished his feelings matched it carlus said anxiously did you tell richard the monks would refuse to take part in the wedding i did thats very hazardous were not here to oppose the will of noblemen godwyn could have predicted that carlus would weaken at the first sign of serious opposition fortunately he was not planning to test the monks resolve we wont have to do it dont worry its just an empty threat but dont tell the bishop i said so so youre not planning to ask the monks to boycott the wedding no simeon said youre playing a dangerous game perhaps but i trust no one is in danger except me you did not even want to be prior you would not allow your name to be put forward you only accepted when all else failed i dont want to be prior godwyn lied but the earl of shiring must not be allowed to choose for us and thats more important than my personal feelings simeon looked at him with respect youre being very honourable like you brother im just trying to do the will of god may he bless your efforts the two old monks left him he felt a twinge of conscience for allowing them to believe that he was acting unselfishly they saw him as some kind of martyr but it was true he told himself that he was only trying to do the will of god he looked around the church was back to normal he was about to go to the priors house for dinner when his cousin caris appeared her blue dress a startling splash of colour in the dim grey church are you going to be inaugurated tomorrow she said he smiled everyones asking the same question the answer is yes we hear the earl is putting up a fight hes going to lose it her shrewd green eyes gave him a penetrating stare ive known you since you were a child and i can tell when youre lying im not lying youre pretending to be more certain than you actually feel thats not a sin my father is worried about the bridge friar murdo is even more likely to obey the earls will than saul whitehead was murdo is not going to be prior of kingsbridge there you go again godwyn was annoyed by her perspicacity i dont know what to say to you he snapped ive been elected and i mean to take the post earl roland would like to stop me but he doesnt have the right and im fighting him with all the means at my disposal am i scared yes but i still intend to beat him she grinned thats what i wanted to hear she punched his shoulder go and see your mother shes in your house waiting for you thats what i came to tell you with that she turned and left godwyn went out through the north transept caris was clever he thought with a mixture of admiration and irritation she had cajoled him into giving her an assessment of the situation more candid than anything he had said to anyone else but he was glad of the chance to talk to his mother everyone else doubted his power to win this fight she would have confidence and perhaps some strategic ideas he found petranilla in the hall sitting at the table which was laid for two with bread ale and a platter of salted fish he kissed her forehead said grace and sat down to eat he allowed himself a moment of triumphant pleasure well he said im the priorelect at least and here we are having dinner in the priors house but roland is still fighting you she said harder than i expected after all he has the right of nomination not selection its inherent in his position that his choice will not always be elected most earls would accept that but not him petranilla said hes felt superior to everyone hes ever met there was a bitterness in her tone which godwyn guessed sprang from memories of their aborted engagement more than thirty years ago she smiled vengefully soon he will realize how badly hes underestimated us he knows im your son then that will be a factor you probably remind him of the dishonourable way he behaved to me thats enough to make him hate you its a shame godwyn lowered his voice in case a servant might be listening outside the door until this point your plan has worked perfectly withdrawing myself from the contest then discrediting everyone else was brilliant perhaps but we may be about to lose everything have you said any more to the bishop no ive reminded him that we know about margery he was scared but not scared enough to defy his father it seems he should be if this comes out he wont be forgiven he could end up a lowly knight on the level of sir gerald wasting his days as a pensioner doesnt he realize that perhaps he thinks i dont have the courage to reveal what i know then youll have to go to the earl with the information heavens hell explode steel your nerve she always said this kind of thing it was why he looked forward with such apprehension to meetings with her she always wanted him to be a little more daring and take greater risks than was his inclination but he could never refuse her she went on if it came out that margerys not a virgin the marriage would be called off roland doesnt want that hell accept the lesser evil of you as prior but hell be my enemy for the rest of his life hell be that whatever happens small consolation godwyn thought but he did not argue for he could see that his mother was right there was a tap at the door and lady philippa walked in godwyn and petranilla stood up i need to talk to you philippa said to godwyn he said may i present my mother petranilla petranilla curtsied then said id better leave youre obviously here to broker a deal my lady philippa gave her an amused look if you know that much you know everything of importance perhaps you should stay as the two women stood facing one another godwyn noticed that they were similar same height same statuesque build and the same imperious air philippa was younger of course by something like twenty years and she had a relaxed authority and a touch of humour that contrasted with petranillas tightwound determination perhaps because philippa had a husband and petranilla had lost hers but philippa was a strongwilled woman who exercised power through a man lord william and godwyn now realized petranilla also wielded influence through a man himself lets sit down philippa said petranilla said has the earl approved whatever youre about to propose no philippa made a helpless gesture with her hands roland is too proud to agree in advance to something that might then be rejected by the other side if i can get godwyns agreement to what im about to suggest then ive got a chance of persuading roland to compromise i thought as much godwyn said would you like something to eat my lady philippa dismissed the offer with an impatient wave as things stand everyone is going to lose she began the wedding will take place but without the proper pomp and ceremony so that rolands alliance with the earl of monmouth will be blighted from the start the bishop will refuse to ratify you as prior godwyn so the archbishop will be called in to resolve the dispute and he will dismiss both you and murdo and nominate someone new probably a member of his staff whom he wants to be rid of no one will get what they want am i right she directed the question at petranilla who made a noncommittal sound so why not anticipate the archbishops compromise philippa went on bring forward the third candidate now only she pointed a finger at godwyn the candidate is chosen by you and he promises to make you subprior godwyn considered this would relieve him of the need to confront the earl eyeballtoeyeball and threaten him with the revelation of his sons behaviour but the compromise would doom him to be subprior for an indefinite period and then when the new prior died he would have to fight the battle all over again he was inclined to refuse despite his apprehension he glanced at his mother she gave an almost imperceptible shake of the head she did not like it either im sorry godwyn said to philippa the monks have held an election and the result must stand philippa stood up in that case i must give you the message that is my official reason for coming here tomorrow morning the earl will rise from his sick bed he wishes to inspect the cathedral and make sure all is ready in plenty of time for the wedding you are to meet him in the church at eight oclock all the monks and nuns must be robed ready and the church dressed with the usual ornaments godwyn bowed his head in acknowledgement and she went out at the appointed hour godwyn stood in a bare silent church he was alone there were no monks or nuns with him no furniture was to be seen except for the fixed choir stalls there were no candles no crucifixes no chalices no flowers the watery sun that had shone fitfully through rain clouds much of this summer now cast a weak cold light into the nave godwyn held his hands tightly together behind his back to keep them from shaking on time the earl walked in with him were lord william lady philippa bishop richard richards assistant archdeacon lloyd and the earls clerk father jerome godwyn would have liked to surround himself with an entourage but none of the monks knew quite how risky his scheme was and if they had known they might not have had the nerve to back him up so he had decided to face the earl alone the bandages had been removed from rolands head he walked slowly but steadily he must surely feel shaky after so many weeks in bed godwyn thought but he seemed determined not to show it he looked normal apart from the paralysis of half his face his message to the world today would be that he was fully recovered and back in charge and godwyn was threatening to spoil that design the others looked with incredulity at the empty church but the earl showed no surprise youre an arrogant monk he said to godwyn speaking as always out of the left side of his mouth godwyn was risking everything and had nothing further to lose by being defiant so he said youre an obstinate earl roland put his hand on the hilt of his sword i ought to run you through for that go ahead godwyn held his arms out sideways ready to be crucified murder the prior of kingsbridge here in the cathedral just as king henrys knights murdered archbishop thomas becket in canterbury send me to heaven and yourself to eternal damnation philippa gasped with shock at godwyns disrespect william moved as if to silence godwyn roland restrained him with a gesture and said to godwyn your bishop orders you to ready the church for the wedding dont monks take a vow of obedience the lady margery cannot be married here why not because you want to be prior because she is not a virgin philippas hand flew to her mouth richard groaned william drew his sword roland said this is treason godwyn said put away your sword lord william you cant restore her maidenhead with that roland said what do you know of such things monk two men of this priory witnessed the act which took place in a private room of the hospital the very room where you my lord are staying i dont believe you the earl of monmouth will you would not dare to tell him i must explain to him why his son cannot marry margery in kingsbridge cathedral at least until she has confessed her sin and received absolution you have no proof of this slander i have two witnesses but ask the girl i believe she will confess i imagine she favours the lover who took her virginity over the political match chosen by her uncle once again godwyn was going out on a limb but he had seen margerys face when richard was kissing her and at that moment he had felt sure she was in love having to marry the earls son must be breaking her heart it would be very difficult for such a young woman to lie convincingly if her emotions were as turbulent as godwyn guessed the animated half of rolands face was working with fury and who is this man who you claim committed this crime for if you can prove what you allege the villain will hang i swear and if not you will so let him be sent for and well see what he has to say hes already here roland looked with incredulity at the four men with him his two sons william and richard plus two priests lloyd and jerome godwyn stared at richard roland followed the direction of godwyns stare in a moment they were all looking at richard godwyn held his breath what would richard say would he bluster would he accuse godwyn of lying would he fly into a rage and attack his accuser but his face showed defeat not anger and after a moment he bowed his head and said its no good the damned monk is right she will not withstand interrogation earl roland went white you did this he said for once he was not shouting but that seemed to make him more terrifying the girl i betrothed to an earls son you fucked her richard made no reply but looked down at the ground you fool the earl said you traitor you philippa interrupted him who else knows that stopped the tirade they all looked at her perhaps the wedding may still take place she said thank god the earl of monmouth isnt here she looked at godwyn who knows about this other than the people here now and the two men of the priory who witnessed the act godwyn tried to calm his thudding heart he was so close to success that he seemed to taste it no one else knows my lady he said all of us on the earls side can keep the secret she said what about your men they will obey their elected prior he said with the slightest emphasis on the word elected philippa turned to roland then the wedding can take place godwyn added provided the inauguration ceremony is held first everyone looked at the earl he took a step forward and suddenly hit richard in the face it was a powerful blow struck by a soldier who knew how to put all his weight into it although he used his open hand richard was knocked to the ground richard lay still looking terrified blood trickling from his mouth earl rolands face was white and sweating the blow had used up all his reserves and he now looked shaky several silent seconds passed at last he seemed to recover his strength with a contemptuous glance at the purplerobed figure cowering on the floor he turned on his heel and walked slowly but steadily out of the church caris stood on the green in front of kingsbridge cathedral along with at least half the population of the town waiting for the bride and groom to emerge from the great west door of the church caris was not sure why she was here she had been feeling negative about marriage ever since the day merthin had finished his hoist and they had had an abrasive conversation about their future she felt angry with him even though everything he had said made perfect sense of course he wanted to have his own house and live with her in it of course he wanted to sleep with her every night and have children that was what everyone wanted everyone it seemed except caris and in fact she wanted all those things too in a way she would have liked to lie down beside him every evening and put her arms around his slim body any time she wanted and feel his clever hands on her skin when she woke up in the morning and give birth to a miniature version of him that they could both love and care for but she did not want the things that went with marriage she wanted a lover not a master she wanted to live with him not dedicate her life to him and she was angry with merthin for forcing her to face up to the dilemma why could they not go on just as they were for three weeks she had hardly spoken to him she pretended to have a summer cold and in fact she developed a painful sore on her lip that gave her an excuse not to kiss him he still took his meals at her house and talked amiably with her father but he did not linger after edmund and petranilla went to bed now cariss sore had healed and her anger had cooled she still did not want to become merthins property but she wished he would start kissing her again however he was not with her now he was in the crowd some distance away talking to bessie bell daughter of the landlord of the bell inn she was a small girl with a curvy body and the kind of grin that men called saucy and women called tarty merthin was making her laugh caris looked away the big wooden church door opened a cheer went up from the crowd and the bride emerged margery was a pretty girl of sixteen dressed in white with flowers in her hair the groom followed her out a tall seriouslooking man about ten years older than she they both looked completely miserable they hardly knew each other until this week they had met only once six months ago when the two earls had arranged the marriage there was a rumour that margery loved someone else but of course there was no question of her disobeying earl roland and her new husband had a studious air as if he would prefer to be in a library somewhere reading a book about geometry what would their life together be like it was hard to imagine their developing the kind of passion for one another that caris and merthin enjoyed she saw merthin coming towards her through the crowd and suddenly she was struck by the thought that she was ungrateful how lucky she was not to be the niece of an earl no one was going to force her into an arranged marriage she was free to marry the man she loved and all she could do was find reasons not to she greeted him with a hug and a kiss on the lips he looked surprised but made no comment some men would have been unnerved by her change of mood but merthin had a bedrock equanimity that was hard to shake they stood together and watched as earl roland came out of the church followed by the earl and countess of monmouth then bishop richard and prior godwyn caris noticed that her cousin godwyn looked both pleased and apprehensive almost as if he were the groom the reason no doubt was that he had just been inaugurated as prior an escort of knights formed up the shiring men in rolands redandblack livery the monmouth men in yellow and green the procession moved off heading for the guild hall there earl roland was giving a banquet for the wedding guests edmund was going but caris had managed to get out of it and petranilla was to accompany him as the bridal party left the precincts a light shower of rain began to fall caris and merthin took shelter in the cathedral porch come with me to the chancel merthin said i want to look at elfrics repairs the wedding guests were still leaving the church moving against the flow merthin and caris pushed through the crowd in the nave and went to the south aisle of the chancel this part of the church was reserved for the clergy and they would have disapproved of cariss being there but the monks and nuns had already left caris glanced around but there was no one to see her except one unfamiliar woman a welldressed redhead of about thirty presumably a wedding guest apparently waiting for someone merthin craned his neck to look up at the vaulted ceiling over the aisle the repairs were not quite finished a small section of the vault was still open and a sheet of canvas painted white was stretched across the gap so that the ceiling looked complete to a casual glance hes doing a decent job merthin said i wonder how long it will last why wouldnt it last indefinitely caris asked because we dont know why the vault crumbled these things dont happen for no reason theyre not acts of god regardless of what the priests may say whatever caused the stonework to collapse once will presumably do so again is it possible to discover the cause its not easy elfric certainly cant do it i might but youve been sacked exactly he stood there for a few moments head tilted back then said i want to see this from above im going into the loft ill come with you they both looked around but there was no one nearby except for the redhaired wedding guest who was still loitering in the south transept merthin led caris to a small door that opened on a narrow spiral staircase she followed him up wondering what the monks would think if they knew a woman was exploring their secret passageways the staircase emerged into an attic over the south aisle caris was intrigued to see the vault from the other side what youre looking at is called the extrados merthin said she liked the casual way he gave her architectural information assuming she would be interested and knowing she would understand he never made stupid jokes about women not grasping technicalities he moved along the narrow walkway then lay down to examine the new stonework closely mischievously she lay beside him and put her arm around him as if they were in bed merthin touched the mortar between the new stones then put his finger on his tongue its drying out quite quickly he said im sure its very dangerous if theres moisture in the cleft he looked at her ill give you moisture in the cleft you already have he kissed her she closed her eyes to enjoy it more after a minute she said lets go to my house well have it to ourselves my father and my aunt are both at the wedding banquet they were about to get up when they heard voices a man and a woman had come into the south aisle immediately below the repair work what they said was only a little muffled by the canvas sheet covering the hole in the ceiling your son is thirteen now the woman said he wants to be a knight all boys do came the reply merthin whispered dont move theyll hear us caris presumed the female voice to be that of the wedding guest the male voice was familiar and she had the feeling the speaker was a monk but a monk could not have a son and your daughter is twelve shes going to be beautiful like her mother a little there was a pause then the woman went on i cant stay long the countess may look for me so she was in the entourage of the countess of monmouth she might be a ladyinwaiting caris guessed she seemed to be giving news of children to a father who had not seen them for years who could it be he said why did you want to meet me loreen just to look at you im sorry you lost your arm caris gasped then covered her mouth hoping she had not been heard there was only one monk who had lost an arm thomas now that the name had come into her mind she knew that the voice was his could it be that he had a wife and two children caris looked at merthin and saw that his face was a mask of incredulity what do you tell the children of me thomas asked that their father is dead loreen replied harshly then she began to cry why did you do it i had no choice if i had not come here i would have been killed even now i almost never leave the precincts why would anyone want to kill you to protect a secret id be better off if youd died as a widow i could find a husband someone to be a father to my children but this way i have all the burdens of a wife and mother but no one to help me no one to put his arms around me in the night im sorry im still alive oh i didnt mean that i dont wish you dead i loved you once and i loved you as much as a man of my kind can love a woman caris frowned what did he mean by a man of my kind was he one of those men who loved other men monks often were whatever he meant loreen seemed to understand for she said gently i know you did there was a long silence caris knew she and merthin should not be eavesdropping on such an intimate conversation but it was now too late to reveal themselves loreen said are you happy yes i was not made to be a husband or a knight i pray for my children every day and for you i ask god to wash from my hands the blood of all the men i killed this is the life i always wanted in that case i wish you well youre very generous youll probably never see me again i know kiss me and say goodbye there was a long silence then light footsteps receded caris lay still hardly daring to breathe after another pause she heard thomas crying his sobs were muffled but seemed to come from deep inside tears came to her own eyes as she listened eventually thomas got himself under control he sniffed coughed and muttered something that might have been a prayer then she heard his steps as he walked away at last she and merthin could move they stood up and walked back along the loft and down the spiral stairs neither spoke as they went down the nave of the great church caris felt as if she had been staring at a painting of high tragedy the figures frozen in their dramatic attitudes of the moment their past and future only to be guessed at like a painting the scene aroused different emotions in different people and merthins reaction was not the same as hers as they emerged into a damp summer afternoon he said what a sad story it makes me angry caris said that woman has been ruined by thomas you can hardly blame him he had to save his life and now her life is over she has no husband but she cant marry again shes forced to raise two children alone at least thomas has the monastery she has the court of the countess how can you compare the two caris said irritably shes probably a distant relation kept on as an act of charity asked to perform menial tasks helping the countess dress her hair and choose her clothes shes got no choice shes trapped so is he you heard him say he cant leave the precincts but thomas has a role hes the matricularius he makes decisions he does something loreen has her children exactly the man takes care of the most important building for miles around and the woman is stuck with her children queen isabella had four children and for a while she was one of the most powerful people in europe but she had to get rid of her husband first they went on in silence walking out of the priory grounds into the main street and stopped in front of cariss house she realized that this was another quarrel and it was on the same subject as last time marriage merthin said im going to the bell for dinner that was bessies fathers inn all right caris said despondently as merthin walked away she called after him loreen would be better off if shed never married he spoke over his shoulder what else would she do that was the problem caris thought resentfully as she entered her house what else was a woman to do the place was empty edmund and petranilla were at the banquet and the servants had the afternoon off only scrap the dog was there to welcome caris with a lazy wag of her tail caris patted her black head absentmindedly then sat at the table in the hall brooding every other young woman in christendom wanted nothing more than to marry the man she loved why was caris so horrified by the prospect from where had she got such unconventional feelings certainly not from her own mother rose had wanted only to be a good wife to edmund she had believed what men said about the inferiority of women her subordination had embarrassed caris and though edmund never complained caris suspected that he had been bored by it caris had more respect for her forceful unlovable aunt petranilla than for her compliant mother even petranilla had allowed her life to be shaped by men for years she had worked to manoeuvre her father up the social ladder until he became alderman of kingsbridge her strongest emotion was resentment towards earl roland because he had jilted her and towards her husband because he had died as a widow she had dedicated herself to godwyns career queen isabella had been similar she had deposed her husband king edward ii but the result had been that her lover roger mortimer had effectively ruled england until her son grew old enough and confident enough to oust him was that what caris should do live her life through men her father wanted her to work with him in the wool business or she could manage merthins career helping him secure contracts to construct churches and bridges expanding his business until he was the richest and most important builder in england she was roused from her thoughts by a tap at the door and the birdlike figure of mother cecilia walked briskly in good afternoon caris said in surprise i was just asking myself whether all women are doomed to live their lives through men and here you are an obvious counterexample youre not quite right cecilia said with a friendly smile i live through jesus christ who was a man though he is god too caris was not sure whether that counted she opened the cupboard and took out a small barrel of the best wine would you like a cup of my fathers rhenish just a little mixed with water caris half filled two cups with wine then topped up the drinks with water from a jug you know that my father and aunt are at the banquet yes i came to see you caris had guessed as much the prioress did not wander around the town making social calls without a purpose cecilia sipped then went on ive been thinking about you and the way you acted on the day the bridge collapsed did i do something wrong on the contrary you did everything perfectly you were gentle but firm with the injured and you obeyed my orders but at the same time used your initiative i was impressed thank you and you seemed not to enjoy it exactly but at least to find satisfaction in the work people were in distress and we brought them relief what could be more satisfying thats how i feel and its why im a nun caris saw where this was going i couldnt spend my life in the priory the natural aptitude you showed for looking after the sick is only part of what i noticed when people first started to walk into the cathedral carrying the injured and dead i asked who had told them what to do the answer was caris wooler it was obvious what should be done yes to you cecilia leaned forward earnestly the talent for organization is given to few people i know i have it and i recognize it in others when everyone around us is baffled or panicked or terrified you and i take charge caris felt this was true i suppose so she said reluctantly ive watched you for ten years since the day your mother died you brought her relief in her distress i knew then just by talking to you that you were going to grow up into an exceptional woman my feeling was confirmed when you attended the nuns school youre twenty now you must be thinking about what to do with your life i believe that god has work for you how do you know what god thinks cecilia bristled if anyone else in town asked me that question id order them down on their knees to pray for forgiveness but youre sincere so ill answer i know what god thinks because i accept the teachings of his church and im convinced he wants you to be a nun i like men too much always a problem for me as a youngster but i can assure you a problem that diminishes with every passing year i cant be told how to live dont be a beguine whats that beguines are nuns who accept no rules and consider their vows to be temporary they live together cultivate their lands and graze their cattle and refuse to be governed by men caris was always intrigued to hear of women who defied the rules where are they to be found mostly in the netherlands they had a leader marguerite porete who wrote a book called the mirror of simple souls id like to read it out of the question the beguines have been condemned by the church for the heresy of the free spirit the belief that we can attain spiritual perfection here on earth spiritual perfection what does that mean its just a phrase if youre determined to close your mind to god youll never understand it im sorry mother cecilia but every time im told something about god by a mere human i think but humans are fallible so the truth might be different how could the church be wrong well the muslims have different beliefs theyre heathens they call us infidels its the same thing and buonaventura caroli says there are more muslims than christians in the world so somebodys church is wrong be careful cecilia said severely dont allow your passion for argument to lead you into blasphemy sorry mother caris knew that cecilia enjoyed sparring with her but there always came a moment when the prioress stopped arguing and started preaching and caris had to back down it left her feeling slightly cheated cecilia stood up i know i cant persuade you against your will but i wanted you to know the tendency of my thoughts you could do nothing better than to join our nunnery and dedicate your life to the sacrament of healing thank you for the wine as cecilia was leaving caris said what happened to marguerite porete is she still alive no said the prioress she was burned at the stake she went out into the street shutting the door behind her caris stared at the closed door a womans life was a house of closed doors she could not be an apprentice she could not study at the university she could not be a priest or a physician nor shoot a bow nor fight with a sword and she could not marry without submitting herself to the tyranny of her husband she wondered what merthin was doing now was bessie sitting at his table at the bell inn watching him drink her fathers best ale giving him that inviting smile pulling the front of her dress tight to make sure he could see what nice breasts she had was he being charming and amusing to her making her laugh was she parting her lips to show him her even teeth and throwing back her head so that he could appreciate the soft skin of her white throat was he talking to her father paul bell asking respectful and interested questions about his business so that later paul would tell his daughter that merthin was a good sort a fine young man would merthin get drunk and put his arm around bessies waist resting his hand on her hip then slyly inching his fingertips towards that sensitive place between her thighs that was already itching for his touch just as he once had with caris tears came to her eyes she felt she was a fool she had the best man in town and here she was handing him over to a barmaid why did she do these things to herself at that moment he walked in she looked at him through a mist of tears her vision was so blurred that she could not read his expression had he come to make friends again or to berate her venting his anger with the courage of several tankards of ale she stood up for a moment she was held in suspense as he closed the door behind him and came slowly to stand in front of her then he said no matter what you do or say i still love you she threw her arms around him and burst out crying he stroked her hair and said nothing which was just right after a while they started to kiss she felt the familiar hunger but stronger than ever she wanted his hands all over her his tongue in her mouth his fingers inside her she felt differently and she wanted their love to find a new expression lets take off all our clothes she said they had never done that before he smiled with pleasure all right but what if someone comes in theyll be at the banquet for hours and anyway we can go upstairs they went to her bedroom she kicked off her shoes suddenly she felt shy what would he think when he saw her naked she knew he loved her body bit by bit her breasts her legs her throat her cunt he always told her how beautiful they were as he kissed and caressed them but would he now notice that her hips were too wide her legs a little short her breasts quite small he seemed to have no such inhibitions he threw off his shirt pulled down his underdrawers and stood unselfconsciously before her his body was slight but strong and he seemed full of pentup energy like a young deer she noticed for the first time that the hair at his groin was the colour of autumn leaves his cock stood up eagerly desire overcame her shyness and she pulled her dress quickly over her head he stared at her bare body but she no longer felt embarrassed his look inflamed her like an intimate caress youre beautiful he said so are you they lay side by side on the strawfilled palliasse that was her bed as they kissed and touched one another she realized that today she was not going to be satisfied with the games they usually played i want to do it properly she said you mean go the whole way the thought of pregnancy surfaced in her mind but she pushed it back down she was too heated to think of consequences yes she whispered so do i he lay on top of her half her life she had wondered what this moment would be like she looked up at his face it wore the concentrated expression that she loved so much the look he had when he was working his small hands shaping wood with tenderness and skill his fingertips softly spread the petals of her sex she was slippery and yearning for him he said are you sure once again she suppressed the thought of pregnancy im sure she felt a moment of fear when he entered her she tightened involuntarily and he hesitated feeling her body resisting him its all right she said you can push harder you wont hurt me she was wrong about that and there was a sudden sharp pain as he thrust she could not help crying out im sorry he whispered just wait a minute she said they lay still he kissed her eyelids and her forehead and the tip of her nose she stroked his face and looked into his goldenbrown eyes then the pain was gone and the desire came back and she began to move rejoicing in the feeling of having the man she loved deep inside her body for the first time she thrilled to see the intensity of his pleasure he stared at her a faint smile on his lips a deep hunger in his eyes as they moved faster i cant stop he said breathlessly dont stop dont stop she watched him intently in a few moments he was overwhelmed by pleasure his eyes shut tight and his mouth open and his whole body as taut as a bowstring she felt his spasms inside her and the jet of his ejaculation and she thought that nothing in life had prepared her for such happiness a moment later she herself was convulsed with ecstasy she had had this sensation before but not so powerfully and she closed her eyes and gave herself up to it pulling his body hard against her own as she shook like a tree in the wind when it was over they lay still for a long while he buried his face in her neck and she felt his panting breath on her skin she stroked his back his skin was damp with perspiration gradually her heartbeat slowed and a deep contentment stole over her like twilight on a summer evening so she said after a while thats what all the fuss is about the day after godwyn was confirmed as prior of kingsbridge edmund wooler came to merthins parents house early in the morning merthin tended to forget what an important personage edmund was for edmund treated him as a member of the family but gerald and maud acted as if receiving an unexpected royal visitation they were embarrassed that edmund should see how poor their house was there was only one room merthin and his parents slept on straw mattresses on the floor there was a fireplace and a table and a small yard at the back fortunately the family had been up since sunrise and had washed and dressed and tidied the place all the same when edmund came stomping into the house with his uneven gait merthins mother dusted a stool patted her hair closed the back door then opened it again and put a log on the fire his father bowed several times put on a surcoat and offered edmund a cup of ale no thank you sir gerald said edmund no doubt knowing that the family had none to spare however ill take a small bowl of your pottage lady maud if i may every family kept a pot of oats on the fire to which they added bones apple cores pea pods and other scraps to be slowcooked for days flavoured with salt and herbs the result was a soup that never tasted the same twice it was the cheapest food pleased maud ladled some pottage into a bowl and put it on the table with a spoon and a plate of bread merthin was still feeling the euphoria of the previous afternoon it was like being slightly drunk he had gone to sleep thinking of cariss naked body and woken up smiling but he was suddenly reminded of his confrontation with elfric over griselda a false instinct told him that edmund was going to scream you defiled my daughter and hit him across the face with a length of timber it was only a momentary vision and it vanished as edmund sat at the table he picked up the spoon but before he began to eat he said to merthin now that weve got a prior i want to start work on the new bridge as soon as possible good said merthin edmund swallowed a spoonful and smacked his lips this is the best pottage ive ever tasted lady maud merthins mother looked pleased merthin was grateful to edmund for being charming to his parents they felt the humiliation of their reduced status and it was balm to the wound to have the towns alderman eating at their table and calling them sir gerald and lady maud now his father said i almost didnt marry her edmund did you know that merthin was sure edmund had heard the story before but he replied good lord no how did that happen i saw her in church on easter sunday and fell in love with her instantly there must have been a thousand people in kingsbridge cathedral and she was the most beautiful woman there now gerald no need to exaggerate maud said crisply then she disappeared into the crowd and i couldnt find her i didnt know her name i asked people who was the pretty girl with the fair hair and they said all the girls were pretty and fair maud said i hurried away after the service we were staying at the holly bush inn and my mother was unwell so i went back to take care of her gerald said i looked all over town but i couldnt find her after easter everyone went home i was living in shiring and she in casterham though i didnt know that i thought id never see her again i imagined she might have been an angel come to earth to make sure everyone was attending the service she said gerald please but my heart was lost i took no interest in other women i expected to spend my life longing for the angel of kingsbridge this went on for two years then i saw her at a tournament in winchester she said this complete stranger came up to me and said its you i after all this time you must marry me before you disappear again i thought he was mad amazing said edmund merthin thought edmunds goodwill had been stretched far enough anyway he said ive drawn some designs on the tracing floor in the masons loft at the cathedral edmund nodded a stone bridge wide enough for two carts as you specified and ramped at both ends and ive found a way to reduce the price by about a third thats astonishing how ill show you as soon as youve finished eating edmund spooned up the last of the pottage and stood im done lets go he turned to gerald and inclined his head in a slight bow thank you for your hospitality its a pleasure to have you here alderman merthin and edmund stepped out into a light drizzle instead of heading for the cathedral merthin led edmund towards the river edmunds lopsided stride was instantly recognizable and every second person on the street greeted him with a friendly word or a respectful bow merthin suddenly felt nervous he had been thinking about the bridge design for months while he worked at st marks supervising the carpenters who were constructing the new roof as the old was demolished he mulled over the greater challenge of the bridge now for the first time his ideas would come under scrutiny by someone else as yet edmund had no idea how radical merthins plan was the muddy street wound downhill through houses and workshops the city ramparts had fallen into disrepair during two centuries of civil peace and in some places all that remained were humps of earth that now formed parts of garden walls at the rivers edge were industries that used large quantities of water especially wool dyers and leather tanners merthin and edmund emerged on to the muddy foreshore between a slaughterhouse that gave off a strong smell of blood and a smithy where hammers clanged on iron directly in front of them across a narrow stretch of water was leper island edmund said why are we here the bridge is a quarter of a mile upstream it was said merthin he took a breath and said i think we should build the new one here a bridge to the island and another from the island to the far shore two small bridges instead of one big one much cheaper but people will have to walk across the island from one bridge to the other why not because its a leper colony theres only one leper left he can be moved elsewhere the disease seems to be dying out edmund looked thoughtful so everyone who comes to kingsbridge will arrive at this spot where were standing well have to build a new street and knock down some of these buildings but the cost will be small by comparison with the money saved on the bridge and on the other side a pasture that belongs to the priory i can see the whole layout when im on the roof of st marks thats how come i thought of it edmund was impressed thats very clever i wonder why the bridge wasnt put here originally the first bridge was erected hundreds of years ago the river probably had a different shape then river banks must move their position as the centuries go by the channel between the island and the pasture could have been wider at one time then there would have been no advantage in building here edmund peered across the water and merthin followed his gaze the leper colony was a scatter of tumbledown wooden buildings spread over three or four acres the island was too rocky for cultivation but there were some trees and scrubby grass the place was infested with rabbits which the townspeople would not eat because of a superstition that they were the souls of dead lepers at one time the ostracized inhabitants had kept their own chickens and pigs now however it was simpler for the priory to supply food to the last remaining inhabitant youre right edmund said there hasnt been a new case of leprosy in the town for at least ten years ive never seen a leper merthin said as a child i thought people were saying leopard i imagined that island to be occupied by spotted lions edmund laughed turning his back on the river he looked at the buildings around there will be some political work to do he mused the people whose homes must be demolished will have to be convinced that theyre the lucky ones being moved to new and better houses while their neighbours missed out and the island may have to be cleansed with holy water to convince people that its safe but we can handle all that ive drawn both bridges with pointed arches like the cathedral merthin said they will be beautiful show me they left the riverside and walked uphill through the town to the priory the cathedral dripped with rain under a layer of low cloud like smoke from a damp fire merthin was looking forward to seeing his drawings again he had not been to the loft for a week or so and to explaining them to edmund he had thought a great deal about the way the current had undermined the old bridge and how he could protect the new one from the same fate he led edmund through the north porch and up the spiral staircase his wet shoes slipped on the worn stone steps edmund energetically hauled his withered leg up behind him several lamps were burning in the masons loft at first merthin was pleased for that meant they would be able to see his drawings more clearly then he saw elfric working on the tracing floor he felt momentarily frustrated the enmity between himself and his former master was as great as ever elfric had failed to prevent townspeople from employing merthin but he continued to block merthins application to join the carpenters guild leaving merthin in an anomalous position illegitimate but accepted elfrics attitude was pointless but spiteful elfrics presence here would put a damper on merthins conversation with edmund he told himself not to be so sensitive why should it not be elfric who was made uncomfortable he held the door for edmund and together they crossed the room to the tracing floor then he suffered a shock elfric was bent over the tracing floor drawing with a pair of compasses on a fresh layer of plaster he had recovered the floor totally obliterating merthins drawings merthin said incredulously what have you done elfric looked contemptuously at him and went on with his drawing saying nothing hes wiped out my work merthin said to edmund whats your explanation man edmund demanded elfric could not ignore his fatherinlaw theres nothing to explain he said a tracing floor has to be renewed at intervals but youve covered over important designs have i the prior has not commissioned this boy to make any drawings and the boy has not asked permission to use the tracing floor edmund was never slow to anger and elfrics cool insolence was getting under his skin dont act stupid he said i asked merthin to prepare drawings for the new bridge im sorry but only the prior has authority to do that damn it the guild is providing the money a loan to be repaid it still gives us the right to a say on the design does it youll have to speak to the prior about that i dont think hell be impressed by your choice of an inexperienced apprentice as your designer though merthin was looking at the drawings elfric had scratched in the new plaster i suppose this is your bridge design he said prior godwyn has commissioned me to build it elfric said edmund was shocked without asking us elfric said resentfully whats the matter dont you want the work to go to your own daughters husband round arches merthin said still studying elfrics drawing and narrow openings how many piers will you have elfric was reluctant to answer but edmund was staring expectantly at him seven he said the wooden bridge only had five merthin said why are they so thick and the openings so narrow to bear the weight of a stonepaved roadway you dont need thick piers for that look at this cathedral its columns bear the entire weight of the roof but theyre slim and widely spaced elfric sneered no ones going to drive a cart across the roof of a church thats true but merthin stopped the rain on the cathedrals vast expanse of roof probably weighed more than an oxcart loaded with stone but why should he explain this to elfric it was not his role to educate an incompetent builder elfrics design was poor but merthin did not want to improve it he wanted to replace it with his own so he shut up edmund also realized he was wasting his breath this decision is not going to be made by you two he said and he stomped off john constables baby daughter was christened in the cathedral by prior godwyn this honour was granted because he was an important employee of the priory all the leading townspeople attended although john was neither wealthy nor well connected his father had worked in the priory stables petranilla said that respectable people should take care to show friendship towards him and support for him caris thought they condescended to john because they needed him to protect their property it was raining again and the people grouped around the font were wetter than the infant who was sprinkled with holy water strange feelings stirred in caris as she looked at the tiny helpless child since lying with merthin she had simply refused to let herself think about pregnancy but all the same she felt a warm surge of protective emotion when she saw the baby she was named jesca after abrahams niece cariss cousin godwyn had never been comfortable with babies and as soon as the brief rite was over he turned to leave but petranilla grabbed the sleeve of his benedictine robe what about this bridge she said she spoke in a low voice but caris heard and made up her mind to listen to the rest godwyn said ive asked elfric to prepare drawings and estimates good we should keep it in the family elfric is the priorys builder other people may want to horn in i shall decide who builds the bridge caris was annoyed enough to intervene how dare you she said to petranilla i was not speaking to you her aunt said caris ignored that why should merthins design not be considered because he isnt family he practically lives with us but youre not married to him if you were it might be different caris knew she was at a disadvantage there so she shifted her ground youve always been prejudiced against merthin she said but everyone knows hes a better builder than elfric her sister alice heard that and joined in the argument elfric taught merthin everything and now merthin pretends he knows better that was dishonest caris knew and she felt angry who built the ferry she said raising her voice who repaired the roof of st marks merthin was working with elfric when he built the ferry and no one asked elfric about st marks because they knew he wouldnt be able to solve the problem godwyn interrupted please he said with his hands raised in front of himself protectively i know youre my family but im the prior and this is the cathedral i cant be harangued by womenfolk in public edmund joined the circle just what i was going to say keep your voices down alice said accusingly you should be supporting your soninlaw it occurred to caris that alice was getting more like petranilla although she was only twentyone and petranilla was more than twice that age alice had the same pursemouthed look of disapproval she was also becoming more stout her bosom filling out the front of her dress like wind in a sail edmund looked sternly at alice this decision will not be made on the basis of family relationships he said the fact that elfric is married to my daughter wont help his bridge stay upright he had strong views on this subject caris knew he believed you should always do business with the most reliable supplier always hire the best man for the job regardless of friendship or family ties any man who needs to surround himself with loyal acolytes doesnt really believe in himself he would say and if he doesnt believe in himself why should i petranilla said so how will the choice be made she gave him a shrewd look youve obviously got a plan the priory and the guild will consider elfrics design and merthins and any others that may be put forward edmund said decisively all designs must be drawn and costed the costing must be independently checked by other builders alice muttered ive never heard of such goingson its like an archery contest elfric is the priorys builder he should do the job her father ignored her finally the designers will be questioned by the leading citizens of the town at a meeting of the parish guild and then he looked at godwyn who was pretending not to be bewildered by the way the decision process had been taken out of his hands and then prior godwyn will make his choice the meeting took place in the guild hall on the main street it had a stone undercroft below and a timber superstructure topped by a tiled roof and two stone chimneys in the basement were the large kitchen that prepared food for the banquets a jail and an office for the constable the main floor was as spacious as a church a hundred feet long and thirty feet wide at one end was a chapel because it was so wide and because timbers long enough to span a thirtyfoot roof were rare and expensive the main room was divided by a row of wooden pillars supporting the joists it appeared an unpretentious building made of the materials used in the humblest dwellings glorifying nobody but as edmund often said the money made by the people here paid for the limestoneandstainedglass majesty of the cathedral and the guild hall was comfortable in its unostentatious way there were tapestries on the walls and glass in the windows and two huge fireplaces kept it warm in winter when business was booming the food served here was fit for royalty the parish guild had been formed hundreds of years ago when kingsbridge was a small town a few merchants had got together to raise money to buy ornaments for the cathedral but when wealthy men eat and drink in a group they inevitably discuss their common concerns and fundraising soon became secondary to politics from the start the guild was dominated by wool merchants which was why a huge pair of scales and a standard weight for a woolsack pounds stood at one end of the hall as kingsbridge grew other guilds had been formed representing crafts carpenters masons brewers goldsmiths but their leading members also belonged to the parish guild which retained its primacy it was a less powerful version of the guild merchant that ruled most english towns but was prohibited here by the towns landlord kingsbridge priory merthin had never attended a meeting or banquet here but he had been inside several times on more mundane business he liked to crane back his neck and study the complex geometry of the roof timbers a lesson in how the weight of a broad expanse of roof could be funnelled down to a few slender wooden pillars most of the elements made sense but one or two pieces of wood seemed to him to be superfluous or even detrimental transferring weight to weaker zones that was because no one really knew what made buildings stand up builders went by instinct and experience and sometimes got it wrong this evening merthin was in a state of high anxiety too nervous to really appreciate the woodwork the guild was about to pass judgement on his bridge design it was far superior to elfrics but would they see that elfric had had the benefit of the tracing floor merthin might have asked godwyn for permission to use it but he had been afraid of further sabotage by elfric so he had devised an alternative he had stretched a large piece of parchment across a wooden frame and had drawn his design on the skin with a pen and ink tonight this might work to his advantage for he had brought his design with him to the guild hall so that members would have it in front of them whereas elfrics would only be in their memories he placed his framed drawing at the front of the hall on a threelegged stand he had devised for the purpose everyone came and looked at it as they arrived although they had all seen it at least once over the last few days they had also climbed the spiral staircase to the loft and looked at elfrics drawings merthin thought most people preferred his design but some were wary of backing a youngster against an experienced man many had kept their opinions to themselves the noise level rose as the hall filled up with men and a few women they dressed up for the guild as they did for church the men in expensive wool coats despite the mild summer weather the women in elaborate headdresses although everyone paid lip service to the untrustworthiness and general inferiority of women in practice several of the towns wealthiest and most important citizens were female there was mother cecilia sitting now at the front with her personal assistant the nun known as old julie caris was here everyone acknowledged that she was edmunds right hand merthin experienced a jolt of desire as she sat on the bench next to him her thigh warm against his own anyone carrying on a trade in the town had to belong to a guild outsiders could do business only on market days even monks and priests were compelled to join if they wanted to trade which they often did when a man died it was common for his widow to continue his enterprise betty baxter was the towns most prosperous baker sarah taverner kept the holly bush inn it would have been difficult and cruel to prevent such women earning a living much easier to include them in the guild edmund normally chaired these meetings sitting on a big wooden throne on a raised platform at the front today however there were two chairs on the platform edmund sat in one and when prior godwyn arrived edmund invited him to take the other godwyn was accompanied by all the senior monks and merthin was pleased to see thomas among them philemon was also in the entourage lanky and awkward and merthin wondered briefly what on earth godwyn had brought him for godwyn was looking pained opening the proceedings edmund was careful to acknowledge that the prior was in charge of the bridge and the choice of design was ultimately his but everyone knew that in fact edmund had taken the decision out of godwyns hands by calling this meeting provided there was a clear consensus tonight godwyn would have great difficulty in going against the expressed will of the merchants in a matter of commerce rather than religion edmund asked godwyn to begin with a prayer and godwyn obliged but he knew he had been outmanoeuvred and that was why he looked as if there was a bad smell edmund stood up and said these two designs have been costed by elfric and merthin who have used the same methods of calculation elfric interjected of course we have he learned them from me there was a ripple of laughter from the older men it was true there were formulae for calculating costs per square foot of wall per cubic yard of infill per foot of a roof span and for more intricate work such as arches and vaulting all builders used the same methods though with their individual variations the bridge calculations had been complex but easier than for a building such as a church edmund went on each man has checked the others calculations so there is no room for dispute edward butcher called out yes all builders overcharge by the same amount that got a big laugh edward was popular with the men for his quick wit and with the women for his good looks and brown bedroom eyes he was not so popular with his wife who knew about his infidelities and had recently attacked him with one of his own heavy knives he still had a bandage on his left arm elfrics bridge will cost two hundred and eightyfive pounds edmund said as the laughter died away merthins comes out at three hundred and seven the difference is twentytwo pounds as most of you will have worked out faster than me there was a quiet chuckle at that edmund was often teased for having his daughter do his arithmetic for him he still used the old latin numerals because he could not get used to the new arabic digits that made calculation so much easier a new voice said twentytwo pounds is a lot of money it was bill watkin the builder who had refused to hire merthin looking like one of the monks with his bald dome dick brewer said yes but merthins bridge is twice as wide it ought to cost twice as much but it doesnt because its a cleverer design dick was fond of his own product ale and in consequence had a protruding round belly like a pregnant woman bill rejoined how many days a year do we need a bridge wide enough for two carts every market day and all of fleece fair week not so said bill its only for an hour in the morning and another in the afternoon ive waited two hours with a cartload of barley before now you should have the sense to bring your barley in on quiet days i bring barley in every day dick was the largest brewer in the county he owned a huge copper kettle that held five hundred gallons in consequence of which his tavern was called the copper edmund interrupted this spat there are other problems caused by delays on the bridge he said some traders go to shiring where theres no bridge and no queue others do their business while waiting in line then go home without ever entering the town and save themselves the bridge toll and the market taxes its forestalling and its illegal but weve never succeeded in stopping it and then theres the question of how people think of kingsbridge right now were the town whose bridge collapsed if were going to attract back all the business were losing we need to change that id like us to become known as the town with the best bridge in england edmund was hugely influential and merthin began to scent victory betty baxter an enormously fat woman in her forties stood up and pointed to something on merthins drawing whats this here in the middle of the bridge parapet over the pier she said theres a little pointed bit that sticks out over the water like a viewing platform what is it for fishing the others laughed its a pedestrian refuge merthin answered if youre walking over the bridge and suddenly the earl of shiring rides across with twenty mounted knights you can step out of their way edward butcher said i hope its big enough to fit betty in everyone laughed but betty persisted with her questioning why is the pier underneath it pointed like that all the way down to the water elfrics piers arent pointed to deflect debris look at any river bridge youll see the piers are chipped and cracked what do you think causes that damage it must be the large pieces of wood tree trunks or timbers from demolished buildings that you see floating downstream and crashing into piers or ian boatman when hes drunk said edward boats or debris they will cause less damage to my pointed piers elfrics will suffer the full impact elfric said my walls are too strong to be knocked down by bits of wood on the contrary said merthin your arches are narrower than mine therefore the water will be drawn through them faster and the debris will strike the piers with greater force causing more damage he could see from elfrics face that the older man had not even thought of that but the audience were not builders how could they judge what was right around the base of each pier merthin had drawn a pile of rough stones known to builders as riprap this would prevent the current undermining his piers the way it had those of the old wooden bridge but no one asked him about the riprap so he did not explain it betty had more questions why is your bridge so long elfrics begins at the waters edge yours starts several yards inland isnt that unnecessary expense my bridge is ramped at both ends merthin explained thats so that you step off the bridge on to dry land instead of a swamp no more oxcarts getting bogged down on the beach and blocking the bridge for an hour cheaper to put down a paved road said elfric elfric was beginning to sound desperate then bill watkin stood up im having trouble deciding whos right and whos wrong he said when these two argue its difficult to make up your mind and im a builder it must be worse for those who arent there was a murmur of agreement bill went on so i think we should look at the men not the designs merthin had been afraid of this he listened with increasing despair which of the two do you know best said bill which can you rely on elfric has been a builder in this town man and boy for twenty years we can look at houses hes put up and see theyre still standing we can see the repairs hes done on the cathedral on the other hand heres merthin a clever lad we know but a bit of a tearaway and never finished his apprenticeship theres not a lot to indicate that hes capable of taking charge of the largest building project kingsbridge has seen since the construction of the cathedral i know which one i trust he sat down several men voiced their approval they would not judge the designs they would decide on personalities it was maddeningly unfair then brother thomas spoke up has anyone in kingsbridge ever been involved in a project that involved building below water level merthin knew the answer was no he felt a surge of hope this could rescue it for him thomas went on i would like to know how both men would handle that problem merthin was ready with his solution but he was afraid that if he spoke first elfric would simply echo him he compressed his lips hoping that thomas who usually helped him would get the message thomas caught merthins eye and said elfric what would you do the answer is simpler than you think elfric said you just have to drop loose rubble into the river at the point where your pier will stand the rubble rests on the river bottom you put more and more in until the pile is visible above water level then you build your pier on that foundation as merthin had expected elfric had come up with the crudest solution to the problem now merthin said there are two snags with elfrics method one is that a pile of rubble is no more stable under water than on land over time it will shift and drop and when that happens the bridge will subside if you want a bridge to last only a few years fine but i think we should build for the long term he heard a quiet rumble of concurrence the second problem is the shape of the pile it will naturally slope outwards below the water line restricting the passage of boats especially when the river is low and elfrics arches are already narrow elfric said irritably what would you do instead merthin suppressed a smile that was what he had wanted to hear elfric admitting that he did not know a better answer ill tell you he said and ill show everyone that i know better than the idiot who chopped my door to pieces he thought he looked around they were all listening their decision hung on what he would say next he took a deep breath first i would take a pointed wooden stake and piledrive it into the river bed then i would bang in another next to it touching then another in that way i would build a ring of stakes around the place in the river where i want to put my pier a ring of stakes elfric jeered that will never keep the water out brother thomas who had asked the question said listen to him please he listened to you merthin said next i would build a second ring inside the first with a gap between them of half a foot he sensed that he had his audiences attention now it still wont be waterproof said elfric edmund said shut up elfric this is interesting merthin went on then i would pour a clay mortar into the gap between the two rings the mixture would displace the water being heavier and it would plug any chinks between the wood stakes making the ring watertight this is called a coffer dam the room was quiet finally i would remove the water from inside by bucket exposing the river bed and build a mortared stone foundation elfric was dumbstruck both edmund and godwyn were staring at merthin thomas said thank you both speaking for myself that makes the decision an easy one yes said edmund i rather think it does caris was surprised that godwyn had wanted elfric to design the bridge she understood that elfric would seem a safer choice but godwyn was a reformer not a conservative and she had expected him to be enthusiastic about merthins clever radical design instead he had timidly favoured the cautious option fortunately edmund had been able to outmanoeuvre godwyn and now kingsbridge would have a wellbuilt beautiful bridge that would allow two carts to cross at the same time but godwyns eagerness to appoint the unimaginative sycophant rather than the bold man of talent was an ominous sign for the future and godwyn had never been a good loser when he was a boy petranilla had taught him to play chess letting him win to encourage him and he had challenged his uncle edmund but after being beaten twice he had sulked and refused to play again he was in the same mood after the meeting in the guild hall she could tell it was probably not that he was particularly attracted to elfrics design but he undoubtedly resented having the decision taken out of his hands next day when she and her father went to the priors house she anticipated trouble godwyn greeted them coolly and did not offer any refreshment as always edmund pretended not to notice slights i want merthin to start work on the bridge immediately he said as he sat down at the table in the hall i have pledges of money for the full amount of merthins budget from whom godwyn interrupted the towns wealthiest traders godwyn continued to look inquiringly at edmund edmund shrugged and said fifty pounds from betty baxter eighty from dick brewer seventy from myself and ten pounds each from eleven others i didnt know our citizens possessed such riches godwyn said he seemed both awestruck and envious god has been kind edmund added kind enough to reward people for a lifetimes hard work and worry no doubt which is why i need to give them reassurances about the return of their money when the bridge is built the tolls will come to the parish guild which will use them to repay loans but who will collect the pennies as the passengers cross the bridge i think it has to be a servant of the guild i never agreed to this godwyn said i know thats why im raising it now i mean i never agreed to pay the tolls to the parish guild what caris stared at godwyn flabbergasted of course he had agreed to it what was he talking about he had spoken to her as well as to edmund and assured them that brother thomas oh she said you promised that thomas would build the bridge if he was elected prior then when thomas withdrew and you became the candidate we assumed you assumed godwyn said a smirk of triumph played about his lips edmund could barely contain himself this is not square dealing godwyn he said in a choked voice you knew what the understanding was i knew no such thing and you should call me father prior edmunds voice got louder then were back where we were with prior anthony three months ago except that now instead of an inadequate bridge we have no bridge at all dont imagine it will be built at no cost to you citizens may lend their life savings to the priory on the security of income from the bridge tolls but they will not give their money away father prior then they must manage without a bridge i have only just become prior how can i start by alienating a right that has belonged to my priory for hundreds of years but its only temporary edmund exploded and if you dont do this no one will gain any money from bridge tolls because there will be no cursed bridge caris was furious but she bit her tongue and tried to figure out what godwyn was up to he was getting his revenge for last night but did he really mean it what do you want she said to him edmund looked surprised by the question but he said nothing the reason he brought caris with him to meetings was that she often saw things he missed and asked questions he had not thought of i dont know what you mean godwyn replied youve pulled a surprise she said youve caught us wrongfooted very well we admit we made an assumption that may have been unwarranted but whats your purpose just to make us feel stupid you asked for this meeting not i edmund burst out what kind of way is that to talk to your uncle and your cousin just a minute papa caris said godwyn did have a secret agenda she felt sure but he did not want to admit it all right she thought ill have to guess it give me a minute to think she said godwyn still wanted the bridge he had to nothing else made sense the business about alienating the priorys ancient rights was rhetoric the kind of pompous prating that all students were taught at oxford did he want edmund to break down and agree to elfrics design she did not think so godwyn clearly resented the way edmund had appealed over his head to the citizenry but he must see that merthin was offering twice as much bridge for almost the same money so what else could it be perhaps he just wanted a better deal he had looked hard at the priorys finances she guessed having railed comfortably against anthonys inefficiency for many years he was now confronted with the reality of having to do the job better himself perhaps it was not going to be as easy as he had imagined perhaps he was not as clever about money and management as he had thought in desperation he wanted the bridge and the money from tolls but how did he think that could happen she said what could we offer you that would make you change your mind build the bridge without keeping the tolls he said instantly so that was his agenda you always were a bit sneaky godwyn she thought a flash of inspiration struck her and she said how much money are we talking about godwyn looked suspicious why do you want to know that edmund said we can work it out not counting citizens who dont pay the toll about a hundred people cross the bridge every market day and carts pay two pence its much less now with the ferry of course caris said say a hundred and twenty pennies a week or ten shillings which comes to twentysix pounds a year edmund said then during fleece fair week about a thousand on the first day and another two hundred each subsequent day thats two thousand two hundred plus carts call it two thousand four hundred pennies which is ten pounds total thirtysix pounds a year caris looked at godwyn is that about right yes he acknowledged grudgingly so what you want from us is thirtysix pounds a year yes impossible said edmund not necessarily caris said suppose the priory were to grant the parish guild a lease on the bridge thinking on her feet she added plus an acre of ground at either end and the island in the middle for thirtysix pounds a year in perpetuity once the bridge was built that land would be priceless she knew would that give you what you want father prior yes godwyn clearly thought he was getting thirtysix pounds a year for something worthless he had no idea how much rent could be charged for a plot of land at the end of a bridge the worst negotiator in the world is a man who believes hes clever caris thought edmund said but how would the guild recoup the cost of construction with merthins design the number of people and carts crossing should rise theoretically it could double everything over thirtysix pounds is the guilds then we could put up buildings either side to service travellers taverns stables cook shops they should be profitable we could charge a good rent i dont know said edmund it seems very risky to me for a moment caris felt furious with her father she had come up with a brilliant solution and he seemed to be finding unnecessary fault with it then she realized he was faking she could see the light of enthusiasm in his eyes not quite concealed he loved the idea but he did not want godwyn to know how keen he was he was hiding his feelings for fear the prior would try to negotiate a better bargain it was a ploy father and daughter had used before when bargaining over wool having figured out what he was up to caris played along pretending to share his misgivings i know its hazardous she said gloomily we could lose everything but what alternative do we have weve got our backs to the wall if we dont build the bridge well go out of business edmund shook his head dubiously all the same i cant agree to this on behalf of the guild ill have to talk to the people who are putting up the money i cant say what their reply will be he looked godwyn in the eye but ill do my best to persuade them if this is your best offer godwyn had not actually made an offer caris reflected but he had forgotten that it is he said firmly got you caris thought triumphantly youre really very shrewd merthin said he was lying between cariss legs his head on her thigh toying with her pubic hair they had just made love for the second time ever and he had found it even more joyous than the first as they dozed in the pleasant daydream of satisfied lovers she had told him about her negotiation with godwyn he was impressed caris said the best of it is he thinks hes driven a hard bargain in fact a perpetual lease on the bridge and the land around it is priceless all the same its a bit dismaying if hes going to be no better at managing the priorys money than your uncle anthony was they were in the forest in a clearing hidden by brambles and shaded by a stand of tall beech trees where a stream ran over rocks to form a pool it had probably been used by lovers for hundreds of years they had stripped naked and bathed in the pool before making love on the grassy bank anyone travelling clandestinely through the woods would skirt the thicket so they were not likely to be discovered unless by children picking blackberries which was how caris had originally discovered the glade she told merthin now he said idly why did you ask for that island im not sure its obviously not as valuable as the land at either end of the bridge and its no good for cultivation but it could still be developed the truth is i guessed he wouldnt object so i just threw it in will you take over your fathers wool business one day no so definite why its too easy for the king to tax the wool trade he has just imposed an extra duty of a pound per sack of wool thats on top of the existing tax of twothirds of a pound the price of wool is now so high that the italians are looking for wool from other countries such as spain the business is too much at the mercy of the monarch still its a living what else would you do merthin was edging the conversation towards marriage a subject she never raised i dont know she smiled when i was ten i wanted to be a doctor i thought that if i had known about medicine i could have saved my mothers life they all laughed at me i didnt realize only men could be physicians you could be a wise woman like mattie that would shock the family imagine what petranilla would say mother cecilia thinks its my destiny to be a nun he laughed if she could see you now he kissed the soft inside of her thigh shed probably want to do what youre doing caris said you know what people say about nuns why would she think you wanted to join the convent its because of what we did after the bridge collapsed i helped her take care of the injured she said i had a natural gift for it you have even i could see it i just did what cecilia said but people seemed to feel better as soon as you spoke to them and then you always listened to what they had to say before telling them what they should do she stroked his cheek i couldnt be a nun im too fond of you her triangle of hair was reddishbrown with golden lights youve got a little mole he said right here on the left beside the cleft i know its been there since i was a little girl i used to think it was ugly i was so pleased when my hair grew because i thought that meant my husband wouldnt see it i never imagined anyone would look as closely as you friar murdo would call you a witch youd better not let him see it not if he were the last man on earth this is the blemish that saves you from blasphemy what are you talking about in the arab world every work of art has a tiny flaw so that it doesnt sacrilegiously compete with the perfection of god how do you know that one of the florentines told me listen do you think the parish guild will want the island why do you ask because id like to own it four acres of rock and rabbits why id build a dock and a builders yard stone and timber coming by river could be delivered directly to my dock when the bridge is finished id build a house on the island nice idea but they wouldnt give it to you free how about as part payment for building the bridge i could take say half wages for two years you charge four pence a day so the price of the island would be just over five pounds i should think the guild would be pleased to get that much for barren land do you think its a good idea i think you could build houses there and rent them as soon as the bridge is finished and people can travel to and from the island easily yes said merthin thoughtfully id better talk to your father about it returning to earlscastle at the end of a days hunting when all the men in earl rolands entourage were in a good mood ralph fitzgerald was happy they crossed the drawbridge like an invading army knights and squires and dogs rain was falling in a light drizzle coolly welcome to the men and animals who were hot and tired and content they had taken several summerfat hinds that would make good eating plus a big old stag too tough for anything but dog meat killed for its magnificent antlers they dismounted in the outer compound within the lower circle of the figureeight moat ralph unsaddled griff murmured a few words of thanks in his ear fed him a carrot and handed him to a groom to be rubbed down kitchen boys dragged away the bloody carcasses of the deer the men were noisily recalling the days incidents boasting and jeering and laughing remembering remarkable jumps and dangerous falls and hairsbreadth escapes ralphs nostrils filled with a smell he loved a mixture of sweating horses wet dogs leather and blood ralph found himself next to lord william of caster the earls elder son a great days sport he said tremendous william agreed he pulled off his cap and scratched his balding head im sorry to lose old bruno though bruno the leader of the dog pack had gone in for the kill a few moments too early when the stag was too exhausted to run any farther and turned to face the hounds its heaving shoulders covered with blood bruno had leaped for its throat but with a last burst of defiance the deer had dipped its head and swung its muscular neck and impaled the soft belly of the dog on the points of its antlers the effort finished the beast off and a moment later the other dogs were tearing it apart but as it thrashed its life away brunos guts unravelled across the antlers like a tangled rope and william had had to put him out of his misery slashing his throat with a long dagger he was a brave dog ralph said and put a hand on williams shoulder in commiseration like a lion william agreed on the spur of the moment ralph decided to speak about his prospects there would never be a better moment he had been rolands man for seven years he was brave and strong and he had saved his lords life after the bridge collapsed yet he had been given no promotion and was still a squire what more could be asked of him yesterday he had met his brother by chance at a tavern on the road from kingsbridge to shiring merthin on his way to the priorys quarry had been full of news he was going to build the most beautiful bridge in england he would be rich and famous their parents were thrilled it had made ralph feel even more frustrated now speaking to lord william he could not think of a neat way to introduce the subject that was on his mind so he just plunged in its three months since i saved your fathers life at kingsbridge several people claim that honour william said the harsh look that came over his face reminded ralph strongly of roland i pulled him out of the water and matthew barber mended his head and the nuns changed his bandages and the monks prayed for him god saved his life though amen ralph said all the same i was hoping for some sign of favour my fathers a hard man to please williams brother richard was standing nearby redfaced and sweating and he overheard the remark thats as true as the bible he said dont complain william said our fathers hardness made us strong as i recall it made us miserable william turned away probably not wanting to argue the point in front of an underling when the horses were stabled the men drifted across the compound past the kitchens and barracks and chapel to a second drawbridge that led to a small inner compound the top loop of the figure eight here the earl lived in a traditional keep with groundfloor storerooms a great hall above and a small upper storey for the earls private bedchamber a colony of rooks inhabited the high trees around the keep and strutted on the battlements like sergeants cawing their dissatisfaction roland was in the great hall having changed out of his dirty hunting clothes into a purple robe ralph stood near the earl determined to raise the question of his promotion at the first opportunity roland was arguing goodnaturedly with williams wife lady philippa one of the few people who could contradict him and get away with it they were talking about the castle i dont think its changed for a hundred years philippa said thats because its such a good design roland said speaking out of the left side of his mouth the enemy expends most of his strength getting into the lower compound then he faces a whole new battle to reach the keep exactly said philippa it was built for defence not comfort but when was the last time a castle in this part of england came under attack not in my lifetime nor in mine he grinned with the mobile half of his face probably because our defences are so strong there was a bishop who scattered acorns on the road wherever he travelled to protect him from lions philippe said when they told him there were no lions in all england he said its more effective than i thought roland laughed philippa added most noble families nowadays live in more comfortable homes ralph did not care for luxury but he cared for philippa he gazed at her voluptuous figure as she talked unaware of him he imagined her lying beneath him twisting her naked body crying out in pleasure or pain or both if he were a knight he could have a woman like that you should knock down this old keep and build a modern house she was saying to her fatherinlaw one with big windows and lots of fireplaces you could have the hall at ground level with the family apartments at one end so that we could all have somewhere private to sleep when we come to visit you and the kitchens at the other end so that the food is still hot when it reaches the table suddenly ralph realized he could make a contribution to this conversation i know who could design such a house for you he said they turned to him in surprise what would a squire know of house design who said philippa my brother merthin she looked thoughtful the funnyfaced boy who tells me to buy green silk to match my eyes he meant no disrespect im not sure what he meant is he a builder hes the best ralph said proudly he devised the new ferry at kingsbridge then he figured out how to repair the roof of st marks when no one else could and now hes been commissioned to build the most beautiful bridge in england somehow im not surprised she said what bridge said roland the new one at kingsbridge it will have pointed arches like a church and be wide enough for two carts ive heard nothing of this roland said ralph realized the earl was displeased what had annoyed him the bridge must be rebuilt mustnt it ralph said im not so sure roland replied nowadays theres hardly enough business for two markets as close together as kingsbridge and shiring but if we must accept the kingsbridge market that doesnt mean we have to countenance a blatant attempt by the priory to steal customers from shiring bishop richard had come in and now roland rounded on him you didnt tell me about the new bridge at kingsbridge because i dont know about it richard answered you ought to youre the bishop richard flushed at the reproof the bishop of kingsbridge has lived in or near shiring ever since the civil war between king stephen and the empress maud two centuries ago the monks prefer it that way and so do most bishops that doesnt prevent you keeping your ear to the ground you should have some idea of whats happening there since i dont perhaps youd be kind enough to tell me what youve learned that kind of cool insolence passed over rolands head its going to be wide enough for two carts it will take business away from my market at shiring theres nothing i can do about it why not youre the abbot ex officio the monks are supposed to do what you say they dont though perhaps they will if we take away their builder ralph can you persuade your brother to give up the project i can try offer him a better prospect tell him i want him to build a new palace for me here at earlscastle ralph was excited to get a special commission from the earl but he was daunted too he had never been able to talk merthin into anything it was always the other way around all right he said will they be able to go ahead without him he got the job because no one else in kingsbridge knew how to build under water richard said hes not the only man in england who can design a bridge obviously william said still taking away their builder would surely delay them they probably couldnt start for another year then its worth doing roland said decisively a look of hatred came over the animated half of his face and he added that arrogant prior has to be put in his place things had changed in the life of gerald and maud ralph discovered his mother wore a new green dress to church and his father had leather shoes back at home there was a goose stuffed with apples roasting over the fire filling the little house with a mouthwatering smell and a loaf of wheat bread the most expensive kind standing on the table the money came from merthin ralph soon learned he gets paid four pence a day every day he works on st marks maud said proudly and hes building a new house for dick brewer thats as well as getting ready to build the new bridge merthin received a lower wage for working on the bridge he explained while his father carved the goose because he had been given leper island in part payment the last remaining leper old and bedridden had been moved to a small house in the monks orchard on the far side of the river ralph found that his mothers evident happiness left a sour taste in his mouth he had believed since he was a boy that the destiny of the family lay in his hands he had been sent away at the age of fourteen to join the household of the earl of shiring and he had known even then that it was up to him to wipe out his fathers humiliation by becoming a knight perhaps a baron even an earl merthin by contrast had been apprenticed to a carpenter and set on a road that could only lead farther down the social hill builders were never made knights it was some consolation that their father was unimpressed by merthins success he showed signs of impatience when maud talked about building projects my elder son seems to have inherited the blood of jack builder my only lowborn ancestor he said and his tone was amazed rather than proud but ralph tell us how youre getting on at the court of earl roland unfortunately ralph had so far mysteriously failed to rise in the nobility whereas merthin was buying his parents new clothes and expensive dinners ralph knew he should just be grateful that one of them had won success and that even if his parents remained humble they could at least be comfortable but though his mind told him to rejoice his heart seethed with resentment and now he had to persuade his brother to give up the bridge the trouble with merthin was that he would never see anything simply he was not like the knights and squires with whom ralph had spent the last seven years they were fighting men in their world loyalties were clear bravery was the virtue and the issue was life or death there was never much need for deep thought but menhin thought about everything he could not play a game of chequers without suggesting a change in the rules he was explaining to their parents why he had accepted four acres of barren rock in part payment for his work on the bridge everyone thinks the land is worthless because its an island he said what they dont realize is that when the bridge is built the island will become part of the city townspeople will walk across the bridge just as they walk along the main street and four acres of city land is very valuable if i build houses on it the rents will be worth a fortune gerald said youve a few years to wait before then im getting some income from it already jake chepstow is renting half an acre to use as a timber yard hes bringing logs from wales why from wales gerald asked the new forest is nearer their wood should be cheaper it should be but the earl of shaftesbury charges a toll or a tax at every river ford and bridge in his territory it was a familiar gripe many lords found ways to tax goods that passed through their territories as they started to eat ralph said to merthin i bring you news of another opportunity the earl wants to build a new palace at earlscastle merthin looked suspicious he sent you to ask me to design it i suggested you lady philippa was berating him about how oldfashioned the keep is and i said i knew the right person to talk to maud was thrilled isnt that wonderful merthin remained sceptical and the earl said he wanted me yes amazing a few months ago i couldnt get a job now ive got too much to do and earlscastle is two days away i dont see how i could build a palace there and a bridge here at the same time oh youll have to give up the bridge ralph said what work for the earl has to take precedence over everything else naturally im not sure thats right take it from me did he say that yes as a matter of fact he did their father joined in this is a marvellous opportunity merthin he said to build a palace for an earl of course it is merthin replied but a bridge for this town is at least as important dont be stupid his father said i do my best not to be merthin said sarcastically the earl of shiring is one of the great men of the land the prior of kingsbridge is a nobody by comparison ralph cut a slice of goose thigh and put it in his mouth but he could hardly swallow he had been afraid of this merthin was going to be difficult he would not take orders from their father either he had never been obedient even as a child ralph felt desperate listen he said the earl doesnt want the new bridge to be built he thinks it will take business away from shiring aha said gerald you dont want to go up against the earl merthin is that whats behind this ralph merthin asked is roland offering me this job just to prevent the building of the bridge not just for that reason but its a condition if i want to build his palace i must abandon the bridge gerald said with exasperation you dont have a choice merthin the earl doesnt request he commands ralph could have told him that an argument based on authority was not the way to persuade merthin merthin said i dont think he can command the prior of kingsbridge who has commissioned me to build this bridge but he can command you can he hes not my lord dont be foolish son you cant win a fight with an earl i dont think rolands quarrel is with me father this is between the earl and the prior roland wants to use me as a hunter uses a dog but i think id do better to stay out of the fight i think you should do what the earl says dont forget hes your kinsman too merthin tried a different argument has it occurred to you what a betrayal this would be of prior godwyn gerald made a disgusted noise what loyalty do we owe the priory it was the monks who forced us into penury and your neighbours the people of kingsbridge among whom youve lived for ten years they need the bridge its their lifeline we are of the nobility his father said were not required to take into account the needs of mere merchants merthin nodded you may feel that way but as a mere carpenter i cant share your view this isnt just about you ralph burst out he had to come clean he realized the earl has given me a mission if i succeed he may make me a knight or at least a minor lord if i fail i could remain a squire maud said its very important that we all try to please the earl merthin looked troubled he was always willing to go headtohead with their father but he did not like to argue with mother ive agreed to build the bridge he said the town is counting on me i cant give it up of course you can maud said i dont want to get a reputation for unreliability everyone would understand if you gave the earl precedence they might understand but they wouldnt respect me for it you should put your family first i fought for this bridge mother merthin said stubbornly i made a beautiful design and i persuaded the whole town to have faith in me no one else can build it not the way it should be done if you defy the earl it will affect ralphs whole life she said dont you see that his whole life shouldnt depend on something like this but it does are you willing to sacrifice your brother just for the sake of a bridge merthin said i suppose its a bit like my asking him to save mens lives by not going to war gerald said come now you cant compare a carpenter to a soldier that was tactless ralph thought it showed geralds preference for the younger son merthin felt the sting ralph could tell his brothers faced reddened and he bit his lip as if to restrain himself from a combative reply after a pause merthin spoke in a quiet voice that ralph knew to be a sign that he had made up his mind irrevocably i didnt ask to be a carpenter he said like ralph i wanted to be a knight a foolish aspiration for me i know that now all the same it was your decision that i should be what i am as things have turned out im good at it im going to make a success of what you forced me into one day id like to build the tallest building in england this is what you made me so youd better learn to live with it before ralph went back to earlscastle with the bad news he racked his brains for a way to turn defeat into victory if he could not talk his brother into abandoning the bridge was there some other way he could get the project cancelled or delayed there was no point talking to prior godwyn or edmund wooler he was sure they would be more committed to the bridge even than merthin and anyway they would not be persuaded by a mere squire what could the earl do he might send a troop of knights to kill the construction workers but that could cause more problems than it solved it was merthin who gave him the idea he had said that jake chepstow the timber merchant who was using leper island as a store yard was buying trees from wales to avoid the taxes charged by the earl of shaftesbury my brother feels he must accept the authority of the prior of kingsbridge ralph said to earl roland on his return before the earl had time to get angry he added but there may be a better way to delay the building of the bridge the priorys quarry is in the heart of your earldom between shiring and earlscastle but it belongs to the monks roland growled the king gave it to them centuries ago we cant stop them taking stone you could tax them though ralph said he felt guilty he was sabotaging a project dear to his brothers heart but it had to be done and he quelled his conscience they will be transporting their stone through your earldom their heavy carts will wear away your roads and churn up your river fords they ought to pay theyll squeal like pigs theyll go to the king let them ralph said sounding more confident than he felt it will take time there are only two months left of this years building season they have to stop work before the first frost with luck you could delay the start of the bridge until next year roland gave ralph a hard look i may have underestimated you he said perhaps youre good for more than pulling drowning earls out of rivers ralph concealed a triumphant smile thank you my lord but how shall we enforce this tax usually theres a crossroads a ford in a river some place every cart has to pass through since were only interested in blocks of stone we could simply camp a troop of men outside the quarry excellent said the earl and you can lead them two days later ralph was approaching the quarry with four menatarms on horseback and two boys leading a string of packhorses carrying tents and food for a week he was pleased with himself so far he had been given an impossible task and turned it around the earl thought he was good for more than river rescue work things were looking up he was deeply uncomfortable about what he was doing to merthin he had lain awake much of the night recalling their childhood together he had always revered his clever older brother they had often fought and ralph had felt worse when he won than when he lost they had always made friends afterwards in those days but grownup fights were harder to forget he was not very anxious about the coming confrontation with the monks quarrymen it should not prove too challenging for a group oi military men he had no knights with him such work was beneath their dignity but he had joseph woodstock whom he knew to be a hard man and three others all the same he would be glad when it was over and he had achieved his aim it was just after dawn they had camped the night before in the forest a few miles from the quarry ralph planned to get there in time to challenge the first cart that attempted to leave this morning the horses stepped daintily along a road muddied by the hooves of oxen and deeply rutted by the wheels of heavy carts the sun rose into a sky of rain clouds broken by scraps of blue ralphs group were in a good mood looking forward to exercising their power over unarmed men with no serious risk to themselves ralph smelled wood burning then saw the smoke of several fires rising over the trees a few moments later the road widened into a muddy clearing in front of the largest hole in the ground he had ever seen it was a hundred yards wide and stretched for at least a quarter of a mile a mud ramp led down to the tents and wooden huts of the quarrymen who were clustered around their fires cooking breakfast a few were already at work farther along the site and ralph could hear the dull thud of hammers driving wedges into cracks in the rock splitting great slabs from the mass of stone the quarry was a days journey from kingsbridge so most carters arrived in the evening and left the following morning ralph could see several carts dotted about the quarry some being loaded with stone and one already making its slow way along the track through the diggings towards the exit ramp the men in the quarry looked up alerted by the sound of horses but no one approached workers were never in a hurry to converse with menatarms ralph waited patiently there appeared to be only one way out of the quarry the long slope of mud that led to where he was the first cart lumbered slowly up the ramp the carter urging the ox on with a longtailed whip the ox putting one foot in front of the other with mute resentment four huge stones were piled on its flatbed roughhewn and incised with the mark of the man who had quarried them each mans output was counted once at the quarry and again at the building site and he was paid per stone as the cart came closer ralph saw that the carter was a kingsbridge man ben wheeler he looked a bit like his ox with a thick neck and massive shoulders his face wore a similar expression of dull hostility he might try to make trouble ralph guessed however he could be subdued ben drove his ox towards the line of horses blocking the road instead of halting at a distance he let the beast come closer and closer the horses were not combattrained destriers but everyday hacks and they snorted nervously and backed the ox stopped of its own accord bens attitude angered ralph who called out youre a cocksure oaf ben said why do you stand in my way to collect the tax theres no tax to carry stone across the territory of the earl of shiring you must pay a penny per cartload i have no money then you must get some do you bar my passage the fool was not as scared as he should have been which infuriated ralph dont presume to question me ralph said the stone stays here until someone has paid tax for it ben glared back at him for a long moment and ralph had the strongest feeling that the man was wondering whether to knock him off his horse but i have no money he said eventually ralph wanted to run him through with his sword but he reined in his temper dont pretend to be even more stupid than you are he said contemptuously just go to the master quarryman and tell him the earls men will not let you leave ben stared at him a little longer mulling this over then without speaking he turned and walked back down the ramp leaving his cart ralph waited fuming staring at the ox ben entered a wooden hut half way along the quarry he emerged a few minutes later accompanied by a slight man in a brown tunic at first ralph presumed the second man was the quarrymaster however the figure looked familiar and as the two came closer ralph recognized his brother merthin oh no he said aloud he was not prepared for this he felt tortured by shame as he watched merthin walk up the long ramp he knew he was here to betray his brother but he had not expected merthin to be here to see it hello ralph said merthin as he came closer ben says you wont let him pass merthin had always been able to overcome him in an argument ralph recalled dismally he decided to be formal it would hide his emotions and he could hardly get into trouble if he simply repeated his instructions he said stiffly the earl has decided to exercise his right to collect taxes from consignments of stone using his roads merthin ignored that arent you going to get down off your horse to talk to your brother ralph would have preferred to stay mounted but he did not want to refuse what seemed like some kind of challenge so he got down then he felt as if he had already been bested theres no tax on stone from here merthin said there is now the monks have been working this quarry for hundreds of years kingsbridge cathedral is build of this stone it has never been taxed perhaps the earl forgave the tax for the sake of the church ralph said improvising but he wont do it for a bridge he just doesnt want the town to have a new bridge thats the reason for this first he sends you to bribe me then when that fails he invents a new tax merthin looked thoughtfully at ralph this was your idea wasnt it ralph was mortified how had he guessed no he said but he felt himself redden i can see from your face that it was i gave you the notion im sure when i spoke of jake chepstow importing logs from wales to avoid the earl of shaftesburys tax ralph was feeling more foolish and angry with every moment theres no connection he said stubbornly you berated me for putting my bridge before my brother but youre happy to wreck my hopes for the sake of your earl it doesnt matter whose idea it was the earl has decided to tax the stone but he doesnt have the right ben wheeler was following the conversation intently standing beside merthin with his legs apart and his hands on his hips now he said to merthin are you saying these men dont have the right to stop me thats exactly what im saying said merthin ralph could have told merthin it was a mistake to treat such a man as if he was intelligent ben now took merthins words for permission to leave he flicked his whip over his oxs shoulders the beast leaned into its wooden collar and took the strain ralph shouted angrily halt ben whipped the ox again and called hup the ox pulled harder and the cart started forward with a jerk that startled the horses joseph woodstocks mount whinnied and reared up eyes rolling joseph sawed at the reins and got the horse under control then he pulled from his saddlebag a long wooden club you keep still when youre told he said to ben he urged his horse forward and lashed out with the club ben dodged the blow grabbed the club and pulled joseph was already leaning out from his saddle the sudden jerk unbalanced him and he fell off his horse merthin cried oh no ralph knew why merthin was dismayed a manatarms could not overlook such humiliation there was no avoiding violence now but ralph himself was not sorry his brother had failed to treat the earls men with the deference they merited and now he would see the consequences ben was holding josephs club in a twohanded grip joseph leaped to his feet seeing ben brandishing the club he reached for his dagger but ben was quicker the carter must have fought in battle at some time ralph realized ben swung the club and landed a mighty blow on the top of josephs head joseph fell to the ground and lay motionless ralph roared with rage he drew his sword and ran at the carter merthin shouted no ralph stabbed ben in the chest thrusting the sword between his ribs as forcefully as he could it passed through bens thick body and came out the other side ben fell back and ralph pulled the sword out blood spurted from the carter in a fountain ralph felt a jolt of triumphant satisfaction there would be no more insolence from ben wheeler he knelt beside joseph the mans eyes stared sightlessly there was no heartbeat he was dead in a way that was good it simplified the explanations ben wheeler had murdered one of the earls men and had died for it no one would see any injustice in that least of all earl roland who had no mercy for those who defied his authority merthin did not see it the same way his face was twisted as if in pain what have you done he said incredulously ben wheeler has a twoyearold son they call him bennie the widow had better look for another husband then said ralph this time she should choose a man who knows his place it was a poor harvest there was so little sunshine in august that the grain had barely ripened by september in the village of wigleigh spirits were low there was none of the usual euphoria of harvest time the dances the drinking the sudden romances wet crops were liable to rot many villagers would go hungry before spring wulfric reaped his barley in the driving rain scything the wet stalks while gwenda followed behind binding the sheaves on the first sunny day of september they started to harvest the wheat the most valuable crop in the hope that the fine weather would last long enough to dry it at some point gwenda realized that wulfric was powered by fury the sudden loss of his entire family had enraged him he would have blamed someone for his bereavement if he could but the collapse of the bridge seemed a random event an act of evil spirits or a punishment by god so he had no outlet for his passion except work she herself was driven by love which was just as potent they were in the fields before the crack of dawn and they did not stop until it was too dark to see gwenda went to sleep with an aching back every night and woke when she heard wulfric bang the kitchen door before dawn still they lagged behind everyone else gradually she sensed a change in the attitude of the village towards her and wulfric all her life she had been looked down upon as the daughter of the disreputable joby and the women had disapproved of her even more when they realized she wanted to snatch wulfric away from annet wulfric was hard to dislike but some felt that his desire to inherit such a big landholding was greedy and impractical however people could hardly fail to be impressed by their efforts to get the harvest in a boy and a girl were trying to do the work of three men and they were getting on better than anyone had expected men began to look at wulfric with admiration and women at gwenda with sympathy in the end the villagers rallied around to help them the priest father gaspard turned a blind eye to their working on sundays when annets family had got their harvest in her father perkin and her brother rob joined gwenda on wulfrics land even gwendas mother ethna showed up as they carted the last of the sheaves to wulfrics barn there was a hint of the traditional harvest spirit with everyone singing the old songs as they walked home behind the cart annet was there in violation of the saying that you should first follow the plough if you want to dance the harvest jig she walked by wulfrics side as was her right being his acknowledged fiancee gwenda watched her from behind noting sourly how she swayed her hips tossed her head and laughed prettily at everything he said how could he be so stupid as to fall for that had he not noticed that annet had done no work on his land no day had yet been fixed for the wedding perkin was nothing if not shrewd and he would not let his daughter commit herself until the question of the inheritance was settled wulfric had proved his ability to farm the land no one would question that now his age had come to seem irrelevant the only remaining obstacle was the heriot would he be able to raise the money to pay the inheritance tax it would depend how much he got for his cash crops the harvest was poor but if the bad weather had been widespread the price of wheat would probably be high in normal circumstances a prosperous peasant family would have money saved up for the heriot but wulfrics familys savings were at the bottom of the river in kingsbridge so nothing was settled and gwenda could continue to dream that wulfric would inherit the land and somehow transfer his affections to her anything was possible as they were unloading the cart into the barn nathan reeve arrived the hunchbacked bailiff was in a state of high excitement come to the church quickly he said everybody stop what youre doing wulfric said im not leaving my crops out in the open it might rain gwenda said well just drag the cart inside whats the emergency nate the bailiff was already hurrying to the next house the new lord is arriving he said wait wulfric ran after him will you recommend that i inherit everyone stood still watching waiting for the answer nathan turned reluctantly and faced wulfric he had to look up for wulfric was taller by a foot i dont know he said slowly ive proved i can farm the land you can see that just look in the barn youve done well no question but can you pay the heriot it depends on the price of wheat annet spoke father she said gwenda wondered what was coming perkin looked hesitant annet prompted him again you remember what you promised me yes i remember perkin said at last tell nate then perkin turned to the bailiff ill guarantee the heriot if the lord will let wulfric inherit gwendas hand flew to her mouth nathan said youll pay it for him its two pounds and ten shillings if hes short ill lend him what he needs of course theyll have to be married first nathan lowered his voice and in addition perkin said something so quietly that gwenda could not hear it but she could guess what it was perkin was offering nathan a bribe probably a tenth of the tax which would be five shillings very well nathan said ill make the recommendation now get yourselves to the church quickly he ran off wulfric smiled broadly and kissed annet everyone shook his hand gwenda was heartsick her hopes were dashed annet had been too clever she had persuaded her father to lend wulfric the money he needed he would inherit his land and he would marry annet gwenda forced herself to help push the cart into the barn then she followed the happy couple as they walked through the village to the church it was all over a new lord not knowing the village or the people was unlikely to go against his bailiffs advice on a question such as this the fact that nathan had gone to the trouble of negotiating a bribe indicated his confidence it was partly her fault of course she had broken her back to make sure wulfric got his harvest in in the vain hope that somehow he would realize how much better a wife she would make than annet all summer long she had been digging her own grave she thought as she walked through the cemetery to the church door but she would do the same again she could not have borne to see him struggle alone whatever happens she thought hell always know i was the one who stuck it out with him it was small consolation most of the villagers were already in the church they had not needed much urging from nathan they were eager to be among the first to pay their respects to their new lord and curious to see what he was like young or old ugly or handsome cheerful or dyspeptic clever or stupid and most important of all cruel or kind everything about him would affect their lives for as long as he remained lord which might be years or decades if he were reasonable he could do a lot to make wigleigh a happy and prosperous village if he were a fool they would have unwise decisions and unjust rulings oppressive taxes and harsh punishments and one of his first decisions would be whether to let wulfric inherit the rumble of conversation died away and a jingle of harness was heard gwenda heard nathans voice low and obsequious then the authoritative tone of a lord a big man she thought confident but young everyone looked at the church door it flew open gwenda gasped with shock the man who strode in was no more than twenty he was well dressed in an expensive wool surcoat and armed with sword and dagger he was tall and his expression was proud he seemed pleased to be lord of wigleigh though there was a hint of insecurity in the haughty look he had wavy dark hair and a handsome face disfigured by a broken nose he was ralph fitzgerald ralphs first manorial court was held the following sunday in the interim wulfric was depressed gwenda wanted to weep every time she looked at him he walked around with his eyes cast down his broad shoulders slumped all summer he had seemed tireless working in the fields with the uncomplaining dependability of a plough horse but now he looked weary he had done all a man could do but his fate had been given into the hands of one who hated him she would have liked to say something hopeful in an attempt to cheer him up but the truth was that she shared his pessimism lords were often petty and vindictive and nothing about ralph encouraged her to believe that he would be magnanimous as a child he had been stupid and brutal she would never forget the day he had killed her dog with merthins bow and arrow there was no sign that he had improved since then he had moved into the manor house with his sidekick a beefy young squire called alan fernhill and the two of them were drinking the best wine eating the chickens and squeezing the breasts of the female servants with the carelessness typical of their class nathan reeves attitude confirmed her fears the bailiff was not bothering to negotiate an increased bribe a sure sign that he expected failure annet too seemed to have a poor view of wulfrics prospects gwenda saw an unmistakable change in her she did not toss her hair so gaily nor walk with that swish of her hips and the waterfall tinkle of her laughter was not heard so often gwenda hoped wulfric would not see the difference in annet he had enough to be gloomy about but it seemed to her that he did not stay so late at perkins house in the evenings and when he returned home he was taciturn she was surprised to learn on sunday morning that wulfric still harboured the ghost of a hope when the service ended and father gaspard gave place to lord ralph she saw that wulfrics eyes were closed and his lips were moving presumably in a prayer to his favourite saint the virgin mary all the villagers were in church of course including joby and ethna gwenda did not stand with her parents she talked to her mother sometimes but only when her father was not around joby had an angry red patch on his cheek where she had burned him with the blazing log he never met her eye she was still afraid of him but she sensed that he was now also afraid of her ralph sat on the big wooden chair staring at his serfs with the appraising look of a buyer at a cattle market the court proceedings on this day consisted of a series of announcements nathan proclaimed the arrangements for getting the harvest in from the lords fields stating on which days of the coming week different villagers would be required to perform their customary duty on the lords lands no discussion was invited clearly ralph did not intend to govern by consensus there were other details of the kind nathan dealt with every week gleaning should be completed in hundredacre by monday night so that livestock could graze the stubble from tuesday morning and autumn ploughing of long field would begin on wednesday normally there would have been minor disputes about these plans with the more argumentative villagers finding reasons to propose different arrangements but today they were all quiet waiting to get the measure of the new lord when the decision came it seemed curiously lowkey as if he were simply stating another schedule of work nathan said wulfric will not be permitted to inherit his fathers landholding because he is only sixteen gwenda looked at ralph he was trying to smother a triumphant grin his hand went to his face unconsciously she thought and he touched his broken nose nathan went on lord ralph will consider what to do with the lands and give his judgement later wulfric groaned loud enough for everyone to hear it was the decision he had been expecting but its confirmation was bitter she watched as he turned his back on the crowd in the church hiding his face and leaned against the wall as if to stop himself falling thats all for today said nathan ralph stood up he walked down the aisle slowly his eyes continually turning to the distraught wulfric what kind of lord would he be gwenda thought if his first instinct was to use his power for revenge nathan followed ralph looking at the floor he knew that an injustice had been done as they left the church a buzz of comment arose gwenda spoke to no one but watched wulfric he turned from the wall his face a picture of misery his eyes raked the crowd and found annet she looked furious gwenda waited for her to meet wulfrics eye but she seemed determined not to look at him gwenda wondered what was going through her mind annet walked towards the door head held high her father perkin and the family followed would she not even speak to wulfric the same thought must have occurred to him for he went after her annet he said wait the place went quiet annet turned wulfric stood before her well still get married wont we he said gwenda winced to hear the undignified note of pleading in his voice annet stared at him apparently about to speak but she said nothing for a long moment and wulfric spoke again lords need good serfs to farm the land perhaps ralph will give me a smaller holding you broke his nose she said harshly he will never give you anything gwenda recalled how pleased annet had been at the time to have two men fighting over her wulfric said then ill be a labourer im strong ill never lack for work but youll be poor all your life is that what youre offering me well be together just as we dreamed that day in the forest when you told me you loved me dont you remember and what would life be like for me married to a landless labourer annet demanded angrily ill tell you she lifted her arm and pointed at gwendas mother ethna standing with joby and the three little ones i would be like her grimfaced with worry and as thin as a broom handle joby was stung by this he waved the stump of his severed hand at annet you watch your mouth you haughty minx perkin stepped in front of his daughter and made a patting gesture with both hands forgive her joby shes overwrought she means no harm wulfric said no disrespect to joby but im not like him annet but you are she said youve got no land its why hes poor and its why youll be poor and your children will be hungry and your wife will be drab it was true in hard times the landless were the first to suffer dismissing your employees was the quickest way to save money all the same gwenda found it hard to believe that a woman would turn down the chance of spending her life with wulfric yet that seemed to be what annet was doing wulfric thought so too plaintively he said dont you love me any more he had lost all his dignity and he looked pathetic yet at that moment gwenda felt more passion for him than ever before i cant eat love annet said and she walked out of the church two weeks later she married billy howard gwenda went to the wedding as did everyone in the village except wulfric despite the poor harvest there was a good feast by this marriage two large landholdings were united perkins hundred acres with billys forty furthermore perkin had asked ralph to give him wulfrics familys lands if ralph agreed annets children could be heirs to almost half the village but ralph had gone to kingsbridge promising a decision as soon as he returned perkin broached a barrel of his wifes strongest ale and slaughtered a cow gwenda ate and drank heartily her future was too uncertain for her to turn down good food she played with her little sisters cathie and joanie throwing and catching a wooden ball then she took baby eric on her knee and sang to him after a while her mother sat beside her and said what will you do now in her heart gwenda was not completely reconciled with ethna they talked and ma asked concerned questions gwenda still resented her mother for forgiving joby but she answered the questions ill live in wulfrics barn as long as i can she said perhaps i can stay there indefinitely and if wulfric moves out leaves the village say i dont know for now wulfric was still working in the fields ploughing in the stubble and harrowing the fallow on the land that had been his familys and gwenda was helping him they were paid the daily labourers rate by nathan as they would have no part of the next harvest nathan was keen for them to stay otherwise the land would deteriorate rapidly they would continue until ralph announced who the new tenant would be at that point they would have to offer themselves for hire where is wulfric now ethna asked i assume hes not disposed to celebrate this wedding how does he feel about you gwenda gave her mother a candid look he tells me im the best friend hes ever had what does that mean i dont know but it doesnt mean i love you does it no said her mother no it doesnt mean that gwenda heard music aaron appletree was playing a bagpipe running up and down the scale in preparation for a tune she saw perkin coming out of his house with a pair of small drums attached to his belt the dancing was about to begin she was in no mood to dance she could have talked to the old women but they would only ask the same questions as her mother and she did not want to spend the rest of the day explaining her predicament she recalled the last village wedding and wulfric slightly drunk dancing around with great leaps embracing all the women though still favouring annet without him there was no festival for gwenda she gave eric back to her mother and drifted away her dog skip stayed behind knowing that such parties provided a banquet of dropped food and discarded scraps she went into wulfrics house half hoping he might be there but the place was empty it was a sturdy timber house of postandbeam construction but with no chimney such luxuries were for the rich she looked in both groundfloor rooms and the upstairs bedroom the place was as tidy and clean as it had been when his mother was alive but that was because he used only one room he ate and slept in the kitchen the place was cold and unhomely it was a family house with no family she went to the barn it was full of bundled hay for winter fodder and sheaves of barley and wheat waiting to be threshed she climbed the ladder to the loft and lay down in the hay after a while she fell asleep when she woke up it was dark she had no idea what time it was she stepped outside to look at the sky there was a low moon behind streaks of cloud and she calculated that it was only an hour or two after nightfall as she stood by the barn door still half asleep she heard weeping she knew instantly that it was wulfric she had heard him cry once before when he saw the bodies of his parents and his brother lying on the floor of kingsbridge cathedral he cried with great sobs that seemed torn from the depths of his chest tears came to her own eyes as she listened to his grief after a while she went into the house she could see him by the light of the moon he lay face down in the straw his back heaving as he sobbed he must have heard her lift the latch but he was too distraught to care and he did not look up gwenda knelt beside him and tentatively touched his mane of hair he made no response she rarely touched him and to stroke his hair was an unknown delight her caress seemed to soothe him for his weeping subsided after a while she dared to lie down beside him she expected him to push her away but he did not he turned his face to her eyes closed she dabbed at his cheeks with her sleeve wiping away the tears she was thrilled to be this close to him and to be permitted these small intimacies she longed to kiss his closed eyelids but she was afraid that would be a step too far and she restrained herself a few moments later she realized he was asleep she was pleased it was a sign of how comfortable he felt with her and it meant she could stay with him at least until he woke up it was autumn and the night was cold as wulfrics breathing became slower and steadier she got up stealthily and took his blanket from its hook on the wall she draped it over him he slept on undisturbed despite the chill in the air she slipped her dress over her head and lay beside him naked arranging the blanket so that it covered them both she moved close to him and laid her cheek against his chest she could hear his heartbeat and feel the breeze of his breath on the top of her head the heat of his big body warmed her in time the moon went down and the room became pitch dark she felt she could have stayed like this for ever she did not sleep she had no intention of wasting any of this precious time she savoured every moment knowing it might never happen again she touched him cautiously careful not to wake him through his light wool shift her fingertips explored the muscles of his chest and back the bones of his ribs and hips the turn of his shoulder and the knob of his elbow he moved in his sleep several times he turned and lay flat on his back whereupon she put her head on his shoulder and her arm across his flat belly later he turned away and then she moved really close fitting herself into the sshape of his body pressing her breasts against his broad back her hips into his her knees into the backs of his knees then he turned back to her flinging one arm across her shoulders and one leg over her thighs his leg was painfully heavy but she relished the ache as proof that she was not dreaming he dreamed though in the middle of the night he suddenly kissed her thrusting his tongue roughly into her mouth grasping her breast with one big hand she felt his erection as he rubbed up against her clumsily for a moment she was bewildered he could have her whatever way he wanted but it was unlike him to be anything but gentle she put her hand to his groin and grasped his penis which was sticking out through the slit in his underdrawers then just as suddenly he turned away and lay on his back breathing rhythmically and she realized that he had never woken up but had touched her in a dream he was undoubtedly dreaming of annet she realized ruefully she did not sleep but she daydreamed she imagined him introducing her to a stranger saying this is my wife gwenda she saw herself pregnant but still working in the fields and fainting in the middle of the day and in her fantasy he picked her up and carried her home and bathed her face with cold water she saw him as an old man playing with their grandchildren indulging them giving them apples and honeycombs grandchildren she thought wryly it was a big edifice to build on the strength of his allowing her to put her arm around him while he cried himself to sleep when she was thinking that it must be almost dawn and her stay in paradise might soon be over he begin to stir his breathing changed he rolled on to his back her arm fell across his chest and she left it there tucking her hand under his arm after a few moments she sensed that he was awake thinking she lay still afraid that if she spoke or moved she would break the spell eventually he rolled back towards her he put his arm around her and she felt his hand on the bare skin of her back he stroked her there but she did not know what the caress meant he seemed to be exploring surprised to find that she was naked his hand went up to her neck and all the way down to the curve of her hip at last he spoke as if afraid of being overheard he whispered she married him gwenda whispered back yes her love is weak true love is never weak his hand remained on her hip maddeningly close to the places where she wanted him to touch her he said will i ever stop loving her gwenda took his hand and moved it she has two breasts like these she said still whispering she did not know why she did it intuition was guiding her and she followed it for good or ill he groaned and she felt his hand close gently over one then the other and she has hair down here like this she said moving his hand again his breathing became faster leaving his hand there she explored his body beneath his wool shift and found that he had an erection she grasped it and said her hand feels just like this he began to move his hips rhythmically she suddenly felt afraid that the act would be over before it was fully consummated she did not want that it was all or nothing now she pushed him gently on to his back then quickly raised herself and straddled him inside shes hot and wet she said and she lowered herself on to him although she had done it before it had not been anything like this she felt filled up and yet she wanted more she moved down against the thrust of his hips then up as he withdrew she lowered her face to his and kissed his bearded mouth he held her head in his hands and kissed her back she loves you gwenda whispered to him she loves you so much he cried out with passion and she was rocked up and down riding his hips like a wild pony until at last she felt him come inside her and he gave one last cry then said oh i love you too i love you annet wulfric went back to sleep but gwenda lay awake she was too excited to sleep she had won his love she knew it it hardly mattered that she had had to half pretend to be annet he had made love to her with such hunger and had kissed her afterwards with such tenderness and gratitude that she felt he was hers for ever when her heart stopped racing and her mind calmed down she thought about his inheritance she was not willing to give up on it especially now as dawn broke outside she racked her brains for some way to save it when wulfric woke up she said im going to kingsbridge he was startled why to find out whether theres some way you can still inherit how i dont know but ralph hasnt given the land to anyone else yet so theres still a chance and you deserve it youve worked so hard and suffered so much what will you do ill see my brother philemon he understands these things better than we do hell know what we need to do wulfric looked at her strangely she said what is it he said you really love me dont you she smiled full of happiness and said lets do it again shall we on the following morning she was at kingsbridge priory sitting on the stone bench by the vegetable garden waiting for philemon during the long walk from wigleigh she had gone over every second of sunday night in her mind relishing the physical pleasures puzzling over the words spoken wulfric still had not said that he loved her but he had said you really love me and he had seemed pleased that she loved him albeit a bit bewildered by the strength of her passion she longed to win back his birthright she yearned for it almost as much as she had yearned for him she wanted it for both of them even if he were a landless labourer like her father she would marry him given the chance but she wanted better for them both and she was determined to get it when philemon came out of the priory into the garden to greet her she saw immediately that he was wearing the robes of a novice monk holger she said using his real name in her shock youre a novice what youve always wanted he smiled proudly and benignly overlooked the use of his old name it was one of godwyns first acts as prior he said he is a wonderful man its such an honour to serve him he sat beside her on the bench it was a mild autumn day cloudy but dry and how are you getting on with your lessons slowly its hard to learn to read and write when youre grown up he grimaced the small boys progress faster than i do but i can copy out the lords prayer in latin she envied him she could not even write her name thats wonderful she said her brother was on his way to achieving his lifes dream and becoming a monk perhaps the status of novice might ameliorate the feelings of worthlessness that she felt sure accounted for his sometimes being sly and deceitful but what about you he said why have you come to kingsbridge did you know that ralph fitzgerald has become lord of wigleigh yes hes here in town staying at the bell living it up he has refused to let wulfric inherit his fathers land she told philemon the story i want to know whether the decision can be contested philemon shook his head the short answer is no wulfric could appeal to the earl of shiring of course asking him to overturn ralphs decision but the earl wont intervene unless he has a personal stake even if he thinks the decision unjust which it obviously is he wont undermine the authority of a new appointee but whats your interest i thought wulfric was going to marry annet when ralph announced his decision annet jilted wulfric and married billy howard and now you have a chance with wulfric i think so she felt herself blush how do you know he asked shrewdly i took advantage of him she confessed when he was distraught over the wedding i went to his bed dont worry we who are born poor have to use cunning to get what we want scruples are for the privileged she did not really like to hear him talk that way sometimes he seemed to think that any behaviour could be excused by their difficult childhood but she was too disappointed to worry about that is there really nothing i can do oh i didnt say that it cant be contested i said but ralph might be talked round not by me im sure i dont know why dont you go and see godwyns cousin caris youve been friends with her since you were girls shell help you if she can and shes close to ralphs brother merthin perhaps he can think of something any hope was better than none gwenda stood up to go ill see her right away she leaned forward to kiss her brother goodbye then realized that he was forbidden such contact now instead she clasped his hand which seemed peculiar ill pray for you he said cariss house was opposite the priory gates when gwenda went in there was no one in the dining hall but she heard voices in the parlour where edmund usually did business the cook tutty told her caris was with her father gwenda sat down to wait tapping her foot impatiently but after a few minutes the door opened edmund came out accompanied by a man she did not recognize he was tall and had flared nostrils that gave his face a supercilious look he wore the black robe of a priest but no cross or other sacred symbol edmund nodded amiably to gwenda and said to the stranger ill walk you back to the priory caris followed the two men out of the parlour and embraced gwenda who was that man gwenda asked as soon as he had left his name is gregory longfellow hes the lawyer hired by prior godwyn hired for what earl roland has stopped the priory taking stone from its quarry hes trying to charge a penny a cartload godwyn is going to appeal to the king are you involved gregory thinks we must argue that the town will be unable to pay its taxes without a bridge thats the best way to persuade the king he says so my father will go with godwyn to testify at the royal court will you go too yes but tell me why youre here i lay with wulfric caris smiled really at last how was it it was wonderful i lay beside him all night while he slept then when he woke up i persuaded him tell me more i want all the details gwenda told caris the story at the end even though she was impatient to get on to the real purpose of her visit she said but something tells me you have news of the same kind caris nodded i lay with merthin i told him i didnt want to get married and he went off to see that fat sow bessie bell and i got upset at the thought of her sticking out her big tits at him then he came back and i was so pleased i just had to do it with him did you like it i loved it its the best thing ever and it gets better we do it whenever we get the chance what if you get pregnant im not even thinking about that i dont care if i die one time she lowered her voice one time we bathed in a pool in the forest and afterwards he licked me down there oh disgusting what was it like nice he liked it too you didnt do the same to him yes but did he caris nodded in my mouth wasnt it foul caris shrugged it tastes funny but its so exciting to feel that happen and he enjoyed it so much gwenda was shocked but intrigued perhaps she should do that to wulfric she knew a place where they could bathe a stream in the forest far from any roads caris said but you didnt come all this way just to tell me about wulfric no its about his inheritance gwenda explained ralphs decision philemon thought perhaps merthin could persuade ralph to change his mind caris shook her head pessimistically i doubt it theyve quarrelled oh no it was ralph who stopped the carts leaving the quarry unfortunately merthin was there at the time there was a fight ben wheeler killed one of the earls ruffians and ralph killed ben gwenda gasped but lib wheeler has a twoyearold and now little bennie has no father gwenda was dismayed for herself as well as for lib so a brothers influence wont help lets go and see merthin anyway hes working on leper island today they left the house and walked down the main street to the riverside gwenda was discouraged everyone believed her chances were slender it was so unfair they got ian boatman to row them across to the island caris explained that the old bridge was to be replaced by two new ones which would use the island as a stepping stone they found merthin with his boy assistant fourteenyearold jimmie laying out the abutments of the new bridge his measuring stick was an iron pole more than twice the height of a man and he was hammering pointed stakes into the rocky ground to mark where the foundations must be dug gwenda watched the way caris and merthin kissed it was different there was a cosy relish in one anothers bodies that seemed new it matched how gwenda herself felt about wulfric his body was not just desirable it was hers to enjoy it seemed to belong to her the way her own body did she and caris watched while merthin finished what he was doing tying a length of twine between two stakes then he told jimmie to pack up the tools gwenda said i suppose theres not much you can do without stone there are some preparations we can make but ive sent all the masons to the quarry theyre dressing the stones there instead of here on site were building a stockpile so if you win your case in the royal court you can start building right away i hope so it depends on how long the case takes and the weather we cant build in deepest winter in case the frost freezes the mortar its october already we normally stop around the middle of november he looked up at the sky we might have a bit longer this year rain clouds keep the earth warm gwenda told him what she wanted i wish i could help you merthin said wulfric is a decent man and that fight was entirely ralphs fault but ive quarrelled with my brother before asking him a favour id have to make friends and i cant forgive him for killing ben wheeler it was the third negative response in a row gwenda thought glumly perhaps this was a foolish errand caris said you may have to do this on your own yes i will gwenda said decisively it was time to stop asking for other peoples help and start relying on herself the way she had all her life ralph is here in town isnt he yes merthin said he came to tell our parents the good news about his promotion theyre the only people in the county who are celebrating but hes not staying with them hes too grand for that now hes at the bell what would be the best way to persuade him merthin thought for a few moments ralph feels our fathers humiliation a knight reduced to the status of a pensioner of the priory hell do anything that seems to enhance his social position gwenda thought about that as ian boatman rowed them all back to the city how could she present her request as a way for ralph to raise his standing it was midday as she walked up the main street with the others merthin was going to cariss house for dinner and caris invited gwenda to join them but she was impatient to see ralph and she went on to the bell a potboy told her ralph was upstairs in the best room most lodgers slept in a communal dormitory ralph was emphasizing his new position by taking an entire room paid for gwenda thought sourly out of the meagre harvests of wigleigh peasants she knocked at the door and went in ralph was there with his squire alan fernhill a boy of about eighteen with big shoulders and a small head on the table between them stood a jug of ale a loaf and a joint of hot beef with a wisp of steam coming from it they were finishing their dinner and looked thoroughly contented with their lot in life gwenda thought she hoped they were not too drunk men in that state could not talk to women all they could do was make ribald remarks and laugh helplessly at each others wit ralph peered at her the room was not well lit youre one of my serfs arent you no my lord but id like to be im gwenda and my father is joby a landless labourer and what are you doing so far from the village its not market day she moved a step farther into the room so that she could see his face more clearly sir i come to plead for wulfric son of the late samuel i know that he behaved disrespectfully to you once but since then he has suffered the torments of job his parents and brother were killed when the bridge collapsed all the familys money was lost and now his fiancee has married someone else i hope you might feel that god has punished him harshly for the wrong he did you and it is time for you to show mercy remembering what merthin had advised she added the mercy characteristic of the true nobleman he belched fruitily and sighed what do you care whether wulfric inherits i love him my lord now that he has been rejected by annet i hope he may marry me with your gracious permission of course come closer he said she moved into the centre of the room and stood in front of him his eyes roamed all over her body youre not a pretty girl he said but theres something about you are you a virgin lord i i obviously not he laughed have you lain with wulfric yet no liar he grinned enjoying himself well now what if i let wulfric have his fathers lands after all perhaps i should what then you would be called a true nobleman by wigleigh and all the world the world wont care but will you be grateful to me gwenda had a horrible feeling that she knew where this was leading of course deeply grateful and how would you show it she backed towards the door any way i could without shame would you take off your dress her heart sank no lord ah not so grateful then she reached the door and touched the handle but she did not go out what what are you asking me lord i want to see you naked then ill decide here yes she looked at alan in front of him yes it did not seem much to show herself to these two men not by comparison with the prize winning wulfrics inheritance back swiftly she undid her belt and pulled her dress over her head she held the dress in her hand keeping the other hand on the doorknob and stared defiantly at ralph he looked greedily at her body then glanced over at his companion with a grin of triumph and gwenda saw that this was about showing his power as much as anything else ralph said an ugly cow but nice udders eh alan alan replied i wouldnt climb over you to get at her ralph laughed gwenda said now will you grant my petition ralph put his hand to his crotch and began to stroke himself lie with me he said on that bed no come on youve already done it with wulfric youre no virgin no think of the lands ninety acres all that his father had she thought if she agreed wulfric would have his hearts desire and the two of them could look forward to a life of plenty if she continued to refuse wulfric would be a landless labourer like joby struggling all his life to make enough to feed his children and often failing still the thought revolted her ralph was an unpleasant man petty and vengeful a bully so different from his brother his being tall and handsome made little difference it would be disgusting to lie with someone she disliked so much the fact that she had done it with wulfric only yesterday made the prospect of sex with ralph even more repellent alter her night of happy intimacy with wulfric it would be a terrible betrayal to do the same with another man dont be a fool she told herself for the sake of five minutes of unpleasantness will you condemn yourself to a life of hardship she thought of her mother and the babies that had died she remembered the stealing she and philemon had been forced to do was it not better to prostitute herself to ralph one time for just a few moments than to condemn her unborn children to a life of poverty ralph remained quiet while she vacillated he was wise any words from him would only have strengthened her revulsion silence served him better please gwenda said at last dont make me do this ah he said that tells me youre willing its a sin she said desperately she did not often talk about sin but she thought there was a chance it might move him a sin for you to ask and a sin for me to agree sins can be forgiven what would your brother think of you that gave him pause for a moment he seemed to hesitate please she said just let wulfric inherit his face hardened again ive made my decision im not going to reverse it unless you can persuade me and just saying please wont work his eyes glistened with desire and he was breathing a little faster his mouth open his lips moist behind his beard she dropped her dress to the floor and walked to the bed kneel on the mattress ralph said no facing away from me she did as he said better view from this side he said and alan laughed loudly gwenda wondered if alan was going to stay to watch but then ralph said leave us alone a moment later the door slammed ralph knelt on the bed behind gwenda she closed her eyes and prayed for forgiveness she felt his thick fingers exploring her she heard him spit then he rubbed a wet hand on her a moment later he entered her she groaned with shame ralph misinterpreted the sound and said you like that eh she wondered how long this would take he began to move rhythmically to ease the discomfort she moved with him and he laughed triumphantly thinking he had excited her lust her greatest rear was that this would sour her entire experience of lovemaking in future when she lay with wulfric would she think of this moment and then to her horror a warm flush of pleasure began to spread through her loins she felt her face redden in shame despite her profound repugnance her body betrayed her and moisture flooded inside her easing the friction of his thrusts he sensed the change and moved faster disgusted with herself she ceased to match his rhythm but he grabbed her hips pushing and pulling alternately and she was helpless to resist she remembered with dismay that her body had undermined her in the same way with alwyn in the forest then as now she had wanted her body to be a wooden statue numb and impassive both times it had responded against her will she had killed alwyn with his own knife she could not do the same to ralph even if she had wanted to because he was behind her she could not see him and she had little control over her body she was in his hands she was glad when she sensed that he was approaching the climax soon it would be over she felt an answering pressure in her own loins she tried to make her body limp and her mind blank it would be too humiliating if she too reached a climax she felt ralph ejaculate inside her and she shuddered not with pleasure but with loathing he sighed with satisfaction withdrew from her and lay flat on the bed she got up and quickly pulled on her dress that was better than i expected ralph said as if he were paying her some kind of polite compliment she went out and slammed the door behind her on the following sunday before church nathan reeve came to wulfrics house gwenda and wulfric were sitting in the kitchen they had had breakfast and swept the room and now wulfric was sewing a pair of leather trousers while gwenda wove a belt from cords they sat close to the window for better light it was raining again gwenda was pretending to live in the barn so that father gaspard would not be offended but she spent every night with wulfric he had not mentioned marriage which disappointed her however they were living more or less as man and wife in the way that people often did when they intended to marry as soon as they got around to the formalities the nobility and the gentry were permitted no such laxity but it was routinely overlooked among the peasantry as she had feared she felt strange making love to him the more she tried to put ralph out of her mind the more he intruded fortunately wulfric never noticed her mood he made love to her with such enthusiasm and joy that it almost swamped her guilty conscience but not quite and she had the consolation of knowing that he would inherit his familys lands after all that made up for everything she could not tell him this of course for then she would have needed to explain what had changed ralphs mind she had told him about her conversations with philemon caris and merthin and had given him a partial version of her encounter with ralph saying only that he had promised to reconsider so wulfric was hopeful rather than triumphant come to the manor house right away both of you nathan said putting his wet head around the door gwenda said what does the lord ralph want will you refuse to go if the proposed topic of discussion fails to interest you nathan said sarcastically dont ask stupid questions just come she put a blanket over her head to walk to the big house she still did not have a cloak wulfric had money from the sale of his crops and could have bought her a cloak but he was saving for the heriot they hurried through the rain to the manor house it was a small version of a noblemans castle having a great hall with a long dining table plus a small upper storey called the solar for the lords private chamber now it bore the signs of a house occupied by men without wives the walls were bare of tapestries the straw on the floor gave up a pungent smell the dogs snarled at the newcomers and a mouse nibbled a crust on the sideboard ralph sat at the head of the table on his right was alan who gave gwenda a smirk she did her best to ignore a minute later nathan came in behind him followed fat sly perkin rubbing his hands and bowing obsequiously his hair so oily it looked like a leather skullcap with perkin was his new soninlaw billy howard billy shot a triumphant glance at wulfric i ve got your girl he was thinking and now im going to get your land he had a shock coming nathan sat on ralphs left the rest of them remained standing gwenda had been looking forward to this moment it was the reward tor her sacrifice she eagerly anticipated the expression on wulfrics face when he learned that he had inherited after all he would be overjoyed and she would too their future would be secure or at least as secure as was possible in a world of unpredictable weather and oscillating grain prices ralph said three weeks ago i said that wulfric son of samuel could not inherit his fathers land because hes too young he spoke slowly and ponderously he loves this gwenda thought sitting at the head of the table pronouncing judgement everyone hanging on his words wulfric has been working the land since then while i have considered who should succeed old samuel he paused then said but ive come to doubt my rejection of wulfric perkin started he had been confident of success and this shocked him billy howard said whats this i thought nate then perkin nudged him and he shut up gwenda could not restrain a smile of triumph ralph said despite his youth wulfric has shown himself capable perkin glared at nathan gwenda guessed that nathan had promised the land to perkin perhaps the bribe had already been paid nathan was just as shocked as perkin he stared openmouthed at ralph for a moment turned to perkin with a baffled expression then looked suspiciously at gwenda ralph added in this he has been well supported by gwenda whose strength and loyalty have impressed me nathan stared at her speculatively she could tell what he was thinking he realized she had intervened and he was wondering how she had managed to change ralphs mind he might even be guessing the truth she did not care if he did so long as wulfric remained ignorant suddenly nathan seemed to make a decision he stood up and leaned his twisted torso across the table he spoke to ralph quietly gwenda could not hear what he said really ralph said in a normal voice how much nathan turned to perkin and murmured something to him gwenda said wait a minute whats all this whispering perkin looked angry but said reluctantly yes all right all right to what gwenda said fearfully double said nathan perkin nodded gwenda had a feeling of dread nathan said aloud perkin offers to pay double the normal heriot which would be five pounds ralph said that makes a difference gwenda cried no wulfric spoke for the first time the heriot is laid down by custom recorded in the manor rolls he said in his slow boyman voice its not for negotiation nathan said quickly heriots can change though theyre not in the domesday book ralph said are you two lawyers if not shut up the heriot is two pounds and ten shillings any other money that changes hands is none of your business gwenda realized with horror that ralph was on the point of reneging on their deal she spoke in a low accusing voice slow but clear you made me a promise why would i do something like that ralph said it was the one question she could not answer because i pleaded with you she replied feebly and i said i would think again but i made no promise she was powerless to make him keep his word she wanted to kill him yes you did she said lords dont bargain with peasants she stared at him lost for words it had all been for nothing the long walk to kingsbridge the humiliation of appearing naked in front of him and alan the shameful act she had performed on ralphs bed she had betrayed wulfric and he still would not inherit she pointed a finger at ralph and said bitterly god damn you to hell ralph fitzgerald he went pale the curse of a genuinely wronged woman was known to be powerful watch what you say he replied we have a punishment for a witch who casts spells gwenda drew back no woman could take such a threat lightly the accusation of witchcraft was easy to make and hard to refute still she could not resist saying those who escape justice in this life will find it in the next ralph ignored that and turned to perkin where is the money perkin had not got rich by telling people where he kept his cash ill letch it right away lord he said wulfric said come on gwenda theres no mercy for us here gwenda fought back tears anger had been replaced by grief they had lost the battle after all they had done she turned away head lowered to hide her emotions perkin said wait wulfric you need employment and i need help work for me ill pay you a penny a day wulfric flushed with the shame of being offered a job as a labourer on lands his family had owned perkin added gwenda too youre both young and willing he did not intend to be malicious gwenda saw he was singleminded in the pursuit of his own interests and he was eager to hire two strong young labourers to help him farm his amalgamated holding he did not care or perhaps did not even know that for wulfric this was the final humiliation perkin said thats a shilling a week between you youll have plenty wulfric looked bitter work for a wage on lands that my family has owned for decades he said never he turned away and left the house gwenda followed thinking what are we going to do now westminster hall was huge bigger than the inside of some cathedrals it was dauntingly long and wide and its distant ceiling was supported by a double row of tall pillars it was the most important room in the palace of westminster earl roland was perfectly at home here godwyn thought resentfully the earl and his son william swaggered about in their fashionable clothes with one leg of their hose red and the other black every earl knew all the others and most of the barons too and they clapped their friends on the shoulders mocked each other facetiously and hooted with laughter at their own humour godwyn wanted to remind them that the courts held in this room had the power to sentence any one of them to death even if they were the nobility he and his entourage were quiet speaking only to one another and then in hushed tones this was not out of reverence he had to admit but nervousness godwyn edmund and caris were ill at ease here none of them had been to london before the only person they knew was buenaventura caroli and he was out of town they did not know their way around their clothes looked oldfashioned and the money they had brought which they had thought would be plenty was running out edmund was not cowed by anything and caris seemed distracted as if she had something more important on her mind though it hardly seemed possible but godwyn was tormented by anxiety he was a newly elected prior challenging one of the greatest noblemen in the land the issue was the future of the town without the bridge kingsbridge would die the priory currently the beating heart of one of englands great cities would dwindle to a lonely outpost in a small village where a few monks did their devotions in the echoing emptiness of a crumbling cathedral godwyn had not fought to be prior only to see his prize turn to dust with so much at stake he wanted to be in control of events confident that he was cleverer than almost everyone else as he was in kingsbridge but here he felt the opposite and the insecurity drove him to distraction his consolation was gregory longfellow a friend of godwyns from university days gregory had a devious mind well suited to the law the royal court was familiar to him aggressive and cocksure he had guided godwyn through the legal maze he had presented the priorys petition to parliament as he had presented many petitions before it was not debated by parliament of course but passed to the kings council which was overseen by the chancellor the chancellors team of lawyers all of them friends or acquaintances of gregorys might have referred the matter to the kings bench the court that dealt with disputes in which the king had an interest but again as gregory had foreseen they had decided this was too petty to bother the king with and had instead sent the case to the common bench or court of common pleas all this had taken a full six weeks it was late november and the weather was getting colder the building season was nearly over today at last they stood before sir wilbert wheatfield an experienced judge who was said to be liked by the king sir wilbert was the younger son of a northern baron his elder brother had inherited the title and the estate and wilbert had trained as a priest studied law come to london and found favour at the royal court his inclination would be to side with an earl against a monk gregory warned but he would put the kings interests ahead of all else the judge sat on a raised bench against the east wall of the palace between windows that looked out on to the green yard and the river thames in front of him were two clerks at a long table there were no seats for the litigants sir the earl of shiring has sent armed men to blockade the quarry owned by kingsbridge priory gregory said as soon as sir wilbert looked at him his voice quivered with simulated indignation the quarry which is within the earldom was granted to the priory by king henry i some two hundred years ago a copy of the charter has been lodged with the court sir wilbert had a pink face and white hair and looked handsome until he spoke when he showed rotten teeth i have the charter before me he said earl roland spoke without waiting to be invited the monks were given the quarry so that they could build their cathedral he said speaking in a boredsounding drawl gregory said quickly but the charter does not restrict their use of it to any one purpose now they want to build a bridge roland said to replace the bridge that collapsed at whitsun a bridge that itself was built many hundreds of years ago with timber that was a gift of the king gregory spoke as if he was outraged by the earls every word they dont need permission to rebuild a preexisting bridge sir wilbert said briskly and the charter does say that the king wishes to encourage the building of the cathedral but it does not say they have to relinquish their rights when the church is finished nor that they are forbidden to use the stone for any other purpose godwyn was heartened the judge seemed to have seen the priorys side of the argument immediately gregory made a spreading gesture with his hands palms up as if the judge had said something blindingly obvious and indeed sir that has been the understanding of priors of kingsbridge and earls of shiring for three centuries that was not quite right godwyn knew there had been disputes about the charter in the time of prior philip but sir wilbert did not know that nor did earl roland rolands attitude was haughty as if it was beneath his dignity to squabble with lawyers but this was deceptive he had a firm grip on the argument the charter does not say the priory may escape tax gregory said why then has the earl never imposed such a tax until now roland had his answer ready former earls forgave the tax as their contribution to the cathedral it was a pious act but no piety compels me to subsidize a bridge yet the monks refuse to pay suddenly the argument had swung the other way how fast it moved godwyn thought not like arguments in the monks chapter house which could go on for hours gregory said and the earls men prevent movement of stones from the quarry and have killed a poor carter sir wilbert said then the dispute had better be resolved as soon as possible what does the priory say to the argument that the earl has the right to tax consignments passing through his earldom using roads and bridges and fords that belong to him regardless of whether he has actually enforced this right in the past or not that since the stones are not passing through his lands but originate there the tax is tantamount to charging the monks for the stones contrary to the charter of henry i godwyn saw with dismay that the judge seemed unimpressed by this however gregory had not finished and that the kings who gave kingsbridge a bridge and a quarry did so for a good reason they wanted the priory and the town to prosper and the towns alderman is here to testify that kingsbridge cannot prosper without a bridge edmund stepped forward with his unkempt hair and provincial clothes he looked like a country bumpkin by contrast with the gorgeously robed noblemen around but unlike godwyn he did not appear intimidated im a wool merchant sir he said without the bridge theres no trade and without trade kingsbridge will pay no taxes to the king sir wilbert leaned forward how much did the town yield in the last tenth he was speaking of the tax imposed by parliament from time to time of onetenth or onefifteenth of each individuals movable property no one ever paid a tenth of course everyone understated their wealth so the amount payable by each town or county had become fixed and the burden was shared out more or less fairly with poor men and lowly peasants paying nothing at all edmund had been expecting this question and he replied promptly one thousand and eleven pounds sir and the effect of the loss of the bridge today i estimate that a tenth would raise less than three hundred pounds but our citizens are continuing to trade in the hope that the bridge will be rebuilt if that hope were to be dashed in this court today the annual fleece fair and the weekly market would almost disappear and the yield from a tenth would fall below fifty pounds next to nothing in the scale of the kings needs the judge said he did not say what they all knew that the king was in dire need of money because in the last few weeks he had declared war on france roland was needled is this hearing about the kings finances he said scornfully sir wilbert was not to be browbeaten even by an earl this is the kings court he said mildly what would you expect justice roland replied and you shall have it the judge implied but did not say whether you like it or not edmund wooler where is the nearest alternative market shiring ah so the business you lose will move to the earls town no sir some will move but much will vanish many kingsbridge traders will be unable to get to shiring the judge turned to roland how much does a tenth yield from shiring roland conferred briefly with his secretary father jerome then said six hundred and twenty pounds and with the increased trade at shiring market could you pay one thousand six hundred and twenty pounds of course not the earl said angrily the judge continued in his mild tone then your opposition to this bridge would cost the king dear i have my rights roland said sulkily and the king has his is there any way you could compensate the royal treasury for the loss of a thousand pounds every year or so by fighting alongside him in france which wool merchants and monks will never do indeed said sir wilbert but your knights will require payment this is outrageous said roland he knew he was losing the argument godwyn tried not to look triumphant the judge did not like his proceedings being called outrageous he fixed roland with a look when you sent your menatarms to blockade the priorys quarry i feel sure you did not intend to damage the kings interests he paused expectantly roland sensed a trap but there was only one answer he could give certainly not now that it has been made clear to the court and to you how the building of the new bridge serves the kings purposes as well as those of kingsbridge priory and the town i imagine you will agree to the reopening of the quarry godwyn realized sir wilbert was being clever he was forcing roland to consent to his ruling making it difficult for him to appeal personally to the king later alter a long pause roland said yes and to the transport of stones through your territory without tax roland knew he had lost there was fury in his voice as he said again yes so ordered the judge said next case it was a great victory but it had probably come too late november had turned into december building normally stopped about now because of the rainy weather the frosts would come late this year but even so there were at most a couple of weeks left merthin had hundreds of stones stockpiled at the quarry cut and shaped and ready to be laid however it would take months to cart them all to kingsbridge although earl roland had lost the court case he had almost certainly succeeded in delaying the building of the bridge by a year caris returned to kingsbridge with edmund and godwyn in sombre mood reining in on the suburban side of the river she saw that merthin had already constructed his coffer dams in each of the channels that ran either side of leper island the ends of wooden boards stuck a couple of feet above the surface in a big circle she recalled merthin explaining in the guild hall how he planned to drive stakes into the river bed in a double ring then fill the gap between the rings with clay mortar to make a watertight seal the water inside the coffer could then be taken out so that the builders could lay a foundation on the river bed one of merthins workmen harold mason was on the ferry as they crossed the river and caris asked him if the coffer dams had been drained not yet he said the master wants to leave it until were ready to start building caris noticed with pleasure that merthin was now called the master despite his youth but why she said i thought we wanted everything ready for a quick start he says the force of the river puts more strain on the dam when theres no water inside caris wondered how merthin knew such things he had learned the basics from his first master joachim elfrics father he always talked a lot to strangers who came to town especially men who had seen tall buildings in florence and rome and he had read all about the construction of the cathedral in timothys book but he seemed also to have remarkable intuition about these matters she would never have guessed that an empty dam would be weaker than a full one although they were subdued as they entered the town they wanted to tell merthin the good news right away and find out what if anything he could get done before the end of the season pausing only to entrust their horses to stable boys they went in search of him they found him in the masons loft high in the northwest tower of the cathedral working by the light of several oil lamps scratching a design for a parapet on the tracing floor he looked up from his drawing saw their faces and grinned widely we won he said we won said edmund thanks to gregory longfellow godwyn added he cost a lot of money but he was worth it merthin embraced both men his quarrel with godwyn forgotten at least for now he kissed caris tenderly i missed you he murmured its been eight weeks i felt as if you were never coming back she made no reply she had something momentous to say to him but she wanted privacy her father did not notice her reticence well merthin you can start building right away good godwyn said you can begin carting stones from the quarry tomorrow but i suppose its too late to get much building done before the winter frosts ive been thinking about that merthin said he glanced at the windows it was midafternoon the december day already darkening to evening there might be a way to do it edmund was immediately enthusiastic well out with it lad whats your idea merthin turned to the prior would you grant an indulgence to volunteers who bring stones from the quarry an indulgence was a special act of forgiveness of sins like a gift of money it could either pay for past debts or stand in credit for future liabilities i could godwyn said what have you got in mind merthin turned to edmund how many people in kingsbridge own a cart let me think edmund said frowning every substantial trader has one so it must come to a couple of hundred at least suppose we were to go around the town tonight and ask every one of them to drive to the quarry tomorrow and pick up stones edmund stared at merthin and a grin slowly spread across his face now he said delightedly thats an idea well tell each one that everybody else is going merthin went on it will be like a holiday their families can go along and they can take food and beer if each one brings back a cartload of stone or rubble in two days time well have enough to build the piers of the bridge that was brilliant caris thought wonderingly it was typical of him to think of something no one else could have imagined but would it work what about the weather said godwyn the rain has been a curse for the peasants but its held off the deep cold weve a week or two yet i think edmund was excited stomping up and down the loft with his lopsided gait but if you can build the piers in the next few days by the end of next year we can finish the bulk of the work could we use the bridge the following year no but wait we could put a temporary wooden roadbed on top in time for the fleece fair so we would have a usable bridge by the year after next and miss only one fleece fair wed have to finish the stone roadbed after the fleece fair then it would harden in time to be used normally in the third year damn it weve got to do it edmund said excitedly godwyn said cautiously you have yet to empty the water out of the coffer dams merthin nodded thats hard work in my original plan i allowed two weeks for it but ive got an idea about that too however lets get the carts organized first they all moved to the door animated with enthusiasm as godwyn and edmund started down the narrow spiral staircase caris caug ht merthin by the sleeve and held him back he thought she wanted to kiss and he put his arms around her but she pushed him away ive got some news she said more im pregnant she watched his face he was startled at first and his redbrown eyebrows rose then he blinked tilted his head to one side and shrugged as if to say nothing surprising about that he grinned at first ruefully then with unmixed happiness at the end he was beaming thats wonderful he said she hated him momentarily for his stupidity no its not why not because i dont want to spend my life as a slave to anyone even if it is my own child a slave is every mother a slave yes how could you possibly not know that i feel that way he looked baffled and hurt and a part of her wanted to back off but she had been nursing her anger too long i did know i suppose he said but then you lay with me so i thought he hesitated you must have known it might happen would happen sooner or later of course i knew but i acted as if i didnt yes i can understand that oh stop being so understanding youre such a weakling his face froze after a long pause he said all right then ill stop being so understanding just give me the information whats your plan i dont have a plan you fool i just know i dont want to have a baby so you dont have a plan and im a fool and a weakling do you want anything from me no then what are you doing here dont be so logical he sighed im going to stop trying to be what you tell me to be because you make no sense he went around the room putting out the lamps im glad were having a baby and id like us to be married and look after the child together assuming this mood youre in is only temporary he put his drawing implements in a leather bag and slung it over his shoulder but for now youre so cantankerous that id rather not speak to you at all and besides i have work to do he went to the door then paused on the other hand we could kiss and make up go away she yelled he ducked through the low door and disappeared into the stairwell caris began to cry merthin had no idea whether the people of kingsbridge would rally to the cause they all had work and worries of their own would they see the communal effort to build the bridge as being more important he was not sure he knew from his reading of timothys book that at moments of crisis prior philip had often prevailed by calling on the ordinary people to make a massive effort but merthin was not philip he had no right to lead people he was just a carpenter they made a list of cart owners and divided it up by streets edmund rounded up ten leading citizens and godwyn picked ten senior monks and they went around in pairs merthin was teamed with brother thomas the first door they knocked on was lib wheelers she was continuing bens business with hired labour you can have both my carts she said and the men to drive them anything to give that damned earl a poke in the eye but their second call brought a refusal im not well said peter dyer who had a cart for delivering the bales of woollen cloth he dyed yellow and green and pink i cant travel he looked perfectly all right merthin thought he was probably scared of a confrontation with the earls men there would be no fight merthin felt sure but he could understand the fear what if all the citizens felt that way their third call was on harold mason a young builder who was hoping for several years of work building the bridge he agreed immediately jake chepstow will come too he said ill make sure of that harold and jake were pals after that almost everybody said yes they did not need to be told how important the bridge was everyone who had a cart was a trader obviously and they had the additional incentive of a pardon for their sins but the most important factor seemed to be the promise of an unexpected holiday most people said is soandso going when they heard that their friends and neighbours had volunteered they did not want to be left out when they had made all their calls merthin left thomas and went down to the ferry they had to take the carts across overnight to be ready to leave at sunrise the ferry carried only one cart at a time two hundred carts would take several hours that was why they needed a bridge of course an ox was revolving the great wheel and carts were already crossing the river on the other side the owners turned their beasts out to graze in the pasture then came back on the ferry and went to bed edmund had got john constable and half a dozen of his deputies to spend the night in newtown guarding carts and beasts the ferry was still working when merthin went to bed an hour or so after midnight he lay thinking about caris for a while her quirkiness and unpredictability were part of what he loved but sometimes she was impossible she was the cleverest individual in kingsbridge but also hopelessly irrational at times most of all though he hated to be called weak he was not sure he would ever forgive caris for that jibe earl roland had humiliated him ten years ago by saying he could not be a squire and was fit only to be apprenticed to a carpenter but he was not weak he had defied elfrics tyranny he had routed prior godwyn over the bridge design and he was about to save the entire town i might be small he thought but by god im strong still he did not know what to do about caris and he fell asleep worrying edmund woke him at first light by then almost every cart in kingsbridge was on the far side of the river in a straggly line that led through the suburb of newtown and half a mile into the forest it took a couple more hours to ferry the people over the excitement of organizing what was effectively a pilgrimage diverted merthins mind from the problem of caris and her pregnancy soon the pasture on the far side was a scene of goodnatured chaos as dozens of people caught their horses and oxen led them to their carts and backed them into the traces dick brewer brought over a huge barrel of ale and gave it away to encourage the expedition he said with mixed results some people were so encouraged they had to lie down a crowd of spectators gathered on the city side of the river watching as the line of carts at last began to move off a great cheer went up but stones were only half the problem merthin turned his attention to the next challenge if he was to begin laying stones as soon as they arrived from the quarry he had to empty the coffer dams in two days instead of two weeks as the cheering died down he raised his voice and addressed the crowd this was the moment to catch their interest when the excitement was fading and they were beginning to wonder what to do next i need the strongest men left in town he shouted they went quiet intrigued are there any strong men in kingsbridge this was partly a comeon the work would be heavy but asking only for strong people also threw down a challenge that the young men would find hard to resist before the carts get back from the quarry tomorrow night we have to empty the water out of the coffer dams it will be the hardest work youve ever done so no weaklings please as he said this he looked at caris in the crowd and caught her eye and he saw her flinch she remembered using that word and she knew she had insulted him any woman who thinks she is the equal of the men can join in he went on i need you to find a bucket and meet me on the shore opposite leper island as soon as possible remember only the strongest he was not sure whether he had won them over as he finished he spotted the tall figure of mark webber and pushed through the throng to him mark will you encourage them he said anxiously mark was a gentle giant much liked in the town even though he was poor he had influence especially among adolescents ill make sure the lads join in he said thank you next merthin found ian boatman im going to need you all day i hope he said ferrying people out to the coffer dams and back you can work for pay or an indulgence your choice ian was excessively fond of his wifes younger sister and would probably prefer the indulgence either for a past sin or for one he was hoping to commit soon merthin made his way through the streets to the shore where he was preparing to build the bridge could the coffer dams be emptied in two days he really had no idea he wondered how many gallons of water were in each thousands hundreds of thousands there must be a way of calculating the greek philosophers had probably worked out a method but if they had it had not been taught at the priory school to find out he would probably have to go to oxford where there were mathematicians famous all over the world according to godwyn he waited at the rivers edge wondering if anyone would come the first to arrive was megg robbins the strapping daughter of a corn dealer with muscles enlarged by years of lifting sacks of grain i can outdo most of the men in this town she said and merthin did not doubt it a group of young men came next then three novice monks as soon as merthin had ten people with buckets he got ian to row them and him to the nearer of the two dams inside the rim of the dam he had built a ledge just above water level strong enough for men to stand on from the ledge four ladders reached all the way down to the river bed in the centre of the dam floating on the surface was a large raft between the raft and the ledge there was a gap of about two feet and the raft was held in a central position by protruding wooden spokes that reached almost to the wall and prevented movement of more than a few inches in any direction you work in pairs he told them one on the raft one on the ledge the one on the raft fills his bucket and passes it to the one on the ledge who tosses the water over the edge into the river as the empty bucket is passed back another full one is passed forward megg robbins said what happens when the water level inside falls and we cant reach one another good thinking megg youd better be my forewoman in charge here when you can no longer reach you work in threes with one on a ladder she caught on fast and then fours with two on a ladder yes though by then well need to rest the men and bring in fresh ones right get started ill bring over another ten youve got plenty of room still megg turned away pick your partners everyone she called the volunteers started to dip their buckets he heard megg say lets keep a rhythm going dip lift pass chuck one two three four how about a song to give us the swing of it she raised her voice in a lusty contralto oh there was once a comely knight they knew the song and all joined in the next line his blade was straight and true oh merthin watched everyone was soaking wet in a few minutes he could see no apparent fall in the level of the water it was going to be a long job he climbed over the side and into ians boat by the time he reached the bank there were thirty more volunteers with buckets he got the second coffer dam started with mark webber as foreman then doubled the numbers in both locations then started replacing tired workers with fresh ones ian boatman became exhausted and handed the oars over to his son the water inside the dams fell inch by wearisome inch as the level fell the work went ever more slowly for the buckets had to be lifted greater and greater distances to the rim megg was the first to discover that a person cannot hold a full bucket in one hand and an empty one in the other and still keep balance on a ladder she devised a oneway bucket chain with full buckets going up one ladder and empty ones down another mark instituted the same system in his dam the volunteers worked an hour and rested an hour but merthin did not stop he was organizing the teams supervising the transport of volunteers to and from the dams replacing buckets that broke most of the men drank ale during their rest periods and in consequence there were several accidents during the afternoon with people dropping buckets and falling off ladders mother cecilia came to take care of the injured with the help of mattie wise and caris too soon the light began to fail and they had to stop but both coffers were more than half empty merthin asked everyone to come back in the morning then went home after a few spoonfuls of his mothers soup he fell asleep at the table waking only long enough to wrap a blanket around himself and lie down in the straw when he woke the next morning his first thought was to wonder whether any of the volunteers would show up for the second day he hurried down to the river at first light with an anxious heart both mark webber and megg robbins were there already mark eating his way through a doorstep of bread and megg lacing a pair of high boots in the hope of keeping her feet dry no one else showed up for the next half hour and merthin began to wonder what he would do with no volunteers then some of the young men arrived carrying their breakfast with them followed by the novice monks then a whole crowd ian boatman turned up and merthin got him to row megg out with some volunteers and they began again the work was harder today everyone was aching from yesterdays efforts every bucket had to be lifted ten feet or more but the end was in sight the levels continued to drop and the volunteers began to glimpse the river bed in the middle of the afternoon the first of the carts arrived back from the quarry merthin directed the owner to unload his stone in the pasture and ferry his cart back across the river to the town a short while later in meggs coffer the raft bumped the river bed there was more to be done when the last of the water was lifted out the raft itself had to be dismantled and raised plank by plank up the ladders and out then dozens of fish were revealed flapping in muddy pools on the bottom and they had to be netted and shared out among the volunteers but when that was finished merthin stood on the ledge weary but jubilant and looked down a twentyfoot hole at the flat mud of the river bed tomorrow he would drop several tons of rubble into each hole and drench the rubble with mortar forming a massive immovable foundation then he would start building the bridge wulfric was in a depression he ate almost nothing and forgot to wash himself he got up automatically at daybreak and lay down again when it got dark but he did not work and he did not make love to gwenda in the night when she asked him what was the matter he would say i dont know really he answered all questions with such uninformative replies or just with grunts there was little to do in the fields anyway this was the season when villagers sat by their fires sewing leather shoes and carving oak shovels eating salt pork and soft apples and cabbage preserved in vinegar gwenda was not worried about how they were going to feed themselves wulfric still had money from the sale of his crops but she was desperately anxious about him wulfric had always lived for his work some villagers grumbled constantly and were happy only on rest days but he was not like that the fields the crops the beasts and the weather were what he cared about on sundays he had always been restless until he found some occupation that was not forbidden and on holidays he had done all he could to circumvent the rules she knew she had to get him to return to his normal state of mind otherwise he might fall sick with some physical illness and his money would not last for ever sooner or later they must both work however she did not give him her news until two full moons had passed and she was sure then one morning in december she said i have something to tell you he grunted he was sitting at the kitchen table whittling a stick and he did not look up from this idle occupation she reached across the table and held his wrists stopping the whittling wulfric would you please look at me he did so with a surly expression on his face resentful at being ordered but too lethargic to defy her its important she said he looked at her in silence im going to have a baby she said his expression did not change but he dropped the knife and stick she looked back at him for a long moment do you understand me she said he nodded a baby he said yes we will have a child when she smiled it was the first question he had asked for two months next summer before the harvest the child must be cared for he said you too yes i must work he looked depressed again she held her breath what was coming he sighed then set his jaw ill go and see perkin he said hell need help with his winter ploughing and manuring she said happily ill come with you he offered to hire us both all right he was still staring at her a child he said as if it were a marvel boy or girl i wonder she got up and walked around the table to sit on the bench next to him which would you prefer a little girl it was all boys in my family i want a boy a miniature version of you we might have twins one of each he put his arm around her we should get father gaspard to marry us properly gwenda sighed contentedly and leaned her head on his shoulder yes she said perhaps we should merthin moved out of his parents house just before christmas he had built a oneroom house for himself on leper island which was now his land he said he needed to guard the growing stockpile of valuable building materials he was keeping on the island timber stones lime ropes and iron tools at the same time he stopped coming to cariss house for meals on the last but one day of december she went to see mattie wise no need to tell me why youre here said mattie three months gone caris nodded and avoided her eye she looked around the little kitchen with its bottles and jars mattie was heating something in a small iron pot and it gave off an acrid smell that made caris want to sneeze i dont want to have a baby caris said i wish i had a chicken for every time ive heard that said am i wicked mattie shrugged i make potions not judgements people know the difference between right and wrong and if they dont thats what priests are for caris was disappointed she had been hoping for sympathy more coolly she said do you have a potion to get rid of this pregnancy i do mattie looked uneasy is there a snag the way to get rid of a pregnancy is to poison yourself some girls drink a gallon of strong wine i make up a dose with several toxic herbs sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt but it always makes you feel dreadful is it dangerous could i die yes though its not as risky as childbirth ill take it mattie took her pot off the fire and put it on a stone slab to cool turning to her scarred old workbench she took a small pottery bowl from a cupboard and poured into it small quantities of different powders caris said whats the matter you say you dont make judgements but you look disapproving mattie nodded youre right i do make judgements of course everyone does and youre judging me im thinking that merthin is a good man and you love him but you dont seem able to find happiness with him that makes me sad you think i should be like other women and throw myself at the feet of some man it seems to make them happy but i chose a different way of life and so will you i suppose are you happy i wasnt born to be happy but i help people i make a living and im free she poured her mixture into a cup added some wine and stirred dissolving the powders have you had breakfast just some milk she dripped a little honey into the cup drink this and dont bother to eat dinner youll only throw it up caris took the cup hesitated then swallowed the draught thank you it had a vilely bitter taste that was only partly masked by the sweetness of the honey it should be all over by tomorrow morning one way or the other caris paid her and left walking home she felt an odd mixture of elation and sadness her spirits were lifted by having made a decision after all the weeks of worry but she also felt a tug of loss as if she were saying goodbye to someone merthin perhaps she wondered if their separation would be permanent she could contemplate the prospect calmly because she still felt angry with him but she knew she would miss him terribly he would find another lover eventually bessie bell perhaps but caris felt sure she would not do the same she would never love anyone as she had loved merthin when she got home the smell of roasting pork in the house nauseated her and she went out again she did not want to gossip with other women in the main street or talk business with the men at the guild hall so she drifted into the priory grounds her heavy wool cloak wrapped around her for warmth and sat on a tombstone in the graveyard looking at the north wall of the cathedral marvelling at the perfection of its carved mouldings and the grace of its flying buttresses it was not long before she felt ill she puked on a grave but her stomach was empty and nothing came up except a sour fluid her head began to ache she wanted to lie down but she was reluctant to go home because of the kitchen smell she decided to go to the priory hospital the nuns would let her lie down for a minute she left the graveyard crossed the green in front of the cathedral and entered the hospital suddenly she was terribly thirsty she was greeted by the kindly podgy face of old julie oh sister juliana caris said gratefully would you bring me a cup of water the priory had water piped from upstream cool and clear and safe to drink are you ill child said old julie anxiously a little nauseated if i may ill just lie down for a moment of course ill fetch mother cecilia caris lay down on one of the straw mattresses lined up neatly on the floor for a few moments she felt better then the headache became worse julie returned with a jug and a cup and mother cecilia caris drank some water threw up and drank some more cecilia asked her some questions then said youve eaten something corrupt you need to be purged caris hurt so much she could make no response cecilia left and returned moments later with a bottle and a spoon she gave caris a spoonful of treacly medicine that tasted of cloves caris lay back with her eyes closed and longed for the pain to go away after a while she was afflicted with stomach cramps followed by uncontrollable diarrhoea she assumed vaguely that it had been brought on by the treacle after an hour it went away julie undressed her washed her gave her a nuns robe instead of her own soiled dress and put her on a clean mattress she lay down and closed her eyes exhausted prior godwyn came to see her and said she must be bled another monk came to do the job he made her sit up and stretch out her arm with her elbow over a large bowl then he took a sharp knife and opened the vein in the crook of her arm she hardly noticed the pain of the cut or the slow throb of the bleeding after a while the monk put a dressing on the cut and told her to hold it there firmly he took away the bowl of blood she was vaguely conscious of people coming to see her her father petranilla merthin old julie put a cup to her lips from time to time and she always drank for she was insatiably thirsty at some point she noticed candles and realized it must be night eventually she fell into a troubled sleep and had terrifying dreams about blood every time she woke julie gave her water at last she woke to daylight the pain had receded leaving only a dull headache the next thing she realized was that someone was washing her thighs she raised herself on her elbow a novice nun with the face of an angel crouched beside the mattress cariss dress was up around her waist and the nun was bathing her with a cloth dipped in warm water after a moment she remembered the girls name mair she said yes the novice answered with a smile as she squeezed out the cloth into a bowl caris was frightened to see that it was red blood she said fearfully dont worry said mair its just your monthly cycle heavy but normal caris saw that her dress and the mattress were soaked with blood she lay back looking up at the ceiling tears came to her eyes but she did not know whether she was crying out of relief or sadness she was no longer pregnant part four june to may the june of was dry and sunny but the fleece fair was a catastrophe for kingsbridge in general and for edmund wooler in particular by the middle of the week caris knew that her father was bankrupt the townspeople had expected that it would be difficult and had done all they could to prepare they commissioned merthin to build three large rafts that could be poled across the river to supplement the ferry and ians boat he could have built more but there was no room to land them on the banks the priorys grounds were opened a day early and the ferry operated all night by torchlight they persuaded godwyn to give permission for kingsbridge shopkeepers to cross to the suburban side and sell to the queue in the hope that dick brewers ale and betty baxters buns would mollify the people waiting it was not enough fewer people than usual came to the fair but the queues were worse than ever the extra rafts were insufficient but even so the shore on both sides became so swampy that carts were constantly getting stuck in the mud and having to be towed out by teams of oxen worse the rafts were difficult to steer and on two occasions there were collisions that threw passengers into the water though fortunately no one drowned some traders anticipated these problems and stayed away others turned back when they saw the length of the queue of those willing to wait half a day to get into the city some then did such paltry business that they left after a day or two by wednesday the ferry was taking more people away than it was bringing in that morning caris and edmund made a tour of the bridge works with guillaume of london guillaume was not as big a customer as buonaventura caroli but he was the best they had this year and they were making a fuss of him he was a tall beefy man in a cloak of expensive italian cloth bright red they borrowed merthins raft which had a raised deck and a builtin hoist for transporting building materials his young assistant jimmie poled them out into the river the midstream piers that merthin had constructed in such a rush last december were still surrounded by their coffer dams he had explained to edmund and caris that he would leave the dams in place until the bridge was almost finished to protect the stonework from accidental damage by his own workmen when he demolished them he would put in their place a pile of loose large stones the riprap which he said would prevent the current undermining the piers the massive stone columns had now grown like trees spreading their arches sideways towards smaller piers built in the shallower water near the banks these in turn were growing arches on one side towards the central piers and on the other towards abutments on the bank a dozen or more masons were busy on the elaborate scaffolding that clung to the stonework like gulls nests on a cliff they landed on leper island and found merthin with brother thomas supervising the masons building the abutment from which the bridge would spring across the northern branch of the river the priory still owned and controlled the bridge even though the land was leased to the parish guild and the construction was financed by loans from individual townspeople thomas was often on site prior godwyn took a proprietorial interest in the work and especially in how the bridge would look evidently feeling it was going to be some kind of monument to him merthin looked up at the visitors with his goldenbrown eyes and cariss heart seemed to beat faster she hardly saw him these days and when they spoke it was always about business but she still felt strange in his presence she had to make an effort to breathe normally to meet his eye with feigned indifference and to slow her speech to a moderate speed they had never patched up their quarrel she had not told him about her abortion so he did not know whether her pregnancy had terminated spontaneously or otherwise neither of them had ever referred to it on two occasions since then he had come to talk to her solemnly and had begged her to make a fresh start with him both times she had told him that she would never love another man but she was not going to spend her life as someones wife and someone elses mother how will you spend your life then he had asked and she had replied simply that she did not know merthin was not as impish as he used to be his hair and beard were neatly trimmed he was now a regular customer of matthew barber he was dressed in a russet tunic like the masons but he wore a yellow cape trimmed with fur a sign of his status as a master and a cap with a feather in it which made him look a bit taller elfric whose enmity continued had objected to merthin dressing like a master on the grounds that he was not a member of any guild merthins reply was that he was a master and the solution to the problem was for him to be admitted to a guild and there the matter remained unresolved merthin was still only twentyone and guillaume looked at him and said hes young caris said defensively hes been the best builder in town since he was about seventeen merthin said a few more words to thomas then came over the abutments of a bridge need to be heavy with deep foundations he said explaining the massive bulwark of stone he was constructing guillaume said why is that young man merthin was used to being condescended to and he took it lightly with a small smile he said let me show you stand with your feet as far apart as you can like this merthin demonstrated and guillaume after a moments hesitation imitated him your feet feel as if they might slide farther apart dont they yes and the ends of a bridge tend to spread like your feet this puts a strain on the bridge just as youre now feeling the tension in your groin merthin stood upright and placed his own booted foot firmly up against guillaumes soft leather shoe now your foot cant move and the strain on your groin has eased hasnt it yes the abutment has the same effect as my foot in bracing your foot and relieving the strain very interesting guillaume said thoughtfully as he straightened up and caris knew he was telling himself not to underestimate merthin let me show you around merthin said the island had changed completely in the last six months all signs of the old leper colony had gone much of the rocky land was now taken up with stores neat piles of stone barrels of lime stacks of timber and coils of rope the place was still infested with rabbits but they were now competing for space with the builders there was a smithy where a blacksmith was repairing old tools and forging new ones several masons lodges and merthins new house small but carefully built and beautifully proportioned carpenters stone carvers and mortar makers were labouring to keep the men on the scaffolding supplied with materials there seem to be more people at work than usual caris murmured in merthins ear he grinned ive put as many as possible in highly visible positions he replied quietly i want every visitor to notice how fast were working to build the new bridge i want them to believe the fair will be back to normal next year at the west end of the island away from the twin bridges were storage yards and warehouses on plots of land merthin had rented to kingsbridge merchants although his rents were lower than what tenants would have to pay within the city walls merthin was already earning a good deal more than the token sum he paid every year for the lease he was also seeing a lot of elizabeth clerk caris thought she was a cold bitch but she was the only other woman in town with the brains to challenge merthin she had a small box of books she had inherited from her father the bishop and merthin spent evenings at her house reading whether anything else went on caris did not know when the tour was over edmund took guillaume back across the water but caris stayed behind to talk to merthin good customer he asked as they watched the raft being poled away weve just sold him two sacks of cheap wool for less than we paid a sack was pounds weight of wool washed clean and dried this year the cheap wool was selling for thirtysix shillings a sack the good quality for about double that why when prices are falling its better to have cash than wool but surely you anticipated a poor fair we didnt expect it to be this bad im surprised in the past your father has always had a supernatural ability to foresee trends caris hesitated its the combination of slack demand and the lack of a bridge in truth she was surprised too she had watched her father buy fleeces in the same quantity as usual despite the poor prospects and had wondered why he did not play safe by reducing his purchases i suppose youll try to sell your surplus at the shiring fair merthin said its what earl roland wants everyone to do the trouble is were not regulars there the locals will cream off the best of the business its what happens in kingsbridge my father and two or three others strike large deals with the biggest buyers leaving smaller operators and outsiders to scrabble for the leftovers im sure the shiring merchants do the same we might sell a few sacks there but theres no real chance we can get rid of it all what will you do thats why ive come to talk to you we may have to stop work on the bridge he stared at her no he said quietly im very sorry but my father doesnt have the money hes put it all into fleeces that he cant sell merthin looked as if he had been slapped after a moment he said we have to find another way her heart went out to him but she could think of nothing hopeful to say my father pledged seventy pounds to the bridge hes paid out half already the rest im afraid is in woolsacks at his warehouse he cant be completely penniless very nearly and the same applies to several other citizens who promised money for the bridge i could slow down merthin said desperately lay off some craftsmen and run down the stocks of materials then you wouldnt have a bridge ready by next years fair and wed be in worse trouble better than giving up altogether yes it would be she said but dont do anything yet when the fleece fair is over well think again i just wanted you to know the situation merthin still looked pale i appreciate it the raft came back and jimmie waited to take her to the shore as she walked on board she said casually and how is elizabeth clerk merthin pretended to be a little surprised by the question shes fine i think he said you seem to be seeing a lot of her not especially weve always been friends yes of course caris said though it was not really true merthin had completely ignored elizabeth for most of last year when he and caris were spending so much time together but it would have been undignified to contradict him so she said no more she waved goodbye and jimmie pushed the raft off merthin was trying to give the impression that his relationship with elizabeth was not a romance perhaps that was true or perhaps he was embarrassed to admit to caris that he was in love with someone else she could not tell one thing she felt sure of it was a romance on elizabeths side caris could tell just by the way elizabeth looked at him elizabeth might be an ice maiden but she was hot for merthin the raft bumped against the opposite bank caris stepped off and walked up the hill into the centre of the city merthin had been deeply shaken by her news caris felt like crying when she recalled the shock and dismay on his face that was how he had looked when she had refused to rekindle their love affair she still did not know how she was going to spend her life she had always assumed that whatever she did she would live in a comfortable house paid for by a profitable business now even that ground was moving under her feet she racked her brains for some way out of the mess her father was oddly serene as if he had not yet grasped the scale of his losses but she knew that something had to be done walking up the main street she passed elfrics daughter griselda carrying her sixmonthold baby it was a boy and she had named him merthin a permanent reproach to the original merthin for not marrying her griselda was still maintaining a pretence of injured innocence everyone else now accepted that merthin was not the father though some townspeople still thought he should have married her anyway as he had lain with her as caris came to her own house her father came out she stared at him in astonishment he was dressed only in his underwear a long undershirt drawers and hose where are your clothes she said he looked down at himself and made a disgusted sound im getting absentminded he said and he went back indoors he must have taken his coat off to go to the privy she thought then forgotten to put it on again was that just his age he was only fortyeight and besides it seemed worse than mere forgetfulness she felt unnerved he returned normally dressed and they crossed the main street together and entered the priory grounds edmund said did you tell merthin about the money yes he was terribly shocked what did he say that he could spend less by slowing the pace but then we wouldnt have a bridge in time for next year but as he said that would be better than abandoning the bridge half built they came to the stall of perkin wigleigh selling laying hens his flirtatious daughter annet had a tray of eggs held up by a strap around her neck behind the counter caris saw her friend gwenda who was now working for perkin eight months pregnant with heavy breasts and a swollen belly gwenda stood with one hand on her hip stretching in the classic pose of the expectant mother with an aching back caris calculated that she too would now be eight months pregnant if she had not taken matties potion after the abortion her breasts had leaked milk and she could not help feeling that this was her bodys reproach for what she had done she suffered pangs of regret but whenever she thought about it logically she knew that if she had her time over again she would do the same gwenda caught cariss eye and smiled against all the odds gwenda had got what she wanted wulfric for her husband he was there now strong as a horse and twice as handsome lifting a stack of wooden crates on to the flatbed of a cart caris was thrilled for gwenda how do you feel today she said my backs been hurting all morning not long now a couple of weeks i think edmund said whos this my dear dont you remember gwenda said caris shes been a guest at your house at least once a year for the past ten years edmund smiled i didnt recognize you gwenda it must be the pregnancy you look well though they moved on wulfric had not been given his inheritance caris knew gwenda had failed in that task caris was not sure exactly what had gone on last september when gwenda had gone to plead with ralph but it seemed ralph had made some kind of promise then reneged anyway gwenda now hated ralph with a passion that was almost frightening nearby was a line of stalls at which local cloth merchants were selling brown burel the loosely woven fabric that was bought by all but the rich for their homemade clothing they seemed to be doing good business unlike the wool merchants raw wool was a wholesale business the absence of a few big buyers could ruin the market but cloth was retail everyone needed it everyone bought it a bit less perhaps when times were hard but they still needed clothes a vague thought formed in the back of cariss mind when merchants could not sell their wool they sometimes had it woven and tried to sell it as cloth but it was a lot of work and there was not much profit in brown burel everyone bought the cheapest and sellers had to keep the price down she looked at the cloth stalls with new eyes i wonder what fetches the most money she said the burel was twelve pence per yard you had to pay half as much again for cloth that had been fulled thickened by pounding in water and still more for colours other than the natural dull brown peter dyers stall featured green yellow and pink cloth at two shillings twentyfour pence per yard even though the colours were not very bright she turned to her father to tell him the notion that was forming in her mind but before she could speak something happened to distract her being at the fleece fair reminded ralph unpleasantly of the same event a year ago and he touched his misshapen nose how had that occurred it had started with him harmlessly teasing the peasant girl annet then teaching her oafish paramour a lesson in respect but somehow it had ended up in humiliation for ralph as he approached perkins stall he consoled himself by reflecting on what had happened since he had saved earl rolands life after the collapse of the bridge he had pleased the earl by his decisive behaviour at the quarry and he had at last been made a lord albeit over nothing more than the little village of wigleigh he had killed a man ben wheeler a carter so there was no honour in it but all the same he had proved to himself that he could do it he had even made up his quarrel with his brother their mother had forced the issue inviting them both to dinner on christmas day insisting that they shake hands it was a misfortune their father had said that they served masters who were rivals but each had a duty to do his best like soldiers who found themselves on opposing sides in a civil war ralph was pleased and he thought merthin felt the same he had been able to take a satisfying revenge on wulfric by denying him his inheritance and at the same time his girl the eyecatching annet was now married to billy howard and wulfric had to content himself with the ugly though passionate gwenda it was a pity wulfric did not look more crushed he seemed to walk tall and proud around the village as if he not ralph owned the place all his neighbours liked him and his pregnant wife worshipped him despite the defeats ralph had inflicted wulfric somehow emerged as the hero perhaps it was because his wife was so lusty ralph would have liked to tell wulfric about gwendas visit to him at the bell i lay with your wife he wanted to say and she liked it that would wipe the proud look off wulfrics face but then wulfric would also know that ralph had made a promise and shamefully broken it which would just make wulfric feel superior all over again ralph shuddered when he thought of the contempt wulfric and others would feel for him if they ever found out about that betrayal his brother merthin in particular would despise him for it no his tumble with gwenda would have to remain a secret they were all at the stall perkin was the first to see ralph approaching and greeted his lord as obsequiously as ever good day lord ralph he said bowing and his wife peg curtseyed behind him gwenda was there rubbing her back as if it hurt then ralph saw annet with her tray of eggs and he remembered touching her small breast round and firm like the eggs on the tray she saw him looking and dropped her eyes demurely he wanted to touch her breast again why not he thought im her lord then he saw wulfric at the back of the stall the boy had been loading crates on to a cart but now he stood still looking at ralph his face was carefully expressionless but his gaze was level and steady his look could not be called insolent but for ralph there was no mistaking the threat it could not have been clearer if ralph had said touch her and ill kill you perhaps i should do it ralph thought let him attack me ill run him through with my sword i will be completely in the right a lord defending himself against a peasant maddened with hatred holding wulfrics gaze he lifted his hand to fondle annets breast and then gwenda let out a sharp cry of pain and distress and all eyes turned to her caris heard a cry of pain and recognized the voice of gwenda she felt a throb of fear something was wrong in a few hurried steps she was at perkins stall gwenda was sitting on a stool looking pale her face twisted in a grimace of pain her hand on her hip again her dress was wet perkins wife peg said briskly her waters have broken her labour is beginning its early caris said anxiously the baby is coming anyway this is dangerous caris made a decision lets take her to the hospital women did not normally go to the hospital to give birth but they would admit gwenda if caris insisted an early baby could be vulnerable everyone knew that wulfric appeared caris was struck by how young he looked he was seventeen and about to become a father gwenda said i feel a bit wobbly ill be all right in a minute ill carry you wulfric said and he picked her up effortlessly follow me said caris she walked ahead of him through the stalls calling stand aside please stand aside in a minute they were at the hospital the door was wide open overnight visitors had been tipped out hours ago and their straw mattresses were now piled high against one wall several employees and novices were energetically washing the floor with mops and buckets caris addressed the nearest cleaner a middleaged woman with bare feet fetch old julie quickly tell her caris sent you caris found a reasonably clean mattress and spread it on the floor near the altar she was not sure how effective altars were at helping sick people but she followed the convention wulfric put gwenda down on the bed as carefully as if she had been made of glass she lay with her knees up and her legs parted a few moments later old julie arrived and caris thought how often in her life she had been comforted by this nun who was probably not much past forty but seemed ancient this is gwenda wigleigh said caris she may be fine but the baby is coming several weeks early and i thought it a sensible precaution to bring her here we were just outside anyway very wise said julie gently pushing caris aside to kneel by the bed how do you feel my dear she said to gwenda while julie talked to gwenda in a low voice caris looked at wulfric his handsome young face was contorted with anxiety caris knew that he had never intended to marry gwenda he had always wanted annet however he now seemed as concerned for her as if he had loved her for years gwenda cried out in pain there there said julie she knelt between gwendas feet and looked up her dress babys coming quite soon she said another nun appeared and caris recognized mair the novice with the angel face she said shall i get mother cecilia no need to bother her said julie just go to the storeroom and fetch me the wooden box with birth written on the top mair hurried away gwenda said oh god it hurts keep pushing said julie wulfric said whats wrong for gods sake nothings wrong said julie this is normal this is how women give birth you must be the youngest of your family otherwise you would have seen your mother like this caris too was the young sibling in her family she knew that childbirth was painful but she had never actually watched it and she was shocked by how bad it was mair returned and placed a wooden box on the floor next to julie gwenda stopped groaning her eyes closed and she looked almost as if she might have been asleep then a few minutes later she cried out again julie said to wulfric sit beside her and hold her hand he obeyed immediately julie was still looking up gwendas dress stop pushing now she said after a while take lots of short breaths she panted to show gwenda what she meant gwenda complied and it seemed to ease her distress for a few minutes then she cried out again caris could hardly stand it if this was normal what was childbirth like when there were difficulties she lost her sense of time everything was happening very quickly but gwendas torment seemed endless caris had the powerless feeling that she hated so much the feeling that had overwhelmed her when her mother died she wanted to help but she did not know what to do and it made her so anxious that she bit her lip until she tasted blood julie said here comes baby she reached between gwendas legs the dress fell away and suddenly caris could clearly see the babys head face down covered in wet hair emerging from an opening that seemed impossibly stretched god help us no wonder it hurts she said in horror julie supported the head with her left hand the baby slowly turned sideways then its tiny shoulders came out its skin was slippery with blood and some other fluid just relax now julie said its nearly over baby looks beautiful beautiful caris thought to her it looked horrible the babys torso came out with a fat pulsing blue cord attached to its navel then its legs and feet came all in a rush julie picked up the baby in both hands it was tiny its head not much bigger than the palm of julies hand something seemed wrong caris realized the baby was not breathing julie brought the babys face close to her own and blew into its miniature nostrils the baby suddenly opened its mouth gasped air and cried praise god said julie she wiped the babys face with the sleeve of her robe tenderly cleaning around the ears eyes nose and mouth then she pressed the newborn to her bosom closing her eyes in that instant caris saw a lifetime of selfdenial the moment passed and julie laid the baby on gwendas chest gwenda looked down is it a boy or a girl caris realized that none of them had looked julie leaned over and parted the babys knees a boy she said the blue cord stopped pulsing and shrivelled turning white julie took from the box two short lengths of string and tied off the umbilical cord then she took out a small sharp knife and cut the cord between the two knots mair took the knife from her and handed her a tiny blanket from the box julie took the baby from gwenda wrapped him in the blanket and gave him back mair found some pillows and propped gwenda up gwenda pushed down the neck of her shift and took out a swollen breast she gave the baby the nipple and he began to suck after a minute he seemed to sleep the other end of the cord was still hanging out of gwenda a few minutes later it moved and a shapeless red mass slipped out the afterbirth blood soaked the mattress julie lifted the mass handed it to mair and said burn this julie scrutinized gwendas pelvic area and frowned caris followed her gaze and saw that the blood was still flowing julie wiped the stains away from gwendas body but the red streaks reappeared immediately when mair came back julie said fetch mother cecilia please right away wulfric said is something wrong the bleeding should have stopped by now julie answered suddenly there was tension in the air wulfric looked frightened the baby cried and gwenda gave him the nipple again he suckled briefly and slept again julie kept looking at the doorway at last cecilia appeared she looked at gwenda and said has the afterbirth come out a few minutes ago did you put the baby to the breast as soon as we had cut the cord ill get a physician cecilia walked quickly away she was gone some minutes when she returned she was carrying a small glass vessel containing a yellowish fluid prior godwyn has prescribed this she said caris was indignant doesnt he want to examine gwenda certainly not cecilia said crisply hes a priest as well as a monk such men dont look upon womens private parts podex caris said contemptuously it was the latin for arsehole cecilia pretended not to hear she knelt beside gwenda drink this my dear gwenda drank the potion but she continued to bleed she was pale and looked weaker than she had done immediately after the birth the baby slept contentedly on her breast but everyone else was scared wulfric kept standing up and sitting down again julie wiped the blood off gwendas thighs and looked as if she might cry gwenda asked for something to drink and mair brought a cup of ale caris took julie aside and said in a whisper shes bleeding to death weve done what we can julie said have you seen cases like this before yes three how did they end the women died caris gave a low groan of despair there must be something we can do shes in gods hands now you could pray thats not what i meant by doing something you be careful what you say caris immediately felt guilty she did not want to quarrel with someone as kindly as julie im sorry sister i didnt mean to deny the power of prayer i should hope not but im not yet ready to leave gwenda in the hands of god what else is there to do youll see caris hurried out of the hospital she pushed impatiently through the customers strolling around the fair it seemed amazing to her that people could still be buying and selling when a drama of life and death was going on a few yards away but there had been many occasions when she had heard that a mothertobe had gone into labour and she had never stopped what she was doing just wished the woman well then carried on she emerged from the priory grounds and ran through the streets of the town to mattie wises house she knocked on the door and opened it to her relief mattie was at home gwendas just had her baby she said whats gone wrong mattie said immediately the babys all right but gwendas still bleeding has the afterbirth come out yes the bleeding should have stopped can you help her perhaps ill try hurry please mattie took a pot off the fire and put on her shoes then the two of them left mattie locking her door behind her caris said vehemently im never going to have a baby i swear they rushed to the priory and went into the hospital caris noticed the strong smell of blood mattie was careful to acknowledge old julie good afternoon sister juliana hello mattie julie looked disapproving do you believe you can help this woman when the holy priors remedies have not been blessed with success if you pray for me and for the patient sister who knows what may happen it was a diplomatic answer and julie was mollified mattie knelt beside mother and child gwenda was becoming paler her eyes were closed the baby sought blindly for the nipple but gwenda seemed too tired to help him mattie said she must keep drinking but not strong liquor please bring her a jug of warm water with a small glass of wine mixed into it then ask the kitchener if he has a clear soup warm but not hot mair looked questioningly at julie who hesitated then said go but dont tell anyone that youre doing matties bidding the novice hurried off mattie pushed gwendas dress up as high as it would go exposing all of her abdomen the skin that had been stretched so taut a few hours ago was now flabby and folded mattie grasped the loose flesh digging her fingers gently but firmly into gwendas belly gwenda grunted but it was a sound of discomfort rather than pain mattie said the womb is soft it has failed to contract thats why shes bleeding wulfric who seemed close to tears said can you do anything for her i dont know mattie began to massage her fingers apparently pressing gwendas womb through the skin and flesh of her belly sometimes this provokes the womb to shrink she said everyone watched in silence caris was almost afraid to breathe mair came back with the waterandwine mixture give her some please mattie said without pausing in her massage mair held a cup to gwendas lips and she drank thirstily not too much mattie warned mair took the cup away mattie continued to massage glancing from time to time at gwendas pelvis julies lips moved in silent prayer the blood flowed without letup looking worried mattie changed her position she put her left hand on gwendas belly just below the navel then her right hand over the left she pressed down slowly putting on more pressure caris was afraid it must hurt the patient but gwenda seemed only half conscious mattie leaned farther over gwenda until she seemed to be putting all her weight on to her hands julie said shes stopped bleeding mattie did not change her position can anyone here count to five hundred yes caris said slowly please caris began to count aloud julie wiped the blood off gwenda again and this time the streaks did not reappear she began to pray aloud holy mary mother of the lord jesus christ everyone was still like a group of statuary the mother and baby on the bed the wise woman pressing down on the mothers belly the husband the praying nun and caris counting a hundred and eleven a hundred and twelve as well as her own voice and julies caris could hear the sound of the fair outside the roar of hundreds of people all speaking at once the strain of pressing down began to show on matties face but she did not move wulfric was crying silently tears streaming down his sunburned cheeks when caris reached five hundred mattie slowly eased her weight off gwendas abdomen everyone looked at her vagina dreading the gush of blood it did not come mattie breathed a long sigh of relief wulfric smiled julie said praise god mattie said give her another drink please once again mair put a full cup to gwendas lips gwenda opened her eyes and drank it all youre going to be all right now mattie said gwenda whispered thank you then she closed her eyes mattie looked at mair perhaps you should go and see about that soup she said the woman must rebuild her strength otherwise her milk will dry up mair nodded and left the baby cried gwenda seemed to revive she moved the baby to her other breast and helped him find the nipple then she looked up at wulfric and smiled julie said what a beautiful little boy caris looked at the baby again for the first time she saw him as an individual what would he be like strong and true like wulfric or weak and dishonest like his grandfather joby he did not resemble either she thought who does he look like she said julie said he has his mothers colouring that was right caris thought the baby had dark hair and beige skin where wulfric had fair skin and a mane of darkblond hair the babys face reminded her of someone and after a moment she realized it was merthin a foolish thought crossed her mind and she dismissed it immediately all the same the resemblance was there you know who he reminds me of she said suddenly she caught a look from gwenda her eyes widened an expression of panic crossed her face and she gave a barely perceptible shake of her head it was gone in an instant but the message was unmistakable shut up caris clamped her teeth together who said julie innocently caris hesitated desperately thinking of something to say at last she was inspired philemon gwendas brother she said of course said julie someone should tell him to come and see his new nephew caris was bewildered so the baby was not wulfrics then whose it could not be merthins he might have lain with gwenda he was certainly vulnerable to temptation but he could never have kept it secret from caris afterwards if not merthin caris was struck by a dreadful thought what had gone on that day when gwenda went to plead with ralph for wulfrics inheritance could the baby be ralphs it was too grim to contemplate she looked at gwenda then at the baby then at wulfric wulfric was smiling with joy though his face was still wet with tears he had no suspicions julie said have you thought about the babys name oh yes said wulfric i want to name him samuel gwenda nodded looking down at the babys face samuel she said sammy sam after my father wulfric said happily one year after the death of anthony kingsbridge priory was a different place godwyn thought with satisfaction as he stood in the cathedral on the sunday after the fleece fair the main difference was the separation of monks and nuns they no longer mingled in the cloisters the library or the scriptorium even here in the church a new carvedoak screen running down the centre of the choir prevented them from looking at one another during the services only in the hospital were they sometimes forced to mix in his sermon prior godwyn said the collapse of the bridge a year ago had been gods punishment for laxity in the monks and nuns and for sin among the townspeople the new spirit of rigour and purity at the priory and piety and submission in the town would lead to a better life for all in this world and the hereafter he felt it went down quite well afterwards he had dinner with brother simeon the treasurer in the priors house philemon served them stewed eel and cider i want to build a new priors house godwyn said simeons long thin face seemed to get longer any particular reason im sure i am the only prior in christendom who lives in a house like a leather tanners think of the people who have been guests here in the last twelve months the earl of shiring the bishop of kingsbridge the earl of monmouth this building isnt appropriate for such folk it gives a poor impression of us and of our order we need a magnificent building to reflect the prestige of kingsbridge priory you want a palace said simeon godwyn detected a disapproving note in simeons tone of voice as if godwyns aim was to glorify himself rather than the priory call it a palace if you wish he said stiffly why not bishops and priors live in palaces its not for their own comfort but for that of their guests and for the reputation of the institution they represent of course said simeon giving up that line of argument but you cant afford it godwyn frowned in theory his senior monks were encouraged to debate with him but the truth was that he hated to be opposed thats ridiculous he said kingsbridge is one of the richest monasteries in the land so it is always said and we do own vast resources but the price of wool has fallen this year for the fifth year in succession our income is shrinking philemon suddenly interjected they say the italian merchants are buying fleeces in spain philemon was changing since achieving his ambition and becoming a novice monk he had lost the awkwardboy look and had grown in confidence to the point where he could join in a conversation between prior and treasurer and make an interesting contribution could be said simeon also the fleece fair was smaller because theres no bridge so we earned a lot less in duty and tolls than we usually do godwyn said but we hold thousands of acres of farmland in this part of the country where most of our lands are there was a poor harvest last year after all that rain many of our serfs struggled to stay alive its hard to force them to pay their rents when theyre hungry they must pay all the same godwyn said monks get hungry too philemon spoke again if the bailiff of a village says that a serf has defaulted on his rent or that part of the land is untenanted therefore no rent is due you havent really got any way of checking that hes telling the truth bailiffs can be bribed by serfs godwyn felt frustrated he had had numerous conversations like this in the past year he had been determined to tighten up control of the priorys finances but every time he tried to change things he ran into barriers have you got a suggestion he said irritably to philemon send an inspector on a tour of the villages let him speak to bailiffs look at the land go into the cottages of serfs who are said to be starving if the bailiff can be bribed so can the inspector not if hes a monk what use have we for money godwyn recalled philemons old inclination to stealing it was true that monks had no use for personal money at least in theory but that did not mean they were incorruptible however a visit from the priors inspector would certainly put bailiffs on their toes its a good idea godwyn said would you like to be the inspector id be honoured then its settled godwyn turned back to simeon all the same we still have a huge income and huge costs simeon replied we pay a subvention to our bishop we feed clothe and house twentyfive monks seven novices and nineteen pensioners of the priory we employ thirty people as cleaners cooks stable boys and so on we spend a fortune on candles monks robes all right ive grasped your point godwyn said impatiently but i still want to build a palace where will you go for the money then godwyn sighed where we always go in the end ill ask mother cecilia he saw her a few minutes later normally he would have asked her to come to him as a sign of the superiority of the male within the church but on this occasion he thought it best to flatter her the prioresss house was an exact copy of the priors but it had a different feel there were cushions and rugs flowers in a bowl on the table embroidered samplers on the wall illustrating bible stories and texts and a cat asleep in front of the fireplace cecilia was finishing a dinner of roast lamb and darkred wine she put on a veil when godwyn arrived in accordance with a rule godwyn had introduced for occasions when monks had to talk to nuns he found cecilia difficult to read veiled or not she had formally welcomed his election as prior and had gone along unprotestingly with his stricter rules about separation of monks and nuns making only the occasional practical point about the efficient running of the hospital she had never opposed him and yet he felt she was not really on his side it seemed he was no longer able to charm her when he was younger he had been able to make her laugh like a girl now she was no longer susceptible or perhaps he had lost the knack small talk was difficult with a woman in a veil so he plunged straight into his topic i think we should build two new houses for entertaining noble and highranking guests he said one for men one for women they would be called the priors house and the prioresss house but their main purpose would be to accommodate visitors in the style to which theyre accustomed thats an interesting idea cecilia said as ever she was compliant without being enthusiastic we should have impressive stone buildings godwyn went on after all you have been prioress here for more than a decade you are one of the most senior nuns in the kingdom we want the guests to be impressed not by our wealth but by the holiness of the priory and the piety of the monks and nuns of course she said indeed but the buildings should symbolize that as the cathedral symbolizes the majesty of god where do you think the new buildings should be sited this was good godwyn thought she was already getting down to details close to where the old houses are now so yours near the east end of the church next to the chapter house and mine down here by the fishpond it crossed godwyns mind that she might be mocking him he could not see her expression imposing a veil on women had its disadvantages he reflected you might prefer a new location he said yes i might there was a short silence godwyn was finding it hard to broach the subject of money he was going to have to change the rule about veils make an exception for the prioress perhaps it was just too difficult to negotiate like this he was forced to plunge again unfortunately i would not be able to make any contribution to the building costs the monastery is very poor to the cost of the prioresss house you mean she said i wouldnt expect it no actually i meant the cost of the priors house oh so you want the nunnery to pay for your new house as well as mine im afraid i would have to ask you that yes i hope you dont mind well if its for the prestige of kingsbridge priory i knew you would see it that way let me see right now im building new cloisters for the nuns as we no longer share with the monks godwyn made no comment he was irritated that cecilia had employed merthin to design the cloisters rather than the cheaper elfric which was a wasteful extravagance but this was not the moment to say so cecilia went on and when thats done i need to build a nuns library and buy some books for it as we cant use your library any more godwyn tapped his foot impatiently this seemed irrelevant and then we need a covered walkway to the church as we now take a different route to that used by the monks and we have no protection in bad weather very reasonable godwyn commented though he wanted to say stop dithering so she said with an air of finality i think we could consider this proposal in three years time three years i want to start now oh i dont think we can contemplate that why not we have a budget for building you see but isnt this more important we must stick to our budget why so that we remain financially strong and independent she said then she added pointedly i wouldnt like to go begging godwyn did not know what to say worse he had a ghastly feeling that she was laughing at him behind the veil he could not stand to be laughed at he stood up abruptly thank you mother cecilia he said coldly well talk about this again yes she said in three years time i look forward to it now he was sure she was laughing he turned away and left as quickly as he could back in his own house he threw himself in a chair fuming i hate that woman he said to philemon who was still there she said no she said she would consider it in three years time thats worse than a no said philemon its a threeyear no were always in her power because she has money i listen to the talk of the older men philemon said apparently irrelevantly its surprising how much you learn what are you getting at when the priory first built mills and dug fishponds and fenced oft rabbit warrens the priors made a law that townspeople had to use the monks facilities and pay for them they werent allowed to grind their corn at home or full cloth by treading it nor could they have their own ponds and warrens they had to buy from us the law ensured that the priory got back its costs but the law fell out of use it changed instead of a prohibition people were allowed their own facilities if they paid a fine then that fell out of use in prior anthonys time and now theres a hand mill in every house and all the fishmongers have ponds there are half a dozen warrens and dyers full their own cloth by making their wives and children tread it instead of bringing it to the priorys fulling mill godwyn was excited if all those people paid a fine for the privilege of having their own facilities it could be quite a lot of money they would squeal like pigs godwyn frowned can we prove what we say there are plenty of people who remember the fines but its bound to be written in the priory records somewhere probably in timothys book youd better find out exactly how much the fines were if were resting on the ground of precedent wed better get it right if i may make a suggestion of course you could announce the new regime from the pulpit of the cathedral on sunday morning that would serve to emphasize that its the will of god good idea said godwyn thats exactly what ill do ive got the solution caris said to her father he sat back in the big wooden seat at the head of the table a slight smile on his face she knew that look it was sceptical but willing to listen go on he said she was a little nervous she felt sure her idea would work saving her fathers fortune and merthins bridge but could she convince edmund we take our surplus wool and have it woven into cloth and dyed she said simply she held her breath waiting for his reaction wool merchants often try that in hard times he said but tell me why you think it would work what would it cost for cleaning spinning and weaving four shillings per sack and how much cloth would that make a sack of poorquality wool that you bought for thirtysix shillings and wove for four more shillings would make fortyeight yards of cloth which you would sell for undyed brown burel sells for a shilling a yard so fortyeight shillings eight more than we would have paid out its not much considering the work we would have put in but thats not the best of it keep going weavers sell their brown burel because theyre in a hurry to get the money but if you spend another twenty shillings fulling the cloth then dyeing and finishing it you can get double the price two shillings a yard ninetysix shillings for the whole lot thirtysix shillings more than you paid edmund looked dubious if its so easy why dont more people do it because they dont have the money to lay out nor do i youve got three pounds from guillaume of london am i to have nothing with which to buy wool next year at these prices youre better off out of the business he laughed by the saints youre right very well try it out with some cheap stuff ive got five sacks of coarse devon wool that the italians never want ill give you a sack of that and see if you can do what you say two weeks later caris found mark webber smashing up his hand mill she was shocked to see a poor man destroying a valuable piece of equipment so much so that for a moment she forgot her own troubles the hand mill consisted of two stone discs each slightly roughened on one face the smaller sat on the larger fitting perfectly into a shallow indentation rough side to rough a protruding wooden handle enabled the upper stone to be turned while the lower remained still ears of grain placed between the two stones would be rapidly ground to flour most kingsbridge people of the lower class had a hand mill the very poor could not afford one and the affluent did not need one they could buy flour already ground by a miller but for families such as the webbers who needed every penny they earned to feed their children a hand mill was a moneysaving godsend mark had laid his on the ground in front of his small house he had borrowed from somewhere a longhandled sledgehammer with an iron head two of his children were watching a thin girl in a ragged dress and a naked toddler he lifted the hammer over his head and swung it in a long arc it was a sight to see he was the biggest man in kingsbridge with shoulders like a carthorse the stone crazed like an eggshell and fell into pieces caris said what on earth are you doing we must grind corn at the priors watermills and forfeit one sack in twentyfour as a fee mark replied he seemed phlegmatic about it but she was horrified i thought the new rules applied only to unlicensed windmills and watermills tomorrow i have to go around with john constable searching peoples homes breaking up illicit hand mills i cant have them saying ive got one of my own thats why im doing this in the street where everyone can see i didnt realize godwyn intended to take the bread out of the mouths of the poor caris said grimly luckily for us weve got some weaving to do thanks to you caris turned her mind to her own business how are you getting on finished that was quick it takes longer in winter but in summer with sixteen hours of daylight i can weave six yards in a day with madge helping wonderful come inside and ill show you his wife madge was standing over the cooking fire at the back of the oneroom house with a baby on one arm and a shy boy at her side madge was shorter than her husband by more than a foot but her build was chunky she had a large bust and a jutting behind and she made caris think of a plump pigeon her protruding jaw gave her an aggressive air that was not entirely misleading although combative she was goodhearted and caris liked her she offered her visitor a cup of cider which caris refused knowing the family could not afford it marks loom was a wooden frame more than a yard square on a stand it took up most of the living space behind it close to the back door was a table with two benches obviously they all slept on the floor around the loom i make narrow dozens mark explained a narrow dozen is a cloth a yard wide and twelve yards long i cant make broadcloth because i havent room for such a wide loom four rolls of brown burel were stacked against the wall one sack of wool makes four narrow dozens he said caris had brought him the raw fleeces in a standard woolsack madge had arranged for the wool to be cleaned sorted and spun into yarn the spinning was done by the poor women of the town and the cleaning and sorting by their children caris felt the cloth she was excited she had completed the first stage of her plan why is it so loosely woven she asked mark bristled loose my burel is the tightest weave in kingsbridge i know i didnt mean to sound critical but italian cloth feels so different yet they make it from our wool partly it depends on the weavers strength and how hard he can press down the batten to pack the wool i dont think the italian weavers are all stronger than you then its their machines the better the loom the closer the weave i was afraid of that the implication was that caris could not compete with highquality italian wool unless she bought italian looms which seemed impossible one problem at a time she told herself she paid mark counting out four shillings of which he would have to give about half to the women who had done the spinning caris had made eight shillings profit theoretically eight shillings would not pay for much work on the bridge and at this rate it would take years to weave all her fathers surplus wool is there any way we can produce cloth faster she said to mark madge answered there are other weavers in kingsbridge but most of them are committed to work for existing cloth merchants i can find you more outside the town though the larger villages often have a weaver with a loom he usually makes cloth for the villagers from their own yarn such men can easily switch to another job if the moneys good caris concealed her anxiety all right she said ill let you know meanwhile will you deliver these cloths to peter dyer for me of course ill take them now caris went home for dinner deep in thought to make any real difference she would have to spend most of what money her father had left if things went wrong they would be even worse off but what was the alternative her plan was risky but no one else had any kind of plan at all when she arrived home petranilla was serving a mutton stew edmund sat at the head of the table the financial setback of the fleece fair seemed to have affected him more severely than caris would have expected his normal exuberance was subdued and he often appeared thoughtful not to say distracted caris was worried about him i saw mark webber smashing up his hand mill she said as she sat down wheres the sense in that petranilla put her nose in the air godwyn is entirely within his rights she said those rights are out of date they havent been enforced for years where else does a priory do such things in st albans petranilla said triumphantly edmund said ive heard of st albans the townspeople periodically riot against the monastery kingsbridge priory is entitled to recoup the money it spent building mills petranilla argued just as you edmund want to get back the money youre putting into the bridge how would you feel if someone built a second bridge edmund did not answer her so caris did it would depend entirely on how soon it happened she said the priorys mills were built hundreds of years ago as were the warrens and fishponds no one has the right to hold back the development of the town for ever the prior has a right to collect his dues she said stubbornly well if he carries on like this there will be no one to collect dues from people will go and live in shiring theyre allowed hand mills there dont you understand that the needs of the priory are sacred petranilla said angrily the monks serve god by comparison with that the lives of the townspeople are insignificant is that what your son godwyn believes of course i was afraid of that dont you believe the priors work is sacred caris had no answer to that so she just shrugged and petranilla looked triumphant the dinner was good but caris was too tense to eat much as soon as the others had finished she said i have to go and see peter dyer petranilla protested are you going to spend more youve already given mark webber four shillings of your fathers money yes and the cloth is worth twelve shillings more than the wool was so ive made eight shillings no you havent petranilla said you havent sold the cloth yet petranilla was expressing doubts that caris shared in her more pessimistic moments but she was stung into denial i will sell it though especially if its dyed red and what will peter charge for dyeing and fulling four narrow dozens twenty shillings but the red cloth will be worth double the brown burel so well make another twentyeight shillings if you sell it and if you dont ill sell it her father intervened let her be he said to petranilla ive told her she can give this a try shiring castle stood on top of a hill it was the home of the county sheriff at the foot of the hill stood the gallows whenever there was a hanging the prisoner was brought down from the castle on a cart to be hanged in front of the church the square in which the gallows stood was also the market place the shiring fair was held here between the guild hall and a large timber building that was the wool exchange the bishops palace and numerous taverns also stood around the square this year because of the troubles at kingsbridge there were more stalls than ever and the fair spilled into the streets off the market place edmund had brought forty sacks of wool on ten carts and could get more brought from kingsbridge before the end of the week if necessary to cariss dismay it was not necessary he sold ten sacks on the first day then nothing until the end of the fair when he sold another ten by reducing the price below what he had paid she could not remember seeing him so down she put her four lengths of dull brownishred cloth on his stall and over the week yard by yard she sold three of the four look at it this way she said to her father on the last day of the fair before you had a sack of unsaleable wool and four shillings now youve got thirtysix shillings and a length of cloth but her cheerfulness was only for his benefit she was deeply depressed she had boasted bravely that she could sell cloth the result was not a complete failure but it was no triumph if she could not sell the cloth for more than it cost then she did not have the solution to the problem what was she going to do she left the stall and went to survey other cloth sellers the best cloth came from italy as always caris stopped at the stall of loro fiorentino cloth merchants such as loro were not wool buyers though they often worked closely with buyers caris knew that loro gave his english takings to buonaventura who used it to pay english merchants for their raw wool then when the wool reached florence buonaventuras family would sell it and with the proceeds pay back loros family that way they all avoided the hazards of transporting barrels of gold and silver coins across europe loro had on his stall only two rolls of cloth but the colours were much brighter than anything the local people could produce is this all you brought caris asked him of course not ive sold the rest she was surprised everyone else is having a bad fair he shrugged the finest cloth always sells an idea was taking shape in cariss head how much is the scarlet only seven shillings per yard mistress that was seven times the price of burel but who can afford it the bishop took a lot of my red lady philippa some blue and green a few daughters of the brewers and bakers in town some lords and ladies from the villages round about even when times are hard someone is prospering this vermilion will be so beautiful on you with a swift motion he unrolled the bale and draped a length over cariss shoulder marvellous see how everyone is looking at you already she smiled i can see why you sell so much she handled the cloth it was closely woven she already had a cloak of italian scarlet the one that she had inherited from her mother it was her favourite garment what dye do they use to get this red madder the same as everyone but how do they make it so bright its no secret they use alum it brightens the colour and also fixes it so it wont fade a cloak in this colour for you would be wonderful a joy for ever alum she repeated why dont english dyers use it its very expensive it comes from turkey such luxury is only for special women and the blue like your eyes her eyes were green but she did not correct him its such a deep colour english dyers use woad but we get indigo from bengal moorish traders bring it from india to egypt and then our italian merchants buy it in alexandria he smiled think how far it has travelled to complement your outstanding beauty yes said caris just think of that the riverside workshop of peter dyer was a house as big as edmunds but built of stone and with no interior walls or floors just a shell two iron cauldrons stood over great fires beside each was a hoist like the ones merthin made for building work these were used to lift huge sacks of wool or cloth and lower them into the vats the floors were permanently wet and the air was thick with steam the apprentices worked barefoot in their underdrawers because of the heat their faces running with sweat their hair gleaming with damp there was an acrid smell that bit at the back of cariss throat she showed peter her unsold length of cloth i want the bright scarlet that the italian cloths have she said thats what sells best peter was a lugubrious man who always looked injured no matter what you said to him now he nodded glumly as if acknowledging a justified criticism well dye it again with madder and with alum to fix the colour and make it brighter we dont use alum never have i dont know anyone who does caris cursed inwardly she had not thought to check this she had assumed a dyer would know everything about dyes cant you try it i havent got any caris sighed peter seemed to be one of those craftsmen for whom everything is impossible unless they have done it before suppose i could get you some where from winchester i suppose or london or perhaps from melcombe that was the nearest big port ships came from all over europe to melcombe if i had some i wouldnt know how to use it cant you find out who from ill try to find out then he shook his head pessimistically i dont know she did not want to quarrel with him he was the only largescale dyer in town well cross that bridge when we come to it she said in a conciliatory tone i wont take up any more of your time discussing it now first ill see if i can get some alum she left him who in town might know about alum she wished now that she had asked loro fiorentino more questions the monks ought to know about things like this but they were no longer allowed to talk to women she decided to see mattie wise mattie was forever mixing strange ingredients maybe alum was one of them more importantly if she did not know she would admit her ignorance unlike a monk or an apothecary who might make something up for fear of being thought foolish matties first words were how is your father he seems a bit shaken by the failure of the fleece fair caris said it was typical of mattie to know what she was worried about hes becoming forgetful he seems older take care of him said mattie hes a good man i know caris was not sure what mattie was getting at petranilla is a selfcentred cow i know that too mattie was grinding something with a mortar and pestle she pushed the bowl towards caris if you do this for me ill pour you a cup of wine thank you caris began to grind mattie poured yellow wine from a stone jug into two wooden cups why are you here youre not ill do you know what alum is yes in small quantities we use it as an astringent to close wounds it can also stop diarrhoea but in large quantities its poisonous like most poisons it makes you vomit there was alum in the potion i gave you last year what is it a herb no its an earth the moors mine it in turkey and africa tanners employ it in the preparation of leather sometimes i suppose you want to use it to dye cloth yes as always matties guesswork seemed supernaturally accurate it acts as a mordant it helps the dye to bite the wool and where do you get it i buy it in melcombe said mattie caris made the twoday journey to melcombe where she had been several times before accompanied by one of her fathers employees as a bodyguard at the quayside she found a merchant who dealt in spices cage birds musical instruments and all kinds of curiosities from remote parts of the world he sold her both the red dye made from the root of the madder plant cultivated in france and a type of alum known as spiralum that he said came from ethiopia he charged her seven shillings for a small barrel of madder and a pound for a sack of alum and she had no idea whether she was paying fair prices or not he sold her his entire stock and promised to get more from the next italian ship to come into port she asked him what quantities of dye and alum she should use but he did not know when she got home she began to dye pieces of her unsold cloth in a cooking pot petranilla objected to the smell so caris built a fire in the back yard she knew that she had to put the cloth in a solution of dye and boil it and peter dyer told her the correct strength of the dye solution however no one knew how much alum she needed or how she should use it she began a frustrating process of trial and error she tried soaking the cloth in alum before dyeing it putting the alum in at the same time as the dye and boiling the dyed cloth in a solution of alum afterwards she tried using the same quantity of alum as dye then more then less at matties suggestion she experimented with other ingredients oak galls chalk lime water vinegar urine she was short of time in all towns no one could sell cloth but members of the guild except during a fair when the normal rules were relaxed and all fairs were held in summer the last was st giless fair which took place on the downs to the east of winchester on st giless day september it was now midjuly so she had eight weeks she started early in the morning and worked until long after dark agitating the cloth continuously and lifting it in and out of the pot made her back ache her hands became red and sore from constant dipping in the harsh chemicals and her hair began to smell but despite the frustration she occasionally felt happy and sometimes she hummed or even sang as she worked old tunes whose words she could barely remember from childhood neighbours in their own back yards watched ner curiously across the fences now and again there came into her mind the thought is this my rate more than once she had said that she did not know what to do with her life but she might not have a free choice she was not to be allowed to be a physician becoming a wool merchant looked like a bad idea she did not want to enslave herself to a husband and children but she had never dreamed that she might end up as a dyer when she thought about it she knew that this was not what she wanted to do having started it she was determined to succeed but it was not going to be her destiny at first she could only get the cloth to turn brownish red or pale pink when she began to approach the right shade of scarlet she found maddeningly that it faded when she dried it in the sun or came out when washed she tried doubledyeing but the effect proved temporary peter told her rather late that the material would soak up dye more completely if she worked with the yarn before it was woven or even with raw fleeces and that improved the shade but not the fastness theres only one way to learn dyeing and thats from a master peter said several times they all thought that way caris realized prior godwyn learned medicine by reading books that were hundreds of years old and prescribed medicines without even looking at his patient elfric had punished merthin for carving the parable of the virgins in a new way peter had never even tried to dye cloth scarlet only mattie based her decisions on what she could see for herself rather than on some venerated authority cariss sister alice stood watching her late one evening with folded arms and pursed lips as darkness gathered in the corners of the yard the light of cariss fire reddened alices disapproving face how much of our fathers money have you spent on this foolishness she said caris added it up seven shillings for the madder a pound for the alum twelve shillings for the cloth thirtynine shillings god save us alice was horrified caris herself was daunted it was more than a years wages for most people in kingsbridge it is a lot but ill make more she said alice was angry you have no right to spend his money like this no right caris said i have his permission what more do i need hes showing signs of age his judgement is not what it was caris pretended not to know this his judgement is fine and a lot better than yours youre spending our inheritance is that whats bothering you dont worry im making you money i dont want to take the risk youre not taking the risk he is he shouldnt throw away money that should come to us tell him that alice went away defeated but caris was not as confident as she pretended she might never get it just right and then what would she and her father do when finally she found the right formula it was remarkably simple an ounce of madder and two ounces of alum for every three ounces of wool she boiled the wool in the alum first then added the madder to the pot without reboiling the liquid the extra ingredient was lime water she could hardly believe the result it was more successful than she could have hoped the red was bright almost like the italian red she felt sure it would fade and give her another disappointment but the colour remained the same through drying rewashing and fulling she gave peter the formula and under her close supervision he used all her remaining alum to dye twelve yards of bestquality wool cloth in one of his giant vats when it had been fulled caris paid a finisher to draw off the loose threads with a teasel the prickly head of a wild flower and to repair small blemishes she went to st giless fair with a bale of perfect bright red cloth as she was unrolling it she was addressed by a man with a london accent how much is that he said she looked at him his clothes were expensive without being ostentatious and she guessed he was wealthy but not noble trying to mask the trembling in her voice she said seven shillings a yard its the best no i meant how much for the whole cloth its twelve yards so that would be eightyfour shillings he rubbed the cloth between finger and thumb its not as closewoven as italian cloth but its not bad ill give you twentyseven gold florins the gold coin of florence was in common use because england had no gold currency of its own it was worth about three shillings thirtysix english silver pennies the londoner was offering to buy her entire cloth for only three shillings less than she would get selling it yard by yard but she sensed that he was not very serious about haggling otherwise he would have started lower no she said marvelling at her own temerity i want the full price all right he said immediately confirming her instinct she watched thrilled as he took out his purse a moment later she held in her hand twentyeight gold florins she examined one carefully it was a bit larger than a silver penny on one side was st john the baptist the patron saint of florence and on the other the flower of florence she placed it on a balance to compare its weight with that of a newminted florin her father kept for the purpose the coin was good thank you she said hardly believing her success im harry mercer of cheapside london he said my father is the largest cloth merchant in england when youve got more of this scarlet come to london well buy as much as you can bring us lets weave it all she said to her father when she returned home youve got forty sacks of wool left well turn it all into red cloth its a big enterprise he said thoughtfully caris was sure her scheme would work there are plenty of weavers and theyre all poor peter isnt the only dyer in kingsbridge we can teach the others to use the alum others will copy you once the secret gets out she knew he was right to think of snags but all the same she felt impatient let them copy she said they can make money too he was not going to be pushed into anything the price will come down if theres a lot of cloth for sale it will have to fall a long way before the business becomes unprofitable he nodded thats true but can you sell that much in kingsbridge and shiring there arent that many rich people then ill take it to london all right he smiled youre so determined its a good plan but even if it were a bad one youd probably make it work she went immediately to mark webbers house and arranged for him to begin work on another sack of wool she also arranged for madge to take one of edmunds oxcarts and four sacks of wool and go around neighbouring villages looking for weavers but the rest of cariss family were not happy next day alice came to dinner as they sat down petranilla said to edmund alice and i think you should reconsider your clothmaking project caris wanted him to tell her that the decision was made and it was too late to go back but instead he said mildly really tell me why youll be risking just about every penny youve got thats why most of its at risk now he said ive got a warehouse full of wool that i cant sell but you could make a bad situation worse ive decided to take that chance alice broke in its not fair on me why not caris is spending my inheritance his face darkened im not dead yet he said petranilla clamped her mouth shut recognizing the undertone in his low voice but alice did not notice how angry he was and ploughed on we have to think about the future she said why should caris be allowed to spend my birthright because its not yours yet and perhaps it never will be you cant just throw away money that should come to me i wont be told what to do with my money especially by my children he said and his voice was so taut with anger that even alice noticed more quietly she said i didnt intend to annoy you he grunted it was not much of an apology but he could never remain grumpy for long lets have dinner and say no more about it he said and caris knew that her project had survived another day after dinner she went to see peter dyer to warn him of the large quantity of work coming his way it cant be done he said that took her by surprise he always looked gloomy but he normally did what she wanted dont worry you wont have to dye it all she said ill give some of the work to others its not the dyeing he said its the fulling why were not allowed to full the cloth ourselves prior godwyn has issued a new edict we have to use the priorys fulling mill well then well use it its too slow the machinery is old and keeps breaking down its been repaired again and again so the wood is a mixture of new and old which never sorts well its no faster than a man treading in a bath of water but theres only one mill it will barely cope with the normal work of kingsbridge weavers and dyers this was maddening surely her whole scheme could not fail because of a stupid ruling by her cousin godwyn she said indignantly but if the mill cant do the work the prior must permit us to tread the cloth by foot peter shrugged tell him that i will she marched off towards the priory but before she got there she thought again the hall of the priors house was used for his meetings with townspeople but all the same it would be unusual for a woman to go in alone without an appointment and godwyn was increasingly touchy about such things moreover a straight confrontation might not be the best way to change his mind she realized she would do better to think this through she returned to her house and sat down with her father in the parlour young godwyn is on weak ground here edmund said immediately there never was a charge for using the fulling mill according to legend it was built by a townsman jack builder for the great prior philip and when jack died philip gave the town the right to use the mill in perpetuity why did people stop using it it fell into disrepair and i think there was an argument about who should pay for its upkeep the argument was never resolved and people went back to treading cloth themselves why then he has no right to charge a fee nor to force people to use it no indeed edmund sent a message to the priory asking when it might be convenient for godwyn to see him and the reply came back saying he was free right away so edmund and caris crossed the street and went to the priors house godwyn had changed a lot in a year caris thought there was no boyish eagerness left he seemed wary as if he expected them to be aggressive she was beginning to wonder whether he had the strength of character to be prior philemon was with him pathetically eager as ever to fetch chairs and pour drinks but with a new touch of assurance in his manner the look of someone who knew he belonged here so philemon youre an uncle now caris said what do you think of your new nephew sam im a novice monk he said prissily we give up all worldly relations caris shrugged she knew he was fond of his sister gwenda but if he wanted to pretend otherwise she was not going to argue edmund laid out the problem starkly for godwyn work on the bridge will have to stop if the wool merchants of kingsbridge cant improve their fortunes happily we have come up with a new source of income caris has discovered how to produce highquality scarlet cloth only one thing stands in the way of the success of this new enterprise the fulling mill why said godwyn the scarlet cloth can be fulled at the mill apparently not its old and inefficient it can barely handle the existing production of cloth it has no capacity for extra either you build a new fulling mill out of the question godwyn interrupted i have no spare cash for that sort of thing very well then said edmund youll have to permit people to full cloth in the old way by putting it in a bath of water and stamping on it with their bare feet the look that came over godwyns face was familiar to caris it was compounded of resentment injured pride and mulish obstinacy in childhood he had looked like that whenever he was opposed it meant he would try to bully the other children into submission or failing that stamp his foot and go home wanting his own way was only part of it he seemed caris thought to feel humiliated by disagreement as if the idea that someone might think him wrong was too wounding to be borne whatever the explanation she knew as soon as she saw the look that he was not going to be reasonable i knew you would oppose me he said petulantly to edmund you seem to think the priory exists for the benefit of kingsbridge youll just have to realize that its the other way around edmund rapidly became exasperated dont you see that we depend on one another we thought you understood that interrelationship thats why we helped you get elected i was elected by the monks not the merchants the town may depend on the priory but there was a priory here before there was a town and we can exist without you you can exist perhaps but as an isolated outpost rather than as the throbbing heart of a bustling city caris put in you must want kingsbridge to prosper godwyn why else would you have gone to london to oppose earl roland i went to the royal court to defend the ancient rights of the priory as i am trying to do here and now edmund said indignantly this is treachery we supported you as prior because you led us to believe you would build a bridge i owe you nothing godwyn replied my mother sold her house to send me to the university where was my rich uncle then caris was amazed that godwyn was still resentful over what had happened ten years ago edmunds expression became coldly hostile i dont think you have the right to force people to use the fulling mill he said a glance passed between godwyn and philemon and caris realized they knew this godwyn said there may have been times when the prior generously allowed the townspeople to use the mill without charge it was the gift of prior philip to the town i know nothing of that there must be a document in your records godwyn became angry the townspeople have allowed the mill to fall into disrepair so that the priory has to pay to put it right that is enough to annul any gift edmund was right caris realized godwyn was on weak ground he knew about prior philips gift but he intended to ignore it edmund tried again surely we can settle this between us i will not back down from my edict godwyn said it would make me appear weak that was what really bothered him caris realized he was frightened that the townspeople would disrespect him if he changed his mind his obstinacy came paradoxically from a kind of timidity edmund said neither of us wants the trouble and expense of another visit to the royal court godwyn bristled are you threatening me with the royal court im trying to avoid it but caris closed her eyes praying that the two men would not push their argument to the brink her prayer was not answered but what said godwyn challengingly edmund sighed but yes if you force the townspeople to use the fulling mill and prohibit home fulling i will appeal to the king so be it said godwyn the deer was a young female a year or two old sleek across the haunches well muscled under a soft leather skin she was on the far side of a clearing pushing her long neck through the branches of a bush to reach a patch of scrubby grass ralph fitzgerald and alan fernhill were on horseback the hooves of their mounts muffled by the carpet of wet autumn leaves and their dogs were trained to silence because of this and perhaps because she was concentrating on straining to reach her fodder the deer did not hear their approach until it was too late ralph saw her first and pointed across the clearing alan was carrying his longbow grasping it and the reins in his left hand with the speed of long practice he fitted an arrow to the string in a heartbeat and shot the dogs were slower only when they heard the thrum of the bowstring and the whistle of the arrow as it flew through the air did they react barley the bitch froze in place head up ears erect and blade her puppy now grown larger than his mother uttered a low startled woof the arrow was a yard long flighted with swan feathers its tip was two inches of solid iron with a socket into which the shaft fitted tightly it was a hunting arrow with a sharp point a battle arrow would have had a square head so that it would punch through armour without being deflected alans shot was good but not perfect it struck the deer low in the neck she jumped with all four feet shocked presumably by the sudden agonizing stab her head came up out of the bush for an instant ralph thought she was going to fall down dead but a moment later she bounded away the arrow was still buried in her neck but the blood was oozing rather than spurting from the wound so it must have lodged in her muscles missing the major blood vessels the dogs leaped forward as if they too had been shot from bows and the two horses followed without urging ralph was on griff his favourite hunter he felt the rush of excitement that was what he mainly lived for it was a tingling in the nerves a constriction in the neck an irresistible impulse to yell at the top of his voice a thrill so like sexual excitement that he could hardly have said what the difference was men such as ralph existed to fight the king and his barons made them lords and knights and gave them villages and lands to rule over for a reason so that they would be able to provide themselves with horses squires weapons and armour whenever the king needed an army but there was not a war every year sometimes two or three years would go by without so much as a minor police action on the borders of rebellious wales or barbarian scotland knights needed something to do in the interim they had to keep fit and maintain their horsemanship and perhaps most important of all their blood lust soldiers had to kill and they did it better when they longed for it hunting was the answer all noblemen from the king down to minor lords such as ralph hunted whenever they got the chance often several times a week they enjoyed it and it ensured they were fit for battle whenever called upon ralph hunted with earl roland on his frequent visits to earlscastle and often joined lord williams hunt at casterham when he was at his own village of wigleigh he went out with his squire alan in the forests round about they usually killed boar there was not much meat on the wild pigs but they were exciting to hunt because they put up a good fight ralph also went after foxes and the occasional rare wolf but a deer was best agile fast and a hundred pounds of good meat to take home now ralph thrilled to the feel of griff beneath him the horses weight and strength the powerful action of its muscles and the drumbeat of its tread the deer disappeared into the vegetation but barley knew where it had gone and the horses followed the dogs ralph carried a spear ready in his right hand a long shaft of ash with a firehardened point as griff swerved and jumped ralph ducked under overhanging branches and swayed with the horse his boots firmly in the stirrups keeping his seat effortlessly by the pressure of his knees in the undergrowth the horses were not as nimble as the deer and they fell behind but the dogs had the advantage and ralph heard frantic barking as they closed in then there was a lull and in a few moments ralph found out why the deer had broken out of the vegetation on to a pathway and was leaving the dogs behind here however the horses had the advantage and they quickly passed the dogs and began to gain on the deer ralph could see that the beast was weakening he saw blood on its rump and deduced that one of the dogs had got a bite its gait became irregular as it struggled to get away it was a sprinter made for the sudden quick dash and it could not keep up its initial pace for long his blood raced as he closed on his prey he tightened his grip on the lance it took a great deal of strength to force a wooden point into the tough body of a big animal the skin was leathery the muscles dense the bones hard the neck was the softest target if you could contrive to miss the vertebrae and hit the jugular vein you had to choose the exact moment then thrust quickly with all your might seeing the horses almost upon it the deer made a desperate turn into the bushes this gave it a few seconds respite the horses slowed as they crashed through undergrowth over which the deer had bounded without pause but the dogs caught up again and ralph saw that the deer could not go much farther the usual pattern was that the dogs would inflict more and more wounds slowing the deer until the horses could catch it and the hunter could deliver the death blow but on this occasion there was an accident when the dogs and the horses were almost upon the deer she dodged sideways blade the younger dog went after her with more enthusiasm than sense and swerved in front of griff the horse was going too fast to stop or even avoid the dog and kicked him with a mighty foreleg the dog was a mastiff weighing seventy or eighty pounds and the impact caused the horse to stumble ralph was thrown he let go of his spear as he flew through the air his greatest fear in that instant was that his horse would fall on him but he saw in the moment before he landed that griff had somehow regained his balance ralph fell into a thorn bush his hands and face were scratched painfully but the branches broke his fall all the same he was enraged alan reined in barley went after the deer but returned in a few moments the beast had obviously got away ralph struggled to his feet cursing alan caught griff then dismounted holding both horses blade lay motionless on the dead leaves blood dripping from his mouth he had been struck on the head by griffs iron horseshoe barley went up to him sniffed nudged him with her nose and licked the blood on his face then turned away looking bewildered alan prodded the dog with the toe of his boot there was no response blade was not breathing dead alan said damn fool dog deserved to die ralph said they walked the horses through the woods looking for a place to rest after a while ralph heard running water following the sound he came to a fastflowing stream he recognized the stretch of water they were only a little way beyond the fields of wigleigh lets have some refreshment he said alan tied up the horses then took from his saddlebag a stoppered jug two wooden cups and a canvas sack of food barley went to the stream and lapped the cold water thirstily ralph sat on the bank resting his back against a tree alan sat beside him and handed him a cup of ale and a wedge of cheese ralph took the drink and refused the food alan knew his boss in a bad mood and said nothing while ralph drank wordlessly refilling ralphs cup from the jug in the silence they both heard female voices alan looked at ralph with a raised eyebrow barley growled ralph stood up shushing the dog and walked softly in the direction of the sound alan followed a few yards downstream ralph stopped looking through the vegetation a small group of village women were doing laundry on the near bank of the stream where the water flowed fast over an outcrop of rocks it was a damp october day cool but not cold and they wore their sleeves rolled up and the skirts of their shifts raised to thigh level to keep them dry ralph studied them one by one there was gwenda all muscular forearms and calves with her baby now four months old strapped to her back he identified peg the wife of perkin scrubbing her husbands underdrawers with a stone his own housemaid vira was there a hardfaced woman of about thirty who had looked so stonily at him when he patted her arse that he never touched her again the voice that he had heard belonged to the widow huberts a great talker no doubt because she lived alone the widow was standing in midstream calling out to the others carrying on a gossipy conversation at a distance and there was annet she stood on a rock washing some small garment bending to dip it in the stream then standing upright to scrub it she had long white legs that disappeared enchantingly into her ruckedup dress every time she bent over her neckline fell open to reveal the pale fruit of her small breasts hanging like temptation on a tree her fair hair was wet at the ends and there was a petulant look on her pretty face as if she felt she had not been born for this kind of work they had been there for some time ralph guessed and their presence might have remained unknown to him had not widow huberts raised her voice to call out he lowered himself to the ground and knelt behind a bush peering through the leafless twigs alan squatted beside him ralph liked spying on women he had often done it as an adolescent they scratched themselves sprawled on the ground with their legs apart and talked about things they would never speak of if they knew a man was listening in fact they acted like men he feasted his eyes on the unsuspecting women of his village and strained to hear what they were saying he watched gwenda looking at her small strong body remembering her naked kneeling on the bed and reliving how it had felt to hold her hips and pull her to him he recalled how her attitude had changed at first she had been coldly passive struggling to conceal her resentment and distaste for the act she was performing then he had seen a slow alteration the skin on her neck had flushed her chest had betrayed her excited breathing and she had bent her head and closed her eyes in what seemed to him to be a mixture of shame and pleasure the memory made him breathe faster and brought out a film of perspiration on his brow despite the chill october air he wondered if he would get another chance to lie with gwenda too soon the women prepared to depart they folded the damp washing and packed it into baskets or wrapped it in bundles to be balanced on their heads and then began to move away along the pathway beside the stream then an argument began between annet and her mother annet had done only half the laundry she had brought she was proposing to take the dirty half home and it seemed peg thought she should stay and finish it in the end peg stomped off and annet stayed looking sulky ralph could hardly believe his luck in a low voice he said to alan well have some fun with her sneak around and cut off her retreat alan disappeared ralph watched as annet dipped the remaining laundry perfunctorily in the stream then sat on the bank staring at the water grumpily when he judged that the other women were out of earshot and alan must be in place he stood up and walked forward she heard him pushing through the undergrowth and looked up startled he enjoyed seeing the expression on her face change from surprise and curiosity to fear as she realized she was alone with him in the forest she leaped to her feet but by that time he was next to her holding her arm in a light but firm grip hello annet he said what are you doing here all alone she looked over his shoulder hoping he guessed that he might be accompanied by others who would restrain him and her face registered dismay when she saw only barley im going home she said my mothers just left dont rush he said you look so attractive like this with your hair damp and your knees bare she tried hastily to push the skirt of her dress down with his free hand he held the point of her chin and made her look at him how about a smile he said dont look so worried i wouldnt harm you im your lord she attempted a smile im just a bit flustered she said you startled me she mustered a trace of her habitual coquetry perhaps you would escort me home she said with a simper a girl needs protection in the forest oh ill protect you ill look after you much better than that fool wulfric or your husband he took his hand from her chin and grasped her breast it was as he remembered small and firm he released her arm so that he could use both hands one on each breast but as soon as he let go of her she fled he laughed as she ran along the path and into the trees a moment later he heard her give a cry of shock he stayed where he was and alan brought her to him her arm twisted behind her back so that her chest stuck out invitingly ralph drew his knife a sharp dagger with a blade a foot long take off your dress he said alan let her go but she did not immediately comply please lord she said ive always shown you respect take off your dress or ill cut your cheeks and scar you for ever it was a wellchosen threat for a vain woman and she gave in immediately she began to cry as she lifted the plain brown wool shift over her head at first she held the crumpled garment in front of her covering her nakedness but alan snatched it from her and threw it aside ralph stared at her naked body she stood with her eyes down tears on her face she had slim hips with a prominent bush of darkblonde hair wulfric never saw you like this did he ralph said she shook her head in negation without raising her eyes he thrust his hand between her legs did he ever touch you here she said please lord im a married woman all the better youve no virginity to lose nothing to worry about lie down she tried to back away from him and bumped into alan who expertly tripped her so that she fell on her back ralph grabbed her ankles so that she could not get up but she wriggled desperately hold her down ralph said to alan alan forced her head down then put his knees on her upper arms and his hands on her shoulders ralph got his cock out and rubbed it to make it harder then he knelt between annets thighs she began to scream but no one heard her fortunately gwenda was one of the first people to see annet after the incident gwenda and peg brought home the laundry and hung it to dry around the fire in the kitchen of perkins house gwenda was still working as a labourer for perkin but now in autumn when there was less to do in the fields she helped peg with her domestic chores when they had dealt with the laundry they began to prepare the midday meal for perkin rob billy howard and wulfric after an hour peg said what can have happened to annet ill go and see gwenda first checked on her baby sammy was lying in a basketwork crib wrapped in an old bit of brown blanket his alert dark eyes watching the smoke from the fire gathering in curls under the ceiling gwenda kissed his forehead then went to look for annet she retraced her steps across the windy fields lord ralph and alan fernhill galloped past her heading up to the village their days hunting apparently cut short gwenda entered the forest and followed the short path that led to the spot where the woman did laundry before she got there she met annet coming the other way are you all right gwenda said your mother is worried im fine annet replied gwenda could tell something was wrong what has happened nothing annet would not meet her eye nothing happened leave me alone gwenda stood squarely in front of annet and looked her up and down her face told gwenda unmistakably that there had been some calamity at first glance she did not appear to be physically hurt though most of her body was covered by the long wool shift but then gwenda saw dark smears on her dress that looked like bloodstains gwenda recalled ralph and alan galloping past did lord ralph do something to you im going home annet tried to push past gwenda gwenda grabbed her arm to stop her she did not squeeze hard but nevertheless annet cried out in pain her hand flying to her upper arm youre hurt gwenda exclaimed annet burst into tears gwenda put her arm around annets shoulders come home she said tell your mother about it annet shook her head im not telling anyone she said too late for that gwenda thought walking annet back to perkins house gwenda ran over the possibilities in her mind clearly annet had suffered some kind of assault she might have been attacked by one or more travellers though there was no road nearby outlaws were always a possibility but it was a long time since any had been seen near wigleigh no the likeliest suspects were ralph and alan peg was brisk she sat annet down on a stool and pulled her dress down over her shoulders both upper arms showed swollen red bruises someone held you down peg said angrily annet made no reply peg persisted am i right answer me child or youll be in worse trouble did someone hold you down annet nodded how many men come on out with it annet did not speak but held up two fingers peg reddened with fury did they fuck you annet nodded who were they annet shook her head gwenda knew why she did not want to say it was dangerous for a serf to accuse a lord of a crime she said to peg i saw ralph and alan riding away peg said to annet was it them ralph and alan annet nodded pegs voice fell almost to a whisper i suppose alan held you down while ralph did it annet nodded again peg softened now that she had got the truth she put her arms around her daughter and hugged her you poor child she said my poor baby annet began to sob gwenda left the house the men would be home soon for their midday dinner and they would quickly find out that ralph had raped annet annets father her brother her husband and her former lover would be mad with rage perkin was too old to do anything foolish rob would do what perkin told him and billy howard probably was not brave enough to make trouble but wulfric would be incandescent he would kill ralph and then he would be hanged gwenda had to turn the course of events otherwise she would lose her husband she hurried through the village speaking to no one and went to the manor house there she hoped to be told that ralph and alan had finished their dinner and gone out again but it was a little too early and to her dismay they were still at home she found them in the stable behind the house looking at a horse with an infected hoof normally she was uncomfortable in the presence of ralph or alan for she felt sure that whenever they looked at her they remembered the sight of her kneeling naked on the bed at the bell in kingsbridge but today the thought hardly entered her head somehow she had to make them leave the village now before wulfric found out what they had done what was she going to say for a moment she was struck dumb then in desperation she said lord there was a messenger here from earl roland ralph was surprised when was this an hour ago ralph looked at the groom who was holding the horses foot up for inspection the man said no one came here naturally a messenger would have come to the manor house and spoken to the lords servants ralph said to gwenda why did he give this message to you she improvised desperately i met him on the road just outside the village he asked for lord ralph and i told him you were out hunting and you would be back for dinner but he wouldnt stay this was unusual behaviour for a messenger who would normally stop to eat and drink and rest his horse ralph said why was he in such a hurry inventing excuses extempore gwenda said he had to get to cowford by sundown i didnt make so bold as to question him ralph grunted the last part was plausible a messenger from earl roland was not likely to subject himself to crossexamination by a peasant woman why didnt you tell me this earlier i came across the fields to meet you but you didnt see me and galloped past oh i think i did see you no matter whats the message earl roland summons you to earlscastle as soon as possible she took a breath and added another layer of implausibiiity the messenger said to tell you not to wait to eat your dinner but take fresh horses and leave at once it was barely credible but she had to get ralph away before wulfric showed up really did he say why he needs me in such a terrible hurry no hm ralph looked thoughtful and said nothing for a few moments gwenda said anxiously so will you go now he glared at her thats no concern of yours its just that i wouldnt want it to be said that i hadnt made the urgency clear enough oh wouldnt you well i dont care what you would or wouldnt want be off gwenda had to go she returned to perkins house she arrived just as the men were coming in from the fields sam was quiet and happy in his crib annet was sitting in the same place with her dress pulled down to show the bruises on her arms peg said accusingly where have you been gwenda did not answer and peg was distracted by perkin coming in and saying whats this whats the matter with annet peg said she had the misfortune to meet ralph and alan when she was alone in the forest perkins face darkened with anger why was she alone its my fault peg said and she began to cry only she was so lazy about the laundry as she always is and i made her stay back and finish it after the other women went home and thats when those two animals must have come along we saw them a while ago riding across brookfield perkin said they must have just come from the place he looked frightened this is very dangerous he said its the kind of thing that can ruin a family but weve done nothing wrong peg protested ralphs guilt will make him hate us for our innocence that was probably true gwenda realized perkin was shrewd beneath his obsequious manner annets husband billy howard came in wiping his muddy hands on his shirt her brother rob was close behind billy looked at his wifes bruises and said what happened to you peg answered for her it was ralph and alan billy stared at his wife what did they do to you annet lowered her eyes and said nothing ill kill them both billy said furiously but it was obviously an idle threat billy was a mildmannered man slim built and had never been known to fight even when drunk wulfric was the last to come through the door too late gwenda realized how attractive annet was looking she had a long neck and pretty shoulders and the tops of her breasts were showing the ugly bruises only emphasized her other charms wulfric stared at her with undisguised admiration he never could hide his feelings then after a moment he registered the angry bruises and he frowned billy said did they rape you gwenda was watching wulfric as he grasped the significance of the scene his expression registered shock and dismay and his fair skin flushed with emotion billy said did they woman gwenda felt a surge of compassion for the unlovable annet why did everyone feel they had the right to ask her bullying questions at last annet answered billys question with a silent nod wulfrics face was suffused with black rage who he growled billy said this is none of your business wulfric go home perkin said tremulously i dont want trouble we mustnt let this destroy us billy looked angrily at his fatherinlaw what are you saying that we should do nothing if we make an enemy of lord ralph we could suffer for the rest of our lives but hes raped annet wulfric said incredulously ralph did this perkin said god will punish him so will i by christ said wulfric gwenda said please wulfric no wulfric made for the door gwenda went to him frantic with fright and grabbed his arm only a few minutes had gone by since she had given ralph the fake message even if he believed it she did not know how seriously he would take the urgency there was a good chance he had not left the village yet dont go to the manor house she pleaded with wulfric please he shook her off roughly get away from me he said look at your baby she cried pointing at sammy in the crib are you going to leave him without a father wulfric went out gwenda followed and the other men came after wulfric marched through the village like the angel of death fists clenched at his sides staring straight ahead his face twisted into a rictus of fury other villagers on their way home for the midday meal spoke to him but got no reply some followed him in the few minutes it took to walk to the manor house he gathered a small crowd nathan reeve came out of his house and asked gwenda what was happening but all she could say was stop him someone please it was useless none of them could have restrained wulfric even if they had dared to try he threw open the front door of the manor house and marched in gwenda was right behind him and the crowd pushed through after them the housekeeper vira said indignantly youre supposed to knock where is your master said wulfric vira saw the expression on wulfrics face and looked scared he went to the stable she said hes about to leave for earlscastle wulfric pushed past her and went through the kitchen as he and gwenda stepped out of the back door they saw ralph and alan mounting up gwenda could have screamed they were just seconds too early wulfric jumped forward with desperate inspiration gwenda stuck out her foot and hooked it around wulfrics ankle wulfric fell flat on his face in the mud ralph did not see either of them he kicked his horse and it trotted out of the yard alan saw them read the situation decided to avoid trouble and followed ralph as they left the yard alan urged his horse into a canter passing ralph whereupon ralphs horse eagerly increased its pace wulfric leaped to his feet cursing and chased them gwenda ran after him wulfric could not catch the horses but gwenda was terrified that ralph would look behind and rein in to see what the fuss was about but the two men were enjoying the lively energy of fresh horses and without a backward glance they raced away along the track that led out of the village in seconds they disappeared wulfric slumped on his knees in the mud gwenda caught up with him and took his arm to help him to his feet he pushed her aside so forcefully that she staggered and almost fell she was shocked it was completely out of character for him to be rough with her you tripped me up he said as he got to his feet unaided i saved your life she said he stared at her with hatred in his eyes and said i will never forgive you when ralph reached earlscastle he was told that roland had not sent for him at all never mind urgently the rooks on the battlements laughed mockingly at him alan conjectured an explanation its to do with annet he said just as we left i saw wulfric coming out of the back door of the manor house i thought nothing of it at the time but maybe he was intending to confront you ill bet he was ralph said he touched the long dagger at his belt you should have told me id welcome an excuse to stick my knife in his belly and no doubt gwenda knows that so perhaps she invented the message to get you away from her murderous husband of course said ralph that would explain why no one else saw this messenger he never existed crafty bitch she should be punished but it might be difficult she would probably say she did it for the best and ralph could hardly argue that she had been wrong to prevent her husband attacking the lord of the manor worse if he made a fuss about her deception he would call attention to the fact that she had outwitted him no there would be no formal penalty though he might find unofficial ways to chastise her as he was at earlscastle he took the opportunity to go hunting with the earl and his entourage and he forgot about annet until the end of the second day when roland called him into his private chamber only the earls clerk father jerome was with him roland did not ask ralph to sit down the priest of wigleigh is here he said ralph was surprised father gaspard at earlscastle roland did not bother to answer these rhetorical questions he complains that you raped a woman called annet the wife of billy howard one of your serfs ralphs heart missed a beat he had not imagined the peasants would have the nerve to complain to the earl it was very difficult for a serf to accuse a lord in a court of law but they could be sly and someone in wigleigh had cleverly persuaded the priest to make the complaint ralph put on an expression of carelessness rubbish he said all right i lay with her but she was willing he gave roland a mantoman grin more than willing an expression of distaste came over rolands face and he turned to father jerome with an inquiring look jerome was an educated ambitious young man a type ralph particularly disliked he had a snooty look as he said the girl is here woman i should say though she is only nineteen she has massive bruises on her arms and a bloodstained dress she says you encountered her in the forest and your squire knelt on her to hold her down and a man called wulfric is here to say that you were seen riding away from the scene ralph guessed it was wulfric who had persuaded father gaspard to come here to earlscastle its not true he said trying to put a note of indignation into his voice jerome looked sceptical why would she lie maybe someone saw us and told her husband he gave her the bruises i expect she cried rape to stop him beating her then she stained her dress with chicken blood roland sighed its a bit oafish isnt it ralph ralph was not sure what he meant did he expect his men to behave like damned monks roland went on i was warned youd be like this my daughterinlaw always said youd give me problems philippa lady philippa to you enlightenment dawned on ralph and he said incredulously is that why you didnt promote me after i saved your life because a woman was against me what sort of an army will you have if you let girls pick your men youre right of course and thats why i went against her judgement in the end what women never realize is that a man without some bile in him is good for nothing but tilling the land we cant take milksops into battle but she was right when she warned me that you would cause trouble i dont want to be bothered in peacetime with damned priests whining about serfs wives being raped dont do it again i dont care if you lie with the peasant women if it comes to that i dont care if you lie with the men but if you take a mans wife willing or otherwise be prepared to compensate the husband in some way most peasants can be bought just dont let it become my problem yes lord jerome said what am i to do with this gaspard let me see roland said thoughtfully wigleigh is on the edge of my territory not far from my son williams landholding is it not yes ralph said how far were you from the border when you met this girl a mile we were only just outside wigleigh no matter he turned to jerome everyone will know this is just an excuse but tell father gaspard that the incident took place in lord williams territory so i cant adjudicate very good my lord ralph said what if they go to william i doubt that they will but if they persist youll have to come to some arrangement with william the peasants will tire of complaining eventually ralph nodded relieved for a moment he had suffered the dread thought that he had made a terrible error of judgement and that after all he might be made to pay the price for raping annet but in the end he had got away with it as he had expected to thank you my lord he said he wondered what his brother would say about this the thought filled him with shame but perhaps merthin would never find out we must complain to lord william said wulfric when they got back to wigleigh the entire village had gathered in the church to discuss the matter father gaspard and nathan reeve were there but somehow wulfric seemed to be the leader despite his youth he had gone to the front leaving gwenda and baby sammy in the crowd gwenda was praying that they would decide to drop the matter it was not that she wanted ralph to go unpunished on the contrary she would have liked to see him boiled alive she herself had killed two men for merely threatening her with rape something she remembered every now and again during the discussion with a shudder but she did not like wulfric taking the leading role it was partly because he was driven by the unquenched flame of his feeling for annet which hurt and saddened gwenda but more importantly she feared for him the enmity between him and ralph had already cost wulfric his inheritance what other vengeance would ralph take perkin said im the father of the victim and i dont want any more trouble over this its very dangerous to complain of the actions of a lord he always finds a way to punish the complainers right or wrong lets drop it too late for that said wulfric weve already complained or at least our priest has theres nothing to be gained by backing down now weve gone far enough perkin argued ralph has been embarrassed in front of his earl he knows now that he cant do just whatever he pleases on the contrary said wulfric he thinks hes got away with it im afraid hell do it again no woman in the village will be safe gwenda herself had said to wulfric all the things perkin was saying wulfric had not answered her he had hardly spoken to her since she tripped him up at the back door of the manor house at first she had told herself that he was merely sulking because he had felt foolish she had expected him to have forgotten about it by the time he returned from earlscastle but she had been wrong he had not touched her in bed or out of it for a week he rarely met her eye and he talked to her in monosyllables and grunts it was beginning to depress her nathan reeve said youll never win against ralph serfs never overcome lords im not so sure wulfric said everyone has enemies we might not be the only people who would like to see ralph reined in perhaps we will never see him convicted in court but we must inflict the maximum of trouble and embarrassment on him if we want him to hesitate before doing this sort of thing again several villagers nodded agreement but no one spoke in support of wulfric and gwenda began to hope that he would lose the argument however her husband was nothing if not determined and he now turned to the priest what do you think father gaspard gaspard was young poor and earnest he had no fear of the nobility he was not ambitious he did not want to become a bishop and join the ruling class so he felt no need to please aristocrats he said annet has been cruelly violated the peace of our village has been criminally broken and lord ralph has committed a wicked vile sin which he must confess and repent for the sake of the victim for our own selfrespect and to save lord ralph from the flames of hell we must go to lord william there was a rumble of assent wulfric looked at billy howard and annet sitting side by side in the end gwenda thought people would probably do what annet and billy wanted i dont want trouble billy said but we should finish what weve started for the sake of all the women in the village annet did not raise her eyes from the floor but she nodded assent and gwenda realized with dismay that wulfric had won well you got what you wanted she said to him as they left the church he grunted she persisted so i suppose you will continue to risk your life for the honour of billy howards wife while refusing to speak to your own wife he said nothing sammy sensed the hostility and began to cry gwenda felt desperate she had moved heaven and earth to get the man she loved she had married him and had his baby and now he was treating her like an enemy her father had never behaved this way to her mother not that jobys behaviour was a model for anyone but she had no idea how to deal with him she had tried using sammy holding him in one arm while touching wulfric with the other hand in an attempt to win back his affection by associating herself with the baby boy he loved but he just moved away rejecting them both she had even tried sex pressing her breasts against his back at night brushing her hand across his belly touching his penis but it did not work as she might have known remembering how resistant he had been last summer before annet married billy now in frustration she cried out what is wrong with you i only tried to save your life you should not have done it he said if id let you kill ralph youd have been hanged you had no right what does it matter if i had the right or not thats your fathers philosophy isnt it she was startled what do you mean your father believes it doesnt matter whether or not he has the right to do something if its for the best he does it like selling you to feed his family they sold me to be raped i tripped you up to save you from the gallows thats completely different as long as you go on telling yourself that youll never understand him or me she realized she was not going to win back his affection by trying to prove him wrong well i dont understand then you took away my power to make my own decisions you treated me the way your father treated you as a thing to be controlled not as a person it doesnt matter whether i was right or wrong what matters is that it was up to me to decide not you but you cant see that just as your father cant see what he took away from you when he sold you she still thought the two things were completely different but she did not argue the point because she was beginning to see what had made him angry he was passionate about his independence something she could empathize with for she felt the same way and she had robbed him of that she said falteringly i i think i understand do you at any rate ill try not to do anything of that kind again good she only half believed she had been wrong but she was desperate to end the war between them so she said im very sorry all right he wasnt saying much but she sensed he might be softening you know that i dont want you to complain to lord william about ralph but if youre determined to i wont try to stop you im glad in fact she said i might be able to help you oh he said how the home of lord william and lady philippa at casterham had once been a castle there was still a round stone keep with battlements though it was in ruins and used as a cowshed the wall around the courtyard was intact but the moat had dried up and the ground in the slight remaining dip was used to grow vegetables and fruit trees where once there had been a drawbridge a simple ramp now led up to the gatehouse gwenda carrying sammy passed under the arch of the gatehouse with father gaspard billy howard annet and wulfric a young manatarms was lolling on a bench presumably on guard but he saw the priests robe and did not challenge them the relaxed atmosphere encouraged gwenda she was hoping to get a private audience with lady philippa they entered the house by the main door and found themselves in a traditional great hall with high windows like those of a church it seemed to take up about half the total space of the house the rest presumably would be personal chambers in the modern fashion which emphasized the privacy of the noble family and played down military defences a middleaged man in a leather tunic was sitting at a table counting notches on a tally stick he glanced up at them finished his count made a note on a slate then said good day to you strangers good day master bailiff said gaspard deducing the mans occupation weve come to see lord william hes expected back by suppertime father the bailiff said politely whats your business with him may i ask gaspard began to explain and gwenda slipped back outside she went around the house to the domestic end there was a wooden extension that she guessed was the kitchen a maid sat on a stool by the kitchen door with a sack of cabbages washing the mud off in a big bowl of water the maid was young and looked fondly at the baby how old is he she said four months nearly five his name is samuel we call him sammy or sam the baby smiled at the girl and she said ah gwenda said im just an ordinary woman like you but i need to speak to the lady philippa the girl frowned and looked troubled im only the kitchen maid she said but you must see her sometimes you could speak to her for me she glanced behind her as if worried about being overheard i dont like to gwenda realized this might be more difficult than she had anticipated couldnt you just give her a message for me she said the maid shook her head then a voice came from inside who wants to send me a message gwenda tensed wondering if she was in trouble she looked towards the kitchen door a moment later lady philippa stepped out she was not quite beautiful and certainly not pretty but she was goodlooking she had a straight nose and a strong jaw and her green eyes were large and clear she was not smiling in fact she wore a slight frown but nevertheless there was something friendly and understanding about her face gwenda answered her question im gwenda from wigleigh my lady wigleigh philippas frown deepened and what do you have to say to me its about lord ralph i was afraid it might be well come inside and lets warm that baby by the kitchen fire many noble ladies would have refused to speak to someone as lowly as gwenda but she had guessed that philippa had a big heart underneath that rather formidable exterior she followed philippa inside sammy began to grizzle and gwenda gave him the breast you can sit down philippa said that was even more unusual a serf would normally remain standing when talking to a lady philippa was being kind because of the baby gwenda guessed all right out with it philippa said what has ralph done you may remember lady a fight at the fleece fair in kingsbridge last year i certainly do ralph groped a peasant girl and her handsome young fiance broke his nose the boy shouldnt have done it of course but ralph is a brute indeed he is last week he came across the same girl annet in the woods his squire held her down while ralph raped her oh god save us philippa looked distressed ralph is an animal a pig a wild boar i knew he should never have been made a lord i told my fatherinlaw not to promote him a pity the earl didnt follow your advice and i suppose the fiance wants justice gwenda hesitated she was not sure how much of the complicated story to tell but she sensed it would be a mistake to hold anything back annet is married lady but to a different man so what lucky girl got mr handsome as it happens wulfric married me congratulations though wulfric is here with annets husband to bear witness philippa gave gwenda a sharp look and seemed about to comment then changed her mind so why have you come here wigleigh is not in my husbands territory the incident happened in the forest and the earl says it was on lord williams land so he cant adjudicate thats an excuse roland adjudicates anything he likes he just doesnt want to punish a man hes recently elevated anyway our village priest is here to tell lord william what happened and what do you want me to do youre a woman you understand you know how men make excuses for rape they say the girl must have been flirting or doing something provocative yes if ralph gets away with this he might do it again perhaps to me or me said philippa you should see the way he stares at me like a dog looking at a goose on the pond that was encouraging perhaps you can make lord william understand how important it is that ralph should not get away with this philippa nodded i think i can sammy had stopped sucking and gone to sleep gwenda stood up thank you lady im glad you came to me said philippa lord william summoned them the next morning they met with him in the great hall gwenda was glad to see lady philippa sitting beside him she gave gwenda a friendly look and gwenda hoped that meant she had spoken to her husband william was tall and blackhaired like his father the earl but he was going bald and the dome above the dark beard and eyebrows suggested a more thoughtful kind of authority matching his reputation he examined the bloodstained dress and looked at annets bruises which were blue now rather than the original angry red all the same they brought a look of fury to lady philippas face gwenda guessed it was not so much the severity of the injuries as the grim picture they conjured up of a brawny squire kneeling on a girls arms to hold her down while another man raped her well youve done everything correctly so far william said to annet you went immediately to the nearest village you showed your injuries to men of good reputation there and you named your attacker now you have to offer a bill to a justice of the peace in the shiring county court she looked anxious what does that mean a bill is an accusation written in latin i cant write english lord let alone latin father gaspard can do it for you the justice will put the bill before an indicting jury and you will tell them what happened can you do that they may ask for embarrassing details annet nodded determinedly if they believe you they will order the sheriff to summon lord ralph to the court a month later to be tried then you will need two sureties people who will pledge a sum of money to guarantee that you will appear at the trial but who will be my sureties father gaspard can be one and i will be the other ill put up the money thank you lord thank my wife who has persuaded me that i cant allow the kings peace to be breached on my territory by an act of rape annet shot a grateful look at philippa gwenda looked at wulfric she had told her husband about her conversation with the lords wife now he met her eye and gave an almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement he knew she had made this happen william went on at the trial you will tell your story again your friends will all have to be witnesses gwenda will say she saw you coming from the forest in your bloodstained dress father gaspard will say you told him what happened wulfric will say he saw ralph and alan riding away from the scene they all nodded solemnly one more thing having started something like this you cant stop it withdrawing an appeal is an offence and you would be severely punished to say nothing of what revenge ralph might take on you annet said i wont change my mind but what will happen to ralph how will he be punished oh theres only one penalty for rape said lord william hell be hanged they all slept in the great hall of the castle with williams servants and squires and dogs wrapping their cloaks around them and nestling into the carpet of rushes on the floor as the light from the embers in the huge fireplace dimmed to a glow gwenda hesitantly reached for her husband putting a tentative hand on his arm stroking the wool of his cloak they had not made love since the rape and she was unsure whether he wanted her or not she had angered him grievously by tripping him up would he feel that her intervention with lady philippa made up for that he responded immediately drawing her to him and kissing her lips she relaxed gratefully into his arms they toyed with each other for a while gwenda was so happy she wanted to weep she waited for him to roll on top of her but he did not do so she could tell he wanted to for he was being very affectionate and his penis was hard in her hand but perhaps he hesitated to do it in the company of so many others people did have sex in halls like this of course it was normal and no one took any notice but perhaps wulfric felt shy however gwenda was determined to seal the repair of their love and after a while she climbed on to him drawing her cloak over them both as they began to move together she saw an adolescent boy watching them wideeyed a few yards away adults would politely look the other way of course but he was at the age where sex was a captivating mystery and he obviously could not tear his gaze away gwenda was feeling so happy that she hardly cared she met his eye then smiled at him without ceasing to move his mouth fell open in shock and he was struck by agonizing embarrassment looking mortified he rolled over and covered his eyes with his arm gwenda pulled her cloak up over her head and wulfrics buried her face in his neck and gave herself up to pleasure caris felt confident the second time she went to the royal court the vast interior of westminster hall no longer intimidated her nor did the mass of wealthy and powerful people crowding around the judges benches she had been here before she knew the ropes everything that had seemed so strange a year ago was now familiar she even had a dress in the london fashion green on the right side and blue on the left she enjoyed studying those around her and reading their lives in their faces cocksure or desperate bewildered or sly she could spot people who were new to the capital by their wideeyed gaze and their air of uncertainty and she felt pleasantly knowledgeable and superior if she had any misgivings they centred on her lawyer francis bookman he was young and well informed and like most lawyers she thought he seemed very sure of himself a small man with sandy hair quick in his movements and always ready for an argument he made her think of a cheeky bird on a window ledge pecking crumbs and aggressively chasing away rivals he had told them that their case was incontrovertible godwyn had gregory longfellow of course gregory had won the case against earl roland and godwyn had naturally asked him to represent the priory again he had proved his ability whereas bookman was an unknown however caris had a weapon up her sleeve something that would come as a shock to godwyn godwyn showed no awareness that he had betrayed caris her father and the entire city of kingsbridge he had always presented himself as a reformer impatient of stickinthemud prior anthony sympathetic with the needs of the town eager for the prosperity of monks and merchants alike then within a year of becoming prior he had turned to face the opposite way and become even more of a traditionalist than anthony yet he appeared to feel no shame caris flushed with anger every time she thought of it he had no right to force the townspeople to use the fulling mill his other impositions the ban on hand mills the fines for private fishponds and warrens were technically correct albeit outrageously harsh but the fulling mill should be free and godwyn knew it caris wondered whether he believed that any deceit was pardonable provided it was done for the sake of gods work surely men of god should be more scrupulous about honesty than laymen not less she put the point to her father as they hung around the court waiting for their case to come up he said i never trust anyone who proclaims his morality from the pulpit that highminded type can always find an excuse for breaking his own rules id rather do business with an everyday sinner who thinks its probably to his advantage in the long run to tell the truth and keep his promises hes not likely to change his mind about that in moments such as that when papa was his old self caris realized how much he had changed nowadays he was not often shrewd and quickwitted more usually he was forgetful and distracted caris suspected the decline had begun some months before she had noticed and it probably accounted for his disastrous failure to anticipate the collapse of the wool market after several days wait they were called before sir wilbert wheatfield the pinkfaced judge with rotten teeth who had ruled for the priory against earl roland a year ago cariss confidence began to ebb away as the judge took his seat on the bench against the east wall it was frightening that a mere mortal should have such power if he made the wrong decision cariss new clothmanufacturing enterprise would be blighted her father would be ruined and no one would be able to pay for the new bridge then as her lawyer began to speak she started to feel better francis commenced with the history of the fulling mill saying how it had been invented by the legendary jack builder who built the first one and how prior philip had given the townspeople the right to use it free he then dealt with godwyns counterarguments disarming the prior in advance it is true that the mill is in bad repair slow and prone to frequent breakdowns he said but how can the prior argue that the people have lost the right to it the mill is the priorys property and it is for the priory to keep it in good repair the fact that he has failed in this duty makes no difference the people have no right to repair the mill and they certainly have no obligation so to do prior philips grant was not conditional at this point francis produced his secret weapon in case the prior should attempt to claim that the grant was conditional i invite the court to read this copy of prior philips will godwyn was astonished he had tried to pretend that the will had been lost but thomas langley had agreed to look for it as a favour to merthin and he had sneaked it out of the library for a day time enough for edmund to have it copied caris could not help enjoying the look of shock and outrage on godwyns face when he found that his deception had been foiled he stepped forward and said indignantly how was this obtained the question was revealing he did not ask where was it found which would have been the logical inquiry if it had really been lost gregory longfellow looked annoyed and waved at him with a hushing gesture and godwyn closed his mouth and stepped back realizing he had given himself away but it was surely too late caris thought the judge must see that the only reason for godwyn to be angry was that he knew the document favoured the townspeople and had attempted to suppress it francis wound up quickly after that a good decision caris thought for godwyns duplicity would be fresh in the judges mind while gregory made the case for the defence but gregorys approach took them all completely by surprise he stepped forward and said to the judge sir kingsbridge is not a chartered borough he stopped there as if that was all he had to say it was true technically most towns had a royal charter giving them the freedom to trade and hold markets without obligations to the local earl or baron their citizens were free men owing allegiance to no one but the king however a few towns such as kingsbridge remained the property of an overlord usually a bishop or a prior st albans and bury st edmunds were examples their status was less clear the judge said that makes a difference only free men can appeal to the royal court what do you have to say to that francis bookman are your clients serfs francis turned to edmund in a low urgent voice he said have the townspeople appealed to the royal court before no the prior has but not the parish guild even before your time theres no record of it so we cant argue from precedent damn francis turned back to the judge his face changed from worried to confident in a flash and he spoke as if condescending to deal with something trivial sir the townspeople are free they enjoy burgess tenure gregory said quickly there is no universal pattern of burgess tenure it means different things in different places the judge said is there a written statement of customs francis looked at edmund who shook his head no prior would ever agree to such things being written down he muttered francis turned back to the judge there is no written statement sir but clearly then this court must decide whether or not you are free men the judge said edmund spoke directly to the judge sir the citizens have the freedom to buy and sell their homes this was an important right not granted to serfs who needed their lords permission gregory said but you have feudal obligations you must use the priors mills and fishponds sir wilbert said forget fishponds the key factor is the citizens relationship to the system of royal justice does the town freely admit the kings sheriff gregory answered that no he must ask permission to enter the town edmund said indignantly that is the priors decision not ours sir wilbert said very well do the citizens serve on royal juries or claim exemption edmund hesitated godwyn looked exultant serving on juries was a timeconsuming chore that everyone avoided if they could after a pause edmund said we claim exemption then that settles the matter the judge said if you refuse that duty on the grounds that you are serfs you cannot appeal over the head of your landlord to the kings justice gregory said triumphantly in the light of that i beg you to dismiss the townspeoples application so ruled said the judge francis appeared outraged sir may i speak certainly not said the judge but sir another word and ill hold you in contempt francis closed his mouth and bowed his head sir wilbert said next case another lawyer began to speak caris was dazed francis addressed her and her father in tones of protest you should have told me you were serfs were not the judge has just ruled that you are i cant win cases on partial information she decided not to squabble with him he was the type of young man who cannot admit a mistake godwyn was so pleased with himself that he looked as if he might burst as he left he could not resist a parting shot he wagged a finger at edmund and caris i hope that in future youll see the wisdom of submitting to the will of god he said solemnly caris said oh piss off and turned her back she spoke to her father this makes us completely powerless we proved we had the right to use the fulling mill free but godwyn can still withhold that right so it seems he said she turned to francis there must be something we can do she said angrily well he said you could get kingsbridge made into a proper borough with a royal charter setting out your rights and freedoms then you would have access to the royal court caris saw a glimmer of hope how do we go about that you apply to the king would he grant it if you argued that you need this to be able to pay your taxes he would certainly listen then we must try edmund warned godwyn will be furious let him caris said grimly dont underestimate the challenge her father persisted you know how ruthless he is even over small disputes something like this will lead to total war so be it said caris bleakly total war oh ralph how could you do it said his mother merthin studied his brothers face in the dim light of their parents home ralph appeared torn between outright denial and selfjustification in the end ralph said she led me on maud was distressed more than angry but ralph she is another mans wife a peasants wife even so dont worry mother theyll never convict a lord on the word of a serf merthin was not so sure ralph was a minor lord and it seemed he had incurred the enmity of william of caster there was no telling how the trial would come out their father said sternly even if they dont convict you which i pray for just think of the shame of it youre the son of a knight how could you forget that merthin was horrified and upset but not surprised that streak of violence had always been in ralphs nature in their boyhood he had ever been ready for a fight and merthin had often steered him away from fisticuffs deflating a confrontation with a conciliatory word or a joke had anyone other than his brother committed this horrible rape merthin would have been hoping to see the man hang ralph kept glancing at merthin he was worried about merthins disapproval perhaps more so than his mothers he had always looked up to his older brother merthin just wished there was some way ralph could be shackled to prevent his attacking people now that he no longer had merthin nearby to keep him out of trouble the discussion with their distraught parents was set to go on for some time but there was a knock at the door of the modest house and caris came in she smiled at gerald and maud though her face changed when she saw ralph merthin guessed she wanted him he stood up i didnt know you were back from london he said just arrived she replied can we have a few words he pulled a cloak around his shoulders and stepped outside with her into the dim grey light of a cold december day it was a year since she had terminated their love affair he knew that her pregnancy had ended in the hospital and he guessed she had somehow brought on the abortion deliberately twice in the following few weeks he had asked her to come back to him but she had refused it was bewildering he sensed that she still loved him but she was adamant he had given up hope and assumed that in time he would cease to grieve so far that had not happened his heart still beat faster when he saw her and he was happier talking to her than doing anything else in the world they walked to the main street and turned into the bell in the late afternoon the tavern was quiet they ordered hot spiced wine we lost the case caris said merthin was shocked how is that possible you had prior philips will it made no difference she was bitterly disappointed merthin could see she explained godwyns smart lawyer argued that kingsbridge people are serfs of the prior and serfs have no right to appeal to the royal court the judge dismissed the case merthin felt angry but thats stupid it means the prior can do anything he likes regardless of laws and charters i know merthin realized she was impatient because he was saying things she had said to herself many times he suppressed his indignation and tried to be practical what are you going to do apply for a borough charter that would free the town from the control of the prior our lawyer thinks we have a strong case mind you he thought we would win against the fulling mill however the king is desperate for money for this war against france he needs prosperous towns to pay his taxes how long would it take to get a charter thats the bad news at least a year perhaps more and in that time you cant manufacture scarlet cloth not with the old fulling mill so well have to stop work on the bridge i cant see any way out of it damn it seemed so unreasonable here they had at their fingertips the means to restore the towns prosperity and one mans stubbornness was preventing them how we all misjudged godwyn merthin said dont remind me weve got to escape from his control i know but sooner than a year from now i wish there was a way merthin racked his brains at the same time he was studying caris she was a wearing a new dress from london particoloured in the current fashion which gave her a playful look even though she was solemn and anxious the colours deep green and midblue seemed to make her eyes sparkle and her skin glow this happened every so often he would be deep in conversation with her over some problem to do with the bridge they rarely talked of anything else then suddenly he would realise how lovely she was even while he was thinking about that the problemsolving part of his mind came up with a proposal we should build our own fulling mill caris shook her head it would be illegal godwyn would order john constable to pull it down what if it were outside the town in the forest you mean thats illegal too youd have the kings verderers on your back verderers enforced the laws of the forest not in the forest then somewhere else wherever you went youd need the permission of some lord my brothers a lord a look of distaste crossed cariss face at the mention of ralph then her expression changed as she thought through what merthin was saying build a fulling mill at wigleigh why not is there a fastflowing stream to turn the mill wheel i believe so but if not it can be driven by an ox like the ferry would ralph let you of course hes my brother if i ask him hell say yes godwyn will go mad with rage ralph doesnt care about godwyn caris was pleased and excited merthin could see but what were her feelings towards him she was glad they had a solution to their problem and eager to outwit godwyn but beyond that he could not read her mind lets think this through before we rejoice she said godwyn will make a rule saying cloth cant be taken out of kingsbridge to be fulled lots of towns have laws like that very hard for him to enforce such a rule without the cooperation of a guild and if he does you can get around it most of the cloth is being woven in the villages anyway isnt it yes then dont bring it into the city send it from the weavers to wigleigh dye it there full it in the new mill then take it to london godwyn will have no jurisdiction how long would it take to build a mill merthin considered the timber building can be put up in a couple of days the machinery will be wooden too but it will take longer as it has to be precisely measured getting the men and materials there will take the most time i could have it finished a week after christmas thats wonderful she said well do it elizabeth rolled the dice and moved her last counter into the home position on the board i win she said thats three out of three pay up merthin handed her a silver penny only two people ever beat him at tabula elizabeth and caris he did not mind losing he was grateful for a worthy opponent he sat back and sipped his pear wine it was a cold saturday afternoon in january and already dark elizabeths mother was asleep in a chair near the fire snoring gently with her mouth open she worked at the bell but she was always at home when merthin visited her daughter he preferred it that way it meant he never had to decide whether to kiss elizabeth or not it was a question he did not want to confront he would have liked to kiss her of course he remembered the touch of her cool lips and the firmness of her flat breasts but it would mean admitting that his love affair with caris was over for ever and he was not yet ready for that how is the new mill at wigleigh elizabeth asked finished and rolling merthin said proudly caris has been fulling cloth there for a week elizabeth raised her eyebrows herself no that was a figure of speech as a matter of fact mark webber is running the mill though he is training some of the village men to take over it will be good for mark if he becomes cariss secondincommand hes been poor all his life this is a big opportunity cariss new enterprise will be good for us all it will mean i can finish the bridge shes a clever girl elizabeth said in a level voice but what does godwyn have to say nothing im not sure he knows about it yet he will though i dont believe theres anything he can do hes a prideful man if youve outwitted him hell never forgive you i can live with that and what about the bridge despite all the problems the work is only a couple of weeks behind schedule ive had to spend money to catch up but we will be able to use the bridge with a temporary wooden roadbed for the next fleece fair you and caris between you have saved the town not yet but we will there was a knock at the door and elizabeths mother woke up with a start now who could that be she said its dark out it was one of edmunds apprentice boys master merthin is wanted at the parish guild meeting he said what for merthin asked him master edmund said to tell you youre wanted at the parish guild meeting the boy said he had obviously learned the message off by heart and knew nothing more something about the bridge i expect merthin said to elizabeth theyre worried about the cost he picked up his cloak thank you for the wine and the game ill play you any time you like she said he walked beside the apprentice to the guild hall on the high street the guild was holding a business meeting not a banquet the twenty or so most important people in kingsbridge were sitting at a long trestle table some drinking ale or wine talking in low voices merthin sensed tension and anger and he became apprehensive edmund was at the head of the table prior godwyn sat next to him the prior was not a member of the guild his presence suggested that merthins surmise had been right and the meeting was about the bridge however thomas the matricularius was not present although philemon was that was odd merthin had recently had a small dispute with godwyn his contract had been for a year at two pence a day plus the lease on leper island it was due for renewal and godwyn had proposed to continue paying him two pence a day merthin had insisted on four pence and in the end godwyn had conceded the point had he complained about this to the guild edmund spoke with characteristic abruptness weve called you here because prior godwyn wishes to dismiss you as master builder in charge of the bridge merthin felt as if he had been punched in the face he was not expecting anything like this what he said but godwyn appointed me godwyn said and therefore i have the right to dismiss you but why the work is behind schedule and over budget its behind schedule because the earl closed the quarry and its over budget because i had to spend money to catch up excuses am i inventing the death of a carter godwyn shot back killed by your own brother what has that to do with anything godwyn ignored the question a man who is accused of rape he added you cant dismiss a master builder because of his brothers behaviour who are you to say what i can do im the builder of your bridge then it occurred to merthin that much of his work as master builder was complete he had designed all the most complicated parts and made wooden templates to guide the stonemasons he had built the coffer dams which no one else knew how to do and he had constructed the floating cranes and hoists needed to move the heavy stones into position in midstream any builder could now finish the job he realized with dismay there is no guarantee of renewal of your contract godwyn said it was true merthin looked around the room for support no one would meet his eye they had already argued this out with godwyn he deduced despair overwhelmed him why had this happened it was not because the bridge was behind schedule and over budget the delay was not merthins fault and anyway he was catching up what was the real reason as soon as he had asked the question the answer came into his mind this is because of the fulling mill at wigleigh he said godwyn said primly the two things are not necessarily connected edmund said quietly but distinctly lying monk philemon spoke for the first time take care alderman he said edmund was undeterred merthin and caris outwitted you didnt they godwyn their mill at wigleigh is entirely legitimate you brought defeat on yourself by your greed and obstinacy and this is your revenge edmund was right no one was as capable a builder as merthin godwyn must know that but clearly he did not care who will you hire instead of me merthin asked then he answered the question himself elfric i suppose that has to be decided edmund said another lie philemon spoke again his voice more shrill you can be brought before the ecclesiastical court for talk like that merthin wondered if this might be no more than a move in the game a way for godwyn to renegotiate his contract he said to edmund is the parish guild in agreement with the prior on this godwyn said it is not for them to agree or disagree merthin ignored him and looked expectantly at edmund edmund was shamefaced it cannot be denied that the prior has the right the guildsmen are financing the bridge by loans but the prior is overlord of the town this was agreed from the start merthin turned to godwyn do you have anything else to say to me lord prior he waited hoping in his heart that godwyn would come out with his real demands but godwyn said stonily no goodnight then he waited a second longer no one spoke the silence told him it was all over he left the room outside the building he took a deep breath of the cold night air he could hardly believe what had happened he was no longer master of the bridge he walked through the dark streets it was a clear night and he could find his way by starlight he walked past elizabeths house he did ot want to talk to her he hesitated outside cariss but passed that too and went down to the waterside his small rowingboat was tied up opposite leper island he got in and rowed himself across when he reached his house he paused outside and looked up at the stars fighting back tears the truth was that in the end he had not outwitted godwyn rather the reverse he had underestimated the lengths to which the prior would go to punish those who opposed him merthin had thought himself clever but godwyn had been cleverer or at least more ruthless he was prepared to damage the town and the priory if necessary to avenge a wound to his pride and that had given him victory merthin went inside and lay down alone and beaten ralph lay awake all through the night before his trial he had seen many people die by hanging every year twenty or thirty men and a few women rode the sheriffs cart from the prison in shiring castle down the hill to the market square where the gallows stood waiting it was a common occurrence but those people had remained in ralphs memory and on this night they returned to torment him some died fast their necks snapped by the drop but not many most strangled slowly they kicked and struggled and opened their mouths wide in silent breathless screaming they pissed and shat themselves he recalled an old woman convicted of witchcraft when she dropped she bit right through her tongue and spat it out and the crowd around the gallows had backed away in fright from the bloody lump of flesh as it flew through the air and fell on the dusty ground everyone told ralph he was not going to be hanged but he could not get the thought out of his mind people said that earl roland could not allow one of his lords to be executed on the word of a serf however so far the earl had done nothing to intervene the preliminary jury had returned an indictment against ralph to the justice of the peace in shiring like all such juries it had consisted mainly of knights of the county owing allegiance to earl roland but despite this they had acted on the evidence of the wigleigh peasants the men jurors were never women of course had not flinched from indicting one of their own in fact the jurors had shown by their questions some distaste for what ralph had done and several had refused to shake his hand afterwards ralph had planned to prevent annet testifying again at the trial proper by imprisoning her in wigleigh before she could leave for shiring however when he went to her house to seize her he found she had already departed she must have anticipated his move and left earlier to foil him today another jury would hear the case but to ralphs dismay at least four of the men had been on the preliminary jury too since the evidence on both sides was likely to be exactly the same he could not see how this group could return a different verdict unless some kind of pressure was put on the jurors and it was getting very late for that he got up at first light and went downstairs to the ground floor of the courthouse inn on the market square of shiring he found a shivering boy breaking the ice on the well in the back yard and told him to fetch bread and ale then he went to the communal dormitory and woke his brother merthin they sat together in the cold parlour with the stale smell of last nights ale and wine and ralph said im afraid theyll hang me so am i said merthin i dont know what to do the boy brought two tankards and half a loaf ralph picked up his ale in a shaking hand and took a long draught merthin ate some bread automatically frowning and looking upwards out of the corners of his eyes in the way he always did when he was racking his brains the only thing i can think of is to try to persuade annet to drop the charge and come to a settlement youll have to offer her compensation ralph shook his head she cant back out its not allowed theyll punish her it she does i know but she could deliberately give weak evidence making room for doubt thats how its usually done i believe hope sparked in ralphs heart i wonder if she would consent the potboy brought in an armful of logs and knelt before the fireplace to start a fire merthin said thoughtfully how much money could you offer annet ive got twenty florins that was worth three pounds of english silver pennies merthin ran a hand through his untidy red hair its not much its a lot to a peasant girl on the other hand her family are rich for peasants doesnt wigleigh yield you much money ive had to buy armour when youre a lord you need to be ready to go to war i could lend you money how much have you got thirteen pounds ralph was so astonished that for a moment he forgot his troubles where did you get all that merthin looked faintly resentful i work hard and im paid well but you were sacked as master builder of the bridge theres plenty more work and i rent out land on leper island ralph was indignant so a carpenter is richer than a lord luckily for you as it happens how much do you think annet will want ralph thought of a snag and his spirits fell again its not her its wulfric hes the ringleader in this of course merthin had spent a lot of time in wigleigh while building the fulling mill and he knew that wulfric had married gwenda only after being jilted by annet then lets talk to him ralph did not think it would do any good but he had nothing to lose they went out into the bleak grey daylight pulling their cloaks around their shoulders against a cold february wind they crossed the market place and entered the bull where the wigleigh folk were staying paid for ralph presumed by lord william without whose help they would not have begun this process but ralph had no doubt that his real enemy was williams voluptuous malevolent wife philippa who seemed to hate ralph even though or perhaps because he found her fascinating and alluring wulfric was up and they found him eating porridge with bacon when he saw ralph his face turned thunderous and he rose from his seat ralph put his hand on his sword ready to fight there and then but menhin hastily stepped forward holding his hands open in front of him in a conciliatory gesture i come as a friend wulfric he said dont get angry or youll end up on trial instead of my brother wulfric remained standing with his hands at his sides ralph was disappointed the agony of his suspense would have been eased by a fight wulfric spat a piece of bacon rind on the floor and swallowed then said what do you want if not trouble to make a settlement ralph is willing to pay annet ten pounds by way of recompense for what he did ralph was startled by the amount merthin would have to pay most of it but he showed no hesitation wulfric said annet cant withdraw the charge its not allowed but she can alter her evidence if she says that at first she consented then changed her mind when it was too late the jury wouldnt convict ralph ralph watched wulfrics face eagerly for a sign of willingness but his expression remained stony and he said so youre offering her a bribe to commit perjury ralph began to despair he could see that wulfric did not want annet to be paid money revenge was his aim not compensation he wanted a hanging merthin said reasonably im offering her a different kind of justice youre trying to get your brother off the hook wouldnt you do the same you had a brother once ralph recalled that wulfrics brother had been killed along with his parents when the bridge collapsed merthin went on wouldnt you try to save his life even if he had done wrong wulfric appeared startled by this appeal to family feeling clearly it had never occurred to him to think of ralph as someone with kinfolk who loved him but he recovered after a moment and said my brother david would never have done what ralph did of course merthin said soothingly all the same you cant blame me for wanting to find a way to save ralph especially if it can be managed without doing an injustice to annet ralph admired his brothers smooth way of talking he could charm a bird out of a tree he thought but wulfric was not easily persuaded the villagers want to see the back of ralph theyre afraid he might do the same thing again merthin sidestepped that perhaps you should put our offer to annet it should be her decision surely wulfric looked thoughtful how could we be certain you would pay the money ralphs heart leaped wulfric was softening merthin replied well give the cash to caris wooler before the trial she will pay annet after ralph is declared innocent you trust caris and we do too wulfric nodded as you say its not my decision ill put it to her he went upstairs merthin let out his breath in a long sigh by heaven theres an angry man you talked him round though ralph said admiringly hes only agreed to pass on a message they sat at the table wulfric had vacated a potboy asked them if they wanted breakfast but they both refused the parlour was full of guests calling for ham and cheese and ale the inns were crowded with people attending the court unless they had a good excuse all the knights of the shire were obliged to come as were most other prominent men of the county senior clergymen wealthy merchants and anyone with an income over forty pounds a year lord william prior godwyn and edmund wooler were all included ralph and merthins father sir gerald had been a regular attender before his fall from grace they had to offer themselves as jurors and transact other business such as paying their taxes or electing their members of parliament in addition there was a host of accused men victims witnesses and sureties a court brought a lot of business to the inns of a town wulfric kept them waiting ralph said what do you think theyre talking about up there merthin said annet may be inclined to take the money her father would support her in that and perhaps her husband billy howard too but wulfric is the type who thinks telling the truth is more important than money his wife gwenda will support him out of loyalty and father gaspard will do the same on principle most importantly theyll have to consult lord william and hell do what lady philippa wants she hates you for some reason on the other hand a woman is more likely to choose reconciliation over confrontation so it could go either way exactly the patrons of the inn finished their breakfasts and began to drift out heading across the square to the courthouse inn where the session would be held soon it would be too late at last wulfric reappeared she says no he said abruptly and he turned away just a minute merthin said wulfric took no notice and disappeared again up the stairs ralph cursed for a while he had hoped for a reprieve now he was in the hands of the jury he heard the sound of a handbell being rung vigorously outside a sheriffs deputy was summoning all concerned to the court merthin stood up reluctantly ralph followed suit they walked back to the courthouse and went into the large back room at the far end the justices bench stood on a raised dais although always called a bench it was in fact a carved wooden chair like a throne the justice was not seated but his clerk was at a table in front of the dais reading a scroll two long benches for the jurymen stood to one side there were no other seats in the room everyone else would stand wherever he wished order was maintained by the power of the justice to sentence instantly anyone who misbehaved no trial was necessary for a crime that the judge had himself witnessed ralph spotted alan fernhill looking terrified and stood beside him without speaking ralph began to think he should never have come here he could have made an excuse sickness a misunderstanding about dates a horse lamed on the road but that would only have brought him a postponement eventually the sheriff would come with armed deputies to arrest him and if he evaded them he would be declared an outlaw however that was better than hanging he wondered if he should flee now he could probably fight his way out of the tavern but he would not get far on foot he would be chased by half the town and if they did not catch him the sheriffs deputies would follow on horseback and his flight would be seen as an admission of guilt as things stood he still had a chance of acquittal annet might be too intimidated to give her evidence clearly perhaps key witnesses would fail to show up there could be some lastminute intervention by earl roland the courtroom filled up annet the villagers lord william and lady philippa edmund wooler and caris prior godwyn and his slimy assistant philemon the clerk banged on his table for quiet and the justice came through a side door it was sir guy de bois a large landholder he had a bald head and a fat belly he was an old comradeinarms of the earls which might stand in ralphs favour but on the other side of the balance he was lady philippas uncle and she might have whispered malice in his ear he had the flushed look of a man who has breakfasted on salt beef and strong ale he sat down farted loudly sighed with satisfaction and said all right lets get on with it earl roland was not present ralphs case came first it was the one that most interested everybody including the justice the indictment was read and annet was called to give her evidence ralph found it strangely difficult to concentrate he had heard it all before of course but he should have been listening hard for any discrepancy in the story annet told today any sign of uncertainty any hesitation or faltering but he felt fatalistic his enemies were out in full force his one powerful friend earl roland was absent only his brother stood beside him and merthin had already tried his best to help and failed ralph was doomed the witnesses followed gwenda wulfric peg gaspard ralph had thought he had absolute power over these people but somehow they had conquered him the foreman of the jury sir herbert montain was one of those who had refused to shake ralphs hand and he asked questions that seemed designed to emphasize the horror of the crime how bad was the pain how much blood was she weeping when it was ralphs turn to speak he told the story that had been disbelieved by the jury of indictment and he told it in a low voice stumbling over his words alan fernhill did better saying firmly that annet had been eager to lie with ralph and that the two lovers had asked him to make himself scarce while they enjoyed one anothers favours beside the stream but the jury did not believe him ralph could tell by their faces he began to feel almost bored by the proceedings wishing they would be over and his fate sealed as alan stepped back ralph was conscious of a new figure at his shoulder and a low voice said listen to me ralph glanced behind and saw father jerome the earls clerk and the thought crossed his mind that a court such as this had no power over priests even if they committed crimes the justice turned to the jury and asked for their verdict father jerome murmured your horses stand outside saddled and ready to go ralph froze was he hearing correctly he turned and said what run for it ralph looked behind him a hundred men barred his way to the door many of them armed its not possible use the side door jerome said indicating with a slight inclination of his head the entrance through which the justice had come ralph saw immediately that only the wigleigh people stood between him and the side door the foreman of the jury sir herbert stood up looking selfimportant ralph caught the eye of alan fernhill standing beside him alan had heard everything and looked expectant go now whispered jerome ralph put his hand on his sword we find lord ralph of wigleigh guilty of rape said the foreman ralph drew his sword waving it in the air he dashed for the door there was a second of stunned silence then everyone shouted at once but ralph was the one man in the room with a weapon in his hand and he knew it would take the others a moment to draw only wulfric tried to stop him stepping into his path heedlessly not even looking scared just determined ralph raised his sword and brought it down as hard as he could aiming at the middle of wulfrics skull intending to cleave it in two but wulfric stepped nimbly back and to the side nevertheless the point of the sword sliced through the left side of his face cutting it open from the temple to the jaw wulfric cried out in sudden agony and his hands flew to his cheek and then ralph was past him he flung open the door stepped through and turned alan fernhill dashed past him the foreman of the jury was close behind alan sword drawn and raised ralph experienced a moment of pure elation this was how things should be settled by a fight not a discussion win or lose he preferred it this way with a yell of exhilaration he thrust at sir herbert the point of his sword touched the foremans chest ripping through his leather tunic but the man was too distant for the blow to penetrate the ribs and it merely cut his skin then glanced off the bones all the same herbert cried out more in fear than pain and stumbled back colliding with those behind him ralph slammed the door on them he found himself in a passage that ran the length of the house with a door to the market square at one end and another to the stable yard at the other where were the horses jerome had said only that they were outside alan was already running for the back door so ralph followed as they burst into the yard a hubbub behind them told him that the courtroom door had been opened and the crowd was after him there was no sign of their horses in the yard ralph ran under the arch that led to the front there stood the most welcome sight in the world his hunter griff saddled and pawing the ground with alans twoyearold fletch beside him both held by a barefoot stable boy with his mouth full of bread ralph seized the reins and jumped on his horse alan did the same they kicked their beasts just as the mob from the courtroom came through the arch the stable boy threw himself out of the way terrified the horses surged forward and away someone in the crowd threw a knife it stuck a quarter of an inch into griffs flank then fell away serving only to spur the horse on they galloped flat out through the streets scattering townspeople before them careless of men women children and livestock they charged through a gate in the old wall and passed into a suburb of houses interspersed with gardens and orchards ralph looked behind no pursuers were in sight the sheriffs men would come after them of course but they had first to fetch horses and saddle them ralph and alan were already a mile from the market square and their mounts showed no signs of tiring ralph was filled with glee five minutes ago he had reconciled himself to being hanged now he was free the road forked choosing at random ralph turned left a mile away across the fields he could see woodland once there he would turn off the track and disappear but what would he do then earl roland was clever merthin said to elizabeth clerk he allowed justice to take its course almost to the end he didnt bribe the judge or influence the jury or intimidate the witnesses and he avoided a quarrel with his son lord william but he escaped the humiliation of seeing one of his men hanged where is your brother now she said no idea i havent spoken to him or even seen him since that day they were sitting in elizabeths kitchen on sunday afternoon she had made dinner for him boiled ham with stewed apples and winter greens and a small jug of wine that her mother had bought or perhaps stolen from the inn where she worked elizabeth said what will happen now the sentence of death still hangs over him he cant return to wigleigh or come here to kingsbridge without getting arrested in effect hes declared himself an outlaw is there nothing he can do he could get a pardon from the king but that costs a fortune far more money than he or i could raise and how do you feel about him merthin winced well he deserves punishment for what he did of course all the same i cant wish it on him i just hope hes all right wherever he is he had told the story of ralphs trial many times in the last few days but elizabeth had asked the most astute questions she was intelligent and sympathetic the thought crossed his mind that it would be no hardship to spend every sunday afternoon this way her mother sairy was dozing by the fire as usual but now she opened her eyes and said my soul ive forgotten the pie she stood up patting her mussed grey hair i promised to ask betty baxter to make a pie with ham and eggs for the leathertanners guild theyre holding their lastbeforelent dinner at the bell tomorrow she draped a blanket around her shoulders and went out it was unusual for them to be left alone together and merthin felt slightly awkward but elizabeth seemed relaxed enough she said what are you doing with yourself now that you no longer work on the bridge im building a house for dick brewer among other things dicks ready to retire and hand over to his son but he says hell never stop work while hes living at the copper so he wants a house with a garden outside the old city walls oh is that the building site beyond lovers field yes it will be the biggest house in kingsbridge a brewer is never short of money would you like to see it the site the house its not finished but its got four walls and a roof now theres still an hour of daylight she hesitated as if she might have had another plan but then she said id love to they put on heavy cloaks with hoods and went out it was the first day of march flurries of snow chased them down the main street they took the ferry to the suburban side despite the ups and downs of the wool trade the town seemed to grow a little every year and the priory turned more and more of its pasture and orchards into house plots for rent merthin guessed there must be fifty dwellings that had not been here when he first came to kingsbridge as a boy twelve years ago dick brewers new home was a twostorey structure set back from the road as yet it had no window shutters or doors so the gaps in the walls had been temporarily covered with hurdles wood frames filled in with woven reeds the front entrance was thus blocked but merthin took elizabeth to the back where there was a temporary wooden door with a lock merthins assistant jimmie now sixteen was in the kitchen guarding the place from thieves he was a superstitious boy always crossing himself and throwing salt over his shoulder he was sitting on a bench in front of a big fire but he looked anxious hello master he said now that youre here may i go and get my dinner lol turner was supposed to bring it but he hasnt come make sure youre back before it gets dark thank you he hurried off merthin stepped through the doorway to the interior of the house four rooms downstairs he said showing her she was incredulous what will they use them all for kitchen parlour dining room and hall there was no staircase yet but merthin climbed a ladder to the upper floor and elizabeth followed four bedrooms he said as she reached the top who will live here dick and his wife his son danny and his wife and his daughter who probably wont remain single for ever most kingsbridge families lived in one room and all slept side by side on the floor parents children grandparents and inlaws elizabeth said this place has more rooms than a palace it was true a nobleman with a big entourage might still live in two rooms a bedchamber for himself and his wife and a great hall for everyone else but merthin had now designed several houses for wealthy kingsbridge merchants and the luxury they all craved was privacy it was a new trend he thought i suppose there will be glass in the windows elizabeth said yes that was another trend merthin could remember the time when there was no glazier in kingsbridge just an itinerant who called every year or two now the city had a resident glazier they returned to the ground floor elizabeth sat on jimmies bench in front of the fire and warmed her hands merthin sat beside her ill build a house like this for myself one day he said in a big garden with fruit trees to his surprise she leaned her head on his shoulder what a nice dream she said they both stared into the fire her hair tickled merthins cheek after a moment she laid a hand on his knee in the silence he could hear her breathing and his own and the crackle of burning logs in your dream whos in the house she said i dont know just like a man i cant see my house but i know whos in it a husband some babies my mother an elderly parentinlaw and three servants men and women have different dreams she lifted her head looked at him and touched his face and when you put them together you have a life she kissed his mouth he closed his eyes he remembered the soft touch of her lips from years ago her mouth lingered on his for just a moment then she drew back he felt oddly detached as if he were watching himself from a corner of the room he did not know how he felt he looked at her and saw again how lovely she was he asked himself what was so striking about her and realized immediately that everything was in harmony like the parts of a beautiful church her mouth her chin her cheekbones and her forehead were just as he would have drawn them if he had been god creating a woman she looked back at him with calm blue eyes touch me she said she opened her cloak he took her breast gently in his hand he remembered doing this too her breasts were firm and flat against her chest her nipple hardened immediately to his touch betraying her calm demeanour i want to be in your dream house she said and she kissed him again she was not acting on the spur of the moment elizabeth never did she had been thinking about this while he had been casually visiting her enjoying her company without thinking any farther she had been imagining their life together perhaps she had even planned this scene that would explain why her mother had left them with an excuse about a pie he had almost spoiled her plan by proposing to show her dick brewers house but she had improvised there was nothing wrong with such an unemotional approach she was a reasoning person it was one of the things he liked about her he knew that passions burned nonetheless beneath the surface what seemed wrong was his own lack of feeling it was not his way to be coolly rational about women quite the reverse when he had felt we it had taken him over making him feel rage and resentment as well as lust and tenderness now he felt interested flattered and titillated but he was not out of control she sensed that his kiss was lukewarm and drew back he saw the ghost of an emotion on her face fiercely suppressed but he knew there was fear behind the mask she was so poised by nature that it must have cost her a lot to be so forward and she dreaded rejection she drew away from him stood up and lifted the skirt of her dress she had long shapely legs covered with nearly invisible fine blonde hair although she was tall and slim her body widened just below the hips in a delightfully womanly way his gaze homed in helplessly on the delta of her sex her hair was so fair that he could see through it to the pale swelling of the lips and the delicate line between them he looked up to her face and read desperation there she had tried everything and she saw that it had not worked merthin said im sorry she dropped her skirts listen he said i think she interrupted him dont speak her desire was turning to anger whatever you say now will be a lie she was right he had been trying to formulate some soothing halftruth he was not feeling well or jimmie might be back at any moment but she did not want to be mollified she had been rebuffed and feeble excuses would only make her feel patronized as well she stared at him grief struggling with rage on the battleground of her beautiful face tears of frustration came to her eyes why not she cried but when he opened his mouth to reply she said dont answer it wont be the truth and again she was right she turned to go then came back its caris she said her face working with emotion that witch has cast a spell on you she wont marry you but no one else can have you shes evil at last she walked away she flung open the door and stepped out he heard her sob once then she was gone merthin stared into the fire oh hell he said theres something i need to explain to you merthin said to edmund a week later as they were leaving the cathedral edmunds face took on a look of mild amusement that was familiar to merthin im thirty years older than you the look said and you should be listening to me not giving me lessons but i enjoy youthful enthusiasm besides im not yet too old to learn something all right he said but explain it in the bell i want a cup of wine they went into the tavern and sat close to the fire elizabeths mother brought their wine but she stuck her nose in the air and did not talk to them edmund said is sairy angry with you or me never mind that said merthin have you ever stood at the edge of the ocean with your bare feet on the sand and felt the sea wash over your toes of course all children play in water even i was a boy once do you remember how the action of the waves flowing in and out seems to scour the sand from under the edges of your feet making a little channel yes its a long time ago but i think i know what you mean thats what happened to the old wooden bridge the flowing river scoured the earth from under the central pier how do you know by the pattern of cracks in the woodwork just before the collapse whats your point the river hasnt changed it will undermine the new bridge just as surely as it did the old unless we prevent it how in my drawing i showed a pile of large loose stones surrounding each of the piers of the new bridge they will break up the current and enfeeble its effect its the difference between being tickled by loose thread and being flogged with a tightly woven rope how do you know i asked buonaventura about it immediately after the bridge collapsed before he went back to london he said he had seen such piles of stones around the piers of bridges in italy and he had often wondered what they were for fascinating are you telling me this for general enlightenment or is there some more specific purpose people like godwyn and elfric dont understand this and wouldnt listen if i told them just in case elfric takes it into his fool head not to follow my design exactly i want to be sure that at least one person in town knows the reason for the pile of stones but one person does you im leaving kingsbridge that shocked him leaving he said you at that moment caris appeared dont stay here too long she said to her father aunt petranilla is preparing dinner do you want to join us merthin edmund said merthins leaving kingsbridge caris paled seeing her reaction merthin felt a jolt of satisfaction she had rejected him but she was dismayed to hear that he was leaving town he immediately felt ashamed of such an unworthy emotion he was too fond of her to want her to suffer all the same he would have felt worse if she had received the news with equanimity why she said theres nothing for me here what am i going to build i cant work on the bridge the town already has a cathedral i dont want to do nothing but merchants houses for the rest of my life in a quiet voice she said where will you go florence ive always wanted to see the buildings of italy ill ask buonaventura caroli for letters of introduction i might even be able to travel with one of his consignments but you own property here in kingsbridge i wanted to speak to you about that would you manage it for me you could collect my rents take a commission and give the balance to buonaventura he can transfer money to florence by letter i dont want a damn commission she said huffily merthin shrugged its work you should be paid how can you be so cold about it she said her voice was shrill and around the parlour of the bell several people looked up she took no notice youll be leaving all your friends im not cold about it friends are great but id like to get married edmund put in plenty of girls in kingsbridge would marry you youre not handsome but youre prosperous and thats worth more than good looks merthin smiled wryly edmund could be disarmingly blunt caris had inherited the trait for a while i thought i might marry elizabeth clerk he said edmund said so did i caris said shes a cold fish no shes not but when she asked me i backed off caris said oh so thats why shes so badtempered lately edmund said and why her mother wont look at merthin why did you refuse her caris asked theres only one woman in kingsbridge i could marry and she doesnt want to be anyones wife but she doesnt want to lose you merthin became angry what should i do he said his voice was loud and people around them stopped their conversations to listen godwyn has fired me youve rejected me and my brother is an outlaw in gods name why should i stay here i dont want you to go she said thats not enough he shouted the room was silent now everyone there knew them the landlord paul bell and his curvy daughter bessie the greyhaired barmaid sairy elizabeths mother bill watkin who had refused to employ merthin edward butcher the notorious adulterer jake chepstow merthins tenant friar murdo matthew barber and mark webber they all knew the history of merthin and caris and they were fascinated by the quarrel merthin did not care let them listen he said furiously im not going to spend my life hanging around you like your dog scrap waiting for your attention ill be your husband but i wont be your pet all right then she said in a small voice her sudden change of tone surprised him and he was not sure what she meant all right what all right ill marry you for a moment he was too shocked to speak then he said suspiciously do you mean it she looked up at him at last and smiled shyly yes i mean it she said just ask me all right he took a deep breath will you marry me yes i will she said edmund shouted hoorah everyone in the tavern cheered and clapped merthin and caris started laughing will you really he said yes they kissed then he put his arms around her and squeezed as hard as he could when he let her go he saw that she was crying some wine for my betrothed he called out a barrel in fact give everyone a cup so they can all drink our health coming right up said the landlord and they all cheered again a week later elizabeth clerk became a novice nun ralph and alan were miserable they were living on venison and cold water and ralph found himself dreaming about food he would normally scorn onions apples eggs milk they slept in a different place every night always lighting a fire they each had a good cloak but it was not enough out in the open and they woke shivering every dawn they robbed any vulnerable people they met on the road but most of the loot was either paltry or useless ragged clothes animal fodder and money which would buy nothing in the forest once they stole a big barrel of wine they rolled it a hundred yards into the woods drank as much as they could and fell asleep when they woke up hung over and illtempered they realized they could not take the threequartersfull barrel with them so they just left it there ralph thought nostalgically of his former life the manor house the roaring fires the servants the dinners but in his realistic moments he knew he did not want that life either it was too dull that was probably why he had raped the girl he needed excitement after a month in the forest ralph decided they had to get organized they needed a base where they could build some kind of shelter and store food and they had to plan their robberies so that they stole items that would be really valuable to them such as warm clothing and fresh food around the time he was coming to this realization their wanderings brought them to a range of hills a few miles from kingsbridge ralph recalled that the hillsides bleak and bare in winter were used for summer grazing by shepherds who had built rough stone shelters in the folds of the landscape as adolescents he and merthin had discovered these crude buildings while out hunting and had lit fires and cooked the rabbits and partridges they shot with their bows even in those days he recalled he had craved the thrill of the hunt chasing and shooting a terrified creature finishing it off with a knife or club the ecstatic sense of power that came from taking a life no one would come here until the new seasons grass was thick the traditional day was whit sunday also the opening day of the fleece fair still two months away ralph selected a hut that looked sturdy and they made it their home there were no doors or windows just a low entrance but there was a hole in the roof to let smoke out and they lit a fire and slept warm for the first time in a month proximity to kingsbridge gave ralph another bright idea the time to rob people he realized was when they were on their way to market they were carrying cheeses flagons of cider honey oatcakes all the things that were produced by villagers and needed by townspeople and by outlaws kingsbridge market was on a sunday ralph had lost track of the days of the week but he found out by asking a travelling friar before robbing him of three shillings and a goose on the following saturday he and alan made camp not far from the road to kingsbridge and stayed awake all night by their fire at dawn they made their way to the road and lay in wait the first group to come along were carting fodder kingsbridge had hundreds of horses and very little grass so the town constantly needed supplies of hay however it was no use to ralph griff and fletch had no end of grazing in the forest ralph was not bored waiting preparing an ambush was like watching a woman get undressed the longer the anticipation the more intense the thrill soon afterwards they heard singing the hairs on the back of ralphs neck stood up it sounded like angels the morning was hazy and when he first saw the singers they seemed to have haloes alan obviously thinking the same as ralph even gave a sob of fear but it was only the weak winter sun lighting the mist behind the travellers they were peasant women each carrying a basket of eggs hardly worth robbing ralph let them go by without revealing himself the sun rose a little higher ralph began to worry that soon the road would become sufficiently crowded with marketgoers to make robbery difficult then along came a family a man and woman in their thirties with two adolescent children a boy and a girl they were vaguely familiar no doubt he had seen them at kingsbridge market during the years he lived there they carried an assortment of goods the husband had a heavy basket of vegetables on his back the wife balanced on her shoulder a long pole bearing several live chickens trussed the boy had a heavy ham on his shoulder and the girl a crock that probably contained salted butter ralphs mouth watered at the thought of ham the excitement rose in his guts and he gave alan a nod as the family drew level ralph and alan came out of the bushes at a run the woman screamed and the boy gave a shout of fear the man tried to shrug off his basket but before it fell from his shoulders ralph ran him through his sword piercing the mans abdomen under the ribs and then rising up the mans scream of agony was cut off abruptly as the point of the sword penetrated his heart alan swung at the woman and cut through most of her neck so that blood spurted from her severed throat in a sudden red jet exhilarated ralph turned to the son the lad was quick to react he had already dropped his ham and drawn a knife while ralphs weapon was still on the upswing the boy darted close and stabbed him it was an unprofessional blow too wild to do much damage the knife completely missed ralphs chest but the point caught in the flesh of his upper right arm and the sudden agonizing pain made him drop his sword the boy turned and ran away going in the direction of kingsbridge ralph looked at alan before turning to the girl alan finished off the mother and the delay almost cost him his life ralph saw the girl throw her crock of butter at alan either accurate or lucky she hit him square on the back of the head and alan fell to the ground as if poleaxed then she ran after her brother ralph stooped picked up his sword in his left hand and gave chase they were young and fleet but he had long legs and he soon gained on them the boy looked over his shoulder and saw ralph coming close to ralphs astonishment the lad stopped turned and came running back at him screaming knife raised in his fist ralph stopped running and lifted his sword the boy ran at him then stopped outside his reach ralph stepped forward and lunged but it was a feint the boy dodged the blow then thinking to catch ralph off balance tried to step inside his guard and stab him at close quarters but that was exactly what ralph was expecting he stepped nimbly back stood on the balls of his feet and thrust his sword precisely into the boys throat pushing it through until the point came out of the back ot his neck the boy fell dead and ralph withdrew his sword pleased with the accuracy and efficiency of the death blow he looked up to see the girl disappearing into the distance he saw immediately that he could not catch her on foot and by the time he fetched his horse she would be in kingsbridge he turned and looked back to his surprise alan was struggling to his feet i thought shed killed you ralph said he wiped his sword on the dead boys tunic sheathed his blade and clamped his left hand over the wound in his right arm trying to stop the bleeding my head hurts like satan alan replied did you kill them all the girl got away do you think she knew us she might know me ive seen this family before in that case were now branded as murderers ralph shrugged better to hang than starve he looked at the three bodies all the same lets get these peasants off the road before someone comes along with his left hand he dragged the man to the edge of the road alan picked up the body and threw it into the bushes they did the same with the woman and the boy ralph made sure the corpses were not visible to passersby the blood on the road was already darkening to the colour of the mud into which it was soaking ralph cut a strip off the womans dress and tied it around the cut in his arm it still hurt but the flow of blood was less he felt the slight depression that always followed a fight like the sadness after sex alan began to collect up the loot a nice haul he said ham chickens butter he looked into the basket the man had been carrying and onions last years of course but still good old onions taste better than no onions my mother says that as ralph bent to pick up the butter crock that had felled alan he felt a sharp iron point stick into his arse alan was in front of him dealing with the trussed chickens ralph said who a harsh voice said dont move ralph never obeyed such instructions he sprang forward away from the voice and spun round six or seven men had materialized from nowhere he was bewildered but he managed lefthanded to draw his sword the man nearest him who presumably had prodded him raised his sword to fight but the others were grabbing the loot snatching chickens and fighting over the ham alans sword flashed in defence of his chickens as ralph engaged with his antagonist he realized that another group of outlaws was trying to rob him he was filled with indignation he had killed people for this stuff and now they wanted to take it from him he felt no fear only anger he attacked his opponent with the energy of outrage despite being forced to fight lefthanded then an authoritative voice said loudly put away your blades you fools all the newcomers stood still ralph held his sword at the ready suspicious of a trick and looked towards the voice he saw a handsome man in his twenties with something of the nobility about him he wore clothes that looked expensive but were filthy dirty a cloak of italian scarlet covered with leaves and twigs a rich brocade coat marked with what appeared to be food stains and hose of a rich chestnut leather scratched and muddy it amuses me to steal from thieves the newcomer said its not a crime you see ralph knew he was in a tight spot but all the same he was intrigued are you the one they call tam hiding he said there were stories of tam hiding when i was a child the man replied but every now and again someone comes along to act the part like a monk impersonating lucifer in a mystery play youre not a common type of outlaw nor are you im guessing that youre ralph fitzgerald ralph nodded i heard about your escape and ive been wondering when id run into you tam looked up and down the road we happened upon you by accident what made you choose this spot i picked the day and time first its sunday and at this hour the peasants are taking their produce to market in kingsbridge which is on this road well well ten years ive been living outside the law and i never thought of doing that perhaps we should team up are you going to put your weapon away ralph hesitated but tam was unarmed so he could not see the disadvantage anyway he and alan were so heavily outnumbered that it would be best to avoid a fight slowly he sheathed his sword thats better tam put an arm around ralphs shoulders and ralph realized they were the same height not many people were as tall as ralph tam walked him into the woods saying the others will bring the loot come this way weve got a lot to talk about you and i edmund rapped on the table ive called this emergency meeting of the parish guild to discuss the outlaw problem he said but as im getting old and lazy ive asked my daughter to summarize the situation caris was a member of the parish guild now by virtue of her success as a manufacturer of scarlet cloth the new business had rescued her fathers fortunes numerous other kingsbridge people were prospering because of it notably the webber family her father had been able to fulfil his pledge to lend money for the building of the bridge and in the general upturn several other merchants had done the same bridge building continued apace supervised now by elfric not merthin unfortunately her father took little initiative these days the moments when he was his sharpwitted former self were becoming rarer she was worried about him but there was nothing she could do she felt the rage that had possessed her during her mothers illness why was there no help for him nobody understood what was wrong no one could even put a name to his malady they said it was old age but he was not yet fifty she prayed he would live to see her wedding she was going to marry merthin in kingsbridge cathedral on the sunday after the fleece fair now just a month away the wedding of the daughter of the towns alderman would be a big event there would be a banquet in the guild hall for the leading citizens and a picnic in lovers field for several hundred more guests some days her father would spend hours planning the menus and the entertainment only to forget everything he had said and start again from scratch the next day she put that out of her mind and turned her attention to a problem she hoped would be more tractable in the last month there has been a big increase in attacks by outlaws she said they take place mainly on sundays and the victims are invariably people bringing produce to kingsbridge she was interrupted by elfric its your fiances brother thats doing it he said talk to merthin not us caris suppressed a flash of exasperation her sisters husband never missed a chance to snipe at her she was painfully aware of ralphs likely involvement it was a cause of agony to merthin elfric relished that dick brewer said i think its tam hiding perhaps its both caris said i believe that ralph fitzgerald who has some military training may have joined forces with an existing band of outlaws and simply made them more organized and effective fat betty baxter the towns most successful baker said whoever it is theyll be the ruination of this town no one comes to market any more that was an exaggeration but attendance at the weekly market was down drastically and the effects were felt by just about every enterprise in town from bakeries to brothels thats not the worst of it though caris said in four weeks time weve got the fleece fair several people here have invested enormous sums of money in the new bridge which should be ready for use with a temporary timber roadbed in time for the opening most of us depend on the annual fair for our prosperity i personally have a warehouse full of costly scarlet cloth to sell if it gets around that people coming to kingsbridge are likely to be robbed by outlaws we may have no customers she was even more worried than she let herself appear neither she nor her father had any cash left everything they had was either invested in the bridge or tied up in raw wool and scarlet cloth the fleece fair was their chance to get their money back if attendance was poor they would be in deep trouble among other things who would pay for the wedding she was not the only worried citizen rick silvers the head of the jewellers guild said that would be the third bad year in succession he was a prim fussy man always immaculately dressed it would finish some of my people he went on we do half our years business at the fleece fair edmund said it would finish this town we cant let it happen several others joined in caris who was unofficially presiding let them grumble a heightened sense of urgency would predispose them to accept the radical solution she was going to propose elfric said the sheriff of shiring ought to do something about it whats he paid for if not to keep the peace caris said he cant search the entire forest he doesnt have enough men earl roland has this was wishful thinking but again caris let the discussion run so that when she proposed her solution they would be aware that there were no real alternatives edmund said to elfric the earl wont help us ive already asked him caris who had in fact written edmunds letter to roland said ralph was the earls man and still is you notice the outlaws dont attack people going to shiring market elfric said indignantly those wigleigh peasants should never have made a complaint against a squire of the earls who do they think they are caris was about to respond indignantly but betty baxter beat her to it oh so you think lords should be allowed to rape anyone they like edmund intervened thats a different question he said briskly showing some of his old authority its happened and ralph is preying on us so what are we going to do the sheriff cant help us and the earl wont rick silvers said what about lord william he took the side of the wigleigh people its his fault that ralphs an outlaw i asked him too edmund said he said were not in his territory rick said thats the trouble with having the priory as your landlord what use is a prior when you need protection caris said another reason why we are applying to the king for a borough charter wed be under royal protection then elfric said weve got our own constable whats he doing mark webber spoke he was one of the constables deputies were ready to do whatevers necessary he said just give us the word caris said no one doubts your bravery but your role is to deal with troublemakers within the town john constable doesnt have the expertise to hunt down outlaws mark who was close to caris because he ran her fulling mill at wigleigh was mildly indignant well who does then caris had been leading the discussion towards this question as a matter of fact there is an experienced soldier who is willing to help us she said i took the liberty of asking him to come here tonight and hes waiting in the chapel she raised her voice thomas will you join us thomas langley came out of the little chapel at the end of the hall rick silvers said sceptically a monk before he was a monk he was a soldier caris explained thats how he lost his arm elfric said grumpily guild members permission should have been sought before he was invited no one took any notice caris was pleased to see they were too interested to hear what thomas would have to say you need to form a militia thomas began by all accounts there are twenty or thirty outlaws in the troop thats not many most townsmen can use a longbow effectively thanks to the sundaymorning practice sessions a hundred of you well prepared and intelligently led could overcome the outlaws easily thats all very well said rick silvers but we have to find them of course said thomas but i feel sure there is someone in kingsbridge who knows where they are merthin had asked the timber merchant jake chepstow to bring him a piece of slate from wales the largest piece he could find jake had come back from his next logging expedition with a thin sheet of grey welsh slate about four feet square merthin had encased it in a wooden frame and he used it for sketching plans this evening while caris was at the parish guild merthin was at his own house on leper island working on a map of the island renting parts of it for wharves and warehouses was the least of his ambitions he foresaw an entire street of inns and shops crossing the island from one bridge to the other he would construct the buildings himself and rent them to enterprising kingsbridge traders it excited him to look into the future of the town and imagine the buildings and streets it was going to need this was the kind of thing the priory would have done if it had had better leadership included in the plan was a new house for him and caris this little place would be cosy when they were first married but they would need more room eventually especially if they had children he had marked out a site on the southern shore where they would get fresh air off the river most of the island was rocky but the patch he had in mind featured a small area of cultivable soil where he might be able to grow some fruit trees as he planned the house he relished the vision of the two of them living side by side day by day always his dream was interrupted by a knock at the door he was startled normally no one came to the island at night except caris and she would not knock who is it he called nervously thomas langley came in monks are supposed to be asleep at this time merthin said godwyn doesnt know im here thomas looked at the slate you draw lefthanded left or right it makes no difference would you like a cup of wine no thanks ill have to be up for matins in a few hours so i dont want to get sleepy merthin liked thomas there had been a bond between them ever since that day twelve years ago when he had promised that if thomas should die he would take a priest to the place where the letter was buried later when they had worked together on cathedral repairs thomas had always been clear in his instructions and gracious to apprentices he managed to be sincere about his religious calling without becoming prideful all men of god should be like that merthin thought he waved thomas to a chair by the fire what can i do for you its about your brother he has to be stopped merthin winced as if at a sudden stab of pain if i could do anything i would but i havent seen him and when i do im not sure he will listen to me there was a time when he looked to me for guidance but i think those days are over ive just come from a meeting of the parish guild they asked me to organize a militia dont expect me to be part of it no i didnt come for that purpose thomas gave a wry smile your many amazing talents dont actually include military skills merthin nodded ruefully thanks but there is something you could do to help me if you would merthin felt uneasy well ask me the outlaws must have a hideout somewhere not far from kingsbridge i want you to think about where your brother might be its probably a place you both know a cave perhaps or an abandoned verderers hut in the forest merthin hesitated thomas said i know youd hate to betray him but think of that first family he attacked a decent hardworking peasant his pretty wife a lad of fourteen and a little girl now three of them are dead and the little girl has no parents even though you love your brother you have to help us catch him i know can you think where he might be merthin was not yet ready to answer the question will you take him alive if i can merthin shook his head not good enough i need a guarantee thomas was silent for a few moments at last he said all right ill take him alive i dont know how but ill find a way i promise thank you merthin paused he knew he had to do this but his heart rebelled after a moment he forced himself to speak when i was about thirteen we used to go hunting often with older boys we would stay out all day and cook whatever we shot sometimes we used to go as far as the chalk hills and meet the families who spend the summer up there grazing sheep shepherdesses tend to be quite free and easy some would let you kiss them he smiled briefly in winter when they werent there we used their huts for shelter that might be where ralph is hiding out thank you said thomas he stood up remember your promise i will you trusted me with a secret twelve years ago i know i never betrayed you i realize that now im trusting you merthin knew that his words could be interpreted two ways either as a plea for reciprocity or as a veiled threat that was all right let thomas take it how he wished thomas put out his one hand and merthin clasped it ill keep my word thomas said then he went out ralph and tam rode side by side up the hill followed by alan fernhill on his horse and the rest of the outlaws on foot ralph was feeling good it had been another successful sunday mornings work spring had arrived and the peasants were beginning to bring the new seasons produce to market the members of the gang were carrying half a dozen lambs a jar of honey a stoppered jug of cream and several leather bottles of wine as usual the outlaws had suffered only minor injuries a few cuts and bruises inflicted by the more foolhardy of their victims ralphs partnership with tam had been extraordinarily successful a couple of hours easy fighting brought them all they needed for a week of living in luxury they spent the rest of their time hunting in the day and drinking in the evenings there were no clodhopping serfs to badger them about boundary disputes or cheat them of rent all they lacked were women and today they had remedied that by kidnapping two plump girls sisters of about thirteen and fourteen years his only regret was that he had never fought for the king it had been his ambition since boyhood and he still felt the tug being an outlaw was too easy he could not feel very proud of killing unarmed serfs the boy in him longed yet for glory he had never proved to himself and others that he had in him the soul of a true knight however he would not allow that thought to lower his spirits as he breasted the rise that hid the upland pasture where their hideout was he looked forward to a feast tonight they would roast a lamb on a spit and drink cream with honey and the girls ralph decided he would make them lie side by side so that each would see her sister being violated by one man after another the thought made his heart beat faster they came within sight of the stone shelters they would not be able to use these much longer ralph reflected the grass was growing and the shepherds would be here soon easter had been early this year so whitsun would come soon after may day the outlaws would have to find another base when he was fifty yards from the nearest hut he was shocked to see someone walk out of it he and tam both reined in and the outlaws gathered around them hands on their weapons the man approached them and ralph saw that it was a monk tam beside ralph said what in the name of heaven one sleeve of the monks robe flapped empty and ralph recognized him as brother thomas from kingsbridge thomas walked up to them as if meeting them by chance on the main street hello ralph he said remember me tam said to ralph do you know this man thomas came up on the right side of ralphs horse and extended his good right arm to shake hands what the hell was he doing here on the other hand what harm could there be in a onearmed monk baffled ralph reached down and took the proffered hand thomas slipped his hand up ralphs arm and grasped his elbow out of the corner of his eye ralph saw movement near the stone huts glancing up he saw a man step out through the doorway of the nearest building closely followed by a second man then three more then he saw that they were pouring out of all the huts and fitting arrows to the tall longbows they carried he realized that he and his band had been ambushed but in that moment the grip on his elbow tightened and with a sudden strong heave he was pulled off his horse a shout went up from the outlaws ralph crashed to the ground landing on his back his horse griff skittered sideways frightened as ralph tried to get up thomas fell on him like a tree flattening him to the ground and lay on top of him like a lover lie still and you wont get killed he said in ralphs ear then ralph heard the sound of dozens of arrows being shot simultaneously from longbows a deadly swish that was unmistakable like the sudden wind of a flash thunderstorm the noise was tremendous there must have been a hundred archers he thought they had obviously crammed themselves into the shelters thomass grasping ralphs arm must have been the signal for them to come out and shoot he considered fighting thomas off and thought better of it he could hear the cries of the outlaws as the arrows struck home from ground level he could not see much but some of his men were drawing their swords however they were too far from the archers if they ran at their enemy they would be shot down before they could engage it was a massacre not a battle hooves drummed the earth and ralph wondered whether tam was charging the archers or riding away confusion reigned but not for long within moments he could tell that the outlaws were in full retreat thomas got off him pulled a long dagger from under his benedictine robe and said dont even think about drawing your sword ralph stood up he looked at the archers and recognized many of them fat dick brewer randy edward butcher convivial paul bell grumpy bill watkin timid lawabiding citizens of kingsbridge every one he had been captured by tradesmen but that was not the most surprising thing he looked curiously at thomas you saved my life monk he said only because your brother asked me to thomas replied crisply if it had been up to me you would have been dead before you hit the ground the kingsbridge jail was in the basement of the guild hall the pen had stone walls a dirt floor and no windows there was no fire either and prisoners occasionally died of cold in the winter but this was may and ralph had a wool cloak to keep him warm at night he also had a few items of furniture a chair a bench and a small table rented from john constable and paid for by merthin on the other side of the barred oak door was john constables office on market days and during the fair he and his deputies sat there waiting to be summoned to deal with trouble alan fernhill was in the cell with ralph a kingsbridge archer had brought him down with an arrow in the thigh and although the wound was not serious he had been unable to run however tam hiding had got away today was their last here the sheriff was due at midday to take them to shiring they had already been sentenced to death in their absence for the rape of annet and for the crimes they had committed in that court under the judges eye wounding the foreman of the jury wounding wulfric and escaping when they got to shiring they would be hanged an hour before noon ralphs parents brought them dinner hot ham new bread and a jug of strong ale merthin came with them and ralph surmised that this was goodbye his father confirmed it well not follow you to shiring he said his mother added we dont want to see you she broke down but he knew what she was going to say they would not journey to shiring to see him hang ralph drank the ale but found it difficult to eat he was going to the gallows and food seemed pointless anyway he had no appetite alan tucked in he seemed to have no sense of the doom that awaited him the family sat in an awkward silence although these were their last minutes together no one knew what to say maud wept quietly gerald looked thunderous and merthin sat with his head in his hands alan fernhill just looked bored ralph had a question for his brother part of him did not want to ask it but now he realized that this was his last chance when brother thomas pulled me off my horse protecting me from the arrows i thanked him for saving my life he said looking at his brother he went on thomas said he did it for you merthin merthin just nodded did you ask him to yes so you knew what was going to happen yes so how did thomas know where to find me merthin did not answer ralph said you told him didnt you their father was shocked merthin he said how could you alan fernhill said you treacherous swine merthin said to ralph you were murdering people innocent peasants and their wives and children you had to be stopped ralph did not feel angry somewhat to his surprise he felt a choking sensation he swallowed then said but why did you ask thomas to spare my life was it because you preferred that i should hang maud said ralph dont and sobbed i dont know merthin said perhaps i just wanted you to live a little longer but you did betray me ralph found that he was on the verge of breaking down tears seemed to gather behind his eyes and he felt the pressure in his head you betrayed me he repeated merthin stood up and said angrily by god you deserved it maud said dont fight ralph shook his head sadly were not going to fight he said those days are over the door opened and john constable stepped in the sheriff is outside he announced maud put her arms around ralph and clung to him weeping after a few moments gerald gently pulled her away john walked out and ralph followed him he was surprised not to be tied up or chained he had escaped once before were they not afraid he would do the same again he walked through the constables office and out into the open air his family came behind it must have been raining earlier for now bright sunshine reflected off the wet street and ralph had to screw up his eyes against the glare as he adjusted to the light he recognized his own horse griff saddled ready the sight gladdened his heart he took the reins and spoke into the horses ear you never betrayed me boy did you eh the horse blew through its nostrils and stamped pleased to have its master back the sheriff and several deputies were waiting mounted and armed to the teeth they were going to let ralph ride to shiring but they were not taking any risks with him there would be no escape this time he realized then he looked again the sheriff was here but the other armed riders were not his deputies they were earl rolands men and there was the earl himself blackhaired and blackbearded mounted on a grey charger what was he doing here without dismounting the earl leaned down and handed a rolled sheet of parchment to john constable read that if you can roland said speaking as always out of one side of his mouth it is a writ from the king all the prisoners in the county are pardoned and freed on condition they come with me to join the kings army gerald shouted hoorah maud burst into tears merthin looked over the constables shoulder and read the writ ralph looked at alan who said what does it mean it means were free ralph said john constable said it does if i read it aright he looked at the sheriff do you confirm this i do said the sheriff then there is no more to be said these men are free to go with the earl the constable rolled up the parchment ralph looked at his brother merthin was weeping were they tears of joy or frustration he was given no more time to wonder come on said roland impatiently weve completed the formalities lets get on the road the king is in france weve a long way to go he wheeled his horse and rode down the main street ralph kicked griffs sides and the horse eagerly broke into a trot and followed the earl you cant win gregory longfellow said to prior godwyn sitting in the large chair in the hall of the priors house the king is going to grant a borough charter to kingsbridge godwyn stared at him this was the lawyer who had won two cases for him at the royal court one against the earl and the other against the alderman if such a champion declared himself beaten then surely defeat must be inevitable it was not to be borne if kingsbridge became a royal borough the priory would be sidelined for hundreds of years the prior had ruled the town in godwyns eyes the town existed only to serve the priory which served god now the priory would become just part of a town ruled by merchants serving the god of money and the book of life would show that the prior who let this happen was godwyn dismayed he said are you quite certain im always quite certain said gregory godwyn was aggravated gregorys cocksure attitude was all very well when he was sneering at your opponents but when he turned it on you it became infuriating angrily godwyn said you came all the way to kingsbridge to tell me you cant do what i asked for and to collect my fee gregory said blithely godwyn wished he could have him thrown into the fishpond in his london clothes it was the saturday of whitsun weekend the day before the opening of the fleece fair outside on the green to the west of the cathedral hundreds of traders were setting up their stalls and their conversations and cries to one another combined to make a roar that could be heard here in the hall of the priors house where godwyn and gregory sat at either end of the dining table philemon sitting on the bench at the side said to gregory perhaps you could explain to the lord prior how you have reached this pessimistic conclusion he was developing a tone of voice that sounded half obsequious and half contemptuous godwyn was not sure he liked it gregory did not react to the tone of course he said the king is in france godwyn said he has been there for almost a year but nothing much has happened you will hear of action this winter why you must have heard of the french raids on our southern ports i have philemon said they say the french sailors raped nuns at canterbury we always claim the enemy has raped nuns gregory said with condescension it encourages the common people to support the war but they did burn portsmouth and there has been serious disruption to shipping you may have noticed a fall in the price you get for your wool we certainly have thats partly due to the difficulty of shipping it to flanders and the price youre paying for wine from bordeaux is up for the same reason we couldnt afford wine at the old prices godwyn thought but he did not say so gregory went on these raids appear to be no more than preliminaries the french are assembling an invasion fleet our spies say they already have more than two hundred vessels anchored in the mouth of the zwyn river godwyn noted that gregory talked of our spies as if he were part of the government in reality he was only retailing gossip all the same it sounded convincing but what does the french war have to do with whether or not kingsbridge becomes a borough taxes the king needs money the parish guild has argued that the town will be more prosperous and therefore will pay more tax if the merchants are freed from the control of the priory and the king believes this it has proved true before thats why kings create boroughs boroughs generate trade and trade produces tax revenue money again godwyn thought with disgust is there nothing we can do not in london i advise you to concentrate on the kingsbridge end can you persuade the parish guild to withdraw the application whats the old alderman like can he be bribed my uncle edmund hes in poor health and fading fast but his daughter my cousin caris is the real driving force behind this ah yes i remember her at the trial rather arrogant i felt there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black godwyn thought sourly shes a witch he said is she now that might help i didnt mean literally philemon said as a matter of fact lord prior there have been rumours gregory raised his eyebrows interesting philemon went on she is a great friend of a wise woman called mattie who mixes potions for gullible townspeople godwyn was about to pour scorn on the witchcraft idea then he decided to shut up any weapon that might shoot down the notion of a borough charter must surely have been sent by god perhaps caris does use witchcraft he thought who knows gregory said i see you hesitate of course if you are fond of your cousin i was when we were younger godwyn said and he felt a pang of regret for the old simplicities but i regret to say she has not grown into a godfearing woman in that case i must investigate this godwyn said gregory said if i might make a suggestion godwyn had had enough of gregorys suggestions but he did not quite have the nerve to say so of course he said with slightly exaggerated politeness heresy investigations can be mucky you shouldnt get your own hands soiled and people may be nervous about talking to a prior delegate the task to someone less intimidating this young novice for example he indicated philemon who glowed with pleasure his attitude strikes me as sensible godwyn recalled that it was philemon who had discovered bishop richards weakness his affair with margery he was certainly the man for any dirty work all right he said see what you can find out philemon thank you lord prior said philemon nothing would give me more pleasure on sunday morning people were still pouring into kingsbridge caris stood and watched them streaming over merthins two wide bridges on foot on horseback or driving twowheeled and fourwheeled horsecarts and oxcarts laden with goods for the fair the sight gladdened her heart there had been no grand opening ceremony the bridge was not really finished but was usable thanks to a temporary timber roadbed but all the same word had got around that it was open and that the roads were safe from outlaws even buonaventura caroli was here merthin had suggested a different way of collecting the tolls which the parish guild had adopted eagerly instead of a single booth at the end of the bridge creating a bottleneck they had stationed ten men on leper island in temporary booths spread across the road between the two bridges most people handed over their penny without breaking stride there isnt even a queue caris said aloud talking to herself and the weather was sunny and mild with no sign of rain the fair was going to be a triumph then a week from today she would marry merthin she still had misgivings the idea of losing her independence and becoming someones property had not ceased to terrify her even though she knew merthin was not the kind of man to take advantage by bullying his wife on the rare occasions when she had confessed this feeling to gwenda for example or to mattie wise she had been told that she thought like a man well so be it that was how she felt but the prospect of losing him had seemed even more bleak what would she have left except for a clothmanufacturing business that did not inspire her when he finally announced his intention of leaving town the future had suddenly seemed empty and she had realized that the only thing worse than being married to him might be not being married to him at least that was what she told herself in her more positive moments then sometimes when she lay awake in the middle of the night she saw herself backing out at the last minute often in the middle of the wedding refusing to take the vows and rushing out of the church to the consternation of the entire congregation that was nonsense she felt now in the light of day with everything going so well she would marry merthin and be happy she left the river bank and walked through the town to the cathedral already crowded with worshippers waiting for the morning service she remembered merthin feeling her up behind a pillar she felt nostalgic for the thoughtless passion of their early relationship the long intense conversations and the stolen kisses she found him near the front of the congregation studying the south aisle of the choir the part of the church that had collapsed in front of their eyes two years ago she recalled going up into the space over the vaulting with merthin and overhearing that dreadful interaction between brother thomas and his estranged wife the conversation that had crystallized all her fears and made her turn merthin down she put the thought out of her mind the repairs seem to be holding she said guessing what he was thinking about he looked dubious two years is a short time in the life of a cathedral theres no sign of deterioration thats what makes it difficult an invisible weakness can work away for years unsuspected until something comes tumbling down perhaps there is no weakness there must be he said with a touch of impatience there was a reason why that collapse took place two years ago we never found out what it was so we havent put it right if it hasnt been put right its still a weakness it might have corrected itself spontaneously she was just being argumentative but he took her seriously buildings dont usually repair themselves but youre right its possible there might have been some seepage of water for example from a blocked gargoyle which somehow became diverted to a less harmful route the monks began to enter in procession singing and the congregation went quiet the nuns appeared from their separate entrance one of the novice nuns looked up a beautiful pale face in the line of hooded heads it was elizabeth clerk she saw merthin and caris together and the sudden malice in her eyes made caris shudder then elizabeth bowed her head and disappeared back into her anonymous uniform she hates you merthin said she thinks i stopped you marrying her shes right no shes not you could have married anyone you wanted but i only wanted you you toyed with elizabeth it must have seemed that way to her merthin said regretfully but i just liked talking to her especially after you turned to ice she felt uncomfortable i know but elizabeth feels cheated the way she looks at me makes me nervous dont be afraid shes a nun now she cant do you any harm they were quiet for a while standing side by side their shoulders touching intimately watching the ritual bishop richard sat on the throne at the east end presiding over the service merthin liked this sort of thing caris knew he always felt better afterwards and he said that was what going to church was supposed to do for you caris went because people noticed if she stayed away but she had doubts about the whole business she believed in god but she was not sure he revealed his wishes exclusively to men such as her cousin godwyn why would a god want praise for example kings and earls required worship and the more petty their rank the more deference they demanded it seemed to her that an almighty god would not care one way or another whether the people of kingsbridge sang his praises any more than she cared whether the deer in the forest feared her she occasionally gave voice to these ideas but no one took her seriously her thoughts drifted to the future the signs were good that the king would grant kingsbridge a borough charter her father would probably be the first mayor if his health recovered her cloth business would continue to grow mark webber would be rich with increased prosperity the parish guild could build a wool exchange so that everyone could do business comfortably even in bad weather merthin could design the building even the priory was going to be better off though godwyn would not thank her the service came to an end and the monks and nuns began to process out a novice monk broke out of line and entered the congregation it was philemon to cariss surprise he approached her may i have a word he said she repressed a shudder there was something loathsome about gwendas brother what about she replied barely politely i want to ask your advice really he said with an attempt at a charming smile you know mattie wise yes what do you think of her methods she gave him a hard look where was this going she decided she had better defend mattie anyway she has never studied the texts of the ancients of course despite that her remedies work sometimes better than those of the monks i think its because she bases her treatments on what has worked previously rather than on a theory about the humours people standing nearby were listening with curiosity and some of them now joined in uninvited she gave our nora a potion that brought her fever down said madge webber john constable said when i broke my arm her medicine took the pain away while matthew barber set the bone philemon said and what kind of spells does she pronounce when shes making her mixtures no spells caris said indignantly she tells people to pray when they take their medicines because only god can heal she says could she be a witch no its a ridiculous idea only there has been a complaint to the ecclesiastical court a chill gripped caris from whom i cant say but ive been asked to investigate caris was mystified who could matties enemy be she said to philemon well you of all people know matties worth she saved the life of your sister when she gave birth to sam gwenda would have bled to death if not for mattie so it seems seems gwendas alive isnt she yes of course so you feel sure mattie does not call on the devil caris noticed that he asked the question in a slightly raised voice as if he wanted to make sure the listeners around heard it she was puzzled but she had no doubt of her answer of course im sure ill swear an oath if you want not necessary philemon said smoothly thank you for your advice he inclined his head in a sort of bow and slithered away caris and merthin walked towards the exit what rubbish caris said mattie a witch merthin looked troubled you would expect philemon to want evidence against her wouldnt you yes so why did he come to you he could have guessed that you of all people would deny the charge why would he be keen to clear her name i dont know they passed through the great west doorway and out on to the green the sun was shining on hundreds of stalls loaded with colourful goods it doesnt make sense merthin said and that troubles me why its like the cause of weakness in the south aisle if you cant see it it may be working away invisibly to undermine you and you wont know it until everything comes crashing down all around the scarlet cloth on cariss market stall was not as good as that sold by loro fiorentino although you had to have a sharp eye for wool to see the difference the weave was not so close because the italian looms were somehow superior the colour was just as bright but it was not perfectly even over the length of the bale no doubt because italian dyers were more skilled in consequence she charged onetenth less than loro all the same it was easily the best english scarlet that had ever been seen at kingsbridge and business was brisk mark and madge sold it retail by the yard measuring and cutting for individual customers and caris dealt with wholesale buyers negotiating reductions for one bale or six with drapers from winchester gloucester and even london by midday on monday she knew she would sell out before the end of the week when business slowed down for the dinner break she strolled around the fair she felt a profound sense of satisfaction she had triumphed over adversity and so had merthin she stopped at perkins stall to talk to the wigleigh folk even gwenda had triumphed here she was married to wulfric something that had seemed impossible and there was her baby sammy a year old sitting on the ground fat and happy annet was selling eggs from a tray as always and ralph had gone to france to fight for the king and might never come back farther on she saw joby gwendas father selling his squirrel furs there was a wicked man but he seemed to have lost his power to hurt gwenda caris stopped at her own fathers stall she had persuaded him to buy fleece in smaller quantities this year the international wool market could not possibly thrive when the french and english were raiding one anothers ports and burning ships how is business she asked him steady he said i think ive judged it about right he forgot that it had been her judgement not his that had counselled caution but that was all right their cook tutty appeared with edmunds dinner mutton stew in a pot a loaf of bread and a jug of ale it was important to look prosperous but not overly so edmund had explained to caris many years ago that although customers needed to believe they were buying from a successful business they would resent contributing to the wealth of someone who appeared to be rolling in money are you hungry he asked her starving he stood up to reach for the stew pot then he staggered made an odd sound half way between a grunt and a cry and fell to the ground the cook screamed caris cried father but she knew he would not respond she could tell he was unconscious by the way he hit the earth inertly heavy like a sack of onions she fought down the urge to scream she knelt beside him he was alive and breathing hoarsely she grasped his wrist and felt his pulse it was strong but slow his face seemed flushed it was always reddish but now it seemed more so than usual tutty said what is it what is it caris forced herself to speak calmly hes had a fit she said fetch mark webber he can carry father into the hospital the cook ran off people from the neighbouring stalls gathered around dick brewer appeared and said poor edmund what can i do dick was too old and fat to lift edmund caris said marks coming to take him to the hospital she began to cry i hope hell be all right she said mark appeared he lifted edmund easily cradling him gently in his strong arms and walked towards the hospital negotiating his way through the crowds calling mind out there out of the way please injured man injured man caris followed distraught she could hardly see through her tears so she stayed close to marks broad back they reached the hospital building and went inside caris was grateful to see the familiar knobbly face of old julie fetch mother cecilia as quick as you can caris said to her the old nun hurried away and mark laid edmund on a pallet near the altar edmund was still unconscious eyes closed breathing hoarsely caris felt his forehead he was neither hot nor cold what had caused this it had been so sudden one moment he had been talking normally the next he fell down unconscious how could such a thing happen mother cecilia came her bustling efficiency was reassuring she knelt beside the pallet and felt edmunds heart then his pulse she listened to his breathing and touched his face get him a pillow and a blanket she said to julie then fetch one of the monkphysicians she stood up and looked at caris hes had a fit she said he may recover all we can do is make him comfortable the physician may recommend bleeding but apart from that the only treatment is prayer that was not good enough for caris im going for mattie she said she ran out of the building and dodged through the fair remembering that she had done exactly the same thing a year ago rushing to fetch mattie when gwenda was bleeding to death this time it was her father and she felt a different kind of panic she had been desperately worried about gwenda but now it was as if the world was falling apart the fear that her father might die gave her the dreadful feeling she sometimes got in dreams when she found herself on the roof of kingsbridge cathedral with no way down but to jump the physical effort of running through the streets calmed her a little and she was in control of her emotions by the time she came to matties house mattie would know what to do she would say ive seen this before i know what will happen next heres the treatment that helps caris banged on the door hearing no immediate answer she impatiently tried the latch and found it open she dashed inside saying mattie you have to come to the hospital right away its my father the front room was empty caris pulled aside the curtain that screened off the kitchen mattie was not there either caris said aloud oh why would you be out of the house at this very moment she looked around for some clue as to where mattie might have gone then she noticed how stripped the room appeared all the little jars and bottles had gone leaving the shelves bare there were none of the mortars and pestles mattie used for grinding ingredients none of her small pots for melting and boiling no knives for chopping herbs caris returned to the front half of the house and saw that matties personal possessions had also disappeared her sewing box her polished wood cups for wine the embroidered shawl she had hung on the wall for decoration the carved bone comb she treasured mattie had packed up and gone and caris could guess why mattie must have heard about philemons questions in church yesterday traditionally the ecclesiastical court held a session on the saturday of fleece fair week only two years ago the monks had used the occasion for the trial of crazy nell on the absurd charge of heresy mattie was no heretic of course but it was difficult to prove that as many old women had learned she had calculated her chances of surviving a trial and found the answer frightening without telling anyone she had packed up her possessions and left town probably she had found a peasant returning home after selling his produce and persuaded him to take her on his oxcart caris imagined her leaving at first light her box beside her on the cart the hood of her cloak pulled forward to hide her face no one could even guess where she had gone what am i going to do caris said to the empty room mattie knew better than anyone else in kingsbridge how to help sick people this was the worst possible moment for her to disappear just when edmund lay unconscious in the hospital caris felt despair she sat down on matties chair still panting from the effort of running she wanted to run back to the hospital but there was no point she would not be able to help her father nobody could the town must have a healer she thought one who does not rely on prayers and holy water or bleeding but uses simple treatments that have been shown to work and as she sat in matties empty house she realized that there was one person who could fill the role someone who knew matties methods and believed in her practical philosophy that person was caris herself the thought burst on her with the blinding light of a revelation and she sat dead still bewildered by the implications she knew the recipes for matties main potions one for easing pain one to cause vomiting one for washing wounds one to bring down a fever she knew the uses of all the common herbs dill for indigestion fennel for fever rue for flatulence watercress for infertility she knew the treatments mattie never prescribed poultices made with dung medicines containing gold and silver verses written on vellum and bound to the ailing part of the body and she had an instinct for it mother cecilia had said so had practically pleaded with caris to become a nun well she was not going to enter the priory but she might perhaps take matties place why not the cloth business could be run by mark webber he was doing most of the work anyway she would seek out other wise women in shiring in winchester perhaps in london and question them about their methods what succeeded and what failed men were secretive about their craft skills their mysteries as they called them as if there were something supernatural about tanning leather or making horseshoes but women were usually willing to share knowledge with other women she would even read some of the monks ancient texts there might be some truth in them perhaps the instinct that cecilia attributed to her would help her winnow the seeds of practical treatment from the chaff of priestly mumbojumbo she stood up and left the house she walked slowly back dreading what she would find at the hospital she felt fatalistic now her father would either be all right or he would not all she could do was carry out her resolution so that in future when the people she loved were sick she would know she was doing everything possible to help them she fought back tears as she made her way through the fair to the priory buildings when she entered the hospital she hardly dared look at her father she approached the bed which was surrounded by people mother cecilia old julie brother joseph mark webber petranilla alice elfric what must be must be she thought she touched the shoulder of her sister alice who moved aside making room at last caris looked at her father he was alive and conscious though he looked pale and tired his eyes were open and he looked straight at her and tried a weak smile im afraid i gave you a scare he said im sorry my dear oh thank god said caris and she began to cry on wednesday morning merthin came to cariss stall in consternation betty baxter just asked me a strange question he said she wanted to know who was going to stand against elfric in the election for alderman what election caris said my father is alderman oh she realized what must be going on elfric was telling people that edmund was too old and sick to fulfil the role and the town needed someone new and he was presenting himself as a candidate we must tell my father right away caris and merthin left the fairground and crossed the main street to the house edmund had left the priory hospital yesterday saying correctly that there was nothing the monks could do for him but bleed him which made him feel worse he had been carried home and a bed had been made up for him in the parlour on the ground floor this morning he was reclining on a stack of pillows in his improvised bed he looked so weak that caris hesitated to bother him with the news but merthin sat down beside him and laid out the facts starkly elfric is right edmund said when merthin had finished look at me i can hardly sit upright the parish guild needs strong leadership its no job for a sick man but youll be better soon caris exclaimed perhaps but im getting old you must have noticed how absentminded ive become i forget things and i was fatally slow to react to the downturn in the market for raw wool i lost a lot of money last year thank god weve rebuilt our fortune with the scarlet cloth but you did that caris not me she knew all that of course but still she felt indignant are you just going to let elfric take over certainly not he would be a disaster hes too much in thrall to godwyn even after we become a borough well need an alderman who can stand up to the priory who else could do the job talk to dick brewer hes one of the richest men in town and the alderman must be rich to have the respect of the other merchants dicks not afraid of godwyn or any of the monks hed be a good leader caris found herself reluctant to do as he said it seemed like accepting that he was going to die she could not remember a time when her father had not been alderman she did not want her world to change merthin understood her reluctance but urged her on we have to accept this he said if we ignore whats happening we could end up with elfric in charge he would be a disaster he might even withdraw the application for the borough charter that decided her youre right she said lets find dick dick brewer had several carts in different locations in the fairground each bore a huge barrel his children grandchildren and inlaws were selling ale from the barrels as fast as they could pour it caris and merthin found him setting an example by drinking a large pot of his own brew while he watched his family making money for him they took him aside and explained what was going on dick said to caris when your father dies i suppose his fortune will be divided equally between you and your sister yes edmund had already told caris that this was in his will when alices inheritance is added to elfrics existing wealth he will be very rich caris realized that half the money she was making from her scarlet cloth might go to her sister she had not thought of this before because she had not thought about her father dying it came as a shock money itself was not important to her but she did not want to help elfric become alderman its not just a question of who is the richest man she said we need someone who will stand up for the merchants then you must put up a rival candidate dick said will you stand she asked him directly he shook his head dont bother trying to persuade me at the end of this week im handing over to my eldest son im planning to spend the rest of my days drinking beer instead of brewing it he took a long draught from his tankard and belched contentedly caris felt she had to accept that he seemed quite sure she said who do you think we might approach theres only one real possibility he said you caris was astonished me why youre the driving force behind the campaign for a borough charter your fiancés bridge has saved the fleece fair and your cloth business has pretty much rescued the towns prosperity after the wool slump youre the child of the existing alderman and although its not an inherited office people think leaders breed leaders and theyre right youve actually been acting as alderman for almost a year ever since your fathers powers started to fail has the town ever had a woman alderman not as far as i know nor one as young as you both these things will count heavily against you im not saying youre going to win im telling you no one else has a better chance of beating elfric caris had a faintly dizzy feeling was it possible could she do the job what about her vow to become a healer were there not many other people in town who would be better than she as alderman what about mark webber she said hed be good especially with that shrewd wife of his at his side but people in this town still think of mark as a poor weaver hes prosperous now thanks to your scarlet cloth but people are suspicious of new money they would just say mark is a jumpedup weaver they want an alderman from a wellestablished family someone whose father was rich and preferably grandfather too caris wanted to beat elfric but she did not feel sure of her ability she thought of her fathers patience and shrewdness his hearty conviviality his inexhaustible energy did she have any such qualities she looked at merthin he said you would be the best alderman the town has ever had his unhesitating confidence decided her all right she said ill do it godwyn invited elfric to dine with him on the friday of the fair he ordered an expensive dinner swan cooked with ginger and honey philemon served them and sat down to eat with them the citizens had decided to elect a new alderman and in a remarkably short time two candidates had emerged as the principal contestants elfric and caris godwyn did not like elfric but he was useful he was not a particularly good builder but he had successfully ingratiated himself with prior anthony and thereby gained the contract for cathedral repairs when godwyn took office he had seen in elfric a servile toady and had kept him on elfric was not well liked but he either employed or subcontracted most of the building craftsmen and suppliers in town and they in their turn courted him in the hope of work having won his confidence they all wanted him to continue in a position where he could grant them favours and that gave him a power base i dont like uncertainty godwyn said elfric tasted the swan and grunted appreciatively in what context the election of a new alderman by its nature an election is uncertain unless there is only one candidate which would be my preference mine too provided that candidate was me thats what im suggesting elfric looked up from his dinner really tell me elfric how badly do you want to be alderman elfric swallowed his mouthful i want it he said his voice sounded a little hoarse and he slurped some wine i deserve it he went on a note of indignation creeping into his tone im as good as any of them am i not why should i not be alderman would you proceed with the application for a borough charter elfric stared at him thoughtfully he said are you asking me to withdraw it if youre elected alderman yes are you offering to help me get elected yes but how by eliminating the rival candidate elfric looked sceptical i dont see how you could achieve that godwyn nodded to philemon who said i believe caris is a heretic elfric dropped his knife youre going to try caris as a witch you must not tell anyone about this philemon said if she hears about it beforehand she may flee as mattie wise did i have let some townspeople believe that mattie has been captured and it is she who will be tried on saturday at the ecclesiastical court but at the last minute a different person will be accused elfric nodded and as its an ecclesiastical court there is conveniently no need for indictments or juries he turned to godwyn and you will be judge unfortunately no godwyn said bishop richard will preside so we must prove our point have you any evidence elfric said sceptically godwyn replied some but wed like more what we already have would be plenty if the accused were some old woman with no family or friends like crazy nell but caris is well known and comes from a wealthy and influential family as i need hardly tell you philemon put in its extremely fortunate for us that her father is too ill to leave his bed god has ordained it so that he will not be able to defend her godwyn nodded nevertheless she has many friends so our evidence must be strong what have you got in mind said elfric philemon answered it would be helpful if a member of her family were to come forward and say that she had called upon the devil or turned a crucifix upside down or spoken to some presence in an empty room for a moment elfric looked as if he did not understand then enlightenment dawned oh he said you mean me think very carefully before you answer youre asking me to help send my sisterinlaw to gallows cross godwyn said your sisterinlaw my cousin yes all right im thinking godwyn saw on elfrics face ambition greed and vainglory and he marvelled at the way god used even mens weaknesses to his holy purpose he could guess what elfric was thinking the position of alderman was a burdensome task for an unselfish man such as edmund who exercised his power for the benefit of the towns merchants but for someone with his eye on the main chance it offered endless opportunities for profit and selfaggrandizement philemon continued in a smooth assured voice if you have never witnessed anything suspicious then of course that is the end of the matter but i beg you to search your memory carefully godwyn noticed again how much philemon had learned in the last two years the awkward priory servant had vanished he talked like an archdeacon there may have been incidents that seemed at the time perfectly harmless but which take on a sinister cast in the light of what you have been told today on mature reflection you may feel that these events were not as innocent as they at first appeared i get your meaning brother elfric said there was a long silence none of them ate godwyn waited patiently for elfrics decision philemon said and of course if caris were dead then edmunds entire fortune would come to the other sister alice your wife yes elfric said id thought of that well said philemon is there anything you can think of that might help us oh yes elfric said at last i can think of quite a lot caris was unable to find out the truth about mattie wise some people said she had been captured and was locked in a cell in the priory others thought she would be tried in her absence a third strand of opinion claimed that someone else entirely would stand trial for heresy godwyn refused to answer cariss questions and the rest of the monks said they knew nothing caris went to the cathedral on saturday morning determined to defend mattie whether she was present or not and to stand up for any other poor old woman who suffered this absurd accusation why did monks and priests hate women so they worshipped their blessed virgin but treated every other female as an incarnation of the devil what was the matter with them in a secular court there would have been a jury of indictment and a preliminary hearing and caris would have been able to find out in advance what the evidence against mattie might be but the church made its own rules whatever they alleged caris would say loud and clear that mattie was a genuine healer who used herbs and drugs and told people to pray to god to make them well some of the many townspeople who had been helped by mattie would surely speak up for her caris stood with merthin in the north transept and remembered the saturday two years ago when crazy nell had been tried caris had told the court nell was mad but harmless it had done no good today as then there was a big crowd of townspeople and visitors in the cathedral hoping for drama accusations counteraccusations quarrels hysterics curses and the spectacle of a woman being flogged through the streets and then hanged at gallows cross friar murdo was present he always showed up for sensational trials they provided an opportunity for him to do what he did best whip up hysteria in a congregation while they were waiting for the clergy cariss mind wandered tomorrow in this church she would marry merthin betty baxter and her four daughters were already busy making the bread and pastry for the feast tomorrow night caris and merthin would sleep together in his house on leper island she had stopped worrying about the marriage she had made her decision and she would take the consequences in truth she felt very happy sometimes she wondered how she could have been so scared merthin could not make anyone his slave it was not in his nature he was even kind to his boy labourer jimmie most of all she loved their sexual intimacy it was the best thing that had ever happened to her what she looked forward to most was having a home and a bed of their own and being able to make love whenever they wanted to on going to bed or on waking up in the middle of the night or even the middle of the day at last the monks and nuns came in led by bishop richard with his assistant archdeacon lloyd when they had taken their seats prior godwyn stood up and said we are here today to try the charge of heresy against caris daughter of edmund wooler the crowd gasped merthin shouted no everyone turned to look at caris she felt sick with fear she had had no suspicion of this it hit her like a punch in the dark bewildered she said why no one answered her she remembered her father warning her that godwyn would have an extreme reaction to the threat of a borough charter you know how ruthless he is even over small disputes edmund had said something like this will lead to total war caris shuddered now to remember her reply so be it total war even so godwyns chance of success would have been slender indeed if her father had been in good health edmund would have fought godwyn to a standstill and probably destroyed him but caris alone was a different matter she did not have her fathers power authority or popular support not yet without him she had become vulnerable she noticed her aunt petranilla in the crowd she was one of the few people not looking at caris how could she stand there in silence of course she supported her son godwyn in general but surely she would try to stop him condemning caris to death she had once said she wanted to be like a mother to caris would she remember that somehow caris felt she would not her devotion to her son was too great that was why she could not meet cariss eye she had already made up her mind not to stand in godwyns way philemon stood up my lord bishop he said formally addressing the judge but he immediately turned to the crowd as everyone knows the woman mattie wise has fled too frightened and guilty to be tried caris has been a regular visitor to matties house for some years only days ago she defended the woman in front of witnesses here in the cathedral so that was why philemon had questioned her about mattie caris realized she caught merthins eye he had been worried because he could not figure out what philemon was up to he had been right to worry now they knew at the same time part of her mind marvelled at the transformation of philemon that awkward unhappy boy was now a confident arrogant man standing in front of the bishop the prior and the townspeople as full of spite as a snake about to strike philemon said she offered to swear on oath that mattie is no witch why would she do that unless to cover her own guilt merthin shouted out because shes innocent and so is mattie you mendacious hypocrite he might have been put in the stocks for that but others were shouting at the same time and his insult passed without comment philemon went on recently caris has miraculously dyed wool the exact shade of italian scarlet something kingsbridge dyers have never been able to do how has this been achieved by a magic spell caris heard the rumble of mark webbers bass voice this is a lie she could not do this by daylight of course she lit a fire in her back yard at night as was seen by people living nearby philemon had been assiduous caris noted with foreboding he had interviewed her neighbours and she chanted strange rhymes why caris had sung to herself out of boredom as she boiled up dyes and dipped the cloth but philemon had the ability to turn innocent trivia into evidence of evil he dropped his voice to a thrilling stage whisper and said because she was calling for the secret aid of the prince of darkness he raised his voice to a shout lucifer the crowd groaned with dread that cloth is satans scarlet caris looked at merthin he was aghast the fools are starting to believe him he said cariss courage began to return dont despair she said i havent had my say yet he took her hand this is not the only spell she has used philemon continued in a more normal voice mattie wise also made love potions he looked accusingly around the crowd there may even be wicked girls in this church now who have made use of matties powers to bewitch a man including your own sister caris thought did philemon know about that he said this novice nun will testify elizabeth clerk stood up she spoke in a quiet voice eyes lowered the picture of nunlike modesty i say this on my oath as i hope to be saved she began i was betrothed to merthin builder merthin called out liar we were in love and very happy elizabeth went on suddenly he changed he seemed like a stranger to me he became cold philemon asked her did you notice anything else unusual sister yes brother i saw him hold his knife in his left hand the crowd gasped this was an acknowledged sign of bewitchment although as caris knew merthin was ambidextrous elizabeth said then he announced he was going to marry caris it was amazing caris thought how the truth could be just a little skewed so that it sounded sinister she knew what had really happened merthin and elizabeth had been friends until elizabeth made it clear she wanted to be more than a friend at which point he had told her that he did not share her feelings and they had parted but a satanic spell made a much better story elizabeth might have convinced herself that she was telling the truth but philemon knew this was a lie and philemon was godwyns tool how could godwyn reconcile his conscience with this level of wickedness was he telling himself that anything was justified in the service of the priory elizabeth finished i can never love another man that is why i have decided to give my life to god she sat down it was powerful evidence caris realized and her dismay darkened like a winter sky the fact that elizabeth had become a nun lent conviction to her testimony she was operating a kind of sentimental blackmail how can you disbelieve me when i have made such a sacrifice the townspeople were quieter now this was not the hilarious spectacle of a mad old woman being condemned they were watching a battle for the life of a fellow citizen philemon said most damning of all my lord bishop is the final witness a close member of the accused womans own family her brotherinlaw elfric builder caris gasped she had been accused by her cousin godwyn by her best friends brother philemon and by elizabeth but this was worse for her sisters husband to speak against her was astonishing treachery surely no one would ever respect elfric again elfric stood up the expression of defiance on his face told caris he was ashamed of himself i say this on my oath as i hope to be saved he began caris looked around for her sister alice but did not see her if she had been here she would surely have stopped elfric no doubt elfric had ordered her to stay at home on some pretext she probably knew nothing of this elfric said caris speaks to unseen presences in empty rooms spirits philemon prompted i fear so a murmur of horror came from the crowd caris was aware that she often talked aloud to herself she had always thought of it as a harmless if mildly embarrassing habit her father said all imaginative people did it now it was being used to condemn her she bit back a protest it was better to let the prosecution run its course then refute the accusations one by one when does she do this philemon asked elfric when she thinks she is alone and what does she say the words are difficult to make out she might be speaking a foreign tongue the crowded reacted to that too witches and their familiars were said to have their own language that no one else could understand what does she seem to be saying to judge by her tone of voice she is asking for help pleading for good luck cursing those who cause her misfortune that sort of thing merthin shouted this is not evidence everyone looked at him and he added he has admitted he did not understand the words hes just making this up there was a rumble of support from the more levelheaded citizens but it was not as loud nor as indignant as caris would have liked bishop richard spoke for the first time be quiet he said men who disrupt the proceedings will be put outside by the constable carry on please brother philemon but do not invite witnesses to fabricate evidence when they have admitted they do not know the truth that was at least evenhanded caris thought richard and his family had no love for godwyn after the quarrel over margerys wedding on the other hand as a cleric richard might not want the town to pass out of the priorys control perhaps he would at least be neutral in this her hopes rose a little philemon said to elfric do you think the familiars she speaks to help her in any way most certainly elfric replied cariss friends those she favours are lucky merthin has become a successful builder although he never even completed his apprenticeship as a carpenter mark webber was a poor man but now he is rich cariss friend gwenda is married to wulfric even though wulfric was betrothed to someone else how are these things achieved if not with unnatural help thank you elfric sat down as philemon summarized his evidence caris fought down a rising feeling of terror she tried to put out of her mind the vision of crazy nell being flogged behind a cart she struggled to concentrate on what she should say to defend herself she could ridicule every statement made about her but that might not be enough she needed to explain why people had lied about her and show what their motives were when philemon was finished godwyn asked her if she had anything to say in a loud voice that sounded more confident than she felt she replied of course i do she made her way to the front of the crowd she would not let her accusers monopolize the position of authority she took her time making them all wait for her she walked up to the throne and looked richard in the eye my lord bishop i say this on my oath as i hope to be saved she turned to the crowd and added which i notice philemon did not say godwyn interrupted as a monk he does not need to swear caris raised her voice and a good thing for him otherwise he would burn in hell for the lies he has told today score a point to me she thought and her hopes rose another notch she spoke to the crowd although the decision would be made by the bishop he would be heavily influenced by the reaction of the townspeople he was not a man of high principle mattie wise healed many people in this town she began on this day two years ago when the old bridge collapsed she was one of the foremost in tending to the injured working alongside mother cecilia and the nuns looking around the church today i see many people who benefited from her care at that terrible time did anyone hear her invoke the devil on that day if so let him speak now she paused to let the silence impress itself on her audience she pointed at madge webber mattie gave you a potion that brought down your childs fever what did she say to you madge looked scared no one was comfortable being called as a witness in the defence of a witch but madge owed a lot to caris she straightened her shoulders looked defiant and said mattie said to me pray to god for only he can heal caris pointed at the constable john she eased your pain while matthew barber set your broken bones what did she say to you john was used to being on the prosecuting side and he too looked uneasy but he told the truth in a strong voice she said pray to god for only he can heal caris turned to the crowd everyone knows that mattie was no witch in that case says brother philemon why did she flee easy question she was afraid that lies would be told about her as they have been told about me which of you women if falsely accused of heresy would feel confident about proving your innocence to a court of priests and monks she looked around letting her eyes rest on the prominent women of the town lib wheeler sarah taverner susanna chepstow why did i mix dyes at night she resumed because the days were short like many of you my father failed to sell all his fleeces last year and i wanted to turn the raw wool into something i could market it was very difficult to discover the formula but i did it by hard work over many hours day and night but without the help of satan she paused for breath when she began again she used a different tone of voice more playful i am accused of bewitching merthin i have to admit that the case against me is strong look at sister elizabeth stand up please sister reluctantly elizabeth stood she is beautiful isnt she caris said she is also clever and she is the daughter of a bishop oh forgive me my lord bishop i meant no disrespect the crowd chuckled at that cheeky stab godwyn looked outraged but bishop richard smothered a smile sister elizabeth cannot see why any man would prefer me to her nor can i unaccountably merthin loves me plain as i am i cannot explain it there was more giggling im sorry elizabeth is so angry if we lived in old testament times merthin could have two wives and everyone would be happy they laughed loudly at that she waited for the sound to subside then said gravely what i am most sorry about is that the commonplace jealousy of a disappointed woman should become the pretext in the untrustworthy mouth of a novice monk for a charge as serious as that of heresy philemon stood up to protest the charge of untrustworthiness but bishop richard flapped a hand at him saying let her speak let her speak caris decided she had made her point about elizabeth and moved on i confess that i sometimes use vulgar words when i am alone especially if i stub my toe but you may ask why my own brotherinlaw would testify against me and tell you that my mutterings were invocations to evil spirits im afraid i can answer that she paused then spoke solemnly my father is ill if he dies his fortune will be divided between me and my sister but if i die first my sister will get it all and my sister is elfrics wife she paused again looking quizzically at the crowd are you shocked she said so am i but men kill for less money than that she moved away as if she had finished and philemon got up from his bench caris turned around and addressed him in latin caput tuum inano est the monks laughed loudly and philemon flushed caris turned to elfric you didnt understand that did you elfric no he said sulkily which is why you might have thought i was using some sinister witchcraft tongue she turned back to philemon brother you know what language i was using dont you latin philemon replied perhaps you would tell us what i just said to you philemon looked an appeal at the bishop but richard was amused and just said answer the question looking furious philemon obeyed she said youve got your head up your arse the townspeople roared with laughter and caris walked back to her place when the noise died down philemon began to speak but richard interrupted him i dont need to hear any further from you he said youve made a strong case against her and she has mounted a vigorous defence does anyone else have anything to say about this accusation i do my lord bishop friar murdo came forward some of the townspeople cheered others groaned murdo aroused contrary reactions heresy is an evil he began his voice modulating into fruity preaching mode it corrupts the souls of women and men thank you brother but i know what heresy does said richard do you have anything else to say if not just this murdo replied i agree with and reiterate if it has been said before your own comment that the case is strong and the defence similar in which case i have a solution to propose all right brother murdo what is it in the minimum number of words she must be examined for the devils mark cariss heart seemed to stop of course said the bishop i seem to remember you making the same suggestion at an earlier trial indeed lord for the devil greedily sucks the hot blood of his acolytes through his own special nipple as the newborn babe sucks the swollen breasts yes thank you friar no need for further details mother cecilia will you and two other nuns please take the accused woman to a place of examination caris looked at merthin he was pale with horror they were both thinking the same caris had a mole it was tiny but the nuns would find it in just the kind of place they thought the devil was most interested in on the left side of her vulva just beside the cleft it was dark brown and the redgold hair around did not hide it the first time merthin had noticed it he had joked friar murdo would call you a witch youd better not let him see it and caris had laughed and said not if he were the last man on earth how could they have spoken of it in such a carefree way now she would be condemned to death for it she looked around desperately she would have run but she was surrounded by hundreds of people some of whom would stop her she saw merthins hand on the knife at his belt but even if the knife had been a sword and he had been a great fighter which he was not he could not have cut his way through such a crowd mother cecilia came to her and took her hand caris decided she would escape as soon as she got outside the church crossing the cloisters she could easily break free then godwyn said constable take one of your deputies and escort the woman to the place of examination and stand outside the door until it is done cecilia could not have held caris but two men could john looked at mark webber normally his first choice among the deputies caris felt a faint hope mark was a loyal friend to her but the constable apparently had the same thought for he turned from mark and pointed to christopher blacksmith cecilia tugged gently on cariss hand as if sleepwalking caris allowed herself to be led out of the church they left by the north door cecilia and caris followed by sister mair and old julie with john constable and christopher blacksmith close behind they crossed the cloisters entered the nuns quarters and made their way to the dormitory the two men stayed outside cecilia closed the door no need to examine me caris said dully ive got a mark we know said cecilia caris frowned how we have washed you she indicated mair and julie all three of us when you were in the hospital two christmases ago you had eaten something that poisoned you cecilia did not know or was pretending not to have guessed that caris had taken a potion to end her pregnancy she went on you were puking and shitting all over the place and bleeding down there you had to be washed several times we all saw the mole hopeless despair washed over caris in an irresistible tide she closed her eyes so now you will condemn me to death she said in a voice so low it was almost a whisper not necessarily said cecilia there could be another way merthin was distraught caris was trapped she would be condemned to death and there was nothing he could do he could not have rescued her even if he had been ralph with big shoulders and a sword and a relish for violence he stared horrified at the door through which she had disappeared he knew where cariss mole was and he felt sure the nuns would find it that was just the kind of place where they would look most carefully all around him the noise of excited chatter rose from the crowd people were arguing for or against caris rerunning the trial but he seemed to be inside a bubble and he could hardly follow what anyone said in his ears their talk sounded like the random beating of a hundred drums he found himself staring at godwyn wondering what he was thinking merthin could understand the others elizabeth was eaten up with jealousy elfric was possessed by greed and philemon was pure malevolence but the prior mystified him godwyn had grown up with his cousin caris and he knew she was not a witch yet he was prepared to see her die how could he do something so wicked what excuse did he make to himself did he tell himself that this was all for the glory of god godwyn had once seemed to be a man of enlightenment and decency the antidote to prior anthonys narrow conservatism but he had turned out to be worse than anthony more ruthless in the pursuit of the same obsolete aims if caris dies merthin thought im going to kill godwyn his parents came up to him they had been in the cathedral throughout the trial his father said something but merthin could not understand him what he said then the north door opened and the crowd became silent mother cecilia walked in alone and closed the door behind her there was a murmur of curiosity what now cecilia walked up to the bishops throne richard said well mother prioress what do you have to report to the court cecilia said slowly caris has confessed there was a roar of shock from the crowd cecilia raised her voice confessed her sins they went quiet again what did this mean she has received absolution from whom godwyn interrupted a nun cannot give absolution from father joffroi merthin knew joffroi he was the priest at st marks the church where merthin had repaired the roof joffroi had no love for godwyn but what was going on everyone waited for cecilia to explain she said caris has applied to become a novice nun here at the priory once again she was interrupted by a shout of shock from the assembled townspeople she yelled over their voices and i have accepted her there was uproar merthin could see godwyn yelling at the top of his voice but his words were lost elizabeth was enraged philemon stared at cecilia with poisonous hatred elfric looked bewildered richard was amused merthins own mind reeled with the implications would the bishop accept this did it mean the trial was over had caris been saved from execution eventually the tumult died down as soon as he could be heard godwyn spoke his face white with fury did she or did she not confess to heresy the confessional is a sacred trust cecilia replied imperturbably i dont know what she said to the priest and if i did i could not tell you or anyone else does she bear the mark of satan we did not examine her this answer was evasive merthin realized but cecilia quickly added it was not necessary once she had received absolution this is unacceptable godwyn bellowed he had dropped the pretence that philemon was the prosecutor the prioress cannot frustrate the proceedings of the court in this way bishop richard said thank you father prior the order of the court must be carried out richard raised his voice that will do godwyn opened his mouth to protest further then thought better of it richard said i dont need to hear any more argument i have made my decision and i will now announce my judgement silence fell the proposal that caris be permitted to enter the nunnery is an interesting one if she is a witch she will be unable to do any harm in the holiness of her surroundings the devil cannot enter here on the other hand if she is not a witch we will have been saved from the error of condemning an innocent woman perhaps the nunnery would not have been cariss choice as a way of life but her consolation will be an existence dedicated to serving god on balance then i find this a satisfactory solution godwyn said what if she should leave the nunnery good point said the bishop that is why i am formally sentencing her to death but suspending the sentence for as long as she remains a nun if she should renounce her vows the sentence would be carried out thats it thought merthin in despair a life sentence and he felt tears of rage and grief come to his eyes richard stood up godwyn said the court is adjourned the bishop left followed by the monks and nuns in procession merthin moved in a daze his mother spoke to him in a consoling voice but he ignored her he let the crowd carry him to the great west door of the cathedral and out on to the green the traders were packing up their leftover goods and dismantling their stalls the fleece fair was over for another year godwyn had got what he wanted he realized with edmund dying and caris out of the way elfric would become alderman and the application for a borough charter would be withdrawn he looked at the grey stone walls of the priory buildings caris was in there somewhere he turned that way moving across the tide of the crowd and headed for the hospital the place was empty it had been swept clean and the strawfilled palliasses used by the overnight visitors were stacked neatly against the walls a candle burned on the altar at the eastern end merthin walked slowly the length of the room not sure what to do next he recalled from timothys book that his ancestor jack builder had briefly become a novice monk the author had hinted that jack had been a reluctant recruit and had not taken easily to monastic discipline at any rate his novitiate had ended abruptly in circumstances over which timothy drew a tactful veil but bishop richard had stated that if caris ever left the nunnery she would be under sentence of death a young nun came in when she recognized merthin she looked scared what do you want she said i must speak to caris ill go and ask she said and hurried out merthin looked at the altar and the crucifix and the triptych on the wall showing elizabeth of hungary the patron saint of hospitals one panel showed the saint who had been a princess wearing a crown and feeding the poor the second showed her building her hospital and the third illustrated the miracle in which the food she carried beneath her cloak was turned into roses what would caris do in this place she was a sceptic doubtful of just about everything the church taught she did not believe that a princess could turn bread into roses how do they know that she would say to stories that everyone else accepted without question adam and eve noahs ark david and goliath even the nativity she would be a caged wildcat in here he had to talk to her to find out what was in her mind she must have some plan that he was not able to guess at he waited impatiently for the nun to return she did not come back but old julie appeared thank heaven he said julie i have to see caris quickly im sorry young merthin she said caris doesnt want to see you dont be ridiculous he said were betrothed were supposed to get married tomorrow she has to see me shes a novice nun now she wont be getting married merthin raised his voice if thats true dont you think she should tell me herself its not for me to say she knows youre here and she wont see you i dont believe you merthin pushed past the old nun and went through the door by which she had entered he found himself in a small lobby he had never been here before few men had ever entered the nuns area of the priory he passed through another door and found himself in the nuns cloisters several of them stood there some reading some walking around the square meditatively some talking in quiet voices he ran along the arcade a nun caught sight of him and screamed he ignored her seeing a staircase he ran up it and entered the first room he found himself in a dormitory there were two lines of mattresses with neatly folded blankets on top no one was there he went a few steps along the corridor and tried another door it was locked caris he shouted are you in there speak to me he banged on the door with his fist he scraped the skin of his knuckles which started to bleed but he hardly felt the pain let me in he yelled let me in a voice behind him said ill let you in he spun round to see mother cecilia she took a key from her belt and calmly unlocked the door merthin threw it open beyond it was a small room with a single window all around the walls were shelves packed with folded clothes this is where we keep our winter robes cecilia said its a storeroom where is she merthin shouted shes in a room that is locked by her own request you wont find the room and if you did you couldnt get in she will not see you how do i know shes not dead merthin heard his voice crack with emotion but he did not care you know me cecilia said shes not dead she looked at his hand youve hurt yourself she said sympathetically come with me and let me put some ointment on your cuts he looked at his hand and then at her youre a devil he said he ran from her back the way he had come into the hospital past a scaredlooking julie out into the open he made his way through the endoffair chaos in front of the cathedral and emerged on to the main street he thought of speaking to edmund but decided against it someone else could tell cariss ailing father the terrible truth whom could he trust he thought of mark webber mark and his family had moved to a big house on the main street with a large stonebuilt groundfloor storeroom for bales of cloth there was no loom in their kitchen now all the weaving was done by others whom they organized mark and madge were sitting on a bench looking solemn when merthin walked in mark jumped up have you seen her he cried they wont let me thats outrageous mark said they dont have the right to stop her seeing the man shes supposed to marry the nuns say she doesnt want to see me i dont believe them nor do i i went in and looked for her but i couldnt find her there are a lot of locked doors she must be there somewhere i know will you come back with me and bring a hammer and help me break down every door until we find her mark looked uncomfortable strong as he was he hated violence merthin said i have to find her she might be dead before he could reply madge said ive got a better idea the two men looked at her ill go to the nunnery madge said the nuns wont be so nervous of a woman perhaps they will persuade caris to see me mark nodded at least then well know that shes alive merthin said but i need more than that what is she thinking is she going to wait until the fuss dies down then escape should i try to break her out of there or should i just wait and if so how long a month a year seven years ill ask her if theyll let me in madge stood up you wait here no im coming with you merthin said ill wait outside in that case mark why dont you come too to keep merthin company to keep merthin out of trouble she meant but he made no objection he had asked for their help and he was grateful to have two people he trusted on his side they hurried back to the priory close mark and merthin waited outside the hospital while madge went in merthin saw that cariss old dog scrap was sitting at the door waiting for her to reappear after madge had been gone for half an hour merthin said i think they must have let her in otherwise shed be back by now well see said mark they watched the last of the traders pack up and depart leaving the cathedral green a sea of churned mud merthin paced up and down while mark sat like a statue of samson one hour followed another despite his impatience merthin was glad of the delay for almost certainly madge was talking to caris the sun was sinking over the west side of town when at last madge emerged her expression was solemn and her face was wet with tears caris is alive she said and theres nothing wrong with her physically or mentally shes in her right mind what did she say merthin asked urgently ill tell you every word come lets sit in the garden they went to the vegetable patch and sat on the stone bench looking at the sunset madges equanimity gave merthin a bad feeling he would have preferred her to be spitting with rage her manner told him the news was bad he felt hopeless he said is it true that she doesnt want to see me madge sighed yes but why i asked her that she said it would break her heart merthin began to cry madge went on in a low clear voice mother cecilia left us alone so that we could speak frankly without being overheard caris believes that godwyn and philemon are determined to get rid of her because of the application for a borough charter shes safe in the nunnery but if she ever leaves they will find her and kill her she could escape and i could take her to london merthin said godwyn would never find us there madge nodded i said that to her we discussed it for a long time she feels the two of you would be fugitives for the rest of your lives shes not willing to condemn you to that its your destiny to be the greatest builder of your generation you will be famous but if she is with you you will always have to lie about your identity and hide from the light of day i dont care about that she told me you would say that but she believes you do care about it and what is more she thinks you should anyway she cares about it she will not take away your destiny even if you ask her to she could say this to me herself shes afraid you would talk her round merthin knew madge was telling the truth cecilia had been telling the truth too caris did not want to see him he felt choked with grief he swallowed wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve and struggled to speak but what will she do he said make the best of it try to be a good nun she hates the church i know she has never been very respectful of the clergy in this town its not surprising but she believes she can find some kind of consolation in a life dedicated to healing her fellow women and men merthin thought about that mark and madge watched him in silence he could imagine caris working in the hospital taking care of sick people but how would she feel about spending half the night singing and praying she might kill herself he said after a long pause i dont think so madge said with conviction shes terribly sad but i dont see her taking that way out she might kill someone else thats more likely then again merthin said slowly and reluctantly she might find a kind of happiness madge said nothing merthin looked hard at her she nodded that was the terrible truth he realized caris might be happy she was losing her home her freedom and her husbandtobe but she might still be happy in the end there was nothing more to say merthin stood up thank you for being my friends he said he began to walk away mark said where are you going merthin stopped and turned back there was a thought spinning in his head and he waited for it to become clear when it did he was astonished but he saw immediately that the idea was right it was not merely right it was perfect he wiped the tears from his face and looked at mark and madge in the red light of the dying sun im going to florence he said goodbye part five march to december sister caris left the nuns cloisters and walked briskly into the hospital there were three patients lying in beds old julie was now too infirm to attend services or climb the stairs to the nuns dormitory bella brewer the wife of dick brewers son danny was recovering from a complicated birth and rickie silvers aged thirteen had a broken arm which matthew barber had set two other people sat on a bench to one side talking a novice nun called nellie and a priory servant bob cariss experienced gaze swept the room beside each bed was a dirty dinner plate the dinner hour was long over bob she said he leaped to his feet take away these plates this is a monastery and cleanliness is a virtue jump to it sorry sister he said nellie have you taken old julie to the latrine not yet sister she always needs to go after dinner my mother was the same take her quick before she has an accident nellie began to get the old nun up caris was trying to develop the quality of patience but after seven years as a nun she still had not succeeded and she became frustrated by having to repeat instructions again and again bob knew he should clear away as soon as dinner was over caris had told him often nellie knew julies needs yet they sat on a bench gossiping until caris surprised tnem with a lightning inspection she picked up the bowl of water that had been used for hand washing and walked the length of the room to throw it outside a man she did not know was relieving himself against the outside wall she guessed he was a traveller hoping for a bed next time use the latrine behind the stable she snapped he leered at her holding his penis in his hand and who are you he said insolently im in charge of this hospital and if you want to stay here tonight youll have to improve your manners oh he said the bossy type eh he took his time shaking the drops off put away your pathetic prick or you wont be allowed to spend a night in this town let alone at the priory caris threw the bowl of water at his middle he jumped back shocked his hose soaked she went back inside and refilled the bowl at the fountain there was an underground pipe running through the priory that brought clean water from upstream of the town and fed fountains in the cloisters the kitchens and the hospital a separate branch of the subterranean stream flushed the latrines one day caris wanted to build a new latrine adjacent to the hospital so that senile patients such as julie would not have to go so far the stranger followed her in wash your hands she said handing him the bowl he hesitated then took the bowl from her she looked at him he was about her own age twentynine who are you she said gilbert of hereford a pilgrim he said ive come to reverence the relics of st adolphus in that case youll be welcome to stay a night here at the hospital provided you speak respectfully to me and to anyone else here for that matter yes sister caris returned to the cloisters it was a mild spring day and the sun shone on the smooth old stones of the courtyard along the west walk sister mair was teaching the girls school a new hymn and caris paused to observe people said that mair looked like an angel she had clear skin bright eyes and a mouth shaped like a bow the school was technically one of cariss responsibilities she was guest master in charge of everyone who came into the nunnery from the outside world she had attended this school herself almost twenty years ago there were ten pupils aged from nine to fifteen some were the daughters of kingsbridge merchants others were noblemens children the hymn on the theme that god is good came to an end and one ox the girls asked sister mair if god is good why did he let my parents die it was the childs personal version of a classic question one asked by all intelligent youngsters sooner or later how can bad things happen caris had asked it herself she looked with interest at the questioner she was tilly shiring twelveyearold niece of earl roland a girl with an impish look that caris liked tillys mother had bled to death after giving birth to her and her father had broken his neck in a hunting accident not long afterwards so she had been brought up in the earls household mair gave a bland answer about gods mysterious ways tilly clearly was not satisfied but was unable to articulate her misgivings and fell silent the question would come up again caris felt sure mair started them singing the hymn again then stepped over to speak to caris a bright girl caris said the best in the class in a year or two shell be arguing with me fiercely she reminds me of someone caris said frowning im trying to remember her mother mair touched cariss arm lightly gestures of affection were prohibited between nuns but caris was not strict about such things she reminds you of yourself mair said caris laughed i was never that pretty but mair was right even as a child caris had asked sceptical questions later when she became a novice nun she had started an argument at every theology class within a week mother cecilia had been obliged to order her to be silent during lessons then caris had begun breaking the nunnery rules and responding to correction by questioning the rationale behind convent discipline once again she had been enjoined to silence before long mother cecilia had offered her a deal caris could spend most of her time in the hospital a part of the nuns work she did believe in and skip services whenever necessary in exchange caris had to stop flouting discipline and keep her theological ideas to herself caris had agreed reluctantly and sulkily but cecilia was wise and the arrangement had worked it was still working for caris now spent most of her time supervising the hospital she missed more than half the services and rarely said or did anything openly subversive mair smiled youre pretty now she said especially when you laugh caris found herself momentarily spellbound by mairs blue eyes then she heard a child scream she turned away the scream had come not from the group in the cloisters but from the hospital she hurried through the little lobby christopher blacksmith was carrying a girl of about eight into the hospital the child whom caris recognized as his daughter minnie was screaming in pain lay her on a mattress caris said christopher put the child down what happened christopher was a strong man in a panic and he spoke in a strangely highpitched voice she stumbled in my workshop and fell with her arm against a bar of redhot iron do something for her quickly sister shes in such agony caris touched the childs cheek there there minnie well ease the pain very soon poppy seed extract was too strong she thought it might kill such a small child she needed a milder potion nellie go to my pharmacy and fetch the jar marked hemp essence walk quickly but dont run if you should stumble and break the vial it will take hours to make up a new batch nellie hurried away caris studied minnies arm she had a nasty burn but fortunately it was restricted to the arm nothing like as dangerous as the allover burns people got in house fires there were large angry blisters over most of the girls forearm and in the middle the skin was burned away to reveal charred flesh underneath she looked up for help and saw mair go to the kitchen and get me half a pint of wine and the same quantity of olive oil in two separate jugs please both need to be warm but not hot mair left caris spoke to the child minnie you must try to stop screaming i know it hurts but you need to listen to me im getting you some medicine it will ease the pain the screaming abated somewhat and began to turn into sobbing nellie arrived with the hemp essence caris poured some on to a spoon then thrust the spoon into minnies open mouth and held her nose the child swallowed she screamed again but after a minute she began to calm down give me a clean towel caris said to nellie they used a lot of towels in the hospital and the cupboard behind the altar was always full of clean ones by cariss edict mair came back from the kitchen with the oil and wine caris put a towel on the floor beside minnies mattress and moved the burned arm over the towel how do you feel she asked it hurts minnie wailed caris nodded in satisfaction those were the first coherent words the patient had uttered the worst was over minnie began to look sleepy as the hemp took effect caris said im going to put something on your arm to make it better try to keep still will you minnie nodded caris poured a little of the warm wine on to minnies wrist where the burn was least bad the child flinched but did not try to snatch her arm away encouraged caris slowly moved the jug up the arm pouring the wine over the worst of the burn to cleanse it then she did the same with the olive oil which would soothe the place and protect the flesh from bad influences in the air finally she took a fresh towel and wrapped it lightly around the arm to keep the flies off minnie was moaning but half asleep caris looked anxiously at her complexion her face was flushed pink with strain that was good if she had been turning pale it would have been a sign that the dose had been too strong caris was always nervous about drugs the strength varied from batch to batch and she had no precise way of measuring it when weak the medicine was ineffectual when strong dangerous she was especially frightened of overdosing children though the parents always pressured her for powerful medicine because they were so distressed by their childrens pain at that point brother joseph came in he was old now somewhere in his late fifties and all his teeth had fallen out but he was still the priorys best monkphysician christopher blacksmith immediately leaped to his feet oh brother joseph thank god youre here he said my little girl has a terrible burn lets have a look said joseph caris stood back hiding her irritation everyone believed the monks were powerful doctors able to work nearmiracles whereas the nuns just fed the patients and cleared up caris had long ago stopped fighting that attitude but it still annoyed her joseph took off the towel and looked at the patients arm he prodded the burnt flesh with his fingers minnie whimpered in her drugged sleep a bad burn but not fatal he said he turned to caris make up a poultice of three parts chicken fat three parts goat dung and one part white lead and cover the burn with it that will bring forth the pus yes brother caris was doubtful of the value of poultices she had noticed that many injuries healed well without bringing forth the pus that monks thought such a healthy sign in her experience wounds sometimes became corrupt beneath such ointments but the monks disagreed except for brother thomas who was convinced he had lost his arm because of the poultice prescribed by prior anthony almost twenty years ago however this was another battle caris had given up the monks techniques had the authority of hippocrates and galen the ancient writers on medicine and everyone agreed they must be right joseph left caris made sure that minnie was comfortable and her father was reassured when she wakes up she will be thirsty make sure she gets plenty to drink weak ale or watered wine she was in no hurry to make the poultice she would give god a few hours to work unaided before she began josephs treatment the likelihood that the monkphysician would come back later to check on his patient was small she sent nellie out to collect goat dung from the green to the west of the cathedral then she went to her pharmacy it was next to the monks library unfortunately she did not have large windows matching those in the library the room was small and dark however it had a workbench some shelves for her jars and vials and a small fireplace for heating ingredients in a cupboard she kept a small notebook parchment was expensive and a text block of identical sheets would be used only for holy scriptures however she had gathered a stack of oddshaped offcuts and sewn them together she kept a record of every patient with a serious complaint she wrote down the date the patients name the symptoms and the treatment given then later she added the results always noting exactly how many hours or days had passed before the patient got better or worse she often looked back over past cases to refresh her memory on how effective different treatments had been when she wrote down minnies age it occurred to her that her own child would have been eight this year if she had not taken mattie wises potion for no good reason she thought her baby would have been a girl she wondered how she would have reacted if her own daughter had suffered an accident would she have been able to deal so coolly with the emergency or would she have been almost hysterical with fear like christopher blacksmith she had just finished logging the case when the bell rang for evensong and she went to the service afterwards it was time for the nuns supper then they went to bed to get some sleep before they had to rise for matins at three oclock in the morning instead of going to bed caris went back to her pharmacy to make the poultice she did not mind the goats dung anyone who worked in a hospital saw worse things but she wondered how joseph could imagine it was a good thing to put on burned flesh she would not be able to apply it until morning now minnie was a healthy child her recovery would be well advanced by then while she was working mair came in caris looked at her curiously what are you doing out of bed mair stood beside her at the work bench i came to help you it doesnt take two people to make a poultice what did sister natalie say natalie was the subprioress in charge of discipline and no one could leave the dormitory at night without her permission shes fast asleep do you really think youre not pretty did you get out of bed to ask me that merthin must have thought you were caris smiled yes he did do you miss him caris finished mixing the poultice and turned away to wash her hands in a bowl i think about him every day she said he is now the richest architect in florence how do you know i get news of him every fleece fair from buonaventura caroli does merthin get news of you what news theres nothing to tell im a nun do you long for him caris turned back and gave mair a direct look nuns are forbidden to long for men but not for women mair said and she leaned forward and kissed caris on the mouth caris was so surprised that for a second she froze mair held the kiss the touch of a womans lips was soft not like merthins caris was shocked though not horrified it was seven years since anyone had kissed her and she realized suddenly how much she missed it in the silence there was a loud noise from the library next door mair jerked away guiltily what was that it sounded like a box being dropped on the floor who could it be caris frowned there shouldnt be anyone in the library at this time of night monks and nuns are in bed mair looked scared what should we do wed better go and look they left the pharmacy although the library was adjacent they had to walk through the nuns cloisters and into the monks cloisters to reach the library door it was a dark night but they had both lived here for years and they could find their way blindfold when they reached their destination they saw a flickering light in the high windows the door normally locked at night was ajar caris pushed it open for a moment she could not make out what she was looking at she saw a closet door standing open a box on a table a candle next to it and a shadowy figure after a moment she realized that the closet was the treasury where charters and other valuables were kept and the box was the chest containing the jewelled gold and silver ornaments used in the cathedral for special services the shadowy man was taking objects out of the box and putting them in some kind of bag the figure looked up and caris recognized the face it was gilbert of hereford the pilgrim who had arrived earlier today except that he was no pilgrim and he probably was not even from hereford he was a thief they stared at each other for a moment no one moving then mair screamed gilbert put out the candle caris pulled the door shut to delay him a second longer then she dashed along the cloisters and darted into a recess pulling mair with her they were at the foot of the stairs that led to the monks dorm mairs scream would have awakened the men but they might be slow to react tell the monks whats happening caris yelled at mair go on run mair dashed up the stairs caris heard a creak and guessed that the library door was opening she listened for the sound of footsteps on the flagstones of the cloisters but gilbert must have been a practised burglar for he walked silently she held her breath and listened for his then a commotion broke out upstairs the thief must have realized then that he had only a few seconds to escape for he broke into a run and caris heard his tread she did not care greatly for the precious cathedral ornaments believing that gold and jewels probably pleased the bishop and the prior more than they pleased god but she had taken a dislike to gilbert and she hated the idea that he might get rich by robbing the priory so she stepped out of her recess she could hardly see but there was no mistaking the running steps hurtling towards her she held her arms out to protect herself and he cannoned into her she was knocked off balance but grasped his clothing and they both fell to the ground there was a clatter as his sack of crucifixes and chalices hit the paving stones the pain of the fall enraged caris and she let go of his clothes and reached for where she thought his face might be she encountered skin and dragged her fingernails across it digging deep he roared with pain and she felt blood flow under her fingertips but he was stronger he grappled with her and swung himself on top a light appeared from the head of the monks stairs and suddenly she could see gilbert and he could see her kneeling astride her he punched her face first with his right fist then with his left then with the right again she cried out in agony there was more light the monks were stumbling down the stairs caris heard mair scream leave her alone you devil gilbert leaped to his feet and scrabbled for his sack but he was too late suddenly mair was flying at him with some kind of blunt instrument he took a blow to the head turned to retaliate and fell beneath a tidal wave of monks caris got to her feet mair came to her and they hugged mair said what did you do tripped him up then scratched his face what did you hit him with the wooden cross off the dormitory wall well said caris so much for turning the other cheek gilbert hereford was tried before the ecclesiastical court found guilty and sentenced by prior godwyn to an appropriate punishment for those who robbed churches he would be flayed alive his skin would be cut off him while he was fully conscious and he would bleed to death on the day of the flaying godwyn had his weekly meeting with mother cecilia their deputies would also attend subprior philemon and subprioress natalie waiting in the hall of the priors house for the nuns to arrive godwyn said to philemon we must try to persuade them to build a new treasury we can no longer keep our valuables in a box in the library philemon said thoughtfully would it be a shared building it would have to be we cant afford to pay for it godwyn thought regretfully of the ambitions he had once had as a young man to reform the monasterys finances and make it rich again this had not happened and he still did not understand why he had been tough forcing the townspeople to use and pay for the priorys mills fishponds and warrens but they seemed to find ways around his rules like building mills in neighbouring villages he had imposed harsh sentences on men and women caught poaching or illegally cutting down trees in the priorys forests and he had resisted the blandishments of those who would tempt him to spend the priorys money by building mills or waste the priorys timber by licensing charcoal burners and iron smelters he felt sure his approach was right but it had not yet yielded the increased income he felt he deserved so you will ask cecilia for the money philemon said thoughtfully there might be advantages in keeping our wealth in the same place as the nuns godwyn saw which way philemons devious mind was leading him but we wouldnt say that to cecilia of course not all right ill propose it while were waiting yes theres a problem you need to know about in the village of long ham godwyn nodded long ham was one of dozens of villages that paid homage and feudal dues to the priory philemon explained it has to do with the landholding of a widow marylynn when her husband died she agreed to let a neighbour farm her land a man called john nott now the widow has remarried and she wants the land back so that her new husband can farm it godwyn was puzzled this was a typical peasant squabble too trivial to require his intervention what does the bailiff say that the land should revert to the widow since the arrangement was always intended to be temporary then that is what must happen there is a complication sister elizabeth has a halfbrother and two halfsisters in long ham ah godwyn might have guessed there would be a reason for philemons interest sister elizabeth formerly elizabeth clerk was the nuns matricularius in charge of their buildings she was young and bright and would rise farther up the hierarchy she could be a valuable ally they are the only family shes got apart from her mother who works at the bell philemon went on elizabeth is fond of her peasant relatives and they in turn revere her as the holy one of the family when they come to kingsbridge they bring gifts to the nunnery fruit honey eggs that sort of thing and john nott is the halfbrother of sister elizabeth has elizabeth asked you to intervene yes and she also asked that i should not tell mother cecilia of the request godwyn knew that this was just the kind of thing philemon liked he loved to be regarded as a powerful person who could use his influence to favour one side or the other in a dispute such things fed his ego which was never satisfied and he was drawn to anything clandestine the fact that elizabeth did not want her superior to know about this request delighted philemon it meant he knew her shameful secret he would store the information away like misers gold what do you want to do godwyn asked its for you to say of course but i suggest we let john nott keep the land elizabeth would be in our debt and that cannot fail to be useful at some point in the future thats hard on the widow godwyn said uneasily i agree but that must be balanced against the interests of the priory and gods work is more important very well tell the bailiff the widow will receive her reward in the hereafter indeed there had been a time when godwyn had hesitated to authorize philemons underhand schemes but that was long ago philemon had proved too useful as godwyns mother petranilla had forecast all those years ago there was a tap at the door and petranilla herself came in she now lived in a comfortable small house in candle court just off the main street her brother edmund had left her a generous bequest enough to last her the rest of her life she was fiftyeight years old her tall figure was now stooped and frail and she walked with a stick but she still had a mind like a bear trap as always godwyn was glad to see her but also apprehensive that he might have done something to displease her petranilla was the head of the family now anthony had been killed in the bridge collapse and edmund had died seven years ago so she was the last survivor of her generation she never hesitated to tell godwyn what to do she was the same with her niece alice alices husband elfric was the alderman but she gave him orders too her authority even extended to her stepgranddaughter griselda and she terrorized griseldas eightyearold son little merthin her judgement was as sound as ever so they all obeyed her most of the time if for some reason she did not take command they would usually ask her opinion anyway godwyn was not sure how they would manage without her and on the rare occasions when they did not do her bidding they worked very hard to hide the fact only caris stood up to her dont you dare tell me what to do she had said to petranilla more than once you would have let them kill me petranilla sat down and looked around the room this is not good enough she said she was often abrupt but all the same godwyn became edgy when she spoke like this what do you mean you should have a better house i know eight years ago godwyn had tried to persuade mother cecilia to pay for a new palace she had promised to give him the money three years later but when the time came she said she had changed her mind he felt sure it was because of what he had done to caris after that heresy trial his charm had ceased to work on cecilia and it had become difficult to get money out of her petranilla said you need a palace for entertaining bishops and archbishops barons and earls we dont get many of those nowadays earl roland and bishop richard have been in france for much of the last few years king edward had invaded northeast france in and spent all of there then in he had taken his army to northwest france and fought in brittany in english troops had done battle in the southwestern wine district of gascony now edward was back in england but assembling another army of invasion roland and richard arent the only noblemen petranilla said testily the others never come here her voice hardened perhaps thats because you cant accommodate them in the style they expect you need a banqueting hall and a private chapel and spacious bedchambers she had been awake all night thinking about this he guessed that was her way she brooded over things then shot off her ideas like arrows he wondered what had brought on this particular complaint it sounds very extravagant he said playing for time dont you understand she snapped the priory is not as influential as it might be simply because you dont ever see the powerful men of the land when youve got a palace with beautiful rooms for them they will come she was probably right wealthy monasteries such as durham and st albans even complained about the number of noble and royal visitors they were obliged to entertain she went on yesterday was the anniversary of my fathers death so thats what brought this on godwyn thought shes been remembering grandfathers glorious career youve been prior here for almost nine years she said i dont want you to get stuck the archbishops and the king should be considering you for a bishopric a major abbey such as durham or a mission to the pope godwyn had always assumed that kingsbridge would be his springboard to higher things but he realized now he had let his ambition wane it seemed only a little while ago that he had won the election for prior he felt he had only just got on top of the job but she was right it was more than eight years why arent they thinking of you for more important posts she asked rhetorically because they dont know you exist you are prior of a great monastery but you havent told anyone about it display your magnificence build a palace invite the archbishop of canterbury to be your first guest dedicate the chapel to his favourite saint tell the king you have built a royal bedchamber in the hope that he will visit wait a moment one thing at a time godwyn protested id love to build a palace but i havent got the money then get it she said he wanted to ask her how but at that moment the two leaders of the nunnery came into the room petranilla and cecilia greeted one another with wary courtesy then petranilla took her leave mother cecilia and sister natalie sat down cecilia was fiftyone now with grey in her hair and poor eyesight she still darted about the place like a busy bird poking her beak into every room chirping her instructions to nuns novices and servants but she had mellowed with the years and would go a long way to avoid a conflict cecilia was carrying a scroll the nunnery has received a legacy she said as she made herself comfortable from a pious woman of thornbury godwyn said how much one hundred and fifty pounds in gold coins godwyn was startled it was a huge sum it was enough to build a modest palace the nunnery has received it or the priory the nunnery she said firmly this scroll is our copy of her will why did she leave you so much money apparently we nursed her when she fell ill on her way home from london natalie spoke she was a few years older than cecilia a roundfaced woman with a mild disposition our problem is where are we going to keep the money godwyn looked at philemon natalie had given them an opening for the topic they had planned to raise what do you do with your money at present he asked her its in the prioresss bedroom which can be reached only by going through the dormitory as though thinking of it for the first time godwyn said perhaps we should spend a little of the bequest on a new treasury i think thats necessary said cecilia a simple stone building with no windows and a stout oak door it wont take long to construct godwyn said and shouldnt cost more than five or ten pounds for safety we think it should be part of the cathedral ah that was why the nuns had to discuss the plan with godwyn they would not have needed to consult him about building within their own area of the priory but the church was common to monks and nuns he said it could go up against the cathedral wall in the corner formed by the north transept and the choir but be entered from inside the church yes thats just the kind of thing i had in mind ill speak to elfric today if you like and ask him to give us an estimate please do godwyn was happy to have extracted from cecilia a fraction of her windfall but he was not satisfied after the conversation with his mother he yearned to get his hands on more of it he would have liked to grab it all but how the cathedral bell tolled and the four of them stood up and went out the condemned man was outside the west end of the church he was naked and tied tightly by his hands and feet to an upright wooden rectangle like a door frame a hundred or so townspeople stood waiting to watch the execution the ordinary monks and nuns had not been invited it was considered improper for them to see bloodshed the executioner was will tanner a man of about fifty whose skin was brown from his trade he wore a clean canvas apron he stood by a small table on which he had laid out his knives he was sharpening one of them on a stone and the scrape of steel on granite made godwyn shudder godwyn said several prayers ending with an extempore plea in english that the death of the thief would serve god by deterring others from the same sin then he nodded to will tanner will stood behind the tethered thief he took a small knife with a sharp point and inserted it into the middle of gilberts neck then drew it downwards in a long straight line to the base of the spine gilbert roared with pain and blood welled out of the cut will made another slash across the mans shoulders forming the shape of the letter t will then changed his knife selecting one with a long thin blade he inserted it carefully at the point where the two cuts met and pulled away a corner of skin gilbert cried out again then holding the corner in the fingers of his left hand will began carefully to cut the skin of gilberts back away from his body gilbert began to scream sister natalie made a noise in her throat turned away and ran back into the priory cecilia closed her eyes and began to pray godwyn felt nauseated someone in the crowd fell to the ground in a dead faint only philemon seemed unmoved will worked quickly his sharp knife slicing through the subcutaneous fat to reveal the woven muscles below blood flowed copiously and he stopped every few seconds to wipe his hands on his apron gilbert screamed in undiminished agony at every cut soon the skin of his back hung in two broad flaps will knelt on the ground his knees an inch deep in blood and began to work on the legs the screaming stopped suddenly gilbert appeared to have passed out godwyn was relieved he had intended the man to suffer agony for trying to rob a church and he had wanted others to witness the thiefs torment but all the same he had found it hard to listen to that screaming will continued his work phlegmatically apparently unconcerned whether his victim was conscious or not until all the back skin body arms and legs was detached then he went around to the front he cut around the ankles and wrists then detached the skin so that it hung from the victims shoulders and hips he worked upwards from the pelvis and godwyn realized he was going to try to take the entire skin off in one piece soon there was no skin left attached except for the head gilbert was still breathing will made a careful series of cuts around the skull then he put down his knives and wiped his hands one more time finally he grasped gilberts skin at the shoulders and gave a sudden jerk upwards the face and scalp were ripped off the head yet remained attached to the rest of the skin will held gilberts bloody hide up in the air like a hunting trophy and the crowd cheered caris was uneasy about sharing the new treasury with the monks she pestered beth with so many questions about the safety of their money that in the end beth took her to inspect the place godwyn and philemon were in the cathedral at the time as if by chance and they saw the nuns and followed them they passed through a new arch in the south wall of the choir into a little lobby and halted in front of a formidable studded door sister beth took out a big iron key she was a humble unassuming woman like most nuns this is ours she said to caris we can enter the treasury any time we like i should think so since we paid for it said caris crisply they entered a small square room it contained a counting table with a stack of parchment rolls a couple of stools and a big ironbound chest the chest is too big to be taken out through the door beth pointed out caris said so how did you it get in here godwyn answered in pieces it was put together by the carpenter here in the room caris gave godwyn a cold look this man had tried to kill her ever since the witchcraft trial she had looked at him with loathing and avoided speaking to him if at all possible now she said flatly the nuns will need a key to the chest not necessary godwyn said quickly it contains the jewelled cathedral ornaments which are in the care of the sacrist who is always a monk caris said show me she could see that he was offended by her tone and had half a mind to refuse her but he wanted to appear open and guileless so he conceded he took a key from the wallet at his belt and opened the chest as well as the cathedral ornaments it contained dozens of scrolls the priorys charters not just the ornaments then caris said her suspicions vindicated the records too including the nuns charters she persisted yes in which case we will have a key my idea is that we copy all our charters and keep the copies in the library whenever we need to read a charter we consult the library copy so that the precious originals can remain under lock and key beth hated conflict and intervened nervously that sounds like quite a sensible idea sister caris caris said grudgingly so long as the nuns always have access to their documents in some form the charters were a secondary issue addressing beth rather than godwyn she said more importantly where do we keep the money beth said in hidden vaults in the floor there are four of them two for the monks and two for the nuns if you look carefully you can see the loose stones caris studied the floor and after a moment said i wouldnt have noticed if you hadnt told me but i can see them now can they be locked i suppose they could said godwyn but then it would be obvious where they were which would defeat the purpose of hiding them under flagstones but this way the monks and nuns have access to one anothers money philemon spoke up he looked accusingly at caris and said why are you here youre the guest master nothing to do with the treasury cariss attitude to philemon was simple loathing she felt he was not fully human he seemed to have no sense of right and wrong no principles or scruples whereas she despised godwyn as a wicked man who knew when he was doing evil she felt that philemon was more like a vicious animal a mad dog or a wild boar i have an eye for detail she told him youre very mistrustful he said resentfully caris gave a humourless laugh coming from you philemon thats ironic he pretended to be hurt i dont know what you can mean beth spoke again trying to keep the peace i just wanted caris to come and look because she asks questions i dont think of caris said for example how can we be sure that the monks dont take the nuns money ill show you said beth hanging on a hook on the wall was a stout length of oak using it as a lever she prised up a flagstone underneath was a hollow space containing an ironbound chest weve had a locked casket made to fit each of these vaults she said she reached inside and lifted out the chest caris examined it it seemed strongly made the lid was hinged and the clasp was secured by a barrel padlock made of iron where did we get the lock she asked christopher blacksmith made it that was good christopher was a wellestablished kingsbridge citizen who would not risk his reputation by selling duplicate keys to thieves caris was not able to fault the arrangements perhaps she had worried unnecessarily she turned to go elfric appeared accompanied by an apprentice with a sack is it all right to put up the warning elfric said philemon replied yes please go ahead elfrics assistant took from his sack something that looked like a big piece of leather beth said whats that wait said philemon youll see the apprentice held the object up against the door ive been waiting for it to dry out philemon said its gilbert herefords skin beth gave a cry of horror caris said thats disgusting the skin was turning yellow and the hair was falling out of the scalp but you could still make out the face the ears two holes for the eyes and a gash of a mouth that seemed to grin that should scare thieves away philemon said with satisfaction elfric took out a hammer and began to nail the hide to the treasury door the two nuns left godwyn and philemon waited for elfric to finish his gruesome task then they went back inside the treasury godwyn said i think were safe philemon nodded caris is a suspicious woman but all her questions were answered satisfactorily in which case philemon closed the door and locked it then he lifted the stone slab over one of the nuns two vaults and took out the chest sister beth keeps a small amount of cash for everyday needs somewhere in the nuns quarters he explained to godwyn she comes in here only to deposit or withdraw larger sums she always goes to the other vault which contains mostly silver pennies she almost never opens this chest which contains the bequest he turned the box around and looked at the hinge at the back it was fixed to the wood by four nails he took from his pocket a thin steel chisel and a pair of pliers for gripping godwyn wondered where he had got the tools but did not ask sometimes it was best not to know too many details philemon slipped the sharp blade of the chisel under the edge of the iron hinge and pushed the hinge came away from the wood slightly and he pushed the blade in a little farther he worked delicately and patiently careful to make sure that the damage would not be visible to a casual glance gradually the flat plate of the hinge became detached the nails coming out with it when he had made enough room for the pliers to grip the nailheads he pulled them out then he was able to detach the hinge and lift the lid heres the money from the pious woman of thornbury he said godwyn looked into the chest the money was in venetian ducats these gold coins showed the doge of venice kneeling before st mark on one side and on the other the virgin mary surrounded by stars to indicate that she was in heaven ducats were intended to be interchangeable with florins from florence and were the same size weight and purity of metal they were worth three shillings or thirtysix english silver pennies england had its own gold coins now an innovation of king edwards nobles halfnobles and quarternobles but these had been in circulation less than two years and had not yet displaced foreign gold coins godwyn took fifty ducats worth seven pounds and ten shillings philemon closed the lid of the chest he wrapped each of the nails in a thin strip of leather to make them a tight fit and reattached the hinge he put the chest back in the vault and lowered the slab over the hole of course they will notice the loss sooner or later he said it may not be for years godwyn said well cross that bridge when we come to it they went out and godwyn locked the door godwyn said find elfric and meet me in the cemetery philemon left godwyn went to the eastern end of the graveyard just beyond the existing priors house it was a blowy may day and the fresh wind made his robe flap around his legs a loose goat was grazing among the tombstones godwyn watched it meditatively he was risking a terrible row with the nuns he knew he did not think they would discover their loss for a year or more but he could not be sure when they did find out there would be hell to pay but what exactly could they do he was not like gilbert hereford stealing money for himself he had taken the bequest of a pious woman to use for holy purposes he thrust his worries aside his mother was right he needed to glorify his role as prior of kingsbridge if he was going to make further progress when philemon returned with elfric godwyn said i want to build the priors palace here well to the east of the present building elfric nodded a very good location if i may say so lord prior close to the chapter house and the east end of the cathedral but separated from the market place by the graveyard so youll have privacy and quiet i want a big dining hall downstairs for banquets godwyn went on about a hundred feet long it must be a really prestigious impressive room for entertaining the nobility perhaps even royalty very good and a chapel at the east end of the ground floor but youll be just a few steps from the cathedral noble guests dont always want to expose themselves to the people they must be able to worship in private if they wish and upstairs the priors own chamber of course with room for an altar and a writing desk and three large chambers for guests splendid how much will it cost more than a hundred pounds perhaps two hundred ill make a drawing then give you a more accurate estimate dont let it go above a hundred and fifty pounds thats all i can afford if elfric wondered where godwyn had suddenly acquired a hundred and fifty pounds he did not ask id better start stockpiling the stone as soon as possible he said can you give me some money to begin with how much would you like five pounds ten would be better ill give you seven pounds ten shillings in ducats godwyn said and handed over the fifty gold coins he had taken from the nuns reserves three days later as the monks and nuns were filing out of the cathedral after the dinnertime service of nones sister elizabeth spoke to godwyn nuns and monks were not supposed to talk to one another casually so she had to contrive a pretext as it happened there was a dog in the nave and it had barked during the service dogs were always getting into the church and making a minor nuisance of themselves but they were generally ignored however on this occasion elizabeth left the procession to shoo the dog out she was obliged to cross the line of monks and timed her move so that she walked in front of godwyn she smiled apologetically at him and said i beg your pardon father prior then she lowered her voice and said meet me in the library as if by accident she chased the dog out of the west door intrigued godwyn made his way to the library and sat down to read the rule of st benedict shortly afterwards elizabeth appeared and took out the gospel of st matthew the nuns had built their own library after godwyn took over as prior in order to improve the separation between males and females but when they removed all their books from the monks library the place had been denuded and godwyn had reversed his decision the nuns library building was now used as a schoolroom in cold weather elizabeth sat with her back to godwyn so that anyone coming in would not get the impression that they were conspiring but she was close enough for him to hear her clearly something i felt i should tell you she said sister caris doesnt like the nuns money being kept in the new treasury i knew that already godwyn said she has persuaded sister beth to count the money to make sure its all still there i thought you might like to know that just in case you have borrowed from them godwyns heart missed a beat an audit would find the reserves short by fifty ducats and he was going to need the rest to build his palace he had not been expecting this so soon he cursed caris how had she guessed what he had done so secretly when he said and there was a catch in his voice today i dont know at what hour it could be any time but caris was most emphatic that you should have no advance warning he was going to have to put the ducats back and fast thank you very much he said i appreciate your telling me this its because you showed favour to my family in long ham she said and she got up and went out godwyn hurried after her what luck that elizabeth felt indebted to him philemons instinct for intrigue was invaluable as that thought crossed his mind he saw philemon in the cloisters get those tools and meet me in the treasury he whispered then he left the priory he hurried across the green and into the main street elfrics wife alice had inherited the house of edmund wooler one of the largest homes in town along with all the money caris had made dyeing cloth elfric now lived in great luxury godwyn knocked on the door and entered the hall alice was sitting at the table amid the remains of dinner with her was her stepdaughter griselda and griseldas son little merthin no one now believed that merthin fitzgerald was the little boys father he looked just like griseldas runaway boyfriend thurstan griselda had married one of her fathers employees harold mason polite people called the eightyearold merthin haroldson and the others called him merthin bastard alice leaped up from her seat when she saw godwyn well cousin prior what a pleasure to have you in our house will you take a little wine godwyn ignored her polite hospitality wheres elfric hes upstairs taking a short nap before he goes back to work sit in the parlour and ill fetch him right away if you please godwyn stepped into the next room there were two comfortablelooking chairs but he paced up and down elfric came in rubbing his eyes sorry about this he said i was just those fifty ducats i gave you three days ago godwyn said i need them back elfric was startled but the money was for stone i know what it was for i have to have it right now ive spent some of it paying carters to bring the stones from the quarry how much about half well you can make that up out of your own funds cant you dont you want a palace any more of course i do but i must have that money dont ask why just give it to me what am i to do with the stones ive bought just keep them youll get the money again i just need it for a few days hurry all right wait here if you will im not going anywhere elfric went out godwyn wondered where he kept his money in the hearth under the firestone was the usual place being a builder elfric might have a more cunning hideyhole wherever it was he was back in a few moments he counted fifty gold coins into godwyns hand godwyn said i gave you ducats some of these are florins the florin was the same size but stamped with different images john the baptist on one side and a flower on the other i dont have the same coins i told you ive spent some of them theyre all worth the same arent they they were would the nuns notice the difference godwyn thrust the money into the wallet at his belt and left without another word he hurried back to the cathedral and found philemon in the treasury the nuns are going to carry out an audit he explained breathlessly ive got the money back from elfric open that chest quickly philemon opened the vault in the floor took out the chest and removed the nails he lifted the lid godwyn sifted through the coins they were all ducats it could not be helped he dug down into the money and pushed his florins to the bottom close it up and put it back he said philemon did so godwyn felt a moment of relief his crime was partly concealed at least now it would not be glaringly obvious i want to be here when she counts it he said to philemon im worried about whether shell notice that shes now got some florins mixed in with her ducats do you know when they intend to come no ill put a novice to sweeping the choir when beth shows up he can come and fetch us philemon had a little coterie of admiring novice monks eager to do his bidding however the novice was not needed as they were about to leave the treasury sister beth and sister caris arrived godwyn pretended to be in the middle of a conversation about accounts well have to look in an earlier account roll brother he said to philemon oh good day sisters caris opened both nuns vaults and took out the two chests something i can help you with godwyn said caris ignored him beth said were just checking something thank you father prior we wont be long go ahead go ahead he said benevolently though his heart was hammering in his chest caris said irritably theres no need to apologize for our being here sister beth its our treasury and our money godwyn opened an account roll at random and he and philemon pretended to study it beth and caris counted the silver in the first chest farthings halfpennies pennies and a few luxembourgs forged pennies crudely made of adulterated silver and used as small change there were a few assorted gold coins too florins ducats and similar coins the genovino from genoa and the reale from naples plus some larger french moutons and new english nobles beth checked the totals against a small notebook when they had finished she said exactly right they replaced all the coins in the chest locked it and put it back in its underfloor vault they began counting the gold coins in the other chest putting them in piles of ten when they got towards the bottom of the chest beth frowned and made a puzzled sound what is it caris said godwyn felt a guilty dread beth said this chest contains only the bequest from the pious woman of thornbury i kept it separate and her husband traded with venice i was sure the entire amount was in ducats but there are some florins here too godwyn and philemon froze listening thats odd caris said perhaps i made a mistake its a bit suspicious not really beth said thieves dont put money into your treasury do they youre right they dont caris said reluctantly they finished counting they had one hundred stacks of ten coins worth a hundred and fifty pounds thats the exact figure in my book beth said so every pound and penny is correct caris said beth said i told you so caris spent many hours thinking about sister mair she had been startled by the kiss but more surprised at her own reaction to it she had found it exciting until now she had not felt attracted to mair or any other woman in fact there was only one person who had ever made her yearn to be touched and kissed and penetrated and that was merthin in the nunnery she had learned to live without physical contact the only hand that touched her sexually was her own in the darkness of the dormitory when she remembered the days of her courtship and buried her face in the pillow so that the other nuns would not hear her panting she did not feel for mair the same happy lust that merthin inspired in her but merthin was a thousand miles away and seven years in the past and she was fond of mair it was something to do with her angelic face something about her blue eyes some response to her gentleness in the hospital and the school mair always spoke sweetly to caris and when no one was looking touched her arm or her shoulder and once her cheek caris did not rebuff her but she held back from responding it was not that she thought it would be a sin she felt sure god was much too wise to make a rule against women harmlessly pleasuring themselves or each other but she was afraid of disappointing mair instinct told her that mairs feelings were strong and definite whereas her own were uncertain shes in love with me caris thought but im not in love with her if i kiss her again she may hope that the two of us will be soul mates for life and i cant promise her that so she did nothing until fleece fair week the kingsbridge fair had recovered from the slump of the trade in raw wool was still suffering from interference by the king and the italians came only every second year but the new business of weaving and dyeing compensated the town was still not as prosperous as it might have been for prior godwyns prohibition of private mills had driven the industry out of the city and into the surrounding villages but most of the cloth was sold in the market indeed it had become known as kingsbridge scarlet merthins bridge had been finished by elfric and people poured across the wide double span with their packhorses and wagons so on the saturday night before the official opening of the fair the hospital was full to bursting with visitors and one of them was ill his name was maldwyn cook and his trade was to make salty little savouries with flour and scraps of meat or fish cook them quickly in butter over a fire and sell them six for a farthing soon after he arrived he was afflicted with a sudden savage belly ache followed by vomiting and diarrhoea there was nothing caris could do for him other than give him a bed near the door she had long wanted to give the hospital its own latrine so that she could supervise its cleanliness but that was only one of the improvements she hoped for she needed a new pharmacy adjacent to the hospital a spacious welllit room where she could prepare medicines and make her notes and she was trying to figure out a way to give patients more privacy at present everyone in the room could see a woman giving birth a man having a fit a child vomiting people in distress should have small rooms of their own she felt like the side chapels in a large church but she was not sure how to achieve this the hospital was not big enough she had had several discussions with jeremiah builder who had been merthins apprentice jimmie many years ago but he had not come up with a satisfactory solution next morning three more people had the same symptoms as maldwyn cook caris fed the visitors breakfast and tipped them out into the market only the sick were allowed to stay behind the floor of the hospital was filthier than usual and she had it swept and swabbed then she went to the service in the cathedral bishop richard was not present he was with the king preparing to invade france again he had always regarded his bishopric mainly as a means of supporting his aristocratic lifestyle in his absence the diocese was run by archdeacon lloyd who collected the bishops tithes and rents baptized children and conducted services with dogged but unimaginative efficiency a trait he illustrated by giving a tedious sermon on why god was more important than money an odd note on which to open one of englands great commercial fairs nevertheless everyone was in high spirits as was usual on the first day the fleece fair was the high point of the year for the townspeople and the peasants of the surrounding villages people made money at the fair and lost it gambling in the inns strapping village girls allowed themselves to be seduced by slick city boys prosperous peasants paid the towns prostitutes for services they dared not ask their wives to perform there was usually a murder often several caris spotted the heavyset richly dressed figure of buonaventura caroli in the congregation and her heart faltered he might have news of merthin she went through the service distractedly mumbling the psalms on the way out she managed to catch buonaventuras eye he smiled at her she tried to indicate with an inclination of her head that she wanted him to meet her afterwards she was not sure whether he got the message however she went to the hospital the only place in the priory where a nun could meet a man from outside and buonaventura came in not long afterwards he wore a costly blue coat and pointed shoes he said last time i saw you you had just been consecrated a nun by bishop richard im guest master now she said congratulations i never expected you to take so well to convent life buonaventura had known her since she was a little girl nor did i she laughed the priory seems to be doing well what makes you say that i see that godwyn is building a new palace yes he must be prospering i suppose he is how about you is trade good we have some problems the war between england and france has disrupted transport and your king edwards taxes make english wool more expensive than the spanish but its also better quality they always complained about taxes caris came to the subject that really interested her any news of merthin as a matter of fact there is buonaventura said and although his manner was as urbane as ever she detected a hesitation merthin is married caris felt as if she had been punched she had never expected this never even thought of it how could merthin do this he was they were there was no reason at all why he should not get married of course she had rejected him more than once and on the last occasion she had made her rejection final by entering the nunnery it was only remarkable that he had waited so long she had no right to feel hurt she forced a smile how splendid she said please send him my congratulations who is the girl buonaventura pretended not to notice her distress her name is silvia he said as casually as if he were passing on harmless gossip shes the younger daughter of one of the citys most prominent citizens alessandro christi a trader in oriental spices who owns several ships how old he grinned alessandro he must be about my age dont tease me she was grateful to buonaventura for lightening the tone how old is silvia twentythree six years younger than me a beautiful girl she sensed the unspoken qualification but he tilted his head to one side apologetically she has the reputation of being sharptongued of course people say all sorts of things but perhaps that is why she remained single so long girls in florence generally marry before the age of eighteen im sure its true caris said the only girls merthin liked in kingsbridge were me and elizabeth clerk and were both shrews buonaventura laughed not so not so when was the wedding two years ago not long after i last saw you caris realized that merthin had remained single until she had been consecrated as a nun he would have heard via buonaventura that she had taken the final step she thought of him waiting and hoping for more than four years in a foreign country and her brittle façade of good cheer began to crack buonaventura said and they have a child a little baby girl called lolla that was too much all the grief caris had felt seven years ago the pain she thought had gone for ever came back in a rush she had not truly lost him back then in she realized he had remained loyal to her memory for years but she had lost him now finally eternally she was shaken as if by a fit and she knew she could not hold out much longer trembling she said its such a pleasure to see you and catch up with the news but i must get back to my work his face showed concern i hope i havent upset you too much i thought you would prefer to know dont be kind to me i cant stand it she turned from him and hurried away she bent her head to hide her face as she walked from the hospital into the cloisters searching for somewhere to be alone she ran up the stairs to the dormitory there was no one there in the daytime she began to sob as she walked the length of the bare room at the far end was mother cecilias bedroom no one was allowed in there without an invitation but caris went in anyway slamming the door behind her she fell on cecilias bed not caring that her nuns cap had fallen off she buried her face in the straw mattress and wept after a while she felt a hand on her head stroking her shortcropped hair she had not heard the person enter the room she did not care who it was all the same she was slowly gradually soothed her sobs became less wrenching her tears dried and the storm of her emotions began to die down she rolled over and looked up at her comforter it was mair caris said merthin is married he has a baby girl she began to cry again mair lay down on the bed and cradled cariss head in her arms caris pressed her face into mairs soft breasts letting the woollen robe soak up the tears there there said mair after a while caris calmed down she was too drained to feel any more sorrow she thought of merthin holding a darkhaired little italian baby and saw how happy he would be she was glad that he was happy and she drifted into an exhausted sleep the illness that had started with maldwyn cook spread like a summer fire through the crowds at the fleece fair on monday it leaped from the hospital to the taverns then on tuesday from the visitors to the townspeople caris noted its characteristics in her book it began with stomach pains led quickly to vomiting and diarrhoea and lasted between twentyfour and fortyeight hours it left adults not much the worse but killed old people and small babies on wednesday it struck the nuns and the children in the girls school both mair and tilly were affected caris sought out buonaventura at the bell and worriedly asked him whether italian doctors had any treatment for such diseases theres no cure he said none that works anyway though doctors nearly always prescribe something just to get more money out of people but some arab physicians believe you can retard the spread of such illnesses oh really caris was interested traders said that muslim doctors were superior to their christian counterparts although the priestphysicians denied this hotly how they believe the disease is acquired when a sick person looks at you sight functions by beams that issue from the eyes and touch the things we see rather like extending a finger to feel whether something is warm or dry or hard but the beams may also project sickness therefore you can avoid the disease by never being in the same room as a sufferer caris did not think illness could be transmitted by looks if that were true then after an important service in the cathedral everyone in the congregation would acquire any illness the bishop had whenever the king was ill he would infect all the hundreds of people who saw him and surely someone would have noticed that however the notion that you should not share a room with someone who was ill did seem convincing here in the hospital maldwyns illness seemed to spread from a sufferer to those nearby the sick mans wife and family were the first to catch it followed by people in neighbouring beds she had also observed that certain kinds of illness stomach upsets coughs and colds and poxes of all sorts seemed to flare up during fairs and markets so it seemed obvious that they were passed from one person to another by some means on wednesday night at supper half the guests in the hospital were suffering from the illness then by thursday morning every one of them had it several priory servants also succumbed so caris was short of people to clean up surveying the chaos at breakfast time mother cecilia suggested closing the hospital caris was ready to consider anything she felt dismayed at her own powerlessness to combat the disease and devastated by the filth of her hospital but where would the people sleep she said send them to the taverns the taverns have the same problem we could put them in the cathedral cecilia shook her head godwyn wont have peasants puking in the nave while services go on in the choir wherever they sleep we ought to separate the sick from the well thats the way to retard the spread of the illness according to buonaventura it makes sense caris was struck by a new idea something that suddenly seemed very obvious though she had not thought of it before perhaps we shouldnt just improve the hospital she said maybe we should build a new one just for sick people and keep the old one for pilgrims and other healthy visitors cecilia looked thoughtful it would be costly weve got a hundred and fifty pounds cariss imagination began to work it could incorporate a new pharmacy we could have private rooms for people who are chronically ill find out what it would cost you could ask elfric caris hated elfric she had disliked him even before he had given evidence against her she did not want him to build her new hospital elfric is busy building godwyns new palace she said id rather consult jeremiah by all means caris felt a rush of affection for cecilia although she was a martinet tough on discipline she gave her deputies room to make their own decisions she had always understood the conflicting passions that drove caris instead of trying to suppress those passions cecilia had found ways to make use of them she had given caris work that engaged her and provided outlets for her rebellious energy here i am caris thought plainly incapable of dealing with the crisis in front of me and my superior is calmly telling me to forge ahead with a new longterm project thank you mother cecilia she said later that day she walked around the priory grounds with jeremiah and explained her aspirations he was as superstitious as ever seeing the work of saints and devils in the most trivial of everyday incidents nevertheless he was an imaginative builder open to new ideas he had learned from merthin they quickly settled on the best location for the new hospital immediately to the south of the existing kitchen block it would be apart from the rest of the buildings so that sick people would have less contact with the healthy but food would not have to be carried far and the new building could still be accessed conveniently from the nuns cloisters with the pharmacy the new latrines and an upper floor with private rooms jeremiah thought it would cost about a hundred pounds most of the legacy caris discussed the site with mother cecilia it was land that belonged neither to the monks nor the nuns so they went to see godwyn about it they found him on the site of his own building project the new palace the shell was up and the roof was on caris had not visited the site for some weeks and she was surprised at its size it was going to be as big as her new hospital she saw why buonaventura had called it impressive the dining hall was larger than the nuns refectory the site was swarming with workmen as if godwyn was in a hurry to get it finished masons were laying a floor of coloured tiles in a geometric pattern several carpenters were making doors and a master glazier had set up a furnace to make the windows godwyn was spending a lot of money he and philemon were showing the new building to archdeacon lloyd the bishops deputy godwyn broke off as the nuns approached cecilia said dont let us interrupt you but when youre finished will you meet me outside the hospital theres something i need to show you by all means said godwyn caris and cecilia walked back through the market place in front of the cathedral friday was bargain day at the fleece fair when traders sold their remaining stocks at reduced prices so that they would not have to carry the goods home caris saw mark webber roundfaced and roundbellied now wearing a coat of his own bright scarlet his four children were helping at his stall caris was especially fond of dora now fifteen who had her mothers bustling confidence in a slimmer body youre looking prosperous caris said to mark with a smile the wealth should have come to you he replied you invented the dye i just did what you said i almost feel as if i cheated you youve been rewarded for hard work she said she did not mind that mark and madge had done so well out of her invention although she had always enjoyed the challenge of doing business she had never lusted for money perhaps because she had always taken it for granted growing up in her fathers wealthy household whatever the reason she felt no pang of regret that the webbers were making a fortune that might have been hers the cashless life of the priory seemed to suit her well and she was thrilled to see the webber children healthy and well dressed she remembered when all six of them had to find sleeping space on the floor of a single room most of which was taken up by a loom she and cecilia went to the south end of the priory grounds the land around the stables looked like a farmyard there were a few small buildings a dovecote a henhouse and a tool shed chickens scratched in the dirt and pigs rooted in the kitchen garbage caris itched to tidy it up godwyn and philemon joined them soon with lloyd tagging along cecilia indicated the patch of land next to the kitchens and said im going to build a new hospital and i want to put it there what do you think a new hospital godwyn said why caris thought he looked anxious which puzzled her cecilia said we want a hospital for the sick and a separate guest house for healthy visitors what an extraordinary idea its because of the stomach illness that started with maldwyn cook this is a particularly virulent example but diseases often flare up at markets and part of the reason they spread so fast may be that we have the sick and the well eating and sleeping and going to the latrine together godwyn took umbrage oho he said so the nuns are the physicians now are they caris frowned this kind of sneering was not godwyns style he used charm to get his way especially with powerful people such as cecilia this fit of pique was covering something else of course not cecilia said but we all know that some illnesses spread from one sufferer to the next thats obvious caris put in the muslim physicians believe illness is transmitted by looking at the sick person oh do they how interesting godwyn spoke with ponderous sarcasm those of us who have spent seven years studying medicine at the university are always glad to be lectured on illness by young nuns barely out of their novitiate caris was not intimidated she felt no inclination to show respect to a lying hypocrite who had tried to murder her she said if you dont believe in the transmission of illness why dont you prove your sincerity by coming to the hospital tonight and sleeping alongside a hundred people suffering from nausea and diarrhoea cecilia said sister caris that will be enough she turned to godwyn forgive her father prior it wasnt my intention to engage you in a discussion about disease with a mere nun i just want to make sure you dont object to my choice of site you cant build it now anyway godwyn said elfric is too busy with the palace caris said we dont want elfric were using jeremiah cecilia turned on her caris be quiet remember your place dont interrupt my conversation with the lord prior again caris realized she was not helping cecilia and against her inclination she lowered her head and said im sorry mother prioress cecilia said to godwyn the question is not when we build its where im afraid i dont approve of this he said stiffly where would you prefer the new building to be sited i dont think you need a new hospital at all forgive me but i am in charge of the nunnery cecilia said with asperity you cant tell me how i should spend our money however we normally consult one another before putting up new buildings although it has to be said that you forgot this little courtesy when planning your palace nevertheless i am consulting you merely on the question of the location of the building she looked at lloyd im sure the archdeacon will agree with me on this there must be agreement lloyd said noncommittally caris frowned baffled why did godwyn care he was building his palace on the north side of the cathedral it made no difference to him if the nuns put up a new building down here in the south where most monks hardly ever came what was he worried about godwyn said im telling you that i do not approve of the location nor of the building so that is the end of the matter caris suddenly saw in a flash of inspiration the reason for godwyns behaviour she was so shocked that she blurted it out you stole our money cecilia said caris i told you hes stolen the legacy of the woman of thornbury caris said overriding cecilia in her outrage thats where he got the money for his palace of course and now hes trying to stop us building because he knows well go to the treasury and find that our money has vanished she felt so indignant she might burst godwyn said dont be preposterous as a response it was so muted that caris knew she must have touched a nerve confirmation made her even angrier prove it she yelled she forced herself to speak more calmly well go to the treasury now and check the vaults you wouldnt object to that would you father prior philemon chipped in it would be a completely undignified proceeding and there is no question of the prior submitting himself to it caris ignored him there should be one hundred and fifty pounds in gold in the nuns reserves out of the question said godwyn caris said well clearly the nuns will have to check the vaults anyway now that the accusation has been made she looked at cecilia who nodded in agreement so if the prior prefers not to be present no doubt the archdeacon will be happy to attend as a witness lloyd looked as if he would have preferred not to get involved in this dispute but it was hard for him to refuse to play the role of umpire so he muttered if i can help both sides of course cariss mind was racing on how did you open the chest she said christopher blacksmith made the lock and hes too honest to give you a duplicate key and help you steal from us you must have broken the box open then repaired it somehow what did you do take off the binge she saw godwyn glance involuntarily at his subprior ah caris said triumphantly so philemon took the hinge off but the prior took the money and gave it to elfric cecilia said enough speculation lets settle the matter well all go to the treasury and open the box and that will be an end to it godwyn said it wasnt stealing everyone stared at him there was a shocked silence cecilia said youre admitting it it wasnt stealing godwyn repeated the money is being used for the benefit of the priory and the glory of god caris said it makes no difference it wasnt your money its gods money godwyn said stubbornly cecilia said it was left to the nunnery you know that you saw the will i know nothing of any will of course you do i gave it to you to make a copy cecilia tailed off godwyn said again i know nothing of any will caris said hes destroyed it he said he would make a copy and put the original in the chest in the treasury but he destroyed it cecilia was staring openmouthed at godwyn i should have known she said after what you tried to do to caris i should never have trusted you again but i thought your soul might yet have been saved i was so wrong caris said its a good thing we made our own copy of the will before handing it over she was inventing this in desperation godwyn said a forgery obviously caris said if the money was yours in the first place you will have had no need to break open the casket to get it so lets go and look that will settle it one way or another philemon said the fact that the hinge has been tampered with proves nothing so i was right said caris but how do you know about the hinge sister beth has not opened the vault since the audit and the box was fine then you must have removed it from the vault yourself if you know that it has been interfered with philemon looked bewildered and had no answer cecilia turned to lloyd archdeacon you are the bishops representative i think its your duty to order the prior to return this money to the nuns lloyd looked worried he said to godwyn have you got any of the money left caris said furiously when youve caught a thief you dont ask him whether he can afford to relinquish his illgotten gains godwyn said more than half has already been spent on the palace building must stop immediately caris said the men must be dismissed today the building torn down and the materials sold you have to return every penny what you cant pay in cash after the palace has been demolished you must make up in land or other assets i refuse godwyn said cecilia addressed lloyd again archdeacon please do your duty you cannot allow one of the bishops subordinates to steal from another no matter that they both do gods work lloyd said i cant adjudicate a dispute such as this myself its too serious caris was speechless with fury and dismay at lloyds weakness cecilia protested but you must he looked trapped but he shook his head stubbornly accusations of theft destruction of a will a charge of forgery this must go to the bishop himself cecilia said but bishop richard is on his way to france and no one knows when he will be back meanwhile godwyn is spending the stolen money i cant help that im afraid lloyd said you must appeal to richard very well then said caris something in her tone made them all look at her in that case theres only one thing to do well go and find our bishop in july of king edward iii assembled the largest invasion fleet england had ever seen almost a thousand ships at portsmouth contrary winds delayed the armada but they finally set sail on july their destination a secret caris and mair arrived in portsmouth two days later just missing bishop richard who had sailed with the king they decided to follow the army to france it had not been easy to get approval even for the trip to portsmouth mother cecilia had invited the nuns in chapter to discuss the proposal and some had felt that caris would be in moral and physical danger but nuns did leave their convents not just on pilgrimages but on business errands to london canterbury and rome and the kingsbridge sisters wanted their stolen money back however caris was not sure that she would have got permission to cross the channel fortunately she was not able to ask she and mair could not have followed the army immediately even if they had known the kings destination because every seaworthy vessel on the south coast of england had been commandeered for the invasion so they fretted with impatience at a nunnery just outside portsmouth and waited for news caris learned later that king edward and his army disembarked on a broad beach at stvaastlahogue on the north coast of france near barfleur however the fleet did not return immediately instead the ships followed the coast eastward for two weeks tracking the invading army as far as caen there they loaded their holds with booty jewellery expensive cloth and gold and silver plate looted by edwards army from the prosperous burgesses of normandy then they returned one of the first back was the grace which was a cog a broadbuilt cargo ship with rounded prow and stern her captain a leatherfaced salt called rollo was full of praise for the king he had been paid at scarcity rates for his ship and his men and he had gained a good share of the plunder himself biggest army ive ever seen rollo said with relish he thought there were at least fifteen thousand men about half of them archers and probably five thousand horses youll have your work cut out to catch up with them he said ill take you to caen the last place i know them to have been and you can pick up their trail there whatever direction theyve taken theyll be about a week ahead of you caris and mair negotiated a price with rollo then went aboard the grace with two sturdy ponies blackie and stamp they could not travel any faster than the armys horses but the army had to stop and fight every so often caris reasoned and that should enable her to catch up when they reached the french side and sailed into the estuary of the orne early on a sunny august morning caris sniffed the breeze and noticed the unpleasant smell of old ashes studying the landscape on either side of the river she saw that the farmland was black it looked as if the crops had been burned in the fields standard practice rollo said what the army cant take must be destroyed otherwise it could benefit the enemy as they neared the port of caen they passed the hulks of several burnedout ships presumably fired for the same reason no one knows the kings plan rollo told them he may go south and advance on paris or swing northeast to calais and hope to meet up there with his flemish allies but youll be able to follow his trail just keep the blackened fields on either side of you before they disembarked rollo gave them a ham thank you but weve got some smoked fish and hard cheese in our saddlebags caris said to him and we have money we can buy anything else we need money may not be much use to you the captain replied there may be nothing to buy an army is like a plague of locusts it strips the country bare take the ham youre very kind goodbye pray for me if you would sister ive committed some heavy sins in my time caen was a city of several thousand houses like kingsbridge its two halves old town and new town were divided by a river the odon which was spanned by st peters bridge on the river bank near the bridge a few fishermen were selling their catch caris asked the price of an eel she found the answer difficult to understand the fisherman spoke a dialect of french she had never heard when at last she was able to make out what he was saying the price took her breath away food was so scarce she realized that it was more precious than jewels she was grateful for rollos generosity they had decided that if they were questioned they would say they were irish nuns travelling to rome now however as she and mair rode away from the river caris wondered nervously whether local people would know from her accent that she was english there were not many local people to be seen brokendown doors and smashed shutters revealed empty houses there was a ghostly hush no vendors crying their wares no children quarrelling no church bells the only work being done was burial the battle had taken place more than a week ago but small groups of grimfaced men were still bringing corpses out of buildings and loading them on to carts it looked as if the english army had simply massacred men women and children they passed a church where a huge pit had been dug in the churchyard and saw the bodies being tipped into a mass grave without coffins or even shrouds while a priest intoned a continuous burial service the stench was unspeakable a welldressed man bowed to them and asked if they needed assistance his proprietorial manner suggested that he was a leading citizen concerned to make sure no harm came to religious visitors caris declined his offer of help noting that his norman french was no different from that of a nobleman in england perhaps she thought the lower orders all had their different local dialects while the ruling class spoke with an international accent the two nuns took the road east out of town glad to leave the haunted streets behind the countryside was deserted too the bitter taste of ash was always on cariss tongue many of the fields and orchards on either side of the road had been fired every few miles they rode through a heap of charred ruins that had been a village the peasants had either fled before the army or died in the conflagration for there was little life just the birds the occasional pig or chicken overlooked by the armys foragers and sometimes a dog nosing through the debris in a bewildered way trying to pick up the scent of its master in a pile of cold embers their immediate destination was a nunnery half a days ride from caen whenever possible they would spend the night at a religious house nunnery monastery or hospital as they had on the way from kingsbridge to portsmouth they knew the names and locations of fiftyone such institutions between caen and paris if they could find them as they hurried in the scorched footprints of king edward their accommodation and food would be free and they would be safe from thieves and mother cecilia would add from fleshly temptations such as strong drink and male company cecilias instincts were sharp but she had not sensed that a different kind of temptation was in the air between caris and mair because of that caris had at first refused mairs request to come with her she was focused on moving fast and she did not want to complicate her mission by entering into a passionate entanglement or by refusing so to do on the other hand she needed someone courageous and resourceful as her companion now she was glad of her choice of all the nuns mair was the only one with the guts to go chasing the english army through france she had planned to have a frank talk before they left saying that there should be no physical affection between them while they were away apart from anything else they could get into terrible trouble if they were seen but somehow she had never got around to the frank talk so here they were in france with the issue still hanging unmentioned like an invisible third traveller riding between them on a silent horse they stopped at midday by a stream on the edge of a wood where there was an unburned meadow for the ponies to graze caris cut slices from rollos ham and mair took from their baggage a loaf of stale bread from portsmouth they drank the water from the stream though it had the taste of cinders caris suppressed her eagerness to get going and forced herself to let the horses rest for the hottest hour of the day then as they were getting ready to leave she was startled to see someone watching her she froze with the ham in one hand and her knife in the other mair said what is it then she followed cariss gaze and understood two men stood a few yards away in the shade of the trees staring at them they looked quite young but it was hard to be sure for their faces were sooty and their clothing was filthy after a moment caris spoke to them in norman french god bless you my children they made no reply caris guessed they were unsure what to do but what possibilities were they considering robbery rape they had a predatory look she was scared but she made herself think calmly whatever else they might want they must be starving she calculated she said to mair quickly give me two trenchers of that bread mair cut two thick slices off the big loaf caris cut corresponding slabs from the ham she put the ham on the bread then said to mair give them one each mair looked terrified but she walked across the grass with an unhesitating step and offered the food to the men they both snatched it and began to wolf it down caris thanked her stars that she had guessed right she quickly put the ham in her saddlebag and the knife in her belt then climbed on to blackie mair followed suit stowing the bread and mounting stamp caris felt safer on horseback the taller of the two men came towards them moving quickly caris was tempted to kick her pony and take off but she did not quite have time and then the mans hand was holding her bridle he spoke through a mouthful of food thank you he said with the heavy local accent caris said thank god not me he sent me to help you he is watching over you he sees everything you have more meat in your bag god will tell me who to give it to there was a pause while the man thought that over then he said give me your blessing caris was reluctant to extend her right arm in the traditional gesture of blessing it would take her hand too far away from the knife at her belt it was only a shortbladed food knife of the kind carried by every man and woman but it was enough to slash the back of the hand that held her bridle and cause the man to let go then she was inspired very well she said kneel down the man hesitated you must kneel to receive my blessing she said in a slightly raised voice slowly the man knelt still holding his food in his hand caris turned her gaze on his companion after a moment the second man did the same caris blessed them both then kicked blackie and quickly trotted away after a moment she looked back mair was close behind her the two starving men stood staring at them caris mulled over the incident anxiously as they rode through the afternoon the sun shone cheerfully as on a fine day in hell in some places smoke was rising fitfully from a patch of woodland or a smouldering barn but the countryside was not totally deserted she realized gradually she saw a pregnant woman harvesting beans in a field that had escaped the english torches the scared faces of two children looking out from the blackened stones of a manor house and several small groups of men usually flitting through the fringes of woodland moving with the alert purposefulness of scavengers the men worried her they looked hungry and hungry men were dangerous she wondered whether she should stop fretting about speed and worry instead about safety finding their way to the religious houses where they planned to stop was also going to be more difficult than caris had thought she had not anticipated that the english army would leave such devastation in its wake she had assumed there would be peasants around to direct her it could be hard enough in normal times to get such information from people who had never travelled farther than the nearest market town now her interlocutors would also be elusive terrified or predatory she knew by the sun that she was heading east and she thought judging by the deep cartwheel ruts in the baked mud that she was on the main road tonights destination was a village named after the nunnery at its centre hopitaldessoeurs as the shadow in front of her grew longer she looked about with increasing urgency for someone whom she could ask for directions children fled from their approach in fear caris was not yet desperate enough to risk getting close to the hungrylooking men she hoped to come across a woman there were no young women anywhere and caris had a bleak suspicion about the fate they might have met at the hands of the marauding english occasionally she saw in the far distance a few lonely figures harvesting a field that had escaped burning but she was reluctant to go too far from the road at last they found a wrinkled old woman sitting under an apple tree next to a substantial stone house she was eating small apples wrenched from the tree long before they were ripe she looked terrified caris dismounted to seem less intimidating the old woman tried to hide her poor meal in the folds of her dress but she seemed not to have the strength to run away caris addressed her politely good evening mother will this road take us to hopitaldessoeurs may i ask the woman seemed to pull herself together and answered intelligently pointing in the direction in which they were heading she said through the woods and over the hill caris saw that she had no teeth it must have been almost impossible to eat unripe apples with your gums she thought with pity how far she asked a long way all distances were long at her age can we get there by nightfall on a horse yes thank you mother i had a daughter said the old woman and two grandsons fourteen years and sixteen fine boys im very sorry to hear that the english said the old woman may they all burn in hell evidently it did not occur to her that caris and mair might be english that answered cariss question local people could not tell the nationality of strangers what were the boys names mother giles and jean i will pray for the souls of giles and jean have you any bread caris looked around to make sure there was no one else lurking nearby ready to pounce but they were alone she nodded to mair who took from her saddlebag the remains of the loaf and offered it to the old woman the woman snatched it from her and began to gnaw it with her gums caris and mair rode away mair said if we keep giving our food away were going to starve i know said caris but how can you refuse we cant fulfil our mission if were dead but we are nuns after all caris said with asperity we must help the needy and leave it to god to decide when its time for us to die mair was startled ive never heard you talk like that before my father hated people who preached about morality were all good when it suits us he used to say that doesnt count its when you want so badly to do something wrong when youre about to make a fortune from a dishonest deal or kiss the lovely lips of your neighbours wife or tell a lie to get yourself out of terrible trouble thats when you need the rules your integrity is like a sword he would say you shouldnt wave it until youre about to put it to the test not that he knew anything about swords mair was silent for a while she might have been mulling over what caris had said or she might simply have given up the argument caris was not sure talk of edmund always made caris realize how much she missed him after her mother died he had become the cornerstone of her life he had always been there standing at her shoulder as it were ready when she needed sympathy and understanding or shrewd advice or just information he had known so much about the world now when she turned in that direction there was just an empty space they passed through a patch of woodland then breasted a rise as the old woman had forecast looking down on a shallow valley they saw another burned village the same as all the rest but for a cluster of stone buildings that looked like a small convent this must be hôpitaldessoeurs said caris thank god she realized as she approached how used to nunnery life she had become as they rode down the hill she found herself looking forward to the ritual washing of hands a meal taken in silence bed time at nightfall even the sleepy peacefulness of matins at three oclock in the morning after what she had seen today the security of those grey stone walls was alluring and she kicked the tired blackie into a trot there was no one moving about the place but that was not really surprising it was a small house in a village and you would not expect the kind of hustle and bustle seen at a major priory such as kingsbridge still at this time of day there should have been a column of smoke from a kitchen fire as the evening meal was prepared however as she came closer she saw further ominous signs and a sense of dismay slowly engulfed her the nearest building which looked like a church appeared to have no roof the windows were empty sockets lacking shutters or glass some of the stone walls were blackened as if by smoke the place was silent no bells no cries of ostlers or kitchen hands it was deserted caris realized despondently as she reined in and it had been fired like every other building in the village most of the stone walls were still standing but the timber roofs had fallen in doors and other woodwork had burned and glass windows had shattered in the heat mair said unbelievingly they set fire to a nunnery caris was equally shocked she had believed that invading armies invariably left ecclesiastical buildings intact it was an iron rule people said a commander would not hesitate to put to death a soldier who violated a holy place she had accepted that without question so much for chivalry she said they dismounted and walked stepping cautiously around charred beams and scorched rubble to the domestic quarters as they approached the kitchen door mair gave a shriek and said oh god whats that caris knew the answer its a dead nun the corpse on the ground was naked but had the cropped hair of a nun the body had somehow survived the fire the woman was about a week dead the birds had already eaten her eyes and parts of her face had been nibbled by some scavenging animal also her breasts had been cut off with a knife mair said in amazement did the english do this well it wasnt the french our soldiers have foreigners fighting alongside them dont they welshmen and germans and so on perhaps it was them theyre all under the orders of our king caris said with grim disapprobation he brought them here what they do is his responsibility they stared at the hideous sight as they looked a mouse came out of the corpses mouth mair screamed and turned away caris hugged her calm down she said firmly but she stroked mairs back to comfort her come on she said after a moment lets get away from here they returned to their horses caris resisted an impulse to bury the dead nun if they delayed they would still be here at nightfall but where were they to go they had planned to spend the night here well go back to the old woman with the apple tree she said her house is the only intact building weve seen since we left caen she glanced anxiously at the setting sun if we push the horses we can be there before its full dark they urged their tired ponies forward and headed back along the road directly ahead of them the sun sank all too quickly below the horizon the last of the light was fading when they arrived back at the house by the apple tree the old woman was happy to see them expecting them to share their food which they did eating in the dark her name was jeanne there was no fire but the weather was mild and the three women rolled up side by side in their blankets not fully trusting their hostess caris and mair lay down clutching the saddlebags that contained their food caris lay awake for a while she was pleased to be on the move after such a long delay in portsmouth and they had made good progress in the last two days if she could find bishop richard she felt sure he would force godwyn to repay the nuns money he was no paragon of integrity but he was openminded and in his lackadaisical way he dispensed justice evenhandedly godwyn had not had things all his own way even in the witchcraft trial she felt sure she could persuade richard to give her a letter ordering godwyn to sell priory assets in order to give back the stolen cash but she was worried about her safety and mairs her assumption that soldiers would leave nuns alone had been quite wrong what they had seen at hopitaldessoeurs had made that clear she and mair needed a disguise when she woke up at first light she said to jeanne your grandsons do you still have their clothes the old woman opened a wooden chest take what you want she said i have no one to give them to she picked up a bucket and went off to fetch water caris began to sort through the garments in the chest jeanne had not asked for payment clothes had little monetary value after so many people had died she guessed mair said what are you up to nuns arent safe caris said were going to become pages in the service of a minor lord pierre sieur of longchamp in brittany pierre is a common name and there must be lots of places called longchamp our master has been captured by the english and our mistress has sent us to find him and negotiate his ransom all right mair said eagerly giles and jean were fourteen and sixteen so with luck their clothes will fit us caris picked out a tunic leggings and a cape with a hood all in the dull brown of undyed wool mair found a similar outfit in green with short sleeves and an undershirt women did not usually wear underdrawers but men did and fortunately jeanne had lovingly washed the linen garments of her dead family caris and mair could keep their own shoes the practical footwear of nuns was no different from what men wore shall we put them on said mair they pulled off their nuns robes caris had never seen mair undressed and she could not resist a peek her companions naked body took her breath away mairs skin seemed to glow like a pink pearl her breasts were generous with pale girlish nipples and she had a luxuriant bush of fair pubic hair caris was suddenly conscious that her own body was not as beautiful she looked away and quickly began to put on the clothes she had chosen she pulled the tunic over her head it was just like a womans dress except that it stopped at the knee instead of the ankles she pulled up the linen underdrawers and the leggings then put her shoes and belt back on mair said how do i look caris studied her mair had put a boys cap over her short blonde hair and tilted it at an angle she was grinning you look so happy caris said in surprise ive always liked boys clothes mair swaggered up and down the small room this is how they walk she said always taking more space than they need it was such an accurate imitation that caris burst out laughing caris was struck by a thought are we going to have to pee standing up i can do it but not in undershorts too inaccurate caris giggled we cant leave off the drawers a sudden flurry of wind could expose our pretences mair laughed then she began to stare at caris in a way that was strange but not entirely unfamiliar looking her up and down meeting her eyes and holding her gaze what are you doing said caris this is how men look at women as if they own us but be careful if you do it to a man he becomes aggressive this could be more difficult than i thought youre too beautiful mair said you need a dirty face she went to the fireplace and blackened her hand with soot then she smeared it on cariss face her touch was like a caress my face isnt beautiful caris thought no one ever judged it so except merthin of course too much mair said after a minute and wiped some off with her other hand thats better she smeared cariss hand and said now do me caris spread a faint smudge on mairs jawline and throat making it look as if she might have a light beard it felt very intimate to be looking so hard at her face and touching her skin so softly she dirtied mairs forehead and cheeks mair looked like a pretty boy but she did not look like a woman they studied one another a smile played on the red bow of mairs lips caris felt a sense of anticipation as if something momentous was about to happen then a voice said where are the nuns they both turned round guiltily jeanne stood in the doorway holding a heavy bucket of fresh water looking frightened what have you done to the nuns she said caris and mair burst out laughing and then jeanne recognized them how you have changed yourselves she exclaimed they drank some of the water and caris shared out the rest of the smoked fish for breakfast it was a good sign she thought as they ate that jeanne had not recognized them if they were careful perhaps they could get away with this they took their leave of jeanne and rode off as they breasted the rise before hopitaldessoeurs the sun came up directly ahead of them casting a red light on the nunnery making the ruins look as if they were still burning caris and mair trotted quickly through the village trying not to think about the mutilated corpse of the nun lying there in the debris and rode on into the sunrise by tuesday august the english army was on the run ralph fitzgerald was not sure how it had happened they had stormed across normandy from west to east looting and burning and no one had been able to withstand them ralph had been in his element on the march a soldier could take anything he saw food jewellery women and kill any man who stood in his way it was how life ought to be lived the king was a man after ralphs own heart edward iii loved to fight when he was not at war he spent most of his time organizing elaborate tournaments costly mock battles with armies of knights in specially designed uniforms on the campaign he was always ready to lead a sortie or raiding party hazarding his life never pausing to balance risks against benefits like a kingsbridge merchant the older knights and earls commented on his brutality and had protested about incidents such as the systematic rape of the women of caen but edward did not care when he had heard that some of the caen citizens had thrown stones at soldiers who were ransacking their homes he had ordered that everyone in the town should be killed and only relented after vigorous protests by sir godfrey de harcourt and others things had started to go wrong when they came to the river seine at rouen they had found the bridge destroyed and the town on the far side of the water heavily fortified king philippe vi of france was there in person with a mighty army the english marched upstream looking for a place to cross but they found that philippe had been there before them and one bridge after another was either strongly defended or in ruins they went as far as poissy only twenty miles from paris and ralph thought they would surely attack the capital but older men shook their heads sagely and said it was impossible paris was a city of fifty thousand men and they must by now have heard the news from caen so they would be prepared to fight to the death knowing they could expect no mercy if the king did not intend to attack paris ralph asked what was his plan no one knew and ralph suspected that edward had no plan other than to wreak havoc the town of poissy had been evacuated and the english engineers were able to rebuild its bridge fighting off a french attack at the same time so at last the army crossed the river by then it was clear that philippe had assembled an army larger by far than the english and edward decided on a dash to the north with the aim of joining up with an angloflemish force invading from the northeast philippe gave chase today the english were encamped south of another great river the somme and the french were playing the same trick as they had at the seine sorties and reconnaissance parties reported that every bridge had been destroyed every riverside town heavily fortified even more ominously an english detachment had seen on the far bank the flag of philippes most famous and frightening ally john the blind king of bohemia edward had started out with fifteen thousand men in total in six weeks of campaigning many of those had fallen and others had deserted to find their way home with their saddlebags full of gold he had about ten thousand left ralph calculated reports of spies suggested that in amiens a few miles upstream philippe now had sixty thousand foot soldiers and twelve thousand mounted knights an overwhelming advantage in numbers ralph was more worried than he had been since he first set foot in normandy the english were in trouble next day they marched downstream to abbeville location of the last bridge before the somme widened into an estuary but the burgesses of the town had spent money over the years strengthening the walls and the english could see it was impregnable so cocksure were the citizens that they sent out a large force of knights to attack the vanguard of the english army and there was a fierce skirmish before the locals withdrew back inside their walled town when philippes army left amiens and started advancing from the south edward found himself trapped in the point of a triangle on his right the estuary on his left the sea and behind him the french army baying for the blood of the barbaric invaders that afternoon earl roland came to see ralph ralph had been fighting in rolands retinue for seven years the earl no longer regarded him as an untried boy roland still gave the impression that he did not much like ralph but he certainly respected him and would always use him to shore up a weak point in the line lead a sally or organize a raid ralph had lost three fingers from his left hand and had walked with a limp when tired ever since a frenchmans pikestaff had cracked his shinbone outside nantes in nevertheless the king had not yet knighted ralph an omission which caused ralph bitter resentment por all the loot he had garnered most of it held for safekeeping by a london goldsmith ralph was unfulfilled he knew that his father would be equally dissatisfied like gerald ralph fought for honour not money but in all this time he had not climbed a single step up the staircase of nobility when roland appeared ralph was sitting in a field of ripening wheat that had been trampled to shreds by the army he was with alan fernhill and half a dozen comrades eating a gloomy dinner pea soup with onions food was running out and there was no meat left ralph felt as they did tired from constant marching dispirited by repeated encounters with broken bridges and welldefended towns and scared of what would happen when the french army caught up with them roland was now an old man his hair and beard grey but he still walked erect and spoke with authority he had learned to keep his expression stonily impassive so that people hardly noticed that the right side of his face was paralysed he said the estuary of the somme is tidal at low tide the water may be shallow in places but the bottom is thick mud making it impassable so we cant cross said ralph but he knew roland had not come just to give him bad news and his spirits lifted optimistically there may be a ford a point where the bottom is firmer roland went on if there is the french will know you want me to find out as quick as you like there are some prisoners in the next field ralph shook his head soldiers might have come from anywhere in france or even other countries its the local people who will have the information i dont care who you interrogate just come to the kings tent with the answer by nightfall roland walked away ralph drained his bowl and leaped to his feet glad to have something aggressive to do saddle up lads he said he still had griff miraculously his favourite horse had survived seven years of war griff was somewhat smaller than a warhorse but had more spirit than the oversized destriers most knights preferred he was now experienced in battle and his ironshod hooves gave ralph an extra weapon in the melee ralph was more fond of him than of most of his human comrades in fact the only living creature to whom he felt closer was his brother merthin whom he had not seen for seven years and might never see again for merthin had gone to florence they headed northeast towards the estuary every peasant living within half a days walk would know of the ford if there was one ralph calculated they would use it constantly crossing the river to buy and sell livestock to attend the weddings and funerals of relatives to go to markets and fairs and religious festivals they would be reluctant to give information to the invading english of course but he knew how to solve that problem they rode away from the army into territory that had not yet suffered from the arrival of thousands of men where there were sheep in the pastures and crops ripening in the fields they came to a village from which the estuary could be seen in the far distance they kicked their horses into a canter along the grassy track that led into the village the oneroom and tworoom hovels of the serfs reminded ralph of wigleigh as he expected the peasants fled in all directions the women carrying babies and children most of the men holding an axe or a sickle ralph and his companions had played out this drama twenty or thirty times in the past few weeks they were specialists in gathering intelligence usually the armys leaders wanted to know where local people had hidden their stocks when they heard the english were coming the sly peasants drove their cattle and sheep into woods stashed sacks of flour in holes in the ground and hid bales of hay in the bell tower of the church they knew they would probably starve to death if they revealed where their food was but they always told sooner or later on other occasions the army needed directions perhaps to an important town a strategic bridge a fortified abbey the peasants would usually answer such inquiries unhesitatingly but it was necessary to make sure they were not lying for the shrewder among them might try to deceive the invading army knowing the soldiers were not able to return to punish them as ralph and his men chased the fleeing peasants across gardens and fields they ignored the men and concentrated on the women and children ralph knew that if he captured them their husbands and fathers would come back he caught up with a girl of about thirteen he rode alongside her for a few seconds watching her terrified expression she was darkhaired and darkskinned with plain homely features young but with a rounded womans body the type he liked she reminded him of gwenda in slightly different circumstances he would have enjoyed her sexually as he had several similar girls in the last few weeks but today he had other priorities he turned griff to cut her off she tried to dodge him tripped over her own feet and fell flat in a vegetable patch ralph leaped off his horse and grabbed her as she got up she screamed and scratched his face so he punched her in the stomach to quiet her then he grabbed her long hair walking his horse he began to drag her back to the village she stumbled and fell but he just kept going dragging her along by the hair and she struggled to her feet crying in pain after that she did not fall again they gathered in the little wooden church the eight english soldiers had captured four women four children and two babies in arms they made them sit on the floor in front of the altar a few moments later a man ran in babbling in the local french begging and pleading four others followed ralph was pleased he stood at the altar which was only a wooden table painted white quiet he shouted he waved his sword they fell silent he pointed at a young man you he said what are you a leather worker lord please dont harm my wife and child theyve done you no wrong he pointed to another man you the girl he had captured gasped and ralph concluded that they were related father and daughter he guessed just a poor cowherd lord a cowherd that was good and how often do you take cattle across the river once or twice a year lord when i go to market and where is the ford he hesitated ford there is no ford we have to cross the bridge at abbeville are you sure yes lord he looked around all of you is this the truth they nodded ralph considered they were scared terrified but they could still be lying if i fetch the priest and he brings a bible will you all swear on your immortal souls that there is no ford across the estuary yes lord but that would take too long ralph looked at the girl he had captured come here she took a step back the cowherd fell to his knees please lord dont harm an innocent child she is only thirteen alan fernhill picked up the girl as if she were a sack of onions and threw her to ralph who caught her and held her youre lying to me all of you there is a ford im sure there is i just need to know exactly where it is all right said the cowherd ill tell you but leave the child alone where is the ford its a mile downstream from abbeville whats the name of the village the cowherd was thrown by the question for a moment then he said there is no village but you can see an inn on the far side he was lying he had never travelled so he did not realize that there was always a village by a ford ralph took the girls hand and placed it on the altar he drew his knife with a swift movement he cut off one of her fingers his heavy blade easily split her small bones the girl screamed in agony and her blood spurted red over the white paint of the altar all the peasants cried out with horror the cowherd took an angry step forward but was stopped by the point of alan fernhills sword ralph kept hold of the girl with one hand and held up the severed finger on the point of his knife you are the devil himself the cowherd said shaking with shock no im not ralph had heard that accusation before but it still stung him im saving the lives of thousands of men he said and if i have to ill cut off the rest of her fingers one by one no no then tell me where the ford really is he brandished the knife the cowherd shouted the blanchetaque its called the blanchetaque please leave her alone the blanchetaque said ralph he was pretending scepticism but in fact this was promising it was an unfamiliar word but it sounded as if it might mean a white platform and it was not the kind of thing that a terrified man would invent on the spur of the moment yes lord they call it that because of the white stones on the river bottom that enable you to cross the mud he was panicstricken tears streaming down his face so he was almost certainly telling the truth ralph thought with satisfaction the cowherd babbled on people say the stones were put there in olden times by the romans please leave my little girl alone where is it ten miles downstream from abbeville not a mile im telling the truth this time lord as i hope to be saved and the name of the village saigneville is the ford always passable or only at low tide only at low tide lord especially with livestock or a cart but you know the tides yes now i have only one more question for you but it is a very important one if i even suspect you may be lying to me i will cut off her whole hand the girl screamed ralph said you know i mean it dont you yes lord ill tell you anything when is low tide tomorrow a look of panic came over the cowherd ah ah let me work it out the man was so wrought up he could barely think the leather worker said ill tell you my brother crossed yesterday so i know low tide tomorrow will be in the middle of the morning two hours before noon yes said the cowherd thats right i was just trying to calculate midmorning or a little after then again in the evening ralph kept hold of the girls bleeding hand how sure are you oh lord as sure as i am of my own name i swear the man probably did not know his own name right now he was so distracted with terror ralph looked at the leather worker there was no sign of deceit on his face no defiance or eagerness to please in his expression he just looked a bit ashamed of himself as if he had been forced against his will to do something wrong this is the truth ralph thought exultantly ive done it he said the blanchetaque ten miles downstream from abbeville at the village of saigneville white stones on the river bottom low tide at midmorning tomorrow yes lord ralph let go of the girls wrist and she ran sobbing to her father who put his arms around her ralph looked down at the pool of blood on the white altar table there was a lot of it for a slip of a girl all right men he said were finished here the trumpets woke ralph at first light there was no time to light a fire or eat breakfast the army struck camp immediately ten thousand men had to travel six miles by midmorning most of them on foot the prince of waless division led the march off followed by the kings division then the baggage train then the rearguard scouts were sent out to check how far away the french army was ralph was in the vanguard with the sixteenyearold prince who had the same name as his father edward they hoped to surprise the french by crossing the somme at the ford last night the king had said well done ralph fitzgerald ralph had long ago learned that such words meant nothing he had performed numerous useful or brave tasks for king edward earl roland and other nobles but he still had not been knighted on this occasion he felt little resentment his life was in as much danger today as it had ever been and he was so glad to have found an escape route for himself that he hardly cared whether anyone gave him credit for saving the entire army as they marched dozens of marshals and undermarshals patrolled constantly heading the army in the right direction keeping the formation together maintaining the separation of divisions and rounding up stragglers the marshals were all noblemen for they had to have the authority to give orders king edward was fanatical about orderly marching they headed north the land rose in a gentle slope to a ridge from which they could see the distant glint of the estuary from there they descended through cornfields as they passed through villages the marshals ensured there was no looting because they did not want to carry extra baggage across the river they also refrained from setting fire to the crops for fear the smoke might betray their exact position to the enemy the sun was about to rise when the leaders reached saigneville the village stood on a bluff thirty feet above the river from the lip of the bank ralph looked over a formidable obstacle a mile and a half of water and marshland he could see the whitish stones on the bottom marking the ford on the other side of the estuary was a green hill as the sun appeared on his right he saw on the far slope a glint of metal and a flash of colour and his heart filled with dismay the strengthening light confirmed his suspicion the enemy was waiting for them the french knew where the ford was of course and a wise commander had provided for the possibility that the english might discover its location so much for surprise ralph looked at the water it was flowing west showing that the tide was going out but it was still too deep for a man to wade they would have to wait the english army continued to build up at the shore hundreds more men arriving every minute if the king had tried now to turn the army round and go back the confusion would have been nightmarish a scout returned and ralph listened as the news was related to the prince of wales king philippes army had left abbeville and was approaching on this bank of the river the scout was sent to determine how fast the french army was moving there was no turning back ralph realized with fear in his heart the english had to cross the water he studied the far side trying to figure out how many french were on the north bank more than a thousand he thought but the greater danger was the army of tens of thousands coming up from abbeville ralph had learned in many encounters with the french that they were extraordinarily brave foolhardy sometimes but they were also undisciplined they marched in disarray they disobeyed orders and they sometimes attacked to prove their valour when they would have been wiser to wait but if they could overcome their disorderly habits and get here in the next few hours they would catch king edwards army in midstream with the enemy on both banks the english could be wiped out after the devastation they had wrought in the last six weeks they could expect no mercy ralph thought about armour he had a fine suit of plate armour that he had taken from a french corpse at cambrai seven years ago but it was on a wagon in the baggage train furthermore he was not sure he could wade through a mile and a half of water and mud so encumbered he was wearing a steel cap and a short cape of chainmail which was all he could manage on the march it would have to do the others had similar light protection most of the infantry carried their helmets hanging from their belts and they would put them on before coming within range of the enemy but no one marched in full armour the sun rose high in the east the water level fell until it was just knee deep the noblemen came from the kings entourage with orders to begin the crossing earl rolands son william of caster brought the instructions to ralphs group the archers go first and begin firing as soon as they are near enough to the other side william told them ralph looked at him stonily he had not forgotten that william had tried to have him hanged for doing what half the english army had done in the last six weeks then when you get to the beach the archers scatter left and right to let the knights and menatarms through it sounded simple ralph thought orders always did but it was going to be bloody the enemy would be perfectly positioned on the slope above the river to pick off the english soldiers struggling unprotected through the water the men of hugh despenser led the advance carrying his distinctive blackonwhite banner his archers waded in holding their bows above the water line and the knights and menatarms splashed along behind rolands men followed and soon ralph and alan were riding through the water a mile and a half was not far to walk but ralph now realized it was a long way to wade even for a horse the depth varied in some places they walked on swampy ground above the surface in others the water came up to the waists of the infantry men and animals tired quickly the august sun beat down on their heads while their wet feet grew numb with cold and all the time as they looked ahead they could see more and more clearly the enemy waiting for them on the north bank ralph studied the opposing force with growing trepidation the front line along the shore consisted of crossbowmen he knew that these were not frenchmen but italian mercenaries always called genoese but in fact coming from various parts of italy the crossbow had a slower rate of fire than the longbow but the genoese were going to have plenty of time to reload while their targets lumbered through the shallows behind the archers on the green rise stood foot soldiers and mounted knights ready to charge looking back ralph saw thousands of english crossing the river behind him once again turning back was not an option in fact those behind were pressing forward crowding the leaders now he could see the enemy ranks clearly ranged along the shore were the heavy wooden shields called pavises used by the crossbowmen as soon as the english came within range the genoese began to shoot at a distance of three hundred yards their aim was inaccurate and the bolts fell with diminished force all the same a handful of horses and men were hit the injured fell and drifted downstream to drown wounded horses thrashed in the water turning it bloody ralphs heart beat faster as the english came closer to the shore the accuracy of the genoese improved and the bolts landed with greater power the crossbow was slow but it fired a steeltipped iron bolt with terrible force all around ralph men and horses fell some of those hit died instantly there was nothing he could do to protect himself he realized with an apprehension of doom either he would be lucky or he would die the air filled with the awful noise of battle the swish of deadly arrows the curses of wounded men the screams of horses in agony the archers at the front of the english column shot back their sixfoot longbows dragged their ends in the water so they had to hold them at an unfamiliar angle and the river bottom beneath their feet was slippery but they did their best crossbow bolts could penetrate armour plate at close range but none of the english was wearing any serious armour anyway apart from their helmets they had little protection from the deadly hail ralph would have turned and run if he could however behind him ten thousand men and half as many horses were pressing forward and would have trampled him and drowned him if he had tried to go back he had no alternative but to lower his head to griffs neck and urge him on the survivors among the leading english archers at last reached shallow water and began to deploy their longbows more effectively they shot in a trajectory over the top of the pavises once they got started english bowmen could shoot twelve arrows a minute the shafts were made of wood usually ash but they had steel tips and when they fell like rain they were terrifying suddenly the shooting from the enemy side lessened some of the shields fell the genoese were driven back and the english began to reach the foreshore as soon as the archers got their feet on solid ground they dispersed left and right leaving the shore clear for the knights who charged out of the shallows at the enemy lines ralph still wading across the river had seen enough battles to know what the french tactics should be at this point they needed to hold their line and let the crossbowmen continue to slaughter the english on the beach and in the water but the chivalric code would not permit the french nobility to hide behind lowborn archers and they broke the line to ride forth and engage with the english knights thereby throwing away much of the benefit of their position ralph felt a glimmer of hope the genoese fell back and the beach was a melee ralphs heart pounded with fear and excitement the french still had the advantage of charging downhill and they were fully armoured they slaughtered hugh despensers men wholesale the vanguard of the charge splashed into the shallows cutting down the men still in the water earl rolands archers reached the edge just ahead of ralph and alan those who survived gained the shore and divided ralph felt that the english were doomed and he was sure to die but there was nowhere to go except forward and suddenly he was charging head down by griffs neck sword in the air straight at the french line he ducked a scything sword and reached dry ground he struck uselessly at a steel helmet then griff cannoned into another horse the french horse was larger but younger and it stumbled throwing its rider to the mud ralph whirled griff around went back and prepared to charge again his sword was of limited use against plate armour but he was a big man on a spirited horse and his best hope was to knock enemy soldiers off their mounts he charged again at this point in a battle he felt no rear instead he was possessed by an exhilarating rage that drove him to kill as many of the enemy as he could when battle was joined time stood still and he fought from moment to moment later when the action came to an end if he was still alive he would be astonished to see that the sun was setting and a whole day had gone by now he rode at the enemy again and again dodging their swords thrusting where he saw an opportunity never slowing his pace for that was fatal at some point it might have been after a few minutes or a few hours he realized with incredulity that the english were no longer being slaughtered in fact they seemed to be winning ground and gaining hope he detached himself from the melee and paused panting to take stock the beach was carpeted with corpses but there were as many french as english and ralph realized the folly of the french charge as soon as the knights on both sides engaged the genoese crossbowmen had stopped firing for fear of hitting their own side so the enemy had no longer been able to pick off the english in the water like ducks on a pond ever since then the english had streamed out of the estuary in their hordes all following the same orders archers spreading left and right knights and infantrymen pushing relentlessly forward so that the french were inundated by sheer weight of numbers glancing back at the water ralph saw that the tide was now rising again so those english still in the river were desperate to get out regardless of the fate that might await them on the beach as he was catching his breath the french lost their nerve forced off the beach chased up the hill overwhelmed by the army stampeding out of the rising water they began to retreat the english pressed forward hardly able to believe their luck and as so often happened it took remarkably little time for retreat to turn into flight with every man for himself ralph looked back over the estuary the baggage train was in midstream horses and oxen pulling the heavy carts across the ford lashed by drivers frantic to beat the tide there was scrappy fighting on the far bank now the vanguard of king philippes army must have arrived and engaged a few stragglers and ralph thought he recognized in the sunlight the colours of the bohemian light cavalry but they were too late he slumped in his saddle suddenly weak with relief the battle was over incredibly against all expectations the english had slipped out of the french trap for today they were safe caris and mair arrived in the vicinity of abbeville on august and were dismayed to find the french army already there tens of thousands of foot soldiers and archers were camped in the fields around the town on the road they heard not just regional french accents but the tongues of places farther afield flanders bohemia italy savoy majorca the french and their allies were chasing king edward of england and his army as were caris and mair caris wondered how she and mair could ever get ahead in the race when they passed through the gates and entered the town late in the afternoon the streets were crowded with french noblemen caris had never seen such a display of costly clothing fine weapons magnificent horses and new shoes not even in london it seemed as if the entire aristocracy of france was here the innkeepers bakers street entertainers and prostitutes of the town were working nonstop to fulfil the needs of their guests every tavern was full of counts and every house had knights sleeping on the floor the abbey of st peter was on the list of religious houses where caris and mair had planned to take shelter but even if they had still been dressed as nuns they would have had trouble getting into the guest quarters the king of france was staying there and his entourage took up all the available space the two kingsbridge nuns disguised now as christophe de longchamp and michel de longchamp were directed to the grand abbey church where several hundred of the kings squires grooms and other attendants were bedding down at night on the cold stone floor of the nave however the marshal in charge told them there was no room and they would have to sleep in the fields like everyone else of low station the north transept was a hospital for the wounded on the way out caris paused to watch a surgeon sewing up a deep cut on the cheek of a groaning manatarms the surgeon was quick and skilful and when he had finished caris said admiringly you did that very well thank you he said glancing at her he added but how would you know laddie she knew because she had watched matthew barber at work many times but she had to make up a story quickly so she said back in longchamp my father is surgeon to the sieur and are you with your sieur now he has been captured by the english and my lady has sent me and my brother to negotiate his ransom hmm you might have done better to go straight to london if he isnt there now he soon will be however now that youre here you can earn a bed for the night by helping me gladly have you seen your father wash wounds with warm wine caris could wash wounds in her sleep in a few moments she and mair were doing what they knew best taking care of sick people most of the men had been hurt the previous day in a battle at a ford over the river somme injured noblemen had been attended to first and now the surgeon was getting around to the common soldiers they worked nonstop for several hours the long summer evening turned to twilight and candles were brought at last all the bones had been set the crushed extremities amputated and the wounds sewn up and the surgeon martin chirurgien took them to the refectory for supper they were treated as part of the kings entourage and fed stewed mutton with onions they had not tasted meat for a week they even had good red wine mair drank with relish caris was glad they had the opportunity to build up their strength but she was still anxious about catching up with the english a knight at their table said do you realize that in the abbots dining room next door four kings and two archbishops are eating supper he counted on his fingers as he named them the kings of france bohemia rome and majorca and the archbishops of rouen and sens caris decided she had to see she went out of the room by the door that seemed to lead to the kitchen she saw servants carrying laden platters into another room and peeped through the door the men around the table were undoubtedly highranking the board was loaded with roasted fowls huge joints of beef and mutton rich puddings and pyramids of sugared fruits the man at the head was presumably king philippe fiftythree years old with a scatter of grey hairs in his blond beard beside him a younger man who resembled him was holding forth the english are not noblemen he said redfaced with fury they are like thieves who steal in the night and then run away martin appeared at cariss shoulder and murmured in her ear thats my master charles count of alençon the kings brother a new voice said i disagree caris saw immediately that the speaker was blind and concluded that he must be king jean of bohemia the english cannot run much longer they are low on food and theyre tired charles said edward wants to join forces with the angloflemish army that has invaded northeast france from flanders jean shook his head we learned today that that army has gone into retreat i think edward has to stand and fight and from his point of view the sooner the better for his men are only going to become more dispirited as the days go by charles said excitedly then we may catch them tomorrow after what they have done to normandy every one of them should die knights noblemen even edward himself king philippe put a hand on charless arm silencing him our brothers anger is understandable he said the crimes of the english are disgusting but remember when we encounter the enemy the most important thing is to put aside any differences there may be between us forget our quarrels and grudges and trust one another at least for the course of the battle we outnumber the english and we should vanquish them easily but we must fight together as one army let us drink to unity that was an interesting toast caris decided as she discreetly withdrew clearly the king could not take it for granted that his allies would act as a team but what worried her about the conversation was the likelihood that there would be a battle soon perhaps tomorrow she and mair would have to take care not to get mixed up in it as they returned to the refectory martin said quietly like the king you have an unruly brother caris saw that mair was getting drunk she was overplaying her boyish role sitting with her legs splayed and her elbows on the table by the saints that was a good stew but its making me fart like the devil said the sweetfaced nun in mens clothing sorry about the stink lads she refilled her wine cup and drank deeply the men laughed at her indulgently amused by the sight of a boy getting drunk for the first time doubtless remembering embarrassing incidents in their own pasts caris took her arm time you were in bed baby brother she said off we go mair went willingly enough my big brother acts like an old woman she said to the company but he loves me dont you christophe yes michel i love you caris said and the men laughed again mair held on tightly to her caris walked her back to the church and found the spot in the nave where they had left their blankets she made mair lie down and covered her with her blanket kiss me goodnight christophe said mair caris kissed her lips then said youre drunk go to sleep we have to start early in the morning caris lay awake for some time worrying she felt she had had terribly bad luck she and mair had almost caught up with the english army and bishop richard but at exactly the same moment the french had also caught up with them she should keep well away from the battlefield on the other hand if she and mair got stuck in the rear of the french army they might never catch the english on balance she thought she had better set off first thing in the morning and try to get ahead of the french an army this big could not move fast it would take hours just to form up into marching order if she and mair were nimble they should be able to stay ahead it was risky but they had done nothing but take risks since leaving portsmouth she drifted off to sleep and woke when the bell rang for matins soon after three oclock in the morning she roused mair and was unsympathetic when she complained of a headache while the monks sang psalms in the church caris and mair went to the stables and found their horses the sky was clear and they could see by starlight the towns bakers had been working all night so they were able to buy loaves for their journey but the city gates were still closed they had to wait impatiently until dawn shivering in the cool air eating the new bread at about half past four they at last left abbeville and headed northwest along the right bank of the somme the direction the english army was said to be taking they were only a quarter of a mile away when the trumpets sounded a reveille on the walls of the town like caris king philippe had decided on an early start in the fields the soldiers and menatarms began to stir the marshals must have got their orders last night for they seemed to know what to do and before long some of the army joined caris and mair on the road caris still hoped to reach the enghsh ahead of these troops the french would obviously have to stop and regroup before joining battle that ought to give caris and mair time to reach their countrymen and find some safe place beyond the battlefield she did not want to get caught between the two sides she was beginning to think she had been foolhardy to set out on this mission knowing nothing of war she had not been able to imagine the difficulties and dangers but it was too late now for regrets and they had got this far without coming to harm the soldiers on the road were not french but italian they carried steel crossbows and sheaves of iron arrows they were friendly and caris chatted to them in a mixture of norman french latin and the italian she had picked up from buonaventura caroli they told her that in battle they always formed the front line and fired from behind their heavy wooden pavises which at the moment were in wagons somewhere behind them they grumbled about their hasty breakfast disparaged french knights as impulsive and quarrelsome and spoke with admiration of their leader ottone doria who could be seen a few yards ahead the sun climbed in the sky and everyone got hot because the crossbowmen knew they might do battle today they were wearing heavy quilted coats and carrying iron helmets and knee guards as well as their bows and arrows towards noon mair declared that she would faint unless they stopped for a break caris too felt exhausted they had been riding since dawn and she knew their horses also needed rest so against her inclination she was forced to stop while thousands of crossbowmen overtook them caris and mair watered their ponies in the somme and ate some more bread when they set off again they found themselves marching with french knights and menatarms caris recognized philippes choleric brother charles at the head of the group she was in the thick of the french army but there was nothing to do but keep moving and hope for a chance to get ahead soon after midday an order came down the line the english were not west of here as previously believed but north and the french king had ordered that his army should swing in that direction not in a column but all at the same time the men around caris and mair led by count charles turned off the riverside road down a narrow path through the fields caris followed with a sinking heart a familiar voice hailed her and martin chirurgien came alongside this is chaos he said grimly the marching order has completely broken down a small group of men on fast horses appeared across the fields and hailed count charles scouts said martin and he went forward to hear what they had to say caris and mairs ponies went too with the natural instinct of horses to stick together the english have halted they heard theyve taken up a defensive position on a ridge near the town of crécy martin said thats henri le moine an old comrade of the king of bohemia charles was pleased by the news then we shall have battle today he said and the knights around him gave a ragged cheer henri raised a hand in caution were suggesting that all units stop and regroup he said stop now charles roared when the english are at last willing to stand and fight lets get at them our men and horses need rest henri said quietly the king is far in the rear give him a chance to catch up and look at the battlefield he can make his dispositions today for an attack tomorrow when the men will be fresh to hell with dispositions there are only a few thousand english well just overrun them henri made a helpless gesture it is not for me to command you my lord but i will ask your brother the king for his orders ask him ask him said charles and he rode on martin said to caris i dont know why my master is so intemperate caris said thoughtfully i suppose he has to prove that hes brave enough to rule even though by an accident of birth hes not the king martin shot her a sharp look youre very wise for a mere boy caris avoided his eye and vowed to remember her false identity there was no hostility in martins voice but he was suspicious as a surgeon he would be familiar with the subtle differences in bone structure between men and women and he might have noticed that christophe and michel de longchamp were abnormal fortunately he did not press the matter the sky began to cloud over but the air was still warm and humid woodland appeared on the left and martin told caris this was the forest of crécy they could not be far from the english but now caris wondered how she was going to detach herself from the french and join the english without being killed by one side or the other the effect of the forest was to crowd the left flank of the marching army so that the road on which caris was riding became jampacked with troops the different divisions getting hopelessly mixed up couriers came down the line with new orders from the king the army was instructed to halt and make camp cariss hopes rose now she would have a chance to get ahead of the french army there was an altercation between charles and a courier and martin went to charless side to listen he came back looking incredulous count charles is refusing to obey the orders he said why caris asked in dismay he thinks his brother is overcautious he charles will not be so lilylivered as to halt before such a weak enemy i thought everyone had to obey the king in battle they should but nothing is more important to french noblemen than their code of chivalry they would die rather than do something cowardly the army marched on in defiance of its orders im glad you two are here martin said im going to need your help again win or lose there will be a lot of wounded men by sundown caris realized she could not escape but somehow she no longer wanted to get away in fact she felt a strange eagerness if these men were mad enough to maim one another with swords and arrows she could at least come to the aid of the wounded soon the crossbowmens leader ottone doria came riding back through the crowd not without difficulty given the crush to speak to charles of alençon halt your men he shouted at the count charles took offence how dare you give orders to me the orders come from the king we are to halt but my men cant stop because of yours pushing from behind then let them march on we are within sight of the enemy if we go any farther well have to do battle so be it but the men have been marching all day theyre hungry and thirsty and tired and my crossbowmen dont have their pavises are they too cowardly to fight without shields are you calling my men cowards if they wont fight yes ottone was quiet for a moment then he spoke in a low voice and caris could only just hear his words youre a fool alençon and youll be in hell by nightfall then he turned his horse and rode away caris felt water on her face and looked up at the sky it was beginning to rain the shower was heavy but brief and when it cleared ralph looked down over the valley and saw with a thrill of fear that the enemy had arrived the english occupied a ridge that ran from southwest to northeast at their backs to the northwest was a wood in front and on both sides the hill sloped down their right flank looked over the town of crécyenponthieu which nestled in the valley of the river maye the french were approaching from the south ralph was on the right flank with earl rolands men commanded by the young prince of wales they were drawn up in the harrow formation that had proved so effective against the scots to the left and right triangular formations of archers stood like the two teeth of a harrow between the teeth set well back were dismounted knights and menatarms this was a radical innovation and one which many knights still resisted they liked their horses and felt vulnerable on foot but the king was implacable everyone on foot in the ground in front of the knights the men had dug pitfalls holes in the ground a foot deep and a foot square to trip the french horses on ralphs right at the end of the ridge was a novelty three new machines called bombards or cannons that used explosive powder to shoot round stones they had been dragged all the way across normandy but so far had never been fired and no one was sure whether they would work today king edward needed to use every means at his disposal for the enemys superiority was somewhere between fourtoone and seventoone on the english left flank the earl of northamptons men were drawn up in the same harrow formation behind the front lines a third battalion led by the king stood in reserve behind the king were two fallback positions the baggage wagons formed the first drawn up in a circle with noncombatants cooks engineers and ostlers inside the circle with the horses the second was the wood itself where in the event of a rout the remnants of the english army could flee and the mounted french knights would find it difficult to follow they had been here since early morning with nothing to eat but pea soup with onions ralph was wearing his armour and had been sweltering in the heat so the rainstorm had been welcome it had also muddied the slope up which the french would have to charge making their approach treacherously slippery ralph could guess what the french tactics would be the genoese crossbowmen would shoot from behind their shields to soften up the english line then when they had done enough damage they would step aside and the french knights would charge on their warhorses there was nothing so terrifying as that charge called the furor fransiscus it was the ultimate weapon of the french nobility their code made them disregard their own safety those huge horses with riders so completely armoured that they looked like iron men simply rolled over archers shields swords and menatarms of course it did not always work the charge could be repulsed especially where the terrain favoured the defenders as it did here however the french were not easily discouraged they would charge again and they had such enormous superiority in numbers that ralph could not see how the english could hold them off indefinitely he was scared but all the same he did not regret being with the army for seven years he had lived the life of action he had always wanted in which strong men were kings and the weak counted for nothing he was twentynine and men of action rarely lived to be old he had committed foul sins but had been absolved of them all most recently this morning by the bishop of shiring who was now standing next to his father the earl armed with a viciouslooking mace priests were not supposed to shed blood a rule they acknowledged cursorily by using blunt weapons on the battlefield the crossbowmen in their white coats reached the foot of the slope the english archers who had been sitting down their arrows stuck pointfirst into the ground in front of them now began to stand up and string their bows ralph guessed that most of them felt what he did a mixture of relief that the long wait was over and fear at the thought of the odds against them ralph thought there was plenty of time he could see that the genoese did not have the heavy wooden pavises that were an essential element of their tactics the battle would not start until the shields were brought he felt sure behind the crossbowmen thousands of knights were pouring into the valley from the south spreading left and right behind the crossbowmen the sun came out again lighting up the bright colours of their banners and the horses coats ralph recognized the coatofarms of charles count of alençon king philippes brother the crossbowmen stopped at the foot of the slope there were thousands of them as if at a signal they all gave a terrific shout some jumped up in the air trumpets sounded it was their war cry meant to terrify the enemy and it might have worked on some foes but the english army consisted of experienced fighting men who were at the end of a sixweek campaign and it took more than shouting to scare them they looked on impassively then to ralphs utter astonishment the genoese lifted their crossbows and shot what were they doing they had no shields the sound was sudden and terrifying five thousand iron bolts flying through the air but the crossbowmen were out of range perhaps they had failed to take account of the fact that they were shooting uphill and the afternoon sun behind the english lines must have been shining in their eyes whatever the reason their bolts fell uselessly short there was a flash of flame and a crash like thunder from the middle of the english front line amazed ralph saw smoke rising from where the new bombards were their sound was impressive but when he returned his gaze to the enemy ranks he saw little actual damage however many of the crossbowmen were shocked enough to pause in their reloading at that moment the prince of wales shouted the order for his archers to shoot two thousand longbows were raised knowing they were too distant to shoot in a straight line parallel with the ground the archers aimed into the sky intuitively plotting a shallow trajectory for their arrows all the bows bent simultaneously like blades of wheat in a field blown by a sudden summer breeze then the arrows were released with a collective sound like a church bell tolling the shafts flying faster than the swiftest bird rose into the air then turned downwards and fell on the crossbowmen like a hailstorm the enemy ranks were densely packed and the padded genoese coats gave little protection without their shields the crossbowmen were horribly vulnerable hundreds of them fell dead or wounded but that was only the beginning while the surviving crossbowmen were rewinding their weapons the english fired again and again it took an archer only four or five seconds to pull an arrow from the ground notch it draw the bow take aim shoot and reach for another experienced practised men could do it faster in the space of a minute twenty thousand arrows fell on the unprotected crossbowmen it was a massacre and the consequence was inevitable they turned and ran in moments the genoese were out of range and the english held their fire laughing at their unexpected triumph and jeering at the enemy but then the crossbowmen encountered another hazard the french knights were moving forward a dense herd of fleeing crossbowmen came head to head with massed horsemen itching to charge for a moment there was chaos ralph was amazed to see the enemy begin to fight among themselves the knights drew their swords and started to hack the bowmen who discharged their bolts at the knights then fought on with knives the french noblemen should have been trying to stop the carnage but as far as ralph could see those in the most expensive armour and riding the largest horses were at the forefront of the fight attacking their own side with evergreater fury the knights drove the crossbowmen back up the slope until they were again within longbow range once again the prince of wales gave the order for the english archers to shoot now the hail of arrows fell among knights as well as bowmen in seven years of warfare ralph had seen nothing like this hundreds of the enemy lay dead and wounded and not a single english soldier had been so much as scratched at last the french knights retreated and the remaining crossbowmen scattered they left the slope below the english position littered with bodies welsh and cornish knifemen ran forward from the english ranks on to the battlefield and began finishing off the french wounded retrieving undamaged arrows for the longbowmen to reuse and no doubt robbing the corpses while they were at it at the same time boy runners got fresh stocks of arrows from the supply train and brought them to the english front line there was a pause but it did not last long the french knights regrouped reinforced by new arrivals who were appearing in their hundreds and thousands peering into their ranks ralph could see that the colours of alençon had been joined by those of flanders and normandy the standard of the count of alençon moved to the front then the trumpets sounded and the horsemen began to move ralph put his faceplate down and drew his sword he thought of his mother he knew she prayed for him every time she went to church and he felt a moment of warm gratitude to her then he watched the enemy the huge horses were slow to start encumbered as they were by riders in full plate armour the setting sun glinted off the french visors and the flags snapped in the evening breeze gradually the pounding of the hooves grew louder and the pace of the charge picked up the knights yelled encouragement to their mounts and to one another waving their swords and spears they came like a wave on to a beach seeming to get bigger and faster as they got nearer ralphs mouth was dry and his heart beat like a big drum they came within bowshot and again the prince gave the order to shoot once more the arrows rose into the air and fell like deadly rain the charging knights were fully armoured and it was a lucky shot indeed that found the weak spot in the joints between plates but their mounts had only faceplates and chainmail neck cowls so it was the horses that were vulnerable when the arrows pierced their shoulders and their haunches some stopped dead some fell and some turned and tried to flee the screams of beasts in pain filled the air collisions between horses caused more knights to fall to the ground joining the bodies of genoese crossbowmen those behind were going too fast to take evasive action so they just rode over the fallen but there were thousands of knights and they kept coming the range shortened for the archers and their trajectory flattened when the charge was a hundred yards away they switched to a different type of arrow with a flattened steel tip for punching through armour instead of a point now they could kill the riders although a shot that hit a horse was almost as good the ground was already wet with rain and now the charge encountered the pitfalls dug earlier by the english the horses momentum was such that few of them could step into a hole a foot deep without stumbling and many fell pitching their riders on to the ground in the path of other horses the oncoming knights shied away from the archers so as the english had planned the charge was funnelled into a narrow killing field fired upon from left and right this was the key to the english tactics at this point the wisdom of forcing the english knights to dismount became clear if they had been on horseback they could not have resisted the urge to charge and then the archers would have had to cease shooting for fear of killing their own side but because the knights and menatarms remained in their lines the enemy could be slaughtered wholesale with no casualties on the english side but it was not enough the french were too numerous and too brave still they came on and at last they reached the line of dismounted knights and menatarms in the fork between the two masses of archers and the real fighting began the horses trampled over the front ranks of english but their charge had been slowed by the muddy uphill slope and they were brought up short by the densely packed english line ralph was suddenly in the thick of it avoiding deadly downward blows from mounted knights swinging his sword at the legs of their horses aiming to cripple the beasts by the easiest and most reliable method cutting their hamstrings the fighting was fierce the english had nowhere to go and the french knew that if they retreated they would have to ride back through the same lethal hail of arrows men fell all around ralph hacked down by swords and battleaxes then trampled by the mighty ironshod hooves of the warhorses he saw earl roland go down to a french sword rolands son bishop richard swung his mace to protect his fallen father but a warhorse shouldered richard aside and the earl was trampled the english were forced back and ralph realized that the french had a target the prince of wales ralph had no affection for the privileged sixteenyearold heir to the throne but he knew it would be a crushing blow to english morale if the prince were captured or killed ralph moved back and to his left joining several others who thickened the shield of fighting men around the prince but the french intensified their efforts and they were on horseback then ralph found himself fighting shoulder to shoulder with the prince recognizing him by his quartered surcoat with fleursdelis on a blue background and heraldic lions on red a moment later a french horseman swung at the prince with an axe and the prince fell to the ground it was a bad moment ralph sprang forward and lunged at the attacker sliding his long sword into the mans armpit where the armour was jointed he had the satisfaction of feeling the point penetrate flesh and saw blood spurt from the wound someone else straddled the fallen prince and swung a big sword twohanded at men and horses alike ralph saw that it was the princes standardbearer richard fitzsimon who had dropped the flag over his supine master for a few moments richard and ralph fought savagely to defend the kings son not knowing if he was alive or dead then reinforcements arrived the earl of arundel appeared with a large force of menatarms all fresh to the fight the newcomers joined the battle with vigour and they turned the tables the french began to fall back the prince of wales got to his knees ralph put up his visor and helped the prince to his feet the boy seemed to be hurt but not seriously and ralph turned away and fought on a moment later the french broke despite the lunacy of their tactics their courage had almost enabled them to sever the english line but not quite now they fled many more falling as they ran the gauntlet of archers stumbling down the bloody slope back to their own lines and a cheer went up from the english weary but jubilant once again the welsh invaded the battlefield cutting the throats of the wounded and collecting thousands of arrows the archers too picked up spent shafts to replenish their stocks from the rear cooks appeared with jugs of beer and wine and surgeons rushed to attend injured noblemen ralph saw william of caster bend over earl roland roland was breathing but his eyes were closed and he looked near to death ralph wiped his bloody sword on the ground and put his visor up to drink a tankard of ale the prince of wales approached him and said whats your name ralph fitzgerald of wigleigh my lord you fought bravely you shall be sir ralph tomorrow if the king listens to me ralph glowed with pleasure thank you lord the prince nodded graciously and moved away caris watched the early stages of the battle from the far side of the valley she saw the genoese crossbowmen try to flee only to be cut down by knights of their own side then she saw the first great charge with the colours of charles of alençon leading thousands of knights and menatarms she had never seen battle and she was utterly sickened hundreds of knights fell to the english arrows to be trampled by the hooves of the great warhorses she was too far away to be able to follow the handtohand fighting but she saw the swords flash and the men fall and she wanted to weep as a nun she had seen severe injuries men who had fallen from high scaffolding hurt themselves with sharp tools suffered hunting accidents and she always felt the pain and the waste of a lost hand a crushed leg a damaged brain to see men inflicting such wounds on one another intentionally revolted her for a long time it seemed the fight could go either way if she had been at home hearing news of the war from afar she might have hoped for an english victory but after what she had seen in the last two weeks she felt a sort of disgusted neutrality she could not identify with the english who had murdered peasants and burned their crops and it made no difference to her that they had committed these atrocities in normandy of course they would say the french deserved what they got because they had burned portsmouth but that was a stupid way to think so stupid that it led to scenes of horror such as this the french retreated and she assumed they would regroup and reorganize and wait for the king to arrive to develop a new battle plan they still had overwhelming superiority in numbers she could see there were tens of thousands of troops in the valley with more still arriving but the french did not regroup instead every new battalion that arrived went straight into the attack throwing themselves suicidally up the hill at the english position the second and subsequent charges fared worse than the first some were cut down by archers even before they reached the english lines the rest were beaten off by foot soldiers the slope below the ridge became shiny with the gushing blood of hundreds of men and horses after the first charge caris looked only occasionally at the battle she was too busy tending those french wounded who were lucky enough to be able to leave the field martin chirurgien had realized that she was as good a surgeon as he giving her free access to his instruments he left her and mair to work independently they washed sewed and bandaged hour after hour news of prominent casualties came back to them from the front line charles of alençon was the first highranking fatality caris could not help feeling that he deserved his fate she had witnessed his foolish enthusiasm and careless indiscipline hours later king jean of bohemia was reported dead and she wondered what madness drove a blind man to battle in gods name why dont they stop she said to martin when he brought her a cup of ale to refresh her fear he replied theyre scared of disgrace to leave the field without striking a blow would be shameful they would prefer to die a lot of them have had that wish granted said caris grimly and she emptied her tankard and went back to work her knowledge and understanding of the human body was growing by leaps and bounds she reflected she saw inside every part of a living man the brains beneath shattered skulls the pipework of the throat the muscles of the arms sliced open the heart and lungs within smashed ribcages the slimy tangle of the intestines the articulation of the bones at hip and knee and ankle she discovered more in an hour on the battlefield than in a year at the priory hospital this was how matthew barber had learned so much she realized no wonder he was confident the carnage continued until night fell the english lit torches afraid of a sneak attack under cover of darkness but caris could have told them they were safe the french were routed she could hear the calls of french soldiers searching the battlefield for fallen kinsmen and comrades the king who had arrived in time to join one of the last hopeless charges left the field after that the exit became general a fog came up from the river filling the valley and obscuring the distant flares once again caris and mair worked by firelight long into the night patching up the wounded all those who could walk or hobble left as soon as they could putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the english hoping to avoid tomorrows inevitable bloodthirsty moppingup operation when caris and mair had done all they could for the victims they slipped away this was their chance they located their ponies and led them forward by the light of a burning torch they reached the bottom of the valley and found themselves in nomansland hidden by fog and darkness they slipped out of their boys clothing for a moment they were terribly vulnerable two naked women in the middle of a battlefield but no one could see them and a second later they were pulling their nuns robes over their heads they packed up their male garments in case they should need them again it was a long way home caris decided to abandon the torch in case an english archer should take it into his head to shoot at the light and ask questions afterwards holding hands so that they would not get separated they went forward still leading the horses they could see nothing the fog obscured whatever light might have come from moon or stars they headed uphill towards the english lines there was a smell like a butchers shop so many bodies of horses and men covered the ground that they could not walk around them they had to grit their teeth and step on the corpses soon their shoes were covered with a mixture of mud and blood the bodies on the ground thinned out and soon there were none caris began to feel a deep sense of relief as she approached the english army she and mair had travelled hundreds of miles lived rough for two weeks and risked their lives for this moment she had almost forgotten the outrageous theft by prior godwyn of one hundred and fifty pounds from the nuns treasury the reason for her journey somehow it seemed less important after all this bloodshed still she would appeal to bishop richard and win justice for the nunnery the walk seemed farther than caris had imagined when she had looked across the valley in daylight she wondered nervously if she had become disoriented she might have turned in the wrong direction and just walked straight past the english perhaps the army was now behind her she strained to hear some noise ten thousand men could not be silent even if most of them had fallen into exhausted sleep but the fog muffled sound she clung to the conviction that as king edward had positioned his forces on the highest land she must be approaching him as long as she was walking uphill but the blindness was unnerving if there had been a precipice she would have stepped right over it the light of dawn was turning the fog to the colour of pearl when at last she heard a voice she stopped it was a man speaking in a low murmur mair squeezed her hand nervously another man spoke she could not make out the language she feared that she might have walked full circle and arrived back on the french side she turned towards the voice still holding mairs hand the red glow of flames became visible through the grey mist and she headed for it gratefully as she came nearer she heard the talk more clearly and realized with immense relief that the men were speaking english a moment later she made out a group of men around a fire several lay asleep rolled in blankets but three sat upright legs crossed looking into the flames talking a moment later caris saw a man standing peering into the fog presumably on sentry duty though the fact that he had not noticed her approach proved his job was impossible to get their attention caris said in a low voice god bless you men of england she startled them one gave a shout of fear the sentry said belatedly who goes there two nuns from kingsbridge priory caris said the men stared at her in superstitious dread and she realized they thought she might be an apparition dont worry were flesh and blood and so are these ponies did you say kingsbridge said one of them in surprise i know you he said standing up ive seen you before caris recognized him lord william of caster she said i am the earl of shiring now he said my father died of his wounds an hour ago may his soul rest in peace we have come here to see your brother bishop richard who is our abbot youre too late william said my brother too is dead later in the morning when the fog had lifted and the battlefield looked like a sunlit slaughterhouse earl william took caris and mair to see king edward everyone was astonished at the tale of the two nuns who had followed the english army all through normandy and soldiers who had faced death only yesterday were fascinated by their adventures william told caris that the king would want to hear the story from her own lips edward iii had been king for nineteen years but he was still only thirtythree years old tall and broadshouldered he was imposing rather than handsome with a face that might have been moulded for power a big nose high cheekbones and luxuriant long hair just beginning to recede from his high forehead caris saw why people called him a lion he sat on a stool in front of his tent fashionably dressed in twocoloured hose and a cape with a scalloped border he wore no armour or weapons the french had vanished and in fact a force of vengeful troops had been sent out to hunt down and kill any stragglers a handful of barons stood around as caris told how she and mair had sought food and shelter in the devastated landscape of normandy she wondered if the king felt criticized by her tale of hardship however he seemed not to think the sufferings of the people reflected on him he was as delighted with her exploits as if he were hearing of someone who had been brave during a shipwreck she ended by telling him of her disappointment on finding after all her travails that bishop richard from whom she hoped for justice was dead i beg your majesty to order the prior of kingsbridge to restore to the nuns the money he stole edward smiled ruefully youre a brave woman but you know nothing of politics he said with condescension the king cant get involved in an ecclesiastical quarrel such as this we would have all our bishops banging on our door in protest that might be so caris reflected but it did not prevent the king interfering with the church when it suited his own purposes however she said nothing edward went on and it would do your cause harm the church would be so outraged that every cleric in the land would oppose our ruling regardless of its merits there might be something in that she judged but he was not as powerless as he pretended i know you will remember the wronged nuns of kingsbridge she said when you appoint the new bishop of kingsbridge please tell him our story of course said the king but caris had the feeling he would forget the interview seemed to be over but then william said your majesty now that you have graciously confirmed my elevation to my fathers earldom there is the question of who is to be lord of caster ah yes our son the prince of wales suggests sir ralph fitzgerald who was knighted yesterday for saving his life caris murmured oh no the king did not hear her but william did and he obviously felt the same way he was not quite able to hide his indignation as he said ralph was an outlaw guilty of numerous thefts murders and rapes until he obtained a royal pardon by joining your majestys army the king was not as moved by this as caris expected he said all the same ralph has fought with us for seven years now he has earned a second chance indeed he has william said diplomatically but given the trouble weve had with him in the past id like to see him settle down peacefully for a year of two before hes ennobled well you will be his overlord so youll have to deal with him edward granted we wont impose him on you against your will however the prince is keen that he should have some further reward the king thought for a few moments then said dont you have a cousin who is eligible for marriage yes matilda said william we call her tilly caris knew tilly she was at the nunnery school thats right said edward she was your father rolands ward her father had three villages near shiring your majesty has a good memory for detail marry lady matilda to ralph and give him her fathers villages said the king caris was appalled but shes only twelve she burst out william said to her hush king edward turned a cold gaze on her the children of the nobility must grow up fast sister queen philippa was fourteen when i married her caris knew she should shut up but she could not tilly was only four years older than the daughter she might have had if she had given birth to merthins baby theres a big difference between twelve and fourteen she said desperately the young king became even more frosty in the royal presence people give their opinions only when asked and the king almost never asks for the opinions of women caris realized she had taken the wrong tack her objection to the marriage was not based on tillys age so much as ralphs character i know tilly she said you cant marry her to that brute ralph mair said in a scared whisper caris remember who youre speaking to edward looked at william take her away shiring before she says something that cannot be overlooked william took cariss arm and firmly marched her out of the royal presence mair followed behind them caris heard the king say i can see how she survived in normandy the locals must have been terrified of her the noblemen around him laughed you must be mad william hissed must i caris said they were out of earshot of the king now and she raised her voice in the last six weeks the king has caused the deaths of thousands of men women and children and burned their crops and their homes and i have tried to save a twelveyearold girl from being married to a murderer tell me again lord william which of us is mad in the year the peasants of wigleigh suffered a poor harvest the villagers did what they always did in such times they ate less food postponed the purchase of hats and belts and slept closer together for warmth old widow huberts died earlier than expected janey jones succumbed to a cough that she might have survived in a good year and joanna davids new baby who might otherwise have had a chance failed to make it to his first birthday gwenda kept an anxious eye on her two little boys sam the eightyearold was big for his age and strong he had wulfrics physique people said though gwenda knew that in truth he was like his real father ralph fitzgerald even so sam was visibly thinner by december david named after wulfrics brother who had died when the bridge collapsed was six he resembled gwenda being small and dark the poor diet had weakened him and all through the autumn he suffered minor ailments a cold then a skin rash then a cough all the same she took the boys with her when she went with wulfric to finish sowing the winter wheat on perkins land a bitterly cold wind swept across the open fields she dropped seeds into the furrows and sam and david chased off the daring birds who tried to snatch the corn before wulfric turned the earth over as they ran and jumped and shouted gwenda marvelled that these two fully functioning miniature human beings had come from inside her body they turned the chasing of the birds into some kind of competitive game and she delighted in the miracle of their imagination once part of her they were now able to have thoughts she did not know about mud clung to their feet as they tramped up and down a fastrunning stream bordered the big field and on the far bank stood the fulling mill merthin had built nine years ago the distant rumble of its pounding wooden hammers accompanied their work the mill was run by two eccentric brothers jack and eli both unmarried men with no land and an apprentice boy who was their nephew they were the only villagers who had not suffered on account of the bad harvest mark webber paid them the same wages all winter long it was a short midwinter day gwenda and her family finished sowing just as the grey sky began to darken and the twilight gathered mistily in the distant woods they were all tired there was half a sack of seed left over so they took it to perkins house as they approached the place they saw perkin himself coming from the opposite direction he was walking beside a cart on which his daughter annet was riding they had been to kingsbridge to sell the last of the years apples and pears from perkins trees annet still retained her girlish figure although she was now twentyeight and had had a child she called attention to her youthfulness with a dress that was a little too short and a hair style that was charmingly disarrayed she looked silly gwenda thought her opinion was shared by every woman in the village and none of the men gwenda was shocked to see that perkins cart was full of fruit what happened she said perkins face was grim kingsbridge folk are having a hard winter just like us he said theyve no money to buy apples we shall have to make cider with this lot that was bad news gwenda had never known perkin to come home from the market with so much unsold produce annet seemed unworried she held out a hand to wulfric who helped her down from the cart as she stepped to the ground she stumbled and fell against him with her hand on his chest oops she said and smiled at him as she recovered her balance wulfric flushed with pleasure you blind idiot gwenda thought they went inside perkin sat at the table and his wife peg brought him a bowl of pottage he cut a thick slice from the loaf on the board peg served her own family next annet her husband billy howard annets brother rob and robs wife she gave a little to annets fouryearold daughter amabel and to robs two small boys then she invited wulfric and his family to sit down gwenda spooned up the broth hungrily it was thicker than the pottage she made peg was putting stale bread in whereas in gwendas house the bread never lasted long enough to go stale perkins family got cups of ale but gwenda and wulfric were not offered any hospitality went only so far in hard times perkin was jocular with his customers but otherwise a sourpuss and the atmosphere in his house was always more or less dismal he talked in a disheartened way about the kingsbridge market most of the traders had had a bad day the only ones doing any business were those who sold essentials such as corn meat and salt no one was buying the nowfamous kingsbridge scarlet cloth peg lit a lamp gwenda wanted to go home but she and wulfric were waiting for their wages the boys began to misbehave running around the room and bumping into adults its getting near their bed time said gwenda though it was not really at last wulfric said if youll give us our wages perkin well leave i havent got any money perkin said gwenda stared at him he had never said anything like this in the nine years she and wulfric had been working for him wulfric said we must have our wages weve got to eat youve had some pottage havent you perkin said gwenda was outraged we work for money not pottage well i havent got any money perkin repeated i went to market to sell my apples but no one bought them so ive got more apples than we can eat and no money gwenda was so shocked that she did not know what to say it had never occurred to her that perkin might not pay them she felt a stab of fear as she realized there was nothing she could do about it wulfric said slowly well whats to be done about it shall we go to the long field and take the seeds back out of the ground ill have to owe you this weeks wages perkin said ill pay you when things get better and next week i wont have any money next week either where do you think its to come from gwenda said well go to mark webber perhaps he can employ us at the fulling mill perkin shook his head i spoke to him yesterday in kingsbridge and asked if he could hire you he said no hes not selling enough cloth hell continue to employ jack and eli and the boy and stockpile the cloth until trade picks up but he cant take on any extra hands wulfric was bewildered how are we to live how will you get your spring ploughing done you can work for food perkin offered wulfric looked at gwenda she choked back a scornful retort she and her family were in deep trouble and this was not the moment to antagonize anyone she thought fast they did not have much choice eat or starve well work for food and youll owe us the money she said perkin shook his head what youre suggesting may be fair it is fair all right it is fair but just the same i cant do it i dont know when ill have the money why i could owe you a pound come whitsun you can work for food or not at all youll have to feed all four of us yes but only wulfric will work i dont know a family wants more than food children need clothes a man must have boots if you cant pay me i will have to find some other way of providing such things how i dont know she paused the truth was she had no idea she fought down panic i may have to ask my father how he manages peg put in i wouldnt do that if i were you joby will tell you to steal gwenda was stung what right did peg have to take a supercilious attitude joby had never employed people then told them at the end of the week that he could not pay them but she bit her tongue and said mildly he fed me through eighteen winters even if he did sell me to outlaws at the end peg tossed her head and abruptly began to pick up the bowls from the table wulfric said we should go gwenda did not move whatever advantages she could gain had to be won now when she left this house perkin would consider that a bargain had been struck and could not be renegotiated she thought hard remembering how peggy had given ale only to her own family she said you wont fob us off with stale fish and watery beer youll feed us exactly the same as yourself and your family meat bread ale whatever it may be peg made a deprecating noise she had been planning to do just what gwenda feared it seemed gwenda added that is if you want wulfric to do the same work as you and rob they all knew perfectly well that wulfric did more work than rob and twice as much as perkin all right perkin said and this is strictly an emergency arrangement as soon as you get money you have to start paying us again at the old rate a penny a day each yes there was a short silence wulfric said is that it i think so gwenda said you and perkin should shake hands on the bargain they shook hands taking their children gwenda and wulfric left it was now full dark clouds hid the stars and they had to make their way by the glimmer of light shining through cracks in shutters and around doors fortunately they had walked from perkins house to their own a thousand times before wulfric lit a lamp and built up the fire while gwenda put the boys to bed although there were bedrooms upstairs they were still living in the large house that had been occupied by wulfrics parents nevertheless they all slept in the kitchen for warmth gwenda felt depressed as she wrapped the boys in blankets and settled them near the fire she had grown up determined not to live the way her mother did in constant worry and want she had aspired to independence a patch of land a hardworking husband a reasonable lord wulfric yearned to get back the land his father had farmed in all those aspirations they had failed she was a pauper and her husband a landless labourer whose employer could not even pay him a penny a day she had ended up exactly like her mother she thought and she felt too bitter for tears wulfric took a pottery bottle from a shelf and poured ale into a wooden cup enjoy it gwenda said sourly you wont be able to buy your own ale for a while wulfric said conversationally its amazing that perkin has no money hes the richest man in the village apart from nathan reeve perkin has money gwenda said theres a jar of silver pennies under his fireplace ive seen it then why wont he pay us he doesnt want to dip into his savings wulfric was taken aback but he could pay us if he wanted to of course then why am i going to work for food gwenda let out an impatient grunt wulfric was so slow on the uptake because the alternative was no work at all wulfric was feeling that they had been hoodwinked we should have insisted on payment then why didnt you i didnt know about the jar of pennies under the fireplace for gods sake do you think a man as rich as perkin can be impoverished by failing to sell one cartload of apples hes been the largest landholder in wigleigh ever since he got hold of your fathers acres ten years ago of course he has savings yes i see that she stared into the fire while he finished the ale then they went to bed he put his arms around her and she rested her head on his chest but she did not want to make love she was too angry she told herself she should not take it out on her husband perkin had let them down not wulfric but she was angry with wulfric furious as she sensed him drifting off to sleep she realized that her anger was not about their wages that was the kind of misfortune that afflicted everyone from time to time like bad weather and barley mould what then she recalled the way annet had fallen against wulfric as she stepped down from the cart when she remembered annets coquettish smile and wulfrics flush of pleasure she wanted to slap his face im angry with you she thought because that worthless emptyheaded flirt can still make you look such a damn fool on the sunday before christmas a manor court was held in the church after the service it was cold and the villagers huddled together wrapped in cloaks and blankets nathan reeve was in charge the lord of the manor ralph fitzgerald had not been seen in wigleigh for years so much the better gwenda thought besides he was sir ralph now with three other villages in his fiefdom so he would not take much interest in ox teams and cow pasture alfred shorthouse had died during the week he was a childless widower with ten acres he has no natural heirs said nate reeve perkin is willing to take over his land gwenda was surprised how could perkin think of taking on more land she was too startled to respond immediately and aaron appletree the bagpipe player spoke first alfred has been in poor health since the summer he said hes done no autumn ploughing and sown no winter wheat all the work is to be done perkin will have his hands full nate said aggressively are you asking for the land yourself aaron shook his head in a few more years when my boys are big enough to help ill jump at such a chance he said i couldnt handle it now i can manage it perkin said gwenda frowned nate obviously wanted perkin to have the land no doubt a bribe had been promised she had known all along that perkin had money but she had little interest in exposing perkins duplicity she was thinking of how she could exploit this situation to her advantage and get her family out of poverty nate said you could take on another labourer perkin wait a minute gwenda said perkin cant pay the labourers hes got now how can he take on more land perkin was taken aback but he could hardly deny what gwenda was saying so he remained silent nate said well who else can cope with it gwenda said quickly well take it nate looked surprised she added quickly wulfric is working for food i have no work we need land she noticed several nodding heads no one in the village liked what perkin had done they all feared that one day they might end up in the same situation nate saw the danger of his plan going awry you cant afford the entry fee he said well pay it a little at a time nate shook his head i want a tenant who can pay right away he looked around the assembled villagers however no one volunteered david johns david was a middleaged man whose sons had land of their own i would have said yes a year ago he said but the rain at harvest time knocked me back the offer of an extra ten acres would normally have had the more ambitious villagers fighting among themselves but it was a bad year gwenda and wulfric were different for one thing wulfric had never ceased to long for land of his own alfreds acres were not wulfrics birthright but they were better than nothing anyway gwenda and wulfric were desperate aaron appletree said give it to wulfric nate hes a hard worker hell get the ploughing done in time and he and his wife deserve some good luck theyve had more than their fair share of bad nate looked badtempered but there was a loud rumble of assent from the peasants wulfric and gwenda were well respected despite their poverty this was a rare combination of circumstances that could get gwenda and her family started on the road to a better life and she felt growing excitement as it began to seem possible but nate was still looking dubious sir ralph hates wulfric he said wulfrics hand went to his cheek and he touched the scar made by ralphs sword i know said gwenda but ralphs not here when earl roland died the day after the battle of crécy several people moved a step up the ladder his elder son william became the earl overlord of the county of shiring answerable to the king a cousin of williams sir edward courthose became lord of caster took over the rule of the forty villages of that fiefdom as a subtenant of the earl and moved into william and philippas old house in casterham and sir ralph fitzgerald became lord of tench for the next eighteen months none of them went home they were all too busy travelling with the king and killing french people then in the war reached a stalemate the english captured and held the valuable port city of calais but otherwise there was little to show for a decade of war except of course a great deal of booty in january ralph took possession of his new property tench was a large village with a hundred peasant families and the manor included two smaller villages nearby he also retained wigleigh which was half a days ride away ralph felt a thrill of pride as he rode through tench he had looked forward to this moment the serfs bowed and their children stared he was lord of every person and owner of every object in the place the house was set in a compound riding in followed by a cart loaded with french loot ralph saw immediately that the defensive walls had long ago fallen into disrepair he wondered whether he should restore them the burgers of normandy had neglected their defences by and large and that had made it relatively easy for edward iii to overrun them on the other hand the likelihood of an invasion of southern england was now very small early in the war most of the french fleet had been wiped out at the port of sluys and thereafter the english had controlled the sea channel that separated the two countries apart from minor raids by freelance pirates every battle since sluys had been fought on french soil on balance it hardly seemed worthwhile to rebuild the compound walls several grooms appeared and took the horses ralph left alan fernhill to supervise the unloading and walked towards his new house he was limping his injured leg always hurt after a long ride tench hall was a stonebuilt manor house it was impressive he noted with satisfaction though it needed repairs not surprisingly for it had remained unoccupied since lady matildas father died however it was modern in design in oldfashioned houses the lords private chamber was an afterthought stuck on to the end of the allimportant great hall but ralph could see from the outside that here the domestic apartments took up half the building he entered the hall and was annoyed to find earl william there at the far end of the room was a large chair made of dark wood elaborately carved with powerful symbols angels and lions on the back and arms snakes and monsters on the legs it was obviously the chair of the lord of the manor but william was sitting in it much of ralphs pleasure evaporated he could not enjoy his mastery of the new manor under the scrutiny of his own overlord it would be like going to bed with a woman while her husband listened outside the door he masked his displeasure and formally greeted earl william the earl introduced the man standing next to him this is daniel who has been bailiff here for twenty years and has taken good care of the place on my fathers behalf during tillys minority ralph acknowledged the bailiff stiffly williams message was clear he wanted ralph to let daniel continue in the job but daniel had been earl rolands man and now he would be earl williams ralph had no intention of letting his domain be managed by the earls man his bailiff would be loyal to him alone william waited expectantly for ralph to say something about daniel however ralph was not going to have that discussion ten years ago he would have jumped feet first into an argument but he had learned a lot in the time he had spent with the king he was not obliged to get his earls approval for his choice of bailiff so he would not seek it he would say nothing until william had gone then he would tell daniel he was being assigned to other duties both william and ralph remained stubbornly silent for a few moments then the deadlock was broken a large door opened at the domestic end of the hall and the tall elegant figure of lady philippa came in it was many years since ralph had seen her but his youthful passion returned with a shock that felt like a punch leaving him breathless she was older she had to be forty he guessed but she was in her prime perhaps she was a little heavier than he remembered her hips more rounded her breasts fuller but that only added to her allure she still walked like a queen as always the sight of her made him ask resentfully why he could not have a wife like that in the past she had barely deigned to notice his presence but today she smiled and shook his hand and said are you getting to know daniel she too wanted him to continue to employ the earls retainer that was why she was being courteous all the more reason to get rid of the man he thought with secret relish ive just arrived he said noncommittally philippa explained their presence we wanted to be here when you met young tilly shes part of our family ralph had commanded the nuns of kingsbridge priory to bring his fiancee here to meet him today interfering busybodies the nuns had obviously told earl william what was happening lady matilda was the ward of earl roland rest his soul ralph said emphasizing that the wardship had ended with rolands death yes and i would have expected the king to transfer her wardship to my husband as rolands heir clearly philippa would have preferred that but he did not ralph said he gave her to me to wed although no ceremony had yet taken place the girl had immediately become ralphs responsibility strictly speaking william and philippa had no business to invite themselves here today as if playing the role of tillys parents but william was ralphs overlord so he could visit whenever he pleased ralph did not want to quarrel with william it was too easy for william to make ralphs life difficult on the other hand the new earl was overreaching his authority here probably under pressure from his wife but ralph was not going to be bullied the last seven years had given him the confidence to defend such independence as he was entitled to anyway he was enjoying crossing swords with philippa it gave him an excuse to stare at her he rested his gaze on the assertive line of her jaw and the fullness of her lips despite her hauteur she was forced to engage with him this was the longest conversation he had ever had with her tilly is very young said philippa she will be fourteen this year ralph said thats the age our queen was when she married our king as the king himself pointed out to me and to earl william after the battle of crécy the aftermath of a battle is not necessarily the best moment to decide the fate of a young girl philippa said in a lowered voice ralph was not going to let that pass speaking for myself i feel obliged to comply with the decisions of his majesty as do we all she muttered ralph felt he had vanquished her it was a sexual feeling almost as if he had lain with her satisfied he turned to daniel my wifetobe should arrive in time for dinner he said make sure we have a feast philippa said i have already seen to that ralph slowly turned his head until his eyes were on her again she had overstepped the bounds of courtesy by going into his kitchen and giving orders she knew it and reddened i didnt know what time you would get here she said ralph said nothing she would not apologize but he was content in having forced her to explain herself a climbdown for a woman as proud as she for a short while there had been the noise of horses outside and now ralphs parents came in he had not seen them for some years and he hurried to embrace them they were both in their fifties but his mother had aged faster it seemed to him her hair was white and her face was lined she had the slight stoop of elderly women his father seemed more vigorous it was partly the excitement of the moment he was flushed with pride and shook ralphs hand as if pumping water from a well but there was no grey in his red beard and his slim figure still appeared spry they were both wearing new clothes ralph had sent the money sir gerald had a heavy wool surcoat and lady maud a fur cloak ralph snapped his fingers at daniel bring wine he said for an instant the bailiff looked as though he might protest at being treated like a maidservant then he swallowed his pride and hurried off to the kitchen ralph said earl william lady philippa may i present my father sir gerald and my mother lady maud he was afraid that william and philippa would look down their noses at his parents but they acknowledged them courteously enough gerald said to william i was a comradeinarms of your father may he rest in peace in fact earl william i knew you as a boy though you wont remember me ralph wished his father would not call attention to his glorious past it only emphasized how far he had fallen but william seemed not to notice well dyou know i think i do remember he said he was probably just being kind but gerald was pleased of course william added i recall you as a giant at least seven feet tall gerald who was short in stature laughed delightedly maud looked around and said my this is a fine house ralph i wanted to decorate it with all theeasures ive brought back from france he said but ive only just got here a kitchen girl brought a jug of wine and goblets on a tray and they all took some refreshment the wine was good bordeaux ralph noticed clear and sweet due credit to daniel for keeping the house well supplied he thought at first then he reflected that for many years no one had been here to drink it except of course daniel he said to his mother any news of my brother merthin hes doing very well she said proudly married with a daughter and rich hes building a palace for the family of buonaventura caroli but they havent made him a conte yet i suppose ralph pretended to be joking but he was pointing out that merthin for all his success had not gained a noble title and that it was he ralph who had fulfilled their fathers hopes by taking the family back into the nobility not yet said his father gaily as if it were a real possibility that merthin might become an italian count which annoyed ralph but only momentarily his mother said could we see our rooms ralph hesitated what did she mean by our rooms the dreadful thought crossed his mind that his parents might think they were going to live here he could not have that they would be a constant reminder of the familys years of shame besides they would cramp his style on the other hand he now realized it was also shameful for a nobleman to let his parents live in a oneroom house as pensioners of a priory he would have to think more about that for now he said i havent had a chance to look at the private quarters myself yet i hope i can make you comfortable for a few nights a few nights his mother said quickly are you going to send us back to our hovel in kingsbridge ralph was mortified that she should mention that in front of william and philippa i dont think theres room for you to live here how do you know if you havent yet looked at the chambers daniel interrupted theres a villager here from wigleigh sir ralph name of perkin wants to pay his respects and discuss an urgent matter ralph would normally have told the man off for butting into a conversation but on this occasion he was grateful for the diversion have a look at the rooms mother he said ill deal with this peasant william and philippa went off with his parents to inspect the domestic quarters and daniel brought perkin to the table perkin was as obsequious as ever so happy to see your lordship safe and whole after the french wars he said ralph looked at his left hand with three fingers missing well almost whole he said all the people of wigleigh are sorry for your wounds lord but the rewards a knighthood and three more villages and lady matilda to wed thank you for your felicitations but what was the urgent matter you needed to discuss lord it doesnt take long to tell alfred shorthouse died without a natural heir to his ten acres and i offered to take on the land even though times have been very hard after this years thunderstorms in august never mind the weather of course in brief nathan reeve made a decision that i feel you would not approve ralph felt impatient he really did not care which peasant farmed alfreds ten acres whatever nathan decided he gave the land to wulfric ah some of the villagers said wulfric deserved it as he had no land but he cant pay the entry fee and anyway you dont need to convince me ralph said i will not allow that troublemaker to hold land in my territory thank you lord shall i tell nathan reeve that you wish me to have the ten acres yes ralph said he saw the earl and countess emerge from the private quarters with his parents in tow ill be there to confirm it in person within the next two weeks he dismissed perkin with a wave at that moment lady matilda arrived she entered the hall with a nun on either side of her one was merthins old girlfriend caris who had tried to tell the king that tilly was too young to marry on the other side was the nun who had travelled to crécy with caris an angelfaced woman whose name ralph did not know behind them presumably acting as their bodyguard was the onearmed monk who had captured ralph so cleverly nine years ago brother thomas and in the centre was tilly ralph saw immediately why the nuns wanted to protect her from marriage her face had a look of childish innocence she had freckles on her nose and a gap between her two front teeth she stared about her with frightened eyes caris had heightened the childish look by dressing her in a plain white nuns robe and a simple cap but the clothing failed to hide the womanly curves of the body underneath caris had obviously wanted to make tilly seem too young for wedlock the effect on ralph was the opposite of what was intended one of the things ralph had learned in the kings service was that in many situations a man could take charge simply by speaking first he said loudly come here tilly the girl stepped forward and came to him her escort hesitated then stayed where they were i am your husband ralph said to her my name is sir ralph fitzgerald lord of tench she looked terrified im happy to meet you sir this is your home now as it was when you were a child and your father was lord here you are now the lady of tench as your mother once was are you happy to be back in your family home yes lord she looked anything but happy im sure the nuns have told you that you must be an obedient wife and do all you can to please your husband who is your lord and master yes lord and here are my mother and father who are your parents too now she made a little curtsey to gerald and maud ralph said come here he held out his hands automatically tilly reached out then she saw his maimed left hand she made a disgusted sound and flinched back an angry curse came to ralphs lips but he suppressed it with some difficulty he forced himself to speak in a light tone of voice dont be afraid of my wounded hand he said you should be proud of it i lost those fingers in the service of the king he kept both arms stretched out expectantly with an effort she took his hands now you can kiss me tilly he was seated and she was standing in front of him she leaned forward and offered her cheek he put his wounded hand at the back of her head and turned her face then he kissed her lips he sensed her uncertainty and guessed that she had not been kissed by a man before he let his mouth linger on hers partly because it was so sweet and partly to enrage those watching then with slow deliberation he pressed his good hand against her chest and felt her breasts they were full and round she was no child he released her and sighed with satisfaction we must get married soon he said he turned to caris who was visibly suppressing anger in kingsbridge cathedral four weeks from sunday he said he looked at philippa but addressed william as were getting married by the express wish of his majesty king edward i would be honoured if you would attend earl william william nodded curtly caris spoke for the first time sir ralph the prior of kingsbridge sends you greetings and says he will be honoured to perform the ceremony unless of course the new bishop wishes to do so ralph nodded graciously she then added but those of us who have had charge of this child believe she is still too young to live with her husband conjugally philippa said i concur ralphs father spoke you know son i waited years to marry your mother ralph did not want to hear that story all over again unlike you father i have been ordered by the king to marry lady matilda his mother said perhaps you should wait son i have waited more than a year she was twelve when the king gave her to me caris said marry the child yes with all due ceremony but then let her return to the nunnery for a year let her grow folly into her womanhood then bring her to your home ralph snorted scornfully i could be dead in a year especially if the king decides to go back to france meanwhile the fitzgeralds need an heir she is a child ralph interrupted raising his voice she is no child look at her that stupid nuns habit cant disguise her breasts puppy fat does she have a womans hair ralph demanded tilly gasped at his crude frankness and her cheeks reddened with shame caris hesitated ralph said perhaps my mother should examine her on my behalf and tell me caris shook her head that wont be necessary tilly has hair where a woman has it and a child does not i knew as much i have seen ralph stopped realizing that he did not want everyone here to know in what circumstances he had seen the naked bodies of girls of tillys age i guessed from her figure he amended avoiding his mothers eye a rarely heard pleading tone entered cariss voice but ralph in her mind she is still a child i dont care about her mind ralph thought but he did not say so she has four weeks to learn what she does not know he said he gave caris a knowing look im sure you can teach her everything caris flushed nuns were not supposed to know about marital intimacy of course but she had been his brothers girlfriend his mother said perhaps a compromise you just dont understand mother do you he said rudely interrupting her no one is really concerned about her age if i were going to marry the daughter of a kingsbridge butcher they wouldnt care if she was nine its because tilly is nobleborn dont you see that they think theyre superior to us he knew he was shouting and he could see the amazed expressions of everyone around him but he did not care they dont want a cousin of the earl of shiring to marry the son of an impoverished knight they want to put off the marriage in the hope that ill be killed in battle before its consummated he wiped his mouth but this son of an impoverished knight fought at the battle of crécy and saved the life of the prince of wales thats what matters to the king he looked at each of them in turn haughty william scornful philippa furious caris and his astonished parents so you might as well accept the facts ralph fitzgerald is a knight and a lord and a comradeinarms of the king and hes going to marry lady matilda the cousin of the earl whether you like it or not there was a shocked silence for several moments at last ralph turned to daniel you can serve dinner now he said in the spring of merthin woke up as if from a nightmare he could not quite remember he felt frightened and weak he opened his eyes to a room lit by bars of bright sunshine coming through halfopen shutters he saw a high ceiling white walls red tiles the air was mild reality returned slowly he was in his bedroom in his house in florence he had been ill the illness came back to him first it had begun with a skin rash purplishblack blotches on his chest then his arms then everywhere soon afterwards he developed a painful lump or bubo in his armpit he had a fever sweating in his bed tangling the sheets as he writhed he had vomited and coughed blood he had thought he would die worst of all was a terrible unquenchable thirst that had made him want to throw himself into the river arno with his mouth open he was not the only sufferer thousands of italians had fallen ill with this plague tens of thousands half the workmen on his building sites had disappeared as had most of his household servants almost everyone who caught it died within five days they called it la moria grande the big death but he was alive he had a nagging feeling that while ill he had reached a momentous decision but he could not remember it he concentrated for a moment the harder he thought the more elusive the memory became until it vanished he sat up in bed his limbs felt feeble and his head spun for a moment he was wearing a clean linen nightshirt and he wondered who had put it on him after a pause he stood he had a fourstorey house with a courtyard he had designed and built it himself with a flat façade instead of the traditional overhanging floors and architectural features such as round window arches and classical columns the neighbours had called it a palagetto a minipalace that was seven years ago several prosperous florentine merchants had asked him to build palagetti for them and that had got his career here started florence was a republic with no ruling prince or duke dominated by an elite of squabbling merchant families the city was populated by thousands of weavers but it was the merchants who made fortunes they spent their money building grand houses which made the city a perfect place for a talented young architect to prosper he went to the bedroom door and called his wife silvia where are you it came naturally to him to speak the tuscan dialect now after nine years then he remembered silvia had been ill too so had their daughter who was three years old her name was laura but they had adopted her childish pronunciation lolla his heart was gripped by a terrible fear was silvia alive was lolla the house was quiet so was the city he realized suddenly the angle of the sunlight slanting into the rooms told him it was midmorning he should have been hearing the cries of street hawkers the clop of horses and the rumble of wooden cartwheels the background murmur of a thousand conversations but there was nothing he went up the stairs in his weakness the effort made him breathless he pushed open the door to the nursery the room looked empty he broke out in a sweat of fear there was lollas cot a small chest for her clothes a box of toys a miniature table with two tiny chairs then he heard a noise there in the corner was lolla sitting on the floor in a clean dress playing with a small wooden horse with articulated legs merthin gave a strangled cry of relief she heard him and looked up papa she observed in a matteroffact tone merthin picked her up and hugged her youre alive he said in english there was a sound from the next room and maria walked in a greyhaired woman in her fifties she was lollas nurse master she said you got up are you better where is your mistress he said marias face fell im so sorry master she said the mistress died lolla said mamas gone merthin felt the shock like a blow stunned he handed lolla to maria moving slowly and carefully he turned away and walked out of the room then down the stairs to the piano nobile the principal floor he stared at the long table the empty chairs the rugs on the floor and the pictures on the walls it looked like someone elses home he stood in front of a painting of the virgin mary with her mother italian painters were superior to the english or any others and this artist had given saint anne the face of silvia she was a proud beauty with flawless olive skin and noble features but the painter had seen the sexual passion smouldering in those aloof brown eyes it was hard to comprehend that silvia no longer existed he thought of her slim body and remembered how he had marvelled again and again at her perfect breasts that body with which he had been so completely intimate now lay in the ground somewhere when he imagined that tears came to his eyes at last and he sobbed with grief where was her grave he wondered in his misery he remembered that funerals had ceased in florence people were terrified to leave their houses they simply dragged the bodies outside and laid them on the street the citys thieves beggars and drunks had acquired a new profession they were called corpse carriers or becchini and they charged exorbitant fees to take the bodies away and put them in mass graves merthin might never know where silvia lay they had been married four years looking at her picture garbed in saint annes conventional red dress merthin suffered an access of painful honesty and asked himself whether he had really loved her he was very fond of her but it was not an allconsuming passion she had an independent spirit and a sharp tongue and he was the only man in florence with the nerve to woo her despite her fathers wealth in return she had given him complete devotion but she had accurately gauged the quality of his love what are you thinking about she used to say sometimes and he would give a guilty start because he had been remembering kingsbridge soon she changed it to who are you thinking about he never spoke cariss name but silvia said it must be a woman i can tell by the look on your face eventually she began to talk about your english girl she would say youre remembering your english girl and she was always right but she seemed to accept it merthin was faithful to her and he adored lolla after a while maria brought him soup and bread what day is it he asked her tuesday how long was i in bed two weeks you were so ill he wondered why he had survived some people never succumbed to the disease as if they had natural protection but those who caught it nearly always died however the tiny minority who recovered were doubly fortunate for no one had ever caught the illness a second time when he had eaten he felt stronger he had to rebuild his life he realized he suspected that he had already made this decision once when he was ill but again he was tantalized by the thread of a memory slipping from his grasp his first task was to find out how much of his family was left he took his dishes to the kitchen where maria was feeding lolla bread dipped in goats milk he asked her what about silvias parents are they alive i dont know she said i havent heard i go out only to buy food id better find out he got dressed and went downstairs the ground floor of the house was a workshop with the yard at the rear used for storing wood and stone no one was at work either inside or out he left the house the buildings around him were mostly stonebuilt some of them very grand kingsbridge had no houses to compare with these the richest man in kingsbridge edmund wooler had lived in a timber house here in florence only the poor lived in such places the street was deserted he had never seen it this way not even in the middle of the night the effect was eerie he wondered how many people had died a third of the population half were their ghosts still lingering in alleyways and shadowed corners enviously watching the lucky survivors the christi house was on the next street merthins fatherinlaw alessandro christi had been his first and best friend in florence a schoolmate of buonaventura caroli alessandro had given merthin his first commission a simple warehouse building he was of course lollas grandpa the door of alessandros palagetto was locked that was unusual in itself merthin banged on the woodwork and waited eventually it was opened by elizabetta a small plump woman who was alessandros laundress she stared at him in shock youre alive she said hello betta he said im glad to see that youre alive too she turned and called back into the house its the english lord he had told them he was not a lord but the servants did not believe him he stepped inside alessandro he said she shook her head and began to cry and your mistress both dead the stairs led from the entrance hall to the main floor merthin walked up slowly surprised by how weak he still felt in the main room he sat down to catch his breath alessandro had been wealthy and the room was a showplace of rugs and hangings paintings and jewelled ornaments and books who else is here he asked elizabetta just lena and her children lena was an asiatic slave unusual but by no means unique in prosperous florentine households she had two small children by alessandro a boy and a girl and he had treated them just like his legitimate offspring in fact silvia had said acidly that he doted on them more than he ever had on her and her brother the arrangement was considered eccentric rather than scandalous by the sophisticated florentines merthin said what about signor gianni gianni was silvias brother dead and his wife the baby is here with me dear god betta said tentatively and your family lord my wife is dead i am so sorry but lolla is alive thank god maria is taking care of her maria is a good woman would you like some refreshment merthin nodded and she went away lenas children came to stare at him a darkeyed boy of seven who looked like alessandro and a pretty fouryearold with her mothers asiatic eyes then lena herself came in a beautiful woman in her twenties with golden skin and high cheekbones she brought him a silver goblet of dark red tuscan wine and a tray of almonds and olives she said will you come to live here lord merthin was surprised i dont think so why the house is yours now she waved a hand to indicate the christi familys wealth everything is yours merthin realized she was right he was alessandro christis only surviving adult relative that made him the heir and the guardian of three children in addition to lolla everything lena repeated giving him a direct look merthin met her candid gaze and realized that she was offering herself he considered the prospect the house was beautiful it was home to lenas children and a familiar place to lolla and even to giannis baby all the children would be happy here he bad inherited enough money to live on for the rest of his life lena was a woman of intelligence and experience and he could readily imagine the pleasures of becoming intimate with her she read his mind she took his hand and pressed it to her bosom her breasts felt soft and warm through the light wool dress but this was not what he wanted he drew lenas hand to him and kissed it i will provide for you and your children he said dont worry thank you lord she said but she looked disappointed and something in her eyes told merthin that her offer had not been merely practical she had genuinely hoped he might be more to her than just her new owner but that was part of the problem he could not imagine sex with someone he owned the idea was distasteful to the point of revulsion he sipped his wine and felt stronger if he was not drawn to an easy life of luxury and sensual gratification what did he want his family was almost gone only lolla was left but he still had his work around the city were three sites where designs of his were under construction he was not going to give up the job he loved he had not survived the great death to become an idler he recalled his youthful ambition to build the tallest building in england he would pick up where he had left off he would recover from the loss of silvia by throwing himself into his building projects he got up to leave lena flung her arms around him thank you she said thank you for saying you will take care of my children he patted her back they are alessandros grandchildren he said in florence the children of slaves were not themselves enslaved when they grow up they will be rich he detached her arms gently and went down the stairs all the houses were locked and shuttered on some doorsteps he saw a shrouded form that he presumed was a dead body there were a few people on the streets but mostly the poorer sort the desolation was unnerving florence was the greatest city in the christian world a noisy commercial metropolis producing thousands of yards of fine woollen cloth every day a market where vast sums of money were paid over on no more security than a letter from antwerp or the verbal promise of a prince walking through these silent empty streets was like seeing an injured horse that has fallen and cannot get up immense strength was suddenly brought to nothing he saw no one from his circle of acquaintance his friends were keeping indoors he presumed those that were still alive he went first to a square nearby in the old roman city where he was building a fountain for the municipality he had devised an elaborate system to recycle almost all the water during florences long dry summers but when he reached the square he could see immediately that no one was working on the site the underground pipes had been put in and covered over before he fell ill and the first course of masonry for the stepped plinth around the pool had been laid however the dusty neglected look of the stones told him that no work had been done for days worse a small pyramid of mortar on a wooden board had hardened into a solid mass that gave off a puff of dust when he kicked it there were even some tools lying on the ground it was a miracle they had not been stolen the fountain was going to be stunning in merthins workshop the best stone carver in the city was sculpting the centrepiece or had been merthin was disappointed that work had stopped surely not all the builders had died perhaps they were waiting to see whether merthin would recover this was the smallest of his three projects albeit a prestigious one he left the square and headed north to inspect another one but as he walked he worried he had not yet met anyone knowledgeable enough to give him a wider perspective what was left of the city government was the plague easing off or getting worse what about the rest of italy one thing at a time he told himself he was building a home for giulielmo caroli the older brother of buonaventura it was to be a real palazzo a high doublefronted house designed around a grand staircase wider than some of the citys streets the ground floor wall was already up the façade was battered or inclined at ground level the slight protrusion giving an impression of fortification but above were elegant pointedarch twolight windows with a trefoil the design said that the people inside were both powerful and refined which was what the caroli family wanted the scaffolding had been erected for the second floor but no one was working there should have been five masons laying stones the only person on site was an elderly man who acted as caretaker and lived in a wooden hut at the back merthin found him cooking a chicken over a fire the fool had used costly marble slabs for his hearth where is everyone merthin said abruptly the caretaker leaped to his feet signor caroli died and his son agostino wouldnt pay the men so they left those that werent already dead themselves that was a blow the caroli family was one of the richest in florence if they felt they could no longer afford to build the crisis was severe indeed so agostino is alive yes master i saw him this morning merthin knew young agostino he was not as clever as his father or his uncle buonaventura so he compensated by being extremely cautious and conservative he would not recommence building until he was sure the family finances had recovered from the effects of the plague however merthin felt confident his third and largest project would continue he was building a church for an order of friars much favoured by the citys merchants the site was south of the river so he crossed the new bridge this bridge had been finished only two years ago in fact merthin had done some work on it under the leading designer the painter taddeo gaddi the bridge had to withstand fastflowing water when the winter snows melted and merthin had helped with the design of the piers now as he crossed he was dismayed to see that all the little goldsmiths shops on the bridge were closed another bad sign the church of sant anna dei frari was his most ambitious project to date it was a big church more like a cathedral the friars were rich though nothing like the cathedral at kingsbridge italy had gothic cathedrals milan being one of the greatest but modernminded italians did not like the architecture of france and england they regarded huge windows and flying buttresses as a foreign fetish the obsession with light which made sense in the gloomy northwest of europe seemed perverse in sunny italy where people sought shade and coolness italians identified with the classical architecture of ancient rome the ruins of which were all around them they liked gable ends and round arches and they rejected ornate exterior sculpture in favour of decorative patterns of differentcoloured stone and marble but merthin was going to surprise even the florentines with this church the plan was a series of squares each topped by a dome five in a row and two either side of the crossing he had heard about domes back in england but had never seen one until he visited siena cathedral there were none in florence the clerestory would be a row of round windows or oculi instead of narrow pillars that reached yearningly for heaven this church would have circles complete in themselves with the air of earthbound selfsufficiency that characterized the commercial people of florence he was disappointed but not surprised to see that there were no masons on the scaffolding no labourers moving the great stones no mortarmaking women stirring with their giant paddles this site was as quiet as the other two however in this case he felt confident he could get the project restarted a religious order had a life of its own independent of individuals he walked around the site and entered the friary the place was silent monasteries were supposed to be so of course but there was a quality to this silence that unnerved him he passed from the vestibule into the waiting room there was usually a brother on duty here studying the scriptures in between attending to visitors but today the room was empty with grim apprehension merthin went through another door and found himself in the cloisters the quadrangle was deserted hello he called out is anyone there his voice echoed around the stone arcades he searched the place all the friars were gone in the kitchen he found three men sitting at the table eating ham and drinking wine they wore the costly clothes of merchants but they had matted hair untrimmed beards and dirty hands they were paupers wearing dead mens garments when he walked in they looked guilty but defiant he said where are the holy brothers all dead said one of the men all every one they took care of the sick you see and so they caught the disease the man was drunk merthin could see however he seemed to be telling the truth these three were too comfortable sitting in the monastery eating the friars food and drinking their wine they clearly knew there was no one left to object merthin returned to the site of the new church the walls of the choir and transepts were up and the oculi in the clerestory were visible he sat in the middle of the crossing amid stacks of stones looking at his work for how long would the project be stalled if all the friars were dead who would get their money as far as he knew they were not part of a larger order the bishop might claim the inheritance and so might the pope there was a legal tangle here that could take years to resolve this morning he had resolved to throw himself into his work as a way of healing the wound of silvias death now it was clear that at least for the present he had no work ever since he began to repair the roof of st marks church in kingsbridge ten years ago he had had at least one building project on the go without one he was lost it made him feel panicky he had woken up to find his whole life in ruins the fact that he was suddenly very rich only heightened the sense of nightmare lolla was the only part of his life he had left he did not even know where to go next he would go home eventually but he could not spend all day playing with his threeyearold and talking to maria so he stayed where he was sitting on a carved stone disc intended for a column looking along what would be the nave as the sun rolled down the curve of the afternoon he began to remember his illness he had felt sure he would die so few survived that he did not expect to be among the lucky ones in his more lucid moments he had reviewed his life as if it were over he had come to some grand realization he knew but since recovering he had been unable to recall what it was now in the tranquillity of the unfinished church he recalled concluding that he had made one huge mistake in his life what was it he had quarrelled with elfric he had had sex with griselda he had rejected elizabeth clerk all these decisions had caused trouble but none counted as the mistake of a lifetime lying on the bed sweating coughing tormented by thirst he had almost wanted to die but not quite something had kept him alive and now it came back to him he had wanted to see caris again that was his reason for living in his delirium he had seen her face and had wept with grief that he might die here thousands of miles away from her the mistake of his life had been to leave her as he at last retrieved that elusive memory and realized the blinding truth of the revelation he was filled with an odd kind of happiness it did not make sense he reflected she had joined the nunnery she had refused to see him and explain herself but his soul was not rational and it was telling him that he should be where she was he wondered what she was doing now while he sat in a halfbuilt church in a city nearly destroyed by a plague the last he had heard was that she had been consecrated by the bishop that decision was irrevocable or so they said caris had never accepted what other people told her were the rules on the other hand once she had made her own decision it was generally impossible to change her mind there was no doubt she was strongly committed to her new life it made no difference he wanted to see her again not to do so would be the secondbiggest mistake of his life and now he was free his ties with florence were all broken his wife was dead and so were all his relations by marriage except for three children the only family he had here was his daughter lolla and he would take her with him she was so young he felt she would hardly notice that they had left it was a momentous move he told himself he would first have to prove alessandros will and make arrangements for the children agostino caroli would help him with that then he would have to turn his wealth into gold and arrange for it to be transferred to england the caroli family could do that too if their international network was still intact most daunting he would have to undertake the thousandmile journey from florence across europe to kingsbridge and all that without having any idea how caris would receive him when at last he arrived it was a decision that required long and careful thought obviously he made up his mind in a few moments he was going home merthin left italy in company with a dozen merchants from florence and lucca they took a ship from genoa to the ancient french port of marseilles from there they travelled overland to avignon home of the pope for the last forty years or more and the most lavish court in europe as well as the smelliest city merthin had ever known there they joined a large group of clergymen and returning pilgrims heading north everyone travelled in groups the larger the better the merchants were carrying money and expensive trading goods and they had menatarms to protect them from outlaws they were happy to have company priestly robes and pilgrim badges might deter robbers and even ordinary travellers such as merthin helped just by swelling the numbers merthin had entrusted most of his fortune to the caroli family in florence their relatives in england would give him cash the carolis carried on this kind of international transaction all the time and indeed merthin had used their services nine years ago to transfer a smaller fortune from kingsbridge to florence all the same he knew that the system was not completely infallible such families sometimes went bankrupt especially if they got involved in lending money to untrustworthy types such as kings and princes that was why he had a large sum in gold florins sewn into his undershirt lolla enjoyed the journey as the only child in the caravan she was much fussed over during the long days on horseback she sat on the saddle in front of merthin his arms holding her safe while his hands held the reins he sang songs repeated rhymes told stories and talked to her about the things they saw trees mills bridges churches she probably did not understand half of what he said but the sound of his voice kept her happy he had never before spent this much time with his daughter they were together all day every day week after week he hoped the intimacy would make up in part for the loss of her mother it certainly worked the other way around he would have been terribly lonely without her she no longer spoke about mama but every now and then she would put her arms around his neck and cling to him with desperation as if frightened to let him go he felt regret only when he stood in front of the great cathedral at chartres sixty miles outside paris there were two towers at its west end the north tower was unfinished but the south tower was three hundred and fifty feet high it reminded him that he had once yearned to design such buildings he was unlikely to achieve that ambition in kingsbridge he lingered in paris for two weeks the plague had not reached here and it was an immense relief to see the normal life of a great city with people buying and selling and walking around instead of empty streets with corpses on the doorsteps his spirits lifted and it was only then that he realized how stricken he had been by the horror he had left behind in florence he looked at pariss cathedrals and palaces making sketches of details that interested him he had a small notebook made of paper a new writing material popular in italy leaving paris he teamed up with a noble family returning to cherbourg hearing lolla talk the people assumed merthin was italian and he did not disabuse them for the english were hated passionately in northern france with the family and their entourage merthin crossed normandy at a leisurely pace with lolla on the saddle in front of him and their pack horse following on a leading rein looking at those churches and abbeys that had survived the devastation of king edwards invasion almost two years ago he could have moved faster but he told himself he was making the most of an opportunity that might not come again the chance to see a rich variety of architecture however when he was honest with himself he had to admit that he was afraid of what he might find when he reached kingsbridge he was going home to caris but she would not be the same caris he had left behind nine years ago she might have changed physically and mentally some nuns became grossly fat their only pleasure in life being food more likely caris might have become ethereally thin starving herself in an ecstasy of selfdenial by now she could be obsessed with religion praying all day and flagellating herself for imaginary sins or she might be dead those were his wildest nightmares in his heart he knew she would not be enormously fat or a religious fanatic and if she were dead he would have heard as he had heard of the death of her father edmund she was going to be the same caris small and neat quickwitted organized and determined but he was seriously concerned about how she would receive him how did she feel about him after nine years did she think of him with indifference as a part of her past too remote to care about the way he thought of say griselda or did she still long for him somewhere deep in her soul he had no idea and that was the true cause of his anxiety they sailed to portsmouth and travelled with a party of traders they left the group at mudeford crossing the traders going on to shiring while merthin and lolla forded the shallow river on horseback and took the kingsbridge road it was a pity merthin thought that there was no visible sign of the way to kingsbridge he wondered how many traders continued on to shiring simply because they did not realize that kingsbridge was nearer it was a warm summer day and the sun was shining when they came within sight of their destination the first thing he saw was the top of the cathedral tower visible over the trees at least it had not fallen down merthin thought elfrics repairs had held for eleven years it was a pity the tower could not be seen from mudeford crossing what a difference that would make to the numbers visiting the town as they came closer he began to suffer a strange mixture of excitement and fear that made him feel nauseous for a few moments he was afraid he would have to dismount and throw up he tried to make himself calm what could happen even if caris proved to have become indifferent to him he would not die he saw several new buildings on the outskirts of the suburb of newtown the splendid new home he had built for dick brewer was no longer on the edge of kingsbridge for the town had grown past it he momentarily forgot his apprehension when he saw his bridge it rose in an elegant curve from the river bank and landed gracefully on the midstream island on the far side of the island the bridge sprang again to span the second channel its white stone gleamed in the sun people and carts were crossing in both directions the sight made his heart swell with pride it was everything he had hoped it would be beautiful useful and strong i did that he thought and its good but he suffered a shock when he got closer the masonry of the nearer span was damaged around the central pier he could see cracks in the stonework repaired with iron braces in a clumsy fashion that bore the hallmark of elfric he was appalled brown dribbles of rust dripped from the nails that fixed the ugly braces in the stonework the sight took him back eleven years to elfrics repairs to the old wooden bridge everyone can make mistakes he thought but people who dont learn from their mistakes just make the same ones again bloody fools he said aloud bloody fools lolla repeated she was learning english he rode on to the bridge the roadbed had been finished properly he was happy to see and he was pleased with the design of the parapet a sturdy barrier with a carved capstone that recalled the mouldings in the cathedral leper island was still overrun with rabbits merthin continued to hold a lease on the island in his absence mark webber had been collecting rents from tenants paying the nominal rent due to the priory every year subtracting an agreed collection fee and sending the balance annually to merthin in florence via the caroli family after all the deductions it was a small sum but it grew a little every year merthins house on the island had an occupied look the shutters open the doorstep swept he had arranged for jimmie to live there the boy must now be a man he thought at the near end of the second span an old man merthin did not recognize sat in the sun collecting the tolls merthin paid him a penny the man gave him a hard stare as if trying to recall where he had seen him before but he said nothing the town was both familiar and strange because it was almost the same the changes struck merthin as miraculous as if they had happened overnight a row of hovels knocked down and replaced by fine houses a busy inn where once there had been a big gloomy house occupied by a wealthy widow a well dried up and paved over a grey house painted white he went to the bell inn on the main street next to the priory gates it was unchanged a tavern in such a good location would probably last hundreds of years he left his horses and baggage with an ostler and went inside holding hands with lolla the bell was like taverns everywhere a big front room furnished with rough tables and benches and a back area where the barrels of beer and wine were racked and food was cooked because it was popular and profitable the straw on the floor was changed frequently and the walls were freshly whitewashed and in winter a huge fire blazed now in the heat of summer all the windows were open and a mild breeze blew through the front room after a moment bessie bell came out from the back nine years ago she had been a curvy girl now she was a voluptuous woman she looked at him without recognition but he saw her appraise his clothes and judge him an affluent customer good day to you traveller she said what can we do to make you and your child comfortable merthin grinned id like to take your private room please bessie she knew him as soon as he spoke my soul she cried its merthin bridger he put out his hand to shake but she threw her arms around him and hugged him she had always had a soft spot for him she released him and studied his face such a beard youve grown i would have recognized you sooner otherwise is this your little girl her name is lolla well arent you a pretty thing your mother must be beautiful merthin said my wife died how sad but lolla is young enough to forget my husband died too i didnt know you were married i met him after you left richard brown from gloucester i lost him a year ago im sorry to hear that my fathers gone to canterbury on a pilgrimage so im running this tavern all on my own at the moment i always liked your father he was fond of you too he always takes to men with a bit of spirit he was never very keen on my richard ah merthin felt the conversation had become too intimate too fast what news of my parents theyre not here in kingsbridge theyre staying at your brothers new home in tench merthin had heard through buonaventura that ralph had become lord of tench my father must be very pleased proud as a peacock she smiled then looked concerned you must be hungry and tired ill tell the boys to take your bags upstairs then ill bring you a tankard of ale and some pottage she turned to go into the back room thats kind but bessie paused at the door if you would give lolla some soup id be grateful theres something i have to do bessie nodded of course she bent down to lolla do you want to come with auntie bessie i expect you could eat a piece of bread do you like new bread merthin translated the question into italian and lolla nodded happily bessie looked at merthin going to see sister caris are you absurdly he felt guilty yes he said shes still here then oh yes shes guest master at the nunnery now ill be surprised if she isnt prioress one day she took lollas hand and led her into the back room good luck she called over her shoulder merthin went out bessie could be a little suffocating but her affection was sincere and it warmed his heart to be welcomed back with such enthusiasm he entered the priory grounds he paused to look at the soaring west front of the cathedral almost two hundred years old now and as aweinspiring as ever he noticed a new stone building to the north of the church beyond the graveyard it was a mediumsized palace with an imposing entrance and an upper storey it had been built close to where the old timber priors house used to be so presumably it had replaced that modest building as the residence of godwyn he wondered where godwyn had found the money he went closer the palace was very grand but merthin did not like the design none of the levels related in any way to the cathedral that loomed over it the details were careless the top of the ostentatious doorcase blocked part of an upperstorey window worst of all the palace was built on a different axis from that of the church so that it stood at an awkward angle it was elfrics work no doubt of that a plump cat sat on the doorstep in the sun it was black with a white tip to its tail it glared malevolently at merthin he turned away and walked slowly to the hospital the cathedral green was quiet and deserted there was no market today the excitement and apprehension rose again in his stomach he might see caris at any moment he reached the entrance and went in the long room looked brighter and smelled fresher than he remembered everything had a scrubbed look there were a few people lying on mattresses on the floor most of them elderly at the altar a young novice was saying prayers aloud he waited for her to finish he was so anxious that he was sure he felt more ill than the patients on the beds he had come a thousand miles for this moment was it a wasted journey at last the nun said amen for the last time and turned around he did not know her she approached him and said politely may god bless you stranger merthin took a deep breath ive come to see sister caris he said the nuns chapter meetings now took place in the refectory in the past they had shared with the monks the elegant octagonal chapter house at the northeast corner of the cathedral sadly mistrust between monks and nuns was now so great that the nuns did not want to risk the monks eavesdropping on their deliberations so they met in the long bare room where they took their meals the nunnery officials sat behind a table mother cecilia in the middle there was no subprioress natalie had died a few weeks ago at the age of fiftyseven and cecilia had not yet replaced her on cecilias right was the treasurer beth and her matricularius elizabeth formerly elizabeth clerk on cecilias left were the cellarer margaret in charge of all supplies and her subordinate caris the guest master thirty nuns sat on rows of benches facing the senior officials after the prayer and the reading mother cecilia made her announcements we have received a letter from our lord bishop in response to our complaint about prior godwyn stealing our money she said there was a murmur of anticipation from the nuns the reply had been a long time coming king edward had taken almost a year to replace bishop richard earl william had lobbied hard for jerome his fathers able administrator but in the end edward had chosen henri of mons a relative of his wifes from hainault in northern france bishop henri had come to england for the ceremony then travelled to rome to be confirmed by the pope then returned and settled in to his palace at shiring before replying to cecilias formal letter of complaint cecilia went on the bishop declines to take any action over the theft saying that the events took place during the time of bishop richard and the past is past the nuns gasped they had accepted the delay patiently feeling confident they would get justice in the end this was a shocking rejection caris had seen the letter earlier she was not as astonished as the rest of the nuns it was not so remarkable that the new bishop did not wish to begin his period of office by quarrelling with the prior of kingsbridge the letter told her that henri would be a pragmatic ruler not a man of principle he was no different in that respect from the majority of men who were successful in church politics however she was no less disappointed for being unsurprised the decision meant that she had to abandon for the foreseeable future her dream of building a new hospital where sick people could be isolated from healthy guests she told herself she should not grieve the priory had existed for hundreds of years without such a luxury so it could wait another decade or more on the other hand it angered her to see the rapid spread of diseases like the vomiting sickness that maldwyn cook had brought to the fleece fair the year before last no one understood exactly how these things were transmitted by looking at a sick person by touching him or just by being in the same room but there could be no doubt that many illnesses did hop from one victim to the next and proximity was a factor however she had to forget all that for now a rumble of resentful muttering came from the nuns on the benches mairs voice rose above the others saying the monks will be cockahoop she was right caris thought godwyn and philemon had got away with daylight robbery they had always argued that it was not theft for the monks to use the nuns money since it was all for the glory of god in the end and they would now consider that the bishop had vindicated them it was a bitter defeat especially for caris and mair but mother cecilia was not going to waste time on regrets this is not the fault of any of us except perhaps me she said we have simply been too trusting you trusted godwyn but i did not caris thought but she kept her mouth clamped shut she waited to hear what cecilia would say next she knew that the prioress was going to make changes among the nunnery officials but no one knew what had been decided however we must be more careful in the future we will build a treasury of our own to which the monks will not have access indeed i hope they will not even know where it is sister beth will retire as treasurer with our thanks for long and faithful service and sister elizabeth will take her place i have complete faith in elizabeth caris tried to control her face so that her disgust would not be seen elizabeth had testified that caris was a witch it was nine years ago and cecilia had forgiven elizabeth but caris never would however that was not the only reason for cariss antipathy elizabeth was sour and twisted and her resentments interfered with her judgement such people could never be trusted in cariss opinion they were always liable to make decisions based on their prejudices cecilia went on sister margaret has asked permission to step down from her duties and sister caris will take her place as cellarer caris was disappointed she had hoped to be made subprioress cecilias deputy she tried to smile as if pleased but she found it difficult cecilia was obviously not going to appoint a subprioress she would have two rival subordinates caris and elizabeth and let them fight it out caris caught elizabeths eye and saw barely suppressed hatred in her look cecilia went on under cariss supervision sister mair will become guest master mair beamed with pleasure she was glad to be promoted and even happier that she would be working under caris caris too liked the decision mair shared her obsession with cleanliness and her mistrust of priests remedies such as bleeding caris had not got what she wanted but she tried to look happy as cecilia announced a handful of lesser appointments when the meeting closed she went to cecilia and thanked her dont imagine it was an easy decision the prioress said elizabeth has brains and determination and shes steady where youre volatile but youre imaginative and you get the best out of people i need you both caris could not argue with cecilias analysis of her she really knows me caris thought ruefully better than anyone else in the world now that my father is dead and merthin has gone she felt a surge of affection cecilia was like a mother bird always moving always busy taking care of her fledglings ill do everything i can to live up to your expectations caris vowed she left the room she needed to check on old julie no matter what she said to the younger nuns no one looked after julie the way she did it was as if they believed that a helpless old person did not need to be kept comfortable only caris made sure julie was given a blanket in cool weather and got something to drink when she was thirsty and was helped to the latrine at those times of day when habitually she needed to go caris decided to take her a hot drink an infusion of herbs that seemed to cheer the old nun up she went to her pharmacy and put a small pan of water on the fire to boil mair came in and closed the door isnt this wonderful she said well still be working together she threw her arms around caris and kissed her lips caris hugged her then detached herself from the embrace dont kiss me like that she said its because i love you and i love you too but not in the same way it was true caris was very fond of mair they had become highly intimate in france when they had risked their lives together caris had even found herself attracted by mairs beauty one night in a tavern in calais when the two of them had had a room with a door that could be locked caris had at last succumbed to mairs advances mair had fondled and kissed caris in all her most private places and caris had done the same to mair mair had said it was the happiest day of her life unfortunately caris had not felt the same for her the experience was pleasant but not thrilling and she had not wanted to repeat it thats all right mair said as long as you love me even just a little bit im happy you wont ever stop will you caris poured boiling water on the herbs when youre as old as julie i promise ill bring you an infusion to keep you healthy tears came to mairs eyes thats the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me caris had not meant it to be a vow of eternal love dont be sentimental she said gently she strained the infusion into a wooden cup lets go and check on julie they crossed the cloisters and entered the hospital a man with a bushy red beard was standing near the altar god bless you stranger she said the man seemed familiar he did not reply to her greeting but looked hard at her with intense goldenbrown eyes then she recognized him she dropped the cup oh god she said you the few moments before she saw him were exquisite and merthin knew he would treasure them all his life whatever else happened he stared hungrily at the face he had not seen for nine years and remembered with a shock that was like plunging into a cold river on a hot day how dear that face had been to him she had hardly changed at all his fears had been groundless she did not even look older she was now thirty he calculated but she was as slim and perky as she had been at twenty she walked quickly into the hospital with an air of brisk authority carrying a wooden cup full of some medicine then she looked at him paused and dropped the cup he grinned at her feeling happy youre here she said i thought you were in florence im very pleased to be back he replied she looked at the liquid on the floor the nun with her said dont worry about this ill clear up go and talk to him the second nun was pretty and had tears in her eyes merthin noticed but he was too excited to pay much attention caris said when did you come back i arrived an hour ago you look well and you look such a man merthin laughed she said what made you decide to return its a long story he replied but id love to tell it to you well step outside she touched his arm lightly and led him out of the building nuns were not supposed to touch people nor to have private conversations with men but for her such rules had always been optional he was glad she had not acquired a respect for authority in the last nine years merthin pointed to the bench by the vegetable garden i sat on that seat with mark and madge webber the day you entered the convent nine years ago madge told me you had refused to see me she nodded it was the most unhappy day of my life but i knew that seeing you would make it even worse i felt the same way except that i wanted to see you no matter how miserable it made me she gave him a direct look her goldflecked green eyes as candid as ever that sounds a bit like a reproach perhaps it is i was very angry with you whatever you decided to do i felt you owed me an explanation he had not intended the conversation to go this way but he found he could not help himself she was unapologetic its really quite simple i could hardly bear to leave you if i had been forced to speak to you i think i would have killed myself he was taken aback for nine years he had thought she had been selfish on that day of parting now it looked as if he had been the selfish one in making such demands on her she had always had this ability to make him revise his attitudes he recalled it was an uncomfortable process but she was often right they did not sit on the bench but turned away and walked across the cathedral green the sky had clouded over and the sun had gone there is a terrible plague in italy he said they call it la moria grande ive heard about it she said isnt it in southern france too it sounds dreadful i caught the disease i recovered which is unusual my wife silvia died she looked shocked im so sorry she said you must feel terribly sad all her family died and so did all my clients it seemed like a good moment to come home and you ive just been made cellarer she said with evident pride to merthin that seemed somewhat trivial especially after the slaughter he had seen however such things were important in the life of the nunnery he looked up at the great church florence has a magnificent cathedral he said lots of patterns in coloured stone but i prefer this carved shapes all the same shade as he studied the tower grey stone against grey sky it started to rain they went inside the church for shelter a dozen or so people were scattered around the nave visitors to the town looking at the architecture devout locals praying a couple of novice monks sweeping i remember feeling you up behind that pillar merthin said with a grin i remember it too she said but she did not meet his eye i still feel the same about you as i did on that day thats the real reason i came home she turned and looked at him with anger in her eyes but you got married and you became a nun but how could you marry her silvia if you loved me i thought i could forget you but i never did then when i thought i was dying i realized i would never get over you her anger vanished as quickly as it had appeared and tears came to her eyes i know she said looking away you feel the same i never changed did you try she met his eye theres a nun the pretty one who was with you in the hospital how did you guess she cried when she saw me i wondered why caris looked guilty and merthin guessed she was feeling the way he had felt when silvia used to say youre thinking about your english girl mair is dear to me caris said and she loves me but but you didnt forget me no merthin felt triumphant but he tried not to let it show in that case he said you should renounce your vows leave the nunnery and marry me leave the nunnery youll need first to get a pardon for the witchcraft conviction i realize that but im sure it can be done well bribe the bishop and the archbishop and even the pope if necessary i can afford it she was not sure it would be as easy as he thought but that was not her main problem its not that im not tempted she said but i promised cecilia i would vindicate her faith in me i have to help mair take over as guest master we need to build a new treasury and im the only one who takes care of old julie properly he was bewildered is all that so important of course it is she said angrily i thought the nunnery was just old women saying prayers and healing the sick and feeding the poor and managing thousands of acres of land its at least as important as building bridges and churches he had not anticipated this she had always been sceptical of religious observance she had gone into the nunnery under duress when it was the only way to save her own life but now she seemed to have grown to love her punishment youre like a prisoner who is reluctant to leave the dungeon even when the door is opened wide he said the door isnt open wide i would have to renounce my vows mother cecilia well have to work on all these problems lets begin right away she looked miserable im not sure she was torn he could see it amazed him is this you he said incredulously you used to hate the hypocrisy and falsehood that you saw in the priory lazy greedy dishonest tyrannical thats still true of godwyn and philemon then leave and do what marry me of course is that all once again he was bewildered its all i want no its not you want to design palaces and castles you want to build the tallest building in england if you need someone to take care of what ive got a little girl her name is lolla shes three that seemed to settle cariss mind she sighed im a senior official in a convent of thirtyfive nuns ten novices and twentyfive employees with a school and a hospital and a pharmacy and youre asking me to throw all that up to nursemaid one little girl ive never met he gave up arguing all i know is that i love you and i want to be with you she laughed humourlessly if you had said that and nothing else you might have talked me into it im confused he said are you refusing me or not i dont know she said merthin lay awake much of the night he was accustomed to bedding down in taverns and the sounds lolla made in her sleep only soothed him but tonight he could not stop thinking about caris he was shocked by her reaction to his return he realized now that he had never thought logically about how she would feel when he reappeared he had indulged in unrealistic nightmares about how she might have changed and in his heart he had hoped for a joyous reconciliation of course she had not forgotten him but he could have figured out that she would not have spent nine years moping for him she was not the type all the same he would never have guessed that she would be so committed to her work as a nun she had always been more or less hostile to the church given how dangerous it was to criticize religion in any way she might well have concealed the true depth of her scepticism even from him so it was a terrible shock to find her reluctant to leave the nunnery he had anticipated fear of bishop richards death sentence or anxiety about being permitted to renounce her vows but he had not suspected she might have found life in the priory so fulfilling that she hesitated to leave it to become his wife he felt angry with her he wished he had said ive travelled a thousand miles to ask you to marry me how can you say youre not sure he thought of a lot of biting remarks he might have made perhaps it was a good thing they had not occurred to him then their conversation had ended with her asking him to give her time to get over the shock of his sudden return and think about what she wanted to do he had consented he had no alternative but it had left him hanging in agony like a man crucified eventually he drifted into a troubled sleep lolla woke him early as usual and they went down to the parlour tor porridge he repressed the impulse to go straight to the hospital and speak to caris again she had asked for time and it would do his cause no good to pester her it occurred to him that there might be more shocks in store for him and that he had better try to catch up with what had been happening in kingsbridge so after breakfast he went to see mark webber the webber family lived on the main street in a large house they had bought soon after caris got them started in the cloth business merthin remembered the days when they and their four children had lived in one room that was not much bigger than the loom on which mark worked their new house had a large stonebuilt ground floor used as a storeroom and shop the living quarters were in the timberbuilt upper storey merthin found madge in the shop checking a cartload of scarlet cloth that had just arrived from one of their outoftown mills she was almost forty now with strands of grey in her dark hair a short woman she had become quite plump with a prominent bosom and a vast behind she made merthin think of a pigeon but an aggressive one because of her jutting chin and assertive manner with her were two youngsters a beautiful girl of about seventeen and a strapping boy a couple of years older merthin recalled her two older children dora a thin girl in a ragged dress and john a shy boy and realized that these were the same grown up now john was effortlessly lifting the heavy bales of cloth while dora counted them by notching a stick it made merthin feel old im only thirtytwo he thought but that seemed old when he looked at john madge gave a cry of surprise and pleasure when she saw him she hugged him and kissed his bearded cheeks then made a fuss of lolla i thought she could come and play with your children merthin said ruefully of course theyre much too old dennis and noah are at the priory school she said theyre thirteen and eleven but dora will entertain lolla she loves children the young woman picked lolla up the cat next door has kittens she said do you want to see them lolla replied with a stream of italian which dora took for assent and they went off madge left john to finish unloading the cart and took merthin upstairs mark has gone to melcombe she said we export some of our cloth to brittany and gascony he should be back today or tomorrow merthin sat in her parlour and accepted a cup of ale kingsbridge seems to be prospering he said the trade in fleeces has declined she said its because of war taxes everything has to be sold through a handful of large traders so that the king can collect his share there are still a few dealers here in kingsbridge petranilla carries on the business edmund left but its nothing like it used to be luckily the trade in finished cloth has grown to replace it in this town at least is godwyn still prior unfortunately yes is he still making difficulties hes so conservative he objects to any change and vetoes all progress for example mark proposed opening the market on saturday as well as sunday as an experiment what possible objection could godwyn have to that he said it would enable people to come to market without going to church which would be a bad thing some of them might have gone to church on saturday too godwyns cup is always half empty never half full surely the parish guild opposes him not very often elfric is alderman now he and alice got almost everything edmund left the alderman doesnt have to be the richest man in town but he usually is remember elfric employs lots of craftsmen carpenters stonemasons mortar makers scaffolders and buys from everyone who trades in building materials the town is full of people who are more or less bound to support him and elfric has always been close to godwyn exactly he gets all the priorys building work which means every public project and hes such a shoddy builder strange isnt it madge said in a musing tone youd think godwyn would want the best man for the job but he doesnt for him its all about who will be compliant who will obey his wishes unquestioningly merthin felt a bit depressed nothing had changed his enemies were still in power it might prove difficult for him to resume his old life no good news for me there then he stood up id better take a look at my island im sure mark will seek you out as soon as he returns from melcombe merthin went next door for lolla but she was having such a good time that he left her with dora and strolled through the town to the riverside he took another look at the cracks in his bridge but he did not need to study them long the cause was obvious he made a tour of leper island little had changed there were a few wharves and storehouses at the west end and just one house the one he had lent to jimmie at the east end beside the road that led from one span of the bridge to the other when he first took possession of the island he had had ambitious plans for developing it nothing had happened of course during his exile now he thought he could do something he paced the ground making rough measurements and visualizing buildings and even streets until it was time for the midday meal he picked lolla up and returned to the bell bessie served a tasty pork stew thickened with barley the tavern was quiet and bessie joined them for dinner bringing a jug of her best red wine when they had eaten she poured him another cup and he told her about his ideas the road across the island from one bridge to the other is an ideal place to put shops he said and taverns she pointed out this place and the holly bush are the busiest inns in town simply because they are close to the cathedral any place where people are continually passing by is a good location for a tavern if i built a tavern on leper island you could run it she gave him a direct look we could run it together he smiled at her he was full of her good food and wine and any man would have loved to tumble into bed with her and enjoy her soft round body but it was not to be i was very fond of my wife silvia he said but all the time we were married i kept thinking about caris and silvia knew it betty looked away thats sad i know and ill never do it to another woman i wont get married again unless its to caris im not a good man but im not that bad caris may never marry you i know she stood up picking up their bowls you are a good man she said too good she returned to the kitchen merthin put lolla to bed for a nap then sat on a bench in front of the tavern looking down the hillside at leper island sketching on a big slate enjoying the september sunshine he did not get much work done because every other person who walked past wanted to welcome him home and ask what he had been doing for the last nine years late in the afternoon he saw the massive figure of mark webber coming up the hill driving a cart bearing a barrel mark had always been a giant but now merthin observed he was a plump giant merthin shook his enormous hand ive been to melcombe mark said i go every few weeks whats in the barrel wine from bordeaux straight off the ship which also brought news you know that princess joan was on her way to spain yes every wellinformed person in europe knew that the fifteenyearold daughter of king edward was to marry prince pedro heir to the throne of castile the marriage would forge an alliance between england and the largest of the iberian kingdoms ensuring that edward could concentrate on his interminable war against france without worrying about interference from the south well said mark joan died of the plague in bordeaux merthin was doubly shocked partly because edwards position in france had suddenly become shaky but mainly because the plague had spread so far they have the plague in bordeaux bodies piled in the streets the french sailors told me merthin was unnerved he had thought he had left la moria grande behind him surely it would not come as far as england he did not fear it personally no one had ever caught it twice so he was safe and lolla was among those who for some reason did not succumb to it but he was afraid for everyone else especially caris mark had other things on his mind youve returned at just the right time some of the younger merchants are getting fed up with elfric as alderman a lot of the time hes just a dogsbody for godwyn im planning to challenge him you could be influential theres a meeting of the parish guild tonight come along and well get you admitted right away wont it matter that i never finished my apprenticeship after what youve built here and abroad hardly all right merthin needed to be a guild member if he was going to develop the island people always found reasons to object to new buildings and he might need support himself but he was not as confident of his acceptance as mark mark took his barrel home and merthin went inside to give lolla her supper at sundown mark returned to the bell and merthin walked with him up the main street as the warm afternoon turned into a chilly evening the guild hall had seemed like a fine building to merthin years ago when he had stood here and presented his bridge design to the parish guild but it appeared awkward and shabby now that he had seen the grand public buildings of italy he wondered what men such as buonaventura caroli and loro fiorentino must think of its rough stone undercroft with the prison and the kitchen and its main hall with a row of pillars running awkwardly down the middle to support the roof mark introduced him to a handful of men who had arrived in kingsbridge or had come to prominence in merthins absence however most of the faces were familiar albeit a little older merthin greeted those few he had not already encountered in the last two days among these was elfric ostentatiously dressed in a brocade surcoat made with silver thread he showed no surprise someone had obviously told him merthin was back but glared with undisguised hostility also present were prior godwyn and his subprior brother philemon godwyn at fortytwo was looking more like his uncle anthony merthin observed with downsloping lines of querulous discontent around his mouth he put on a pretence of affability that might have fooled someone who did not know him philemon too had changed he was no longer lean and awkward he had filled out like a prosperous merchant and carried himself with an air of arrogant selfassurance although merthin fancied he could still see underneath the façade the anxiety and selfhatred of the fawning toady philemon shook his hand as if touching a snake it was depressing to realize that old hatreds were so longlived a handsome darkhaired young man crossed himself when he saw merthin then revealed that he was merthins former protege jimmie now known as jeremiah builder merthin was delighted to find that he was doing well enough to belong to the parish guild however it seemed he was still as superstitious as ever mark mentioned the news about princess joan to everyone he spoke to merthin answered one or two anxious questions about the plague but the kingsbridge merchants were more concerned that the collapse of the alliance with castile would prolong the french war which was bad for business elfric sat on the big chair in front of the giant woolsack scales and opened the meeting mark immediately proposed that merthin should be admitted as a member not surprisingly elfric objected he was never a member of the guild because he did not finish his apprenticeship because he wouldnt marry your daughter you mean said one of the men and they all laughed merthin took a few moments to identify the speaker it was bill watkin the house builder the black hair around his bald dome now turning grey because he is not a craftsman of the required standard elfric persisted stubbornly how can you say that mark protested he has built houses churches palaces and our bridge which is cracking after only eight years you built that elfric i followed merthins design exactly clearly the arches are not strong enough to bear the weight of the roadbed and the traffic upon it the iron braces i have installed have not been sufficient to prevent the cracks widening therefore i propose to reinforce the arches either side of the central pier on both bridges with a second course of masonry doubling their thickness i thought this subject might come up tonight so i have prepared estimates of the cost elfric must have started to plan this attack the moment he heard that merthin was back in town he had always seen merthin as an enemy nothing had changed however he had failed to understand the problem with the bridge and that gave merthin his chance he spoke to jeremiah in a low voice would you do something for me after all you did for me anything run to the priory now and ask to speak to sister caris urgently tell her to find the original drawing i made for the bridge it should be in the priory library bring it here right away jeremiah slipped out of the room elfric went on i must tell guildsmen that i have already spoken to prior godwyn who says the priory cannot afford to pay for this repair we will have to finance it as we financed the original cost of building the bridge and be repaid out of penny tolls they all groaned there followed a long and badtempered discussion about how much money each member of the guild should put up merthin felt animosity building up towards him in the room this was undoubtedly what elfric had intended merthin kept looking at the door willing jeremiah to reappear bill watkin said maybe merthin should pay for the repairs if its his design thats at fault merthin could not stay out of the discussion any longer he threw caution to the winds i agree he said there was a startled silence if my design has caused the cracks ill repair the bridge at my own expense he went on recklessly bridges were costly if he was wrong about the problem it could cost half his fortune bill said handsomely said im sure merthin said but i have something to say first if guildsmen will permit he looked at elfric elfric hesitated obviously trying to think of a reason for refusing but bill said let him speak and there was a chorus of assent elfric nodded reluctantly thank you said merthin when an arch is weak it cracks in a characteristic pattern the stones at the top of the arch are pressed downwards so that their lower edges splay apart and a crack appears at the crown of the arch on the intrados the underside thats true said bill watkin ive seen that sort of crack many a time its not usually fatal merthin went on this is not the type of cracking youre seeing on the bridge contrary to what elfric said those arches are strong enough the thickness of the arch is one twentieth of its diameter at the base which is the standard proportion in every country the builders in the room nodded they all knew that ratio the crown is intact however there are horizontal cracks at the springing of the arch either side of the central pier bill spoke again you sometimes see that in a quadripartite vault which this bridge is not merthin pointed out the vaults are simple whats causing it then elfric did not follow my original design elfric said i did i specified a pile of large loose stones at both ends of the piers a pile of stones elfric said mockingly and you say thats what was going to keep your bridge upright yes i do merthin said he could tell that even the builders in the room agreed with elfrics scepticism but they did not know about bridges which were different from any other kind of building because they stood in water the piles of stones were an essential part of the design they were never in the drawings would you like to show us my drawings elfric to prove your point the tracing floor is long gone i did a drawing on parchment it should be in the priory library elfric looked at godwyn at that moment the complicity between the two men was blatant and merthin hoped the rest of the guild could see it godwyn said parchment is costly that drawing was scraped and reused long ago merthin nodded as if he believed godwyn there was still no sign of jeremiah merthin might have to win the argument without the help of the original plans the stones would have prevented the problem that is now causing the cracks he said philemon put in you would say that wouldnt you but why should we believe you its just your word against elfrics merthin realized he would have to stick his neck out all or nothing he thought i will tell you what the problem is and prove it to you in daylight if you will meet me at the riverside tomorrow at dawn elfrics face showed that he wanted to refuse this challenge but bill watkin said fair enough well be there bill can you bring two sensible boys who are good swimmers and divers easy elfric had lost control of the meeting and godwyn intervened revealing himself as the puppetmaster what kind of a mockery are you planning he said angrily but it was too late the others were curious now let him make his point said bill if its a mockery well all know soon enough just then jeremiah came in merthin was pleased to see that he was carrying a wooden frame with a large sheet of parchment stretched across it elfric stared at jeremiah shocked godwyn looked pale and said who gave you that a revealing question merthin commented the lord prior doesnt ask what the drawing shows nor where it came from he seems to know all that already he just wonders who handed it over bill said never mind all that show us the drawing jeremiah jeremiah stood in front of the scales and turned the frame round so that everyone could see the drawing there at the ends of the piers were the piles of stones merthin had spoken of merthin stood up in the morning ill explain how they work summer was turning into autumn and it was chilly on the river bank at dawn news had somehow got around that a drama would take place and as well as the members of the parish guild there were two or three hundred people waiting to see the clash between merthin and elfric even caris was there this was no longer merely an argument about an engineering problem merthin realized he was the youngster challenging the authority of the old bull and the herd understood that bill watkin produced two lads of twelve or thirteen stripped to their undershorts and shivering it turned out they were mark webbers younger sons dennis and noah dennis the thirteenyearold was short and chunky like his mother he had redbrown hair the colour of leaves in autumn noah the younger by two years was taller and would probably grow up to be as big as mark merthin identified with the short redhead he wondered whether dennis was embarrassed as merthin himself had been at that age to have a younger brother who was bigger and stronger merthin thought elfric might object to marks sons being the divers on the grounds that they might have been briefed in advance by their father and told what to say however elfric said nothing mark was too transparently honest for anyone to suspect him of such duplicity and perhaps elfric realized that or more likely godwyn realized it merthin told the boys what to do swim out to the central pier then dive youll find the pier is smooth for a long way down then theres the foundation a great lump of stones held together with mortar when you reach the river bed feel underneath the foundation you probably wont be able to see anything the water will be too muddy but hold your breath for as long as you can and investigate thoroughly all around the base then come up to the surface and tell us exactly what you find they both jumped into the water and swam out merthin spoke to the assembled townspeople the bed of this river is not rock but mud the current swirls around the piers of a bridge and scours the mud out from underneath the pillars leaving a depression filled only with water this happened to the old wooden bridge the oak piers were not resting on the river bed at all but hanging from the superstructure thats why the bridge collapsed to prevent the same thing happening to the new bridge i specified piles of large rough stones around the feet of the piers such piles break up the current so that its action is haphazard and weak however the piles were not installed and so the piers have been undermined they are no longer supporting the bridge but hanging from it and thats why there are cracks where the pier joins the arch elfric snorted sceptically but the other builders looked intrigued the two boys reached midstream touched the central pier took deep breaths and disappeared merthin said when they come back they will tell us that the pier is not resting on the river bed but hanging over a depression filled with water large enough for a man to climb into he hoped he was right both boys stayed under water for a surprisingly long time merthin found himself feeling breathless as it were in sympathy with them at last a wet head of red hair broke the surface then a brown one the two boys conversed briefly nodding as if establishing that they had both observed the same thing then they struck out for the shore merthin was not completely sure of his diagnosis but he could think of no other explanation for the cracks and he had felt the need to appear supremely confident if he now turned out to be wrong he would look all the more foolish the boys reached the bank and waded out of the water panting madge gave them blankets which they pulled around their shaking shoulders merthin allowed them a few moments to catch their breath then said well what did you find nothing said dennis the elder what do you mean nothing theres nothing there at the bottom of the pillar elfric looked triumphant just the mud of the river bed you mean no said dennis no mud just water noah put in theres a hole you could climb into easily that big pillar is just hanging in the water with nothing under it merthin tried not to look relieved elfric blustered theres still no authority for saying a pile of loose stones would have solved the problem but no one was listening to him in the eyes of the crowd merthin had proved his point they gathered around him commenting and questioning after a few moments elfric walked away alone merthin felt a momentary pang of compassion then he recalled how when he was an apprentice elfric had hit him across the face with a length of timber and his pity evaporated into the cold morning air the following morning a monk came to see merthin at the bell when he pulled back his hood menhin did not at first recognize him then he saw that the monks left arm was cut off at the elbow and he realized it was brother thomas now in his forties with a grey beard and deepset lines around his eyes and mouth was his secret still dangerous after all these years merthin wondered would thomass life be in danger even now if the truth came out but thomas had not come to talk about that you were right about the bridge he said merthin nodded there was a sour satisfaction in it he had been right but prior godwyn had fired him and in consequence his bridge would never be perfect i wanted to explain the importance of the rough stones back then he said but i knew elfric and godwyn would never listen to me so i told edmund wooler then he died you should have told me i wish i had come with me to the church thomas said since you can read so much from a few cracks id like to show you something if i may he led merthin to the south transept here and in the south aisle of the choir elfric had rebuilt the arches following the partial collapse eleven years ago merthin saw immediately what thomas was worrying about the cracks had reappeared you said they would come back thomas said unless you discovered the root cause of the problem yes you were right elfric was wrong twice merthin felt a spark of excitement if the tower needed rebuilding you understand that but does godwyn thomas did not answer the question what do you think the root cause might be menhin concentrated on the immediate problem he had thought about this on and off for years this is not the original tower is it he said according to timothys book it has been rebuilt and made higher about a hundred years ago yes when the raw wool business was booming do you think they made it too high it depends on the foundations the site of the cathedral sloped gently to the south towards the river and that might be a factor he walked through the crossing under the tower to the north transept he stood at the foot of the massive pillar at the northeast corner of the crossing and looked up at the arch that stretched over his head across the north aisle of the choir to the wall its the south aisle im worried about thomas said slightly peevishly there are no problems here merthin pointed up theres a crack on the underside of the arch the intrados at the crown he said you get that in a bridge when the piers are inadequately grounded and start to splay apart what are you saying that the tower is moving away from the north transept merthin went back through the crossing and looked at the matching arch on the south side this one is cracked too but on the upper side the extrados do you see the wall above it is cracked too they arent very big cracks but they tell us what is happening on the north side the arch is being stretched on the south side its being pinched that means the tower is moving south thomas looked up warily it seems straight you cant see it with the eye but if you climb up into the tower and drop a plumb line from the top of one of the columns of the crossing just below the springing of the arch you will see that by the time the line touches the floor it will be adrift of the column to the south by several inches and as the tower leans its separating from the wall of the choir which is where the damage shows worst what can be done merthin wanted to say you have to commission me to build a new tower but that would have been premature a lot more investigation before any building he said suppressing his excitement we have established that the cracks have appeared because the tower is moving but why is it moving and how will we learn that dig a hole merthin said in the end jeremiah dug the hole thomas did not want to employ merthin directly it was difficult enough as it was he said to get the money for the investigation out of godwyn who seemed never to have any money to spare but he could not give the job to elfric who would have said there was nothing to investigate so the compromise was merthins old apprentice jeremiah had learned from his master and liked to work fast on the first day he lifted the paving stones in the south transept next day his men started excavating the earth around the huge southeast pier of the crossing as the hole got deeper jeremiah built a timber hoist for lifting out loads of earth by the second week he had to build wooden ladders down the sides of the hole so that the labourers could get to the bottom meanwhile the parish guild gave merthin the contract for the repair of the bridge elfric was against the decision of course but he was in no position to claim that he was the best man for the job and he hardly bothered to argue merthin went to work with speed and energy he built cofferdams around the two problem piers drained the dams and began to fill the holes under the piers with rubble and mortar next he would surround the piers with the piles of large rough stones he had envisaged from the start finally he would remove elfrics ugly iron braces and fill the cracks with mortar provided the repaired foundations were sound the cracks would not reopen but the job he really wanted was the rebuilding of the tower it would not be easy he would have to get his design accepted by the priory and the parish guild currently run by his two worst enemies godwyn and elfric and godwyn would have to find the money as a first step merthin encouraged mark to put himself forward for election as alderman to replace elfric the alderman was elected once a year on all hallows day the first of november in practice most aldermen were reelected unopposed until they retired or died however there was no doubt that a contest was permitted indeed elfric himself had put his name forward while edmund wooler was still in office mark required little prompting he was itching to put an end to elfrics rule elfric was so close to godwyn that there was not much point in having a parish guild at all the town was in effect run by the priory narrow conservative mistrustful of new ideas careless of the interests of the townspeople so the two candidates began drumming up support elfric had his followers mainly people he either employed or bought materials from however he had lost face badly in the argument over the bridge and those who took his side were downcast marks supporters by contrast were ebullient merthin visited the cathedral every day and examined the foundations of the mighty column as they were exposed by jeremiahs digging the foundations were made of the same stone as the rest of the church laid in mortared courses but less carefully trimmed as they would not be visible each course was a little wider than the one above in a pyramid shape as the excavation went deeper he examined every layer for weakness and found none but he felt confident that eventually he would merthin told no one what was in his mind if his suspicions were correct and the thirteenthcentury tower was simply too heavy for the twelfthcentury foundations the solution would be drastic the tower would have to be demolished and a new one built and the new tower could be the tallest in england one day in the middle of october caris appeared at the digging it was early in the morning and a winter sun was shining through the great east window she stood on the edge of the hole with her hood around her head like a halo merthins heart beat faster perhaps she had an answer for him he climbed up the ladder eagerly she was as beautiful as ever though in the strong sunlight he could see the little differences that nine years had made to her face her skin was not quite as smooth and there were now the tiniest of creases at the corners of her lips but her green eyes still shone with that alert intelligence that he loved so much they walked together down the south aisle of the nave and stopped near the pillar that always reminded him of how he had once felt her up here im happy to see you he said youve been hiding away im a nun im supposed to hide away but youre thinking about renouncing your vows i havent made a decision he was crestfallen how much time do you need i dont know he looked away he did not want to show her how badly he was hurt by her hesitation he said nothing he could have told her she was being unreasonable but what was the point youll be going to visit your parents in tench at some point i suppose she said he nodded quite soon they will want to see lolla he was eager to see them too and had delayed only because he had become so deeply involved in his work on the bridge and the tower in that case i wish you would talk to your brother about wulfric in wigleigh merthin wanted to talk about himself and caris not wulfric and gwenda his response was cool what do you want me to say to ralph wulfric is labouring for no money just food because ralph wont give him even a small acreage to farm merthin shrugged wulfric broke ralphs nose he felt the conversation begin to descend into a quarrel and he asked himself why he was angry caris had not spoken to him for weeks but she had broken her silence for the sake of gwenda he resented gwendas place in her heart he realized that was an unworthy emotion he told himself but he could not shake it caris flushed with annoyance that was twelve years ago isnt it time ralph stopped punishing him merthin had forgotten the abrasive disagreements he and caris used to have but now he recognized this friction as familiar he spoke dismissively of course he should stop in my opinion but ralphs opinion is the one that counts then see if you can change his mind she said he resented her imperious attitude im yours to command he said facetiously why the irony because im not yours to command of course but you seem to think i am and i feel a bit foolish for going along with you oh for heavens sake she said youre offended that ive asked you for some reason he felt sure she had made up her mind to reject him and stay in the nunnery he tried to control his emotions if we were a couple you could ask me anything but while youre keeping open the option of rejecting me it seems a bit presumptuous of you he knew he was sounding pompous but he could not stop if he revealed his true feelings he would burst into tears she was too wrapped up in her indignation to notice his distress but its not even for myself she protested i realize its your generosity of spirit that makes you do it but i still feel youre using me all right then dont do it of course ill do it suddenly he could no longer contain himself he turned and walked away from her he was shaking with some passion he could not identify as he strode up the aisle of the great church he struggled to get himself under control he reached the excavation this was stupid he thought he turned and looked back but caris had vanished he stood at the lip of the hole looking down waiting for the storm inside him to subside after a while he realized that the excavation had reached a crucial stage thirty feet below him the men had dug down past the masonry foundations and were beginning to reveal what was beneath there was nothing more he could do about caris right now it would be best to concentrate on his work he took a deep breath swallowed and went down the ladder this was the moment of truth his distress over caris began to ease as he watched the men dig farther down shovelful after shovelful of heavy mud was dug up and taken away merthin studied the stratum of earth that was revealed below the foundations it looked like a mixture of sand and small stones as the men removed the mud the sandy stuff dribbled into the hole they were making merthin ordered them to stop he knelt down and picked up a handful of the sandy material it was nothing like the soil all around it was not natural to the site therefore it must be something that had been put there by builders the excitement of discovery rose inside him overmastering his grief about caris jeremiah he called see if you can find brother thomas quick as you like he told the men to carry on digging but to make a narrower hole at this point the excavation itself could be dangerous to the structure after a while jeremiah returned with thomas and the three of them watched as the men took the hole farther down eventually the sandy layer came to an end and the next stratum was revealed to be the natural muddy earth i wonder what that sandy stuff is thomas said i think i know merthin said he tried not to look triumphant he had predicted years ago that elfrics repairs would not work unless the root of the problem was discovered and he had been right but it was never wise to say i told you so thomas and jeremiah looked at him in anticipation he explained when youve dug a foundation hole you cover the bottom with a mixture of rubble and monar then you lay the masonry on top of that its a perfectly good system as long as the foundations are proportional to the building above thomas said impatiently we both know this what happened here was that a much higher tower was erected on foundations that were not designed for it the extra weight acting over a hundred years has crushed that layer of rubble and mortar to sand the sand has no cohesion and under pressure it has spread outwards into the surrounding soil allowing the masonry above it to sink down the effect is worse on the south side simply because the site naturally slopes that way he felt a profound satisfaction at having figured this out the other two looked thoughtful thomas said i suppose we will have to reinforce the foundations jeremiah shook his head before we can put any reinforcement under the stonework wed have to remove the sandy stuff and that would leave the foundations unsupported the tower would fall down thomas was perplexed so what can we do they both looked at merthin he said build a temporary roof over the crossing erect scaffolding and take down the tower stone by stone then reinforce the foundations then wed have to build a new tower that was what merthin wanted but he did not say so thomas might suspect that his judgement had been coloured by his aspiration im afraid so he said with feigned regret prior godwyn wont like that i know merthin said but i dont think hes got any choice next day merthin rode out of kingsbridge with lolla on the saddle in front of him as they travelled through the forest he obsessively ran over his fraught exchange with caris he knew he had been ungenerous how foolish that was when he was trying to win back her love what had got into him cariss request was perfectly reasonable why would he not wish to perform a small service for the woman he wanted to marry but she had not agreed to marry him she was still reserving the right to reject him that was the source of his anger she was exercising the privileges of a fiancee without making the commitment he could see now that it was petty of him to object on these grounds he had been stupid and turned what could have been a delightful moment of intimacy into a squabble on the other hand the underlying cause of his distress was all too real how long did caris expect him to wait for an answer how long was he prepared to wait he did not like to think about that anyway it would do him nothing but good if he could persuade ralph to stop persecuting poor wulfric tench was on the far side of the county and on the way merthin spent a night at windy wigleigh he found gwenda and wulfric thin after a rainy summer and the second poor harvest in a row wulfrics scar seemed to stand out more on a hollowed cheek their two small sons looked pale and had runny noses and sores on their lips merthin gave them a leg of mutton a small barrel of wine and a gold florin that he pretended were gifts from caris gwenda cooked the mutton over the fire she was possessed by rage and she hissed and spat like the turning meat as she talked of the injustice that had been done to them perkin has almost half the land in the village she said the only reason he can manage it all is that hes got wulfric who does the work of three men yet he must demand more and keep us in poverty im sorry that ralph still bears a grudge merthin said ralph himself provoked that fight gwenda said even lady philippa said so old quarrels wulfric said philosophically ill try to get him to see reason merthin said in the unlikely event that he listens to me what do you really want from him ah said wulfric and he got a faraway look in his eyes which was unusual for him what i pray for every sunday is to get back the lands that my father farmed that will never happen gwenda said quickly perkin is too well entrenched and if he should die he has a son and a married daughter waiting to inherit and a couple of grandsons growing taller every day but wed like a piece of land of our own for the last eleven years wulfric has been working hard to feed other mens children its time he got some of the benefit of his strength ill tell my brother he has punished you long enough merthin said next day he and lolla rode from wigleigh to tench merthin was even more resolved to do something for wulfric it was not just that he wanted to please caris and atone for his curmudgeonly attitude he also felt sad and indignant that two such honest and hardworking people as wulfric and gwenda should be poor and thin and their children sickly just because of ralphs vindictiveness his parents were living in a house in the village not in tench hall itself merthin was shocked by how much his mother had aged though she perked up when she saw lolla his father looked better ralph is very good to us gerald said in a defensive way that made merthin think the opposite the house was pleasant enough but they would have preferred to live at the hall with ralph merthin guessed that ralph did not want his mother watching everything he did they showed him around their home and gerald asked merthin how things were in kingsbridge the town is still prospering despite the effects of the kings french war merthin replied ah but edward must fight for his birthright his father said he is the legitimate heir to the throne of france after all i think thats a dream father said merthin no matter how many times the king invades the french nobility will not accept an englishman as their king and a king cant rule without the support of his earls but we had to stop the french raids on our south coast ports that hasnt been a major problem since the battle of sluys when we destroyed the french fleet which was eight years ago anyway burning the crops of the peasants wont stop pirates it might even add to their numbers the french support the scots who keep invading our northern counties dont you think the king would be better able to deal with scottish incursions if he were in the north of england rather than the north of france gerald looked baffled it had probably never occurred to him to question the wisdom of the war well ralph has been knighted he said and he brought your mother a silver candlestick from calais that was about the size of it merthin thought the real reason for the war was booty and glory they all walked to the manor house ralph was out hunting with alan fernhill in the great hall was a huge carved wooden chair obviously the lords merthin saw what he thought was a young servant girl heavily pregnant and was dismayed to be introduced to her as ralphs wife tilly she went to the kitchen to fetch wine how old is she merthin said to his mother while she was gone fourteen it was not unknown for girls to become pregnant at fourteen but all the same merthin felt that decent people behaved otherwise such early pregnancies usually happened in royal families for whom there was intense political pressure to produce heirs and among the lowest and most ignorant of peasants who knew no better the middle classes maintained higher standards shes a bit young isnt she he said quietly maud replied we all asked ralph to wait but he would not clearly she too disapproved tilly returned with a servant carrying a jug of wine and a bowl of apples she might have been pretty merthin thought but she looked worn out his father addressed her with forced jollity cheer up tilly your husband will be home soon you dont want to greet him with a long face im fed up with being pregnant she said i just wish the baby would come as soon as possible it wont be long now maud said three or four weeks id say it seems like for ever they heard horses outside maud said that sounds like ralph waiting for the brother he had not seen for nine years merthin had mixed feelings as ever his affection for ralph was always contaminated by his knowledge of the evil ralph had done the rape of annet had been only the beginning during his days as an outlaw ralph had murdered innocent men women and children merthin had heard travelling through normandy of the atrocities perpetrated by king edwards army and while he did not know specifically what ralph had done it would have been foolish to hope that ralph had held himself aloof from that orgy of rape burning looting and slaughter but ralph was his brother ralph too would have mixed feelings merthin was sure he might not have forgiven merthin for giving away the location of his outlaw hideout and although merthin had made brother thomas promise not to kill ralph he had known that ralph once captured was likely to be hanged the last words ralph had spoken to merthin in the jail in the basement of the guild hall at kingsbridge were you betrayed me ralph came in with alan both muddy from the hunt merthin was shocked to see that he walked with a limp ralph took a moment to recognize merthin then he smiled broadly my big brother he said heartily it was an old joke merthin was the elder but had long been smaller they embraced merthin felt a surge of warmth despite everything at least were both alive he thought despite war and plague when they had parted he had wondered whether they would ever meet again ralph threw himself into the big chair bring some beer were thirsty he said to tilly there were to be no recriminations merthin gathered he studied his brother ralph had changed since that day in when he had ridden off to war he had lost some of the fingers of his left hand presumably in battle he had a dissipated look his face was veined from drink and his skin seemed dry and flaky did you have good hunting merthin asked we brought home a roe deer as fat as a cow he replied with satisfaction you shall have her liver for supper merthin asked him about fighting in the army of the king and ralph related some of the highlights of the war their father was enthusiastic an english knight is worth ten of the french he said the battle of crécy proved that ralphs response was surprisingly measured an english knight is not much different from a french knight in my opinion he said but the french havent yet understood the harrow formation in which we line up with archers either side of dismounted knights and menatarms they are still charging us suicidally and long may they continue but they will figure it out one day and then they will change their tactics meanwhile we are almost unbeatable in defence unfortunately the harrow formation is irrelevant to attack so we have ended up winning very little merthin was struck by how his brother had grown up warfare had given him a depth and subtlety he had never previously possessed in turn merthin talked about florence the incredible size of the city the wealth of the merchants the churches and palaces ralph was particularly fascinated by the notion of slave girls darkness fell and the servants brought lamps and candles then supper ralph drank a lot of wine merthin noticed that he hardly spoke to tilly perhaps it was not surprising ralph was a thirtyoneyearold soldier who had spent half his adult life in an army and tilly was a girl of fourteen who had been educated in a nunnery what would they have to talk about late in the evening when gerald and maud had returned to their own house and tilly had gone to bed merthin broached the subject caris had asked him to raise he felt more optimistic than previously ralph was showing signs of maturity he had forgiven merthin for what had happened in and his cool analysis of english and french tactics had been impressively free from tribal chauvinism merthin said on my way here i spent a night in wigleigh i see that fulling mill stays busy the scarlet cloth has become a good business for kingsbridge ralph shrugged mark webber pays the rent on time it was beneath the dignity of noblemen to discuss business i stayed with gwenda and wulfric merthin went on you know that gwenda has been cariss friend since childhood i remember the day we all met sir thomas langley in the forest merthin shot a quick glance at alan fernhill they had all kept their childish vows and had not told anyone about that incident merthin wanted the secrecy to continue for he sensed it was still important to thomas though he had no idea why but alan showed no reaction he had drunk a lot of wine and had no ear for hints merthin moved on quickly caris asked me to speak to you about wulfric she thinks youve punished him enough for that fight and i agree he broke my nose i was there remember you werent an innocent party merthin tried to make light of it you did feel up his fiancee what was her name annet if her tits werent worth a broken nose youve only got yourself to blame alan laughed but ealph was not amused wulfric almost got me hanged by stirring lord william up after annet pretended id raped her but you werent hanged and you cut wulfrics cheek open with your sword when you escaped from the courthouse it was a terrible wound you could see his back teeth through it hell never lose the scar good youve punished wulfric for eleven years his wife is thin and his children are ill havent you done enough ralph no what do you mean its not enough why merthin cried in frustration i dont understand you i will continue to punish wulfric and hold him back and humiliate him and his women merthin was startled by ralphs frankness for heavens sake to what end i wouldnt normally answer that question ive learned that it rarely does you any good to explain yourself but youre my big brother and from childhood ive always needed your approval ralph had not really changed merthin realized except insofar as he seemed to know and understand himself in a way he never had when younger the reason is simple ralph went on wulfric is not afraid of me he wasnt scared that day at the fleece fair and hes still not scared of me even after all ive done to him thats why he must continue to suffer merthin was horrified thats a life sentence the day i see fear in his eyes when he looks at me he shall have anything he likes is that so important to you merthin said incredulously that people fear you its the most important thing in the world said ralph merthins return affected the whole town caris observed the changes with amazement and admiration it started with his victory over elfric in the parish guild people realized the town could have lost its bridge because of elfrics incompetence and that jolted them out of their apathy but everyone knew that elfric was a tool of godwyn so the priory was the ultimate focus of their resentment and peoples attitude to the priory was changing there was a mood of defiance caris felt optimistic mark webber had a good chance of winning the election on the first day of november and becoming alderman if that happened prior godwyn would no longer have things all his own way and perhaps the town could begin to grow markets on saturdays new mills independent courts that traders could have faith in but she spent most of her time thinking about her own position merthins return was an earthquake that shook the foundations of her life her first reaction had been horror at the prospect of abandoning all that she had worked for over the last nine years her position in the convent hierarchy maternal cecilia and affectionate mair and ailing old julie and most of all her hospital so much more clean and efficient and welcoming than it had been before but as the days became shorter and colder and merthin repaired his bridge and began laying out the foundations of the street of new buildings he wanted to create on leper island cariss resolve to remain a nun weakened monastic restrictions that she had stopped noticing began to chafe again the devotion of mair which had been a pleasant romantic diversion now became irritating she started to think about what kind of life she might lead as merthins wife she thought a lot about lolla and about the child she might have had with merthin lolla was darkeyed and blackhaired presumably like her italian mother cariss daughter might have had the green eyes of the wooler family the idea of giving up everything to take care of another womans daughter had appalled caris in theory but as soon as she met the little girl she softened she could not talk to anyone in the priory about this of course mother cecilia would tell her she must keep her vows mair would beg her to stay so she agonized alone at night her quarrel with merthin over wulfric made her despair after he walked away from her she had gone back to her pharmacy and cried why were things so difficult all she wanted was to do the right thing while merthin was at tench she confided in madge webber two days after merthin left madge came into the hospital soon after dawn when caris and mair were doing their rounds im worried about my mark she said mair said to caris i went to see him yesterday he had been to melcombe and come back with a fever and an upset stomach i didnt tell you because it didnt seem serious now hes coughing blood madge said ill go caris said the webbers were old friends she preferred to attend mark herself she picked up a bag containing some basic medicines and went with madge to her house in the main street the living area was upstairs over the shop marks three sons loitered anxiously in the dining hall madge took caris into a bedroom that smelled bad caris was used to the odour of a sick room a mixture of sweat vomit and human waste mark lay on a straw mattress perspiring his huge belly stuck up in the air as if he were pregnant the daughter dora stood by the bed caris knelt beside mark and said how do you feel rough mark said in a croaky voice can i have something to drink dora handed caris a cup of wine and caris held it to marks lips she found it strange to see a big man helpless mark had always seemed invulnerable it was unnerving like finding an oak tree that has been there all your life suddenly felled by lightning she touched his forehead he was burning up no wonder he was thirsty let him have as much to drink as he wants she said weak beer is better than wine she did not tell madge that she was puzzled and worried by marks illness the fever and the stomach upset were routine but his coughing blood was a dangerous sign she took a vial of rose water from her bag soaked a small piece of woollen cloth and bathed his face and neck the action soothed him immediately the water would cool him a little and the perfume masked the bad smells in the room ill give you some of this from my pharmacy she said to madge the physicians prescribe it for an inflamed brain a fever is hot and humid and roses are cool and dry so the monks say whatever the reason it will give him some ease thank you but caris knew of no effective treatment for bloody sputum the monkphysicians would diagnose an excess of blood and recommend bleeding but they prescribed that for almost everything and caris did not believe in it as she bathed marks throat she noticed a symptom madge had not mentioned there was a rash of purpleblack spots on marks neck and chest this was an illness she had not come across before and she was mystified but she did not let madge know that come back with me and ill give you the rose water the sun was rising as they walked from the house to the hospital youve been very good to my family madge said we were the poorest people in town until you started the scarlet business it was your energy and industry that made it work madge nodded she knew what she had done all the same it wouldnt have happened without you on impulse caris decided to take madge through the nuns cloisters to her pharmacy so that they could talk privately lay people were not normally allowed inside but there were exceptions and caris was now senior enough to decide when the rules could be broken they were alone in the cramped little room caris filled a pottery bottle with rose water and asked madge for six pence then she said im thinking of renouncing my vows madge nodded unsurprised everybodys wondering what youre going to do caris was shocked that the townspeople had guessed her thoughts how do they know it doesnt take a clairvoyant you entered the nunnery only to escape a death sentence for witchcraft after the work youve done here you should be able to get a pardon you and merthin were in love and always seemed so right for one another now hes come back you must at least be thinking about marrying him i just dont know what my life would be like as someones wife madge shrugged a bit like mine perhaps mark and i run the cloth business together i have to organize the household as well all husbands expect that but its not so difficult especially if you have the money for servants and the children will always be your responsibility rather than his but i manage and so would you you dont make it sound very exciting she smiled i assume you already know about the good parts feeling loved and adored knowing theres one person in the world who will always be on your side getting into bed every night with someone strong and tender who wants to fuck you thats happiness for me madges simple words painted a vivid picture and caris was suddenly filled with a longing that was almost unbearable she felt she could hardly wait to quit the cold hard loveless life of the priory in which the greatest sin was to touch another human being if merthin had walked into the room at that moment she would have torn off his clothes and taken him there on the floor she saw that madge was watching her with a little smile reading her thoughts and she blushed its all right madge said i understand she put six silver pennies down on the bench and picked up the bottle id better go home and look after my man caris recovered her composure try to keep him comfortable and come and fetch me immediately theres any change thank you sister said madge i dont know what well do without you merthin was thoughtful on the journey back to kingsbridge even lollas bright meaningless chatter did not bring him out of his mood ralph had learned a lot but he had not changed deep down he was still a cruel man he neglected his childwife barely tolerated his parents and was vengeful to the point of mania he enjoyed being a lord but felt little obligation to care for the peasants in his power he saw everything around him people included as being there for his gratification however merthin felt optimistic about kingsbridge all the signs were that mark would become alderman on all hallows day and that could be the start of a boom merthin got back on the last day of october all hallows eve it was a friday this year so there was not the influx of crowds that came when the night of evil spirits fell on a saturday as it had in the year that merthin was eleven and he met the tenyearold caris all the same the people were nervous and everyone planned to be in bed by nightfall on the main street he saw mark webbers eldest son john my father is in the hospital the boy said he has a fever this is a bad time for him to fall sick merthin said its an illstarred day i didnt mean because of the date he has to be present at the parish guild meeting tomorrow an alderman cant be elected in his absence i dont think hell be going to any meetings tomorrow that was worrying merthin took his horses to the bell and left lolla in the care of betty entering the priory grounds he ran into godwyn with his mother he guessed they had dined together and now godwyn was walking her to the gate they were deep in an anxious conversation and merthin guessed they were worried about the prospect of their placeman elfric losing the post of alderman they stopped abruptly when they saw him petranilla said unctuously im sorry to hear that mark is unwell forcing himself to be civil merthin replied its just a fever we will pray that he gets well quickly thank you merthin entered the hospital he found madge distraught hes been coughing blood she said and i cant quench his thirst she held a cup of ale to marks lips mark had a rash of purple blotches on his face and arms he was perspiring and his nose was bleeding merthin said not so good today mark mark did not seem to see him but he croaked im very thirsty madge gave him the cup again she said no matter how much he drinks hes always thirsty she spoke with a note of panic that merthin had never heard in her voice before merthin was filled with dread mark made frequent trips to melcombe where he talked to sailors from plagueridden bordeaux tomorrows meeting of the parish guild was the least of marks worries now and the least of merthins too merthins first impulse was to cry out to everyone the news that they were in mortal danger but he clamped his mouth shut no one listened to a man in a panic and besides he was not yet sure there was a small chance marks illness was not what he feared when he was certain he would get caris alone and speak to her calmly and logically but it would have to be soon caris was bathing marks face with a sweetsmelling fluid she wore a stony expression that merthin recognized she was hiding her feelings she obviously had some idea of how serious marks illness was mark was clutching something that looked like a scrap of parchment merthin guessed it would have a prayer written on it or a verse of the bible or perhaps a magic spell that would be madges idea caris had no faith in writing as a remedy prior godwyn came into the hospital trailed as usual by philemon stand away from the bed philemon said immediately how will the man get well if he cannot see the altar merthin and the two women stood back and godwyn bent over the patient he touched marks forehead and neck then felt his pulse show me the urine he said the monkphysicians set great store by examination of the patients urine the hospital had special glass bottles called urinals for the purpose caris handed one to godwyn it did not take an expert to see that there was blood in marks urine godwyn handed it back this man is suffering from overheated blood he said he must be bled then fed sour apples and tripes merthin knew from his experience of the plague in florence that godwyn was talking rubbish but he made no comment in his mind there was no longer much room for doubt about what was wrong with mark the skin rash the bleeding the thirst this was the illness he himself had suffered in florence the one that had killed silvia and all her family this was la moria grande the plague had come to kingsbridge as darkness fell on all hallows eve mark webbers breathing became more difficult caris watched him weaken she felt the angry impotence that possessed her when she was unable to help a patient mark passed into a state of troubled unconsciousness sweating and gasping although his eyes were closed and he showed no awareness at merthins quiet suggestion caris felt in marks armpits and found large boillike swellings there she did not ask him the significance of this she would question him later the nuns prayed and sang hymns while madge and her four children stood around helplessly distraught at the end mark convulsed and blood jetted from his mouth in a sudden flood then he fell back lay still and stopped breathing dora wailed loudly the three sons looked bewildered and struggled to hold back unmanly tears madge wept bitterly he was the best man in the world she said to caris why did god have to take him caris had to fight back her own grief her loss was nothing compared with theirs she did not know why god so often took the best people and left the wicked alive to do more wrong the whole idea of a benevolent deity watching over everyone seemed unbelievable at moments such as this the priests said sickness was a punishment for sin mark and madge loved one another cared for their children and worked hard why should they be punished there were no answers to religious questions but caris had some urgent practical inquiries to make she was deeply worried by marks illness and she could guess that merthin knew something about it she swallowed her tears first she sent madge and her children home to rest and told the nuns to prepare the body for burial then she said to merthin i want to talk to you and i to you he said she noticed that he looked frightened that was rare her fear deepened come to the church she said we can talk privately there a wintry wind swept across the cathedral green it was a clear night and they could see by starlight in the chancel monks were preparing for the all hallows dawn service caris and merthin stood in the northwest corner of the nave away from the monks so that they could not be overheard caris shivered and pulled her robe closer around her she said do you know what killed mark merthin took a shaky breath its the plague he said la moria grande she nodded this was what she had feared but all the same she challenged him how do you know mark goes to melcombe and talks to sailors from bordeaux where the bodies are piled in the streets she nodded hes just back but she did not want to believe merthin all the same can you be sure its the plague the symptoms are the same fever purpleblack spots bleeding buboes in the armpits and most of all the thirst i remember it by christ i was one of the few to recover almost everyone dies within five days often less she felt as if doomsday had come she had heard the terrible stories from italy and southern france entire families wiped out unburied bodies rotting in empty palaces orphaned toddlers wandering the streets crying livestock dying untended in ghost villages was this to happen to kingsbridge what did the italian doctors do prayed sang hymns took blood prescribed their favourite nostrums and charged a fortune everything they tried was useless they were standing close together and speaking in low tones she could see his face by the faint light of the monks distant candles he was staring at her with a strange intensity he was deeply moved she could tell but it did not seem to be grief for mark that possessed him he was focused on her she asked what are the italian doctors like compared with our english physicians after the muslims the italian doctors are supposed to be the most knowledgeable in the world they even cut up dead bodies to learn more about sickness but they never cured a single sufferer from this plague caris refused to accept such complete hopelessness we cant be utterly helpless no we cant cure it but some people think you can escape it caris said eagerly how it seems to spread from one person to another she nodded lots of diseases do that usually when one in a family gets it they all do proximity is the key factor that makes sense some say you fall ill from looking at sick people in florence the nuns counselled us to stay at home as much as possible and avoid social gatherings markets and meetings of guilds and councils and church services no they didnt say that though lots of people stayed home from church too this chimed with what caris had been thinking for years she felt renewed hope perhaps her methods could stave off the plague what about the nuns themselves and the physicians people who have to meet the sick and touch them priests refused to hear confessions in whispers so that they did not have to get too near nuns wore linen masks over their mouths and noses so that they would not breathe the same air some washed their hands in vinegar every time they touched a patient the priestphysicians said none of this would do any good but most of them left the city anyway and did these precautions help its hard to say none of this was done until the plague was rampant and it wasnt systematic just everyone trying different things all the same we must make the effort he nodded after a pause he said however there is one precaution that is sure whats that run away this was what he had been waiting to say she realized he went on the saying goes leave early go far and stay long people who did that escaped the sickness we cant go away why not dont be silly there are six or seven thousand people in kingsbridge they cant all leave town where would they go im not talking about them just you listen you may not have caught the plague from mark madge and the children almost certainly have but you spent less time close to him if youre still all right we could escape we could leave today you and me and lolla caris was appalled by the way he assumed it had spread by now was she doomed already and and go where to wales or ireland we need to find a remote village where they dont see a stranger from one year to the next youve had the sickness you told me people dont get it twice never and some people dont catch it at all lolla must be like that if she didnt pick it up from her mother shes not likely to get it from anyone else so why do you want to go to wales he just stared at her with that intense look and she realized that the fear she had detected in him was for her he was terrified that she would die tears came to her eyes she remembered what madge had said knowing theres one person in the world who will always be on your side merthin tried to look after her no matter what she did she thought of poor madge blasted by grief at the loss of the one who was always on her side how could she caris even think of rejecting merthin but she did i cant leave kingsbridge she said of all times not now they rely on me if someone is sick when the plague strikes im the one they will turn to for help if i were to flee well i dont know how to explain this i think i understand merthin said youd be like a soldier who runs away as soon as the first arrow is shot youd feel a coward yes and a cheat after all these years of being a nun and saying that i live to serve others i knew you would feel this way merthin said but i had to try the sadness in his voice nearly broke her heart as he added and i suppose this means you wont be renouncing your vows in the foreseeable future no the hospital is where they come for help i have to be here at the priory to play my role i have to be a nun all right then dont be too downhearted with wry sorrow he said and why should i not be downhearted you said that it killed half the population of florence something like that so at least half the people just didnt catch it like lolla no one knows why perhaps they have some special strength or maybe the disease strikes at random like arrows fired into the enemy ranks killing some and missing others either way theres a good chance ill escape the illness one chance in two like the toss of a coin heads or tails he said life or death hundreds of people came to mark webbers funeral he had been one of the towns leading citizens but it was more than that poor weavers arrived from the surrounding villages some of them having walked for hours he had been unusually well loved merthin reflected the combination of his giants body and his gentle temperament cast a spell it was a wet day and the bared heads of rich and poor men were soaked as they stood around the grave cold rain mingled with hot tears on the faces of the mourners madge stood with her arms around the shoulders of her two younger sons dennis and noah they were flanked by the eldest son john and the daughter dora who were both much taller than their mother and looked as if they might be the parents of the three short people in the middle merthin wondered grimly whether madge or one of her children would be the next to die six strong men grunted with the effort of lowering the extralarge coffin into the grave madge sobbed helplessly as the monks sang the last hymn then the gravediggers started to shovel the sodden earth back into the hole and the crowd began to disperse brother thomas approached merthin pulling up his hood to keep the rain off the priory has no money to rebuild the tower he said godwyn has commissioned elfric to demolish the old tower and just roof the crossing merthin tore his mind away from apocalyptic thoughts of the plague how will godwyn pay elfric for that the nuns are putting up the money i thought they hated godwyn sister elizabeth is the treasurer godwyn is careful to be kind to her family who are tenants of the priory most of the other nuns do hate him its true but they need a church merthin had not given up his hope of rebuilding the tower higher than before if i could find the money would the priory build a new tower thomas shrugged hard to say that afternoon elfric was reelected alderman of the parish guild after the meeting merthin sought out bill watkin the largest builder in town after elfric once the foundations of the tower are repaired it could be built even higher he said no reason why not bill agreed but what would be the point so that it could be seen from mudeford crossing many travellers pilgrims merchants and so on miss the road for kingsbridge and go on to shiring the town loses a lot of custom that way godwyn will say he cant afford it consider this merthin said suppose the new tower could be financed the same way as the bridge the town merchants could lend the money and be repaid out of bridge tolls bill scratched his monklike fringe of grey hair this was an unfamiliar concept but the tower is nothing to do with the bridge does that matter i suppose not the bridge tolls are just a way of guaranteeing that the loan is repaid bill considered his selfinterest would i be commissioned to do any of the work it would be a big project every builder in town would get a piece of it that would be useful all right listen if i design a large tower will you back me here at the parish guild at the next meeting bill looked dubious the guild members arent likely to approve of extravagance i dont think it needs to be extravagant just high if we put a domed ceiling over the crossing i can build that with no centering a dome thats a new idea i saw domes in italy i can see how it would save money and the tower can be topped by a slender wooden spire which will save money and look wonderful youve got this all worked out havent you not really but its been at the back of my mind ever since i returned from florence well it sounds good to me good for business good for the town and good for our eternal souls ill do my best to help you push it through thank you merthin mulled over the design of the tower as he went about his more mundane work repairing the bridge and building new houses on leper island it helped turn his mind away from dreadful obsessive visions of caris ill with the plague he thought a lot about the south tower at chartres it was a masterpiece albeit a little oldfashioned having been built about two hundred years ago what merthin had liked about it he recalled very clearly was the transition from the square tower to the octagonal spire above at the top of the tower perched on each of the four corners were pinnacles facing diagonally outwards on the same level at the midpoint of each side of the square were dormer windows similar in shape to the pinnacles these eight structures matched the eight sloping sides of the tower rising behind them so that the eye hardly noticed the change of shape from square to octagon however chartres was unnecessarily chunky by the standards of the fourteenth century merthins tower would have slender columns and large window openings to lighten the weight on the pillars below and to reduce stress by allowing the wind to blow through he made his own tracing floor at his workshop on the island he enjoyed himself planning the details doubling and quadrupling the narrow lancets of the old cathedral to make the large windows of the new tower updating the clusters of columns and the capitals he hesitated over the height he had no way to calculate how high it had to be in order to be visible from mudeford crossing that could be done only by trial and error when he had finished the stone tower he would have to erect a temporary spire then go to mudeford on a clear day and determine whether it could be seen the cathedral was built on elevated ground and at mudeford the road breasted a rise just before descending to the river crossing his instinct told him that if he went a little higher than chartres say about four hundred feet that would be sufficient the tower at salisbury cathedral was four hundred and four feet high merthin planned his to be four hundred and five while he was bent over the tracing floor drawing the roof pinnacles bill watkin appeared what do you think of this merthin said to him does it need a cross on top to point to heaven or an angel to watch over us neither said bill its not going to get built merthin stood up holding a straightedge in his left hand and a sharpened iron drawingneedle in his right what makes you say that ive had a visit from brother philemon i thought i might as well let you know as soon as possible what did that snake have to say he pretended to be friendly he wanted to give me a piece of advice for my own good he said it wouldnt be wise of me to support any plan for a tower designed by you why not because it would annoy prior godwyn who was not going to approve your plans regardless merthin could hardly be surprised if mark webber had become alderman the balance of power in the town would have changed and merthin might have won the commission to build the new tower but marks death meant the odds were against him he had clung to hope however and now he felt the deep ache of heavy disappointment i suppose hell commission elfric that was the implication will he never learn when a man is proud that counts for more than common sense will the parish guild pay for a stumpy little tower designed by elfric probably they may not get excited about it but theyll find the money they are proud of their cathedral despite everything elfrics incompetence almost cost them the bridge merthin said indignantly they know that he allowed his wounded feelings to show if i hadnt diagnosed the problem with the tower it would have collapsed and it might have brought down the entire cathedral they know that too but theyre not going to fight with the prior just because hes treated you badly of course not said merthin as if he thought that was perfectly reasonable but he was hiding his bitterness he had done more for kingsbridge than godwyn and he was hurt that the townspeople had not put up more of a fight for him but he also knew that most people most of the time acted in their own immediate selfinterest people are ungrateful bill said im sorry yes merthin said thats all right he looked at bill then looked away and then he threw down his drawing implements and walked off during the predawn service of lauds caris was surprised to look down the nave and see a woman in the north aisle on her knees in front of a wall painting of christ risen she had a candle by her side and in its unsteady light caris made out the chunky body and jutting chin of madge webber madge stayed there throughout the service not paying any attention to the psalms apparently deep in prayer perhaps she was asking god to forgive marks sins and let him rest in peace not that mark had committed many sins as far as caris knew more likely madge was asking mark to send her good fortune from the spirit world madge was going to carry on the cloth business with the help of her two older children it was the usual thing when a trader died leaving a widow and a thriving enterprise still no doubt she felt the need of her dead husbands blessing on her efforts but this explanation did not quite satisfy caris there was something intense in madges posture something about her stillness that suggested great passion as if she were begging heaven to grant her some terribly important boon when the service ended and the monks and nuns began to file out caris broke away from the procession and walked through the vast gloom of the nave towards the candles glow madge stood up at the sound of her footsteps when she recognized cariss face she spoke with a note of accusation mark died of the plague didnt he so that was it i think so said caris you didnt tell me im not sure and i didnt want to frighten you not to mention the whole town on the basis of a guess ive heard its come to bristol so the townspeople had been talking about it and london caris said she had heard this from a pilgrim what will happen to us all sorrow stabbed caris like a pain in the heart i dont know she lied it spreads from one to another i hear many illnesses do the aggression went out of madge and her face took on a pleading look that broke cariss heart in a nearwhisper she asked will my children die merthins wife got it caris said she died and so did all her family but merthin recovered and lolla didnt catch it at all so my children will be all right that was not what caris had said they may be or some may catch it and others escape that did not satisfy madge like most patients she wanted certainties not possibilities what can i do to protect them caris looked at the painting of christ youre doing all you can she said she began to lose control as a sob rose in her throat she turned away to hide her feelings and walked quickly out of the cathedral she sat in the nuns cloisters for a few minutes pulling herself together then went to the hospital as usual at this hour mair was not there she had probably been called to attend a sick person in the town caris took charge overseeing the serving of breakfast to guests and patients making sure the place was cleaned thoroughly checking on those who were sick the work eased her distress about madge she read a psalm to old julie when all the chores were done mair still had not appeared so caris went in search of her she found her in the dormitory lying face down on her bed cariss heart quickened mair are you all right she said mair rolled over she was pale and sweating she coughed but did not speak caris knelt beside her and placed a hand on her forehead youve got a fever she said suppressing the dread that rose in her belly like nausea when did it begin i was coughing yesterday mair said but i slept all right and got up this morning then when i went in to breakfast i suddenly felt i was going to throw up i went to the latrine then came here and lay down i think i might have been sleeping what time is it the bell is about to ring for terce but youre excused it could just be an ordinary illness caris told herself she touched mairs neck then pulled the cowl of her robe down mair smiled weakly are you trying to look at my chest yes you nuns are all the same there was no rash as far as caris could see perhaps it was just a cold any pains theres a dreadfully tender place in my armpit that did not tell caris much painful swellings in the armpits or groin were a feature of other illnesses as well as the plague lets get you down to the hospital she said as mair lifted her head caris saw bloodstains on the pillow she felt the shock like a blow mark webber had coughed blood and mair had been the first person to attend mark at the start of his illness she had gone to the house the day before caris did caris hid her fear and helped mair up tears came to her eyes but she controlled herself mair put her arm around cariss waist and her head on her shoulder as if she needed support walking caris put her arm around mairs shoulder together they walked down the stairs and through the nuns cloisters to the hospital caris took mair to a mattress near the altar she fetched a cup of cold water from the fountain in the cloisters mair drank thirstily caris bathed her face and neck with rose water after a while mair seemed to sleep the bell rang for terce caris was normally excused this service but today she felt the need for a few moments of quiet she joined the file of nuns walking into the church the old grey stones seemed cold and hard today she chanted automatically while in her heart a storm raged mair had the plague there was no rash but she had the fever she was thirsty and she had coughed blood she would probably die caris felt a terrible guilt mair loved her devotedly caris had never been able to return mairs love not in the way mair longed for now mair was dying caris wished she could have been different she ought to have been able to make mair happy she should be able to save her life she cried as she sang the psalm hoping that anyone who noticed her tears would assume she was moved by religious ecstasy at the end of the service a novice nun was waiting anxiously for her outside the south transept door theres someone asking for you urgently in the hospital the girl said caris found madge webber there her face white with fear caris did not need to ask what madge wanted she picked up her medical bag and the two of them rushed out they crossed the cathedral green in a biting november wind and went to the webber house in the main street upstairs madges children were waiting in the living room the two older children were sitting at the table looking frightened the young boys were both lying on the floor caris examined them quickly all four were feverish the girl had a nose bleed the three boys were coughing they all had a rash of purplishblack spots on their shoulders and necks madge said its the same isnt it this is what mark died of theyve got the plague caris nodded im sorry i hope i die too madge said then we can all be together in heaven in the hospital caris instituted the precautions merthin had told her about she cut up strips of linen for the nuns to tie over their mouths and noses while they were dealing with people who had the plague and she compelled everyone to wash their hands in vinegar and water every time they touched a patient the nuns all got chapped hands madge brought her four children in then fell ill herself old julie whose bed had been next to mark webbers while he was dying also succumbed there was little caris could do for any of them she bathed their faces to cool them gave them cold clear water to drink from the fountain in the cloisters cleaned up their bloody vomit and waited for them to die she was too busy to think about her own death she observed a kind of fearful admiration in the townspeoples eyes when they saw her soothing the brows of infectious plague victims but she did not feel like a selfless martyr she saw herself as the kind of person who disliked brooding and preferred to act like everyone else she was haunted by the question whos next but she firmly put it out of her mind prior godwyn came in to see the patients he refused to wear the face mask saying it was womens nonsense he made the same diagnosis as before overheated blood and prescribed bleeding and a diet of sour apples and rams tripes it did not matter much what the patients ate as they threw everything up towards the end but caris felt sure that taking blood from them made the illness worse they were already bleeding too much they coughed blood vomited blood and pissed blood but the monks were the trained physicians so she had to follow their instructions she did not have time to be angry whenever she saw a monk or nun kneeling at the bedside of a patient holding an arm out straight cutting into a vein with a small sharp knife and supporting the arm while a pint or more of precious blood dripped into a bowl on the floor caris sat with mair at the end holding her hand not caring if anyone disapproved to ease her torment she gave her a tiny amount of the euphoric drug mattie had taught her to make from poppies mair still coughed but it did not hurt her so much after a coughing fit her breathing would be easier for a short while and she could talk thank you for that night in calais she whispered i know you didnt really enjoy it but i was in heaven caris tried not to cry im sorry i couldnt be what you wanted you loved me though in your own way i know that she coughed again when the fit ended caris wiped the blood from her lips i love you mair said and closed her eyes caris let the tears come then not caring who saw or what they thought she watched mair through a watery film as she grew paler and breathed more shallowly until at last her breathing stopped caris remained where she was on the floor beside the mattress holding the hand of the corpse mair was still beautiful even like this white and forever still it occurred to caris that one other person loved her as mair had and that was merthin how strange that she had rejected his love too there was something wrong with her she thought some malformation of the soul that prevented her from being like other women and embracing love gladly later that night the four children of mark webber died and so did old julie caris was distraught was there nothing she could do the plague was spreading fast and killing everyone it was like living in a prison and wondering which of the inmates would be next to go to the gallows was kingsbridge to be like florence and bordeaux with bodies in the streets next sunday there would be a market on the green outside the cathedral hundreds of people from every village within walking distance would come to buy and sell and mingle with the townspeople in churches and taverns how many would go home fatally ill when she felt like this excruciatingly helpless up against terrible forces she understood why people threw up their hands and said everything was controlled by the spirit world but that had never been her way whenever a member of the priory died there was always a special burial service involving all the monks and nuns with extra prayers for the departed soul both mair and old julie had been well loved julie for her kind heart and mair for her beauty and many of the nuns wept madges children were included in the funeral with the result that several hundred townspeople came madge herself was too ill to leave the hospital they all gathered in the graveyard under a slategrey sky caris thought she could smell snow in the cold north wind brother joseph said the graveside prayers and six coffins were lowered into the ground a voice in the crowd asked the question that was on everyones mind are we all going to die brother joseph joseph was the most popular of the monkphysicians now close to sixty years old and with no teeth he was intellectual but had a warm bedside manner now he said were all going to die friend but none of us knows when thats why we must always be prepared to meet god betty baxter spoke up ever the probing questioner what can we do about the plague she said it is the plague isnt it the best protection is prayer joseph said and in case god has decided to take you regardless come to church and confess your sins betty was not so easily fobbed off merthin says that in florence people stayed in their homes to avoid contact with the sick is that a good idea i dont think so did the florentines escape the plague everyone looked at merthin standing with lolla in his arms no they didnt escape he said but perhaps even more would have died if they had done otherwise joseph shook his head if you stay at home you cant go to church holiness is the best medicine caris could not remain silent the plague spreads from one person to another she said angrily if you stay away from other people youve got a better chance of escaping infection prior godwyn spoke up so the women are the physicians now are they caris ignored him we should cancel the market she said it would save lives cancel the market he said scornfully and how would we do that send messengers to every village shut the city gates she replied block the bridge keep all strangers out of the town but there are already sick people in town close all taverns cancel meetings of all guilds prohibit guests at weddings merthin said in florence they even abandoned meetings of the city council elfric spoke up then how are people to do business if you do business youll die caris said and youll kill your wife and children too so choose betty baxter said i dont want to close my shop id lose a lot of money but ill do it to save my life cariss hopes lifted at this but then betty dashed them again what do the doctors say they know best caris groaned aloud prior godwyn said the plague has been sent by god to punish us for our sins the world has become wicked heresy lasciviousness and disrespect are rife men question authority women flaunt their bodies children disobey their parents god is angry and his rage is fearsome dont try to run from his justice it will find you no matter where you hide what should we do if you want to live you should go to church confess your sins pray and lead a better life caris knew it was useless to argue but all the same she said a starving man should go to church but he should also eat mother cecilia said sister caris you need say no more but we could save so many that will do this is life and death cecilia lowered her voice but no one is listening to you drop it caris knew cecilia was right no matter how long she argued people would believe the priests not her she bit her lip and said no more blind carlus started a hymn and the monks began to process back into the church the nuns followed and the crowd dispersed as they passed from the church into the cloisters mother cecilia sneezed every evening merthin put lolla to bed in the room at the bell he would sing to her or recite poems or tell her stories this was the time when she talked to him asking him the strangely unexpected questions of a threeyearold some childish some profound some hilarious tonight while he was singing a lullaby she burst into tears he asked her what the trouble was why did dora die she wailed so that was it madges daughter dora had taken to lolla they had spent time together playing counting games and plaiting one anothers hair she had the plague merthin said my mama had the plague lolla said she switched to the italian she had not quite forgotten la moria grande i had it too but i got better so did libia libia was the wooden doll she had carried all the way from florence did libia have the plague yes she sneezed felt hot and had spots but a nun made her better tm very pleased that means shes safe nobody gets it twice youre safe arent you yes that seemed like a good note on which to end go to sleep now goodnight she said he went to the door is bessie safe she said go to sleep i love bessie thats nice goodnight he closed the door downstairs the parlour was empty people were nervous about going to crowded places despite what godwyn said cariss message had gone home he could smell a savoury soup following his nose he went into the kitchen bessie was stirring a pot on the fire bean soup with ham she said merthin sat at the table with her father paul a big man now in his fifties he helped himself to bread while paul poured him a tankard of ale bessie served the soup bessie and lolla were becoming fond of one another he realized he had employed a nanny to take care of lolla during the day but bessie often watched lolla in the evening and lolla preferred her merthin owned a house on leper island but it was a small place especially by comparison with the palagetto he had become used to in florence he was happy to let jimmie go on living there merthin was comfortable here at the bell the place was warm and clean and there was plenty of hearty food and good drink he paid his bill every saturday but in other respects he was treated like a member of the family he was in no hurry to move into a place of his own on the other hand he could not live here for ever and when he did move out lolla might be upset to leave bessie behind too many of the people in her life had left it she needed stability perhaps he should move out now before she became too attached to bessie when they had eaten paul retired to bed bessie gave merthin another cup of ale and they sat by the fire how many people died in florence she said thousands tens of thousands probably no one could keep count i wonder whos next in kingsbridge i think about it all the time it might be me im afraid so id like to lie with a man one more time before i die merthin smiled but said nothing i havent been with a man since my richard passed away and thats more than a year you miss him how about you how long is it since you had a woman merthin had not had sex since silvia fell ill remembering her he felt a stab of grief he had been insufficiently grateful for her love about the same he said your wife yes rest her soul its a long time to go without loving yes but youre not the type to go with just anybody you want someone to love i suppose youre right im the same its wonderful to lie with a man the best thing in the world but only if you love one another truly ive only ever had one man my husband i never went with anyone else merthin wondered if that was true he could not be sure bessie seemed sincere but it was the kind of thing a woman would say anyway what about you she said how many women three your wife and before that caris and who else oh i remember griselda im not saying who they were dont worry everyone knows merthin smiled ruefully of course everyone did know perhaps they could not be sure but they guessed and they usually guessed right how old is griseldas little merthin now seven eight ten ive got fat knees bessie said she pulled up the skirt of her dress to show him ive always hated my knees but richard used to like them merthin looked her knees were plump and dimpled he could see her white thighs he would kiss my knees she said he was a sweet man she adjusted her dress as if straightening it but she lifted it and for a moment he glimpsed the dark inviting patch of hair at her groin he would kiss me all over sometimes especially after bathing i used to like that i liked everything a man can do what he likes to a woman who loves him dont you agree this had gone far enough merthin stood up i think youre probably right but this kind of talk leads only one way so im going to bed before i commit a sin she gave him a sad smile sleep well she said if you get lonely ill be here by the fire ill remember that they put mother cecilia on a bedstead not a mattress and placed it immediately in front of the altar the holiest place in the hospital nuns sang and prayed around her bed all day and all night in shifts there was always someone to bathe her face with cool rose water always a cup of clear fountain water at her side none of it made any difference she declined as fast as the others bleeding from her nose and her vagina her breathing becoming more and more laboured her thirst unquenchable on the fourth night after she sneezed she sent for caris caris was heavily asleep her days were exhausting the hospital was overflowing she was deep in a dream in which all the children in kingsbridge had the plague and as she rushed around the hospital trying to care for them all she suddenly realized that she too had caught it one of the children was tugging at her sleeve but she was ignoring it and desperately trying to figure out how she would cope with all these patients while she was so ill and then she realized someone was shaking her shoulder with increasing urgency saying wake up sister please the mother prioress needs you she came awake a novice knelt by her bed with a candle how is she caris asked shes sinking but she can still speak and she wants you caris got out of bed and put on her sandals it was a bitterly cold night she was wearing her nuns robe and she took the blanket from her bed and pulled it around her shoulders then she ran down the stone stairs the hospital was full of dying people the mattresses on the floor were lined up like fish bones so that those patients who were able to sit upright could see the altar families clustered around the beds there was a smell of blood caris took a clean length of linen from a basket by the door and tied it over her mouth and nose four nuns knelt beside cecilias bed singing cecilia lay back with her eyes closed and at first caris was afraid she had arrived too late then the old prioress seemed to sense her presence she turned her head and opened her eyes caris sat on the edge of the bed she dipped a rag in a bowl of rose water and wiped a smear of blood from cecilias upper lip cecilias breathing was tortured in between gasps she said has anyone survived this terrible illness only madge webber the one who didnt want to live all her children died im going to die soon dont say that you forget yourself we nuns have no fear of death all our lives we long to be united with jesus in heaven when death comes we welcome it the long speech exhausted her she coughed convulsively caris wiped blood from her chin yes mother prioress but those who are left behind may weep tears came to her eyes she had lost mair and old julie and now she was about to lose cecilia dont cry thats for the others you have to be strong i dont see why i think god has you in mind to take my place and become prioress in that case he has made a very odd choice caris thought he usually picks people whose view of him is more orthodox but she had long ago learned that there was no point in saying these things if the sisters choose me ill do my best i think theyll choose you im sure sister elizabeth will want to be considered elizabeth is clever but youre loving caris bowed her head cecilia was probably right elizabeth would be too harsh caris was the best person to run the nunnery even though she was sceptical of lives spent in prayer and hymnsinging she did believe in the school and the hospital heaven forbid that elizabeth should end up running the hospital theres something else cecilia lowered her voice and caris had to lean closer something prior anthony told me when he was dying he had kept it secret until the last and now ive done the same caris was not sure she wanted to be burdened with such a secret however the death bed seemed to overrule such scruples cecilia said the old king did not die of a fall caris was shocked it had happened more than twenty years ago but she remembered the rumours the killing of a king was the worst offence imaginable a double outrage combining murder with treason both of them capital crimes even knowing about such a thing was dangerous no wonder anthony had kept it a secret cecilia went on the queen and her lover mortimer wanted edward ii out of the way the heir to the throne was a little boy mortimer became king in all but name in the upshot it didnt last as long as he might have hoped of course young edward iii grew up too fast she coughed again more weakly mortimer was executed while i was an adolescent but even edward didnt want anyone to know what had really happened to his father so the secret was kept caris was awestruck queen isabella was still alive living in lavish circumstances in norfolk the revered mother of the king if people found out that she had her husbands blood on her hands there would be a political earthquake caris felt guilty just knowing about it so he was murdered she asked cecilia made no reply caris looked harder the prioress was still her face immobile her eyes staring upward she was dead the day after cecilia died godwyn asked sister elizabeth to have dinner with him this was a dangerous moment cecilias death unbalanced the power structure godwyn needed the nunnery because the monastery on its own was not viable he had never succeeded in improving its finances yet most of the nuns were now angry about the money he had taken from them and bitterly hostile to him if they fell under the control of a prioress bent on revenge caris perhaps it could mean the end of the monastery he was frightened of the plague too what if he caught it what if philemon died such flashes of nightmare unnerved him but he succeeded in pushing them to the back of his mind he was determined not to be distracted from his longterm purpose by the plague the election of the prioress was an immediate danger he had visions of the monastery closing down and himself leaving kingsbridge in disgrace being forced to become an ordinary monk in some other place subordinate to a prior who would discipline and humiliate him if that happened he thought he might kill himself on the other hand this was an opportunity as well as a threat if he handled things cleverly he might get a prioress sympathetic to him who would be content to let him take the lead and elizabeth was his best bet she would make an imperious leader one who would stand on her dignity but he could work with her she was pragmatic she had proved that the time she had warned him that caris was planning to audit the treasury she would be his ally she walked in with her head held high she knew she had suddenly become important and she was enjoying it godwyn realized he wondered anxiously if she would go along with the plan he was about to propose she might need careful handling she looked around the grand dining hall you built a splendid palace she said reminding him that she had helped him get the money for it she had never been inside the place he realized although it had been finished a year ago he preferred not to have females in the monks part of the priory only petranilla and cecilia had been admitted here until today he said thank you i believe it wins us respect from the noble and powerful already we have entertained the archbishop of monmouth here he had used the last of the nuns florins to buy tapestries showing scenes from the lives of the prophets she studied a picture of daniel in the lions den this is very good she said from arras she raised an eyebrow is that your cat under the sideboard godwyn tutted i cant get rid of it he lied he shooed it out of the room monks were not supposed to have pets but he found the cat a soothing presence they sat at one end of the long banqueting table he hated having a woman here sitting down to dinner as if she were just as good as a man but he hid his discomfort he had ordered an expensive dish pork cooked with ginger and apples philemon poured wine from gascony elizabeth tasted the pork and said delicious godwyn was not very interested in food except as a means of impressing people but philemon tucked in greedily godwyn got down to business how do you plan to win this election i believe im a better candidate than sister caris she said godwyn sensed the suppressed emotion with which she uttered the name clearly she was still angry that merthin had rejected her in favour of caris now she was about to enter another contest with her old rival she would kill to win this time he thought that was good philemon said to her why do you think youre better im older than caris elizabeth said ive been a nun longer and a priory officer longer and i was born and brought up in a deeply religious household philemon shook his head dismissively none of that will make any difference she raised her eyebrows startled by his bluntness and godwyn hoped philemon would not be too brutal we need her compliant he wanted to whisper dont get her back up philemon went on remorselessly youve only got one year of experience more than caris has and your father the bishop rest his soul will count against you after all bishops arent supposed to have children she flushed priors arent supposed to have cats were not discussing the prior he said impatiently his manner was insolent and godwyn winced godwyn was good at masking his hostility and putting on a façade of friendly charm but philemon had never learned that art however elizabeth took it coolly so did you ask me here to tell me i cant win she turned to godwyn its not like you to cook with costly ginger just for the pleasure of it youre quite right said godwyn we want you to become prioress and were going to do everything we can to help you philemon said and were going to start by taking a realistic look at your prospects caris is liked by everyone nuns monks merchants and nobility the job she does is a great advantage to her most of the monks and nuns and hundreds of townspeople have come to the hospital with ailments and been helped by her by contrast they rarely see you youre the treasurer thought of as cold and calculating i appreciate your frankness elizabeth said perhaps i should give up now godwyn could not tell whether she was being ironic you cant win philemon said but she can lose dont be enigmatic its tiresome elizabeth snapped just tell me in plain words what youre getting at i can see why shes not popular godwyn thought philemon pretended not to notice her tone your task in the next few weeks is to destroy caris he said you have to transform her in the nuns minds from a likeable hardworking compassionate sister into a monster a glint of eagerness came into elizabeths eye is that possible with our help yes go on is she still ordering nuns to wear linen masks in the hospital yes and wash their hands yes there is no basis for these practices in galen or any other medical authority and certainly none in the bible it seems a mere superstition elizabeth shrugged apparently the italian doctors believe the plague spreads through the air you catch it by looking at sick people or touching them or breathing their breath i dont see how and where did the italians get this idea perhaps just by observing patients i have heard merthin say that the italian doctors are the best except for the arabs elizabeth nodded ive heard that so this whole business of wearing masks probably comes from the muslims possibly in other words it is a heathen practice i suppose so philemon sat back as if he had proved a point elizabeth did not yet get it so we outmanoeuvre caris by saying she has introduced a heathen superstition into the nunnery not exactly said philemon with a crafty smile we say she is practising witchcraft she saw it then of course i had almost forgotten about that you testified against her at the trial it was a long time ago i would think youd never forget that your enemy was once accused of such a crime philemon said philemon himself certainly never forgot such things godwyn reflected knowing peoples weaknesses and exploiting them shamelessly was his speciality godwyn sometimes felt guilty about the sheer depth of philemons malice but that malice was so useful to godwyn that he always suppressed his misgivings who else could have dreamed up this way of poisoning the nuns minds against the beloved caris a novice brought apples and cheese and philemon poured more wine elizabeth said all right this makes sense have you thought about how in detail we should bring this up its important to prepare the ground philemon said you should never make an accusation such as this formally until its already believed by large numbers of people philemon was very good at this godwyn thought admiringly elizabeth said and how do you suggest we achieve that actions are better than words refuse to wear the mask yourself when asked shrug and say quietly that you have heard it is a muslim practice and you prefer christian means of protection encourage your friends to refuse the mask as a sign of support for you dont wash your hands too often either when you notice people following cariss precepts frown disapprovingly but say nothing godwyn nodded agreement philemons slyness sometimes approached the level of genius should we not even mention heresy talk about it as much as you like without connecting it directly to caris say that youve heard of a heretic being executed in another city or a devil worshipper who succeeded in depraving an entire nunnery perhaps in france i wouldnt wish to say anything that was not true elizabeth said stiffly philemon sometimes forgot that not everyone was as unscrupulous as he godwyn said hastily of course not philemon just means that you should repeat such stories if and when you hear them to remind the nuns of the everpresent danger very good the bell rang for nones and elizabeth stood up i mustnt miss the service i dont want someone to notice my absence and guess that ive been here quite right said godwyn anyway weve agreed our plan she nodded no masks godwyn could see that she was nursing a doubt he said you dont imagine theyre effective do you no she replied no of course not how could they be exactly thank you for dinner she went out that had gone well godwyn reflected but he was still worried he said anxiously to philemon elizabeth on her own might not be able to convince people that caris is still a witch i agree we may need to help with the process perhaps with a sermon exactly ill speak about the plague from the cathedral pulpit philemon looked thoughtful it might be dangerous to attack caris directly that could backfire godwyn agreed if there were open strife between himself and caris the townspeople would probably support her i wont mention her name just sow the seeds of doubt and let people come to their own conclusions ill blame heresy devil worship and heathenish practices godwyns mother petranilla came in she was very stooped and walked with two canes but her large head still jutted forward assertively on her bony shoulders how did that go she said she had urged godwyn to attack caris and had approved philemons plan elizabeth will do exactly as we wish godwyn said feeling pleased he enjoyed giving her good news good now i want to talk to you about something else she turned to philemon we wont need you for a moment philemon looked hurt like a child unexpectedly smacked brutally abrasive himself he was easily wounded however he recovered quickly and pretended to be untroubled and even a bit amused by her highhandedness of course madam he said with exaggerated deference godwyn said to him take charge of nones for me will you very good when he had gone petranilla sat at the big table and said i know it was me who urged you to foster that young mans talents but i have to admit that nowadays he makes my flesh crawl hes more useful than ever you can never really trust a ruthless man if he will betray others why should he not betray you ill remember that godwyn said though he felt he was now so bound up with philemon that it was hard to imagine operating without him however he did not want to tell his mother that changing the subject he said would you like a cup of wine she shook her head im already too liable to fall over sit down and listen to me very well mother he sat beside her at the table i want you to leave kingsbridge before this plague gets much worse i cant do that but you could go i dont matter im going to die soon anyway the thought filled godwyn with panic dont say that dont be stupid im sixty years old look at me i cant even stand upright its time for me to go but youre only fortytwo and youve got so much ahead you could be bishop archbishop even cardinal as always her limitless ambition for him made godwyn feel dizzy was he really capable of becoming a cardinal or was it just a mothers blindness he did not really know i dont want you to die of the plague before youve achieved your destiny she finished mother youre not going to die forget about me she said angrily i cant leave town i have to make sure the nuns dont make caris prioress get them to hold the election quickly failing that get out anyway and leave the election in gods hands he was terrified of the plague but he feared failure too i could lose everything if they elect caris her voice softened godwyn listen to me i have only one child and thats you i cant bear to lose you her sudden change of tone shocked him into silence she went on please i beg you get out of this city and go to some place where the plague cant reach you he had never known her to plead it was unnerving he felt scared just to stop her he said let me think about it this plague she said its like a wolf in the forest when you see it you dont think you run godwyn gave the sermon on the sunday before christmas it was a dry day with high pale cloud roofing the cold vault of heaven the central tower of the cathedral was covered by a birds nest of ropeandbranch scaffolding where elfric was demolishing it from the top down at the market on the green shivering traders did desultory business with a few preoccupied customers beyond the market the frozen grass of the cemetery was quilted with the brown rectangles of more than a hundred fresh graves but the church was full the frost that godwyn had noticed on the inside walls during prime had been dispersed by the warmth of thousands of bodies by the time he entered the church to perform the christmas service they huddled in their heavy earthcoloured coats and cloaks looking like cattle in a pen they had come because of the plague he knew the congregation of thousands of townspeople had been augmented by hundreds more from the surrounding countryside all in search of gods protection against an illness that had already struck at least one family in every city street and rural village godwyn sympathized even he had been praying more fervently lately normally only the people at the front solemnly followed the service those behind chatted to their friends and neighbours and the youngsters amused themselves at the back but today there was little noise from the nave all heads were turned to the monks and nuns watching with unusual attention as they performed the rituals the crowd murmured the responses scrupulously desperate to acquire what defensive holiness they could godwyn studied their faces reading their expressions what he saw there was dread like him they were wondering fearfully who would be the next to sneeze or suffer a nosebleed or come out in a rash of purpleblack spots right at the front he could see earl william with his wife philippa their two grown sons roland and richard and their much younger daughter odila who was fourteen william ruled the county in the same style as his father roland with order and justice and a firm hand that was occasionally cruel he looked worried an outbreak of plague in his earldom was something he could not control no matter how harsh he was philippa had her arm around the young girl as if to protect her next to them was sir ralph lord of tench ralph had never been any good at hiding his feelings and now he looked terrified his childwife was carrying a tiny baby boy godwyn had recently christened the child gerald after its grandfather who stood nearby with the grandmother maud godwyns eye moved along the line to ralphs brother merthin when merthin had returned from florence godwyn had hoped that caris would renounce her vows and leave the nunnery he thought she might be less of a nuisance as the mere wife of a citizen but it had not happened merthin was holding the hand of his little italian daughter next to them was bessie from the bell inn bessies father paul bell had succumbed to the plague already not far away was the family merthin had spurned elfric with his daughter griselda the little boy they had named merthin now ten and harry mason the husband griselda had wed after she gave up hope of the original merthin next to elfric was his second wife godwyns cousin alice elfric kept looking up he had built a temporary ceiling over the crossing while he tore down the tower and he was either admiring his work or worrying about it conspicuously absent was the bishop of shiring henri of mons the bishop normally gave the sermon on christmas day however he had not come so many clergy had died of the plague that the bishop was frantically busy visiting parishes and searching for replacements there was already talk of easing the requirements for priests and ordaining undertwentyfives and even illegitimate men godwyn stepped forward to speak he had a delicate task he needed to whip up fear and hatred of the most popular person in kingsbridge and he had to do it without mentioning her name indeed without even letting people think he was hostile to her they must turn on her with fury but when they did they had to believe it was their own idea not his not every service featured a sermon only at major solemnities attended by large crowds did he address the congregation and then he did not always preach often there were announcements messages from the archbishop or the king about national events military victories taxes royal births and deaths but today was special what is sickness he said the church was already quiet but the congregation became very still he had asked the question that was on everybodys mind why does god send illnesses and plagues to torment and kill us he caught the eye of his mother standing behind elfric and alice and he was suddenly reminded of her forecast that she would die soon for a moment he froze paralysed with fear unable to speak the congregation shifted restlessly waiting knowing he was losing their attention he felt panicky and that made his paralysis worse then the moment passed sickness is a punishment for sin he resumed over the years he had developed a preaching style he was not a ranter like friar murdo he spoke in a more conversational manner sounding like a reasonable man rather than a demagogue he wondered how suitable that was for whipping up the kind of hatred he wanted them to feel but philemon said it made him sound more convincing the plague is a special sickness so we know god is inflicting a special punishment on us there was a low collective sound between a murmur and a moan from the crowd this was what they wanted to hear he was encouraged we must ask ourselves what sins we have committed to merit such punishment as he said this he noticed madge webber standing alone last time she came to church she had had a husband and four children he thought of making the point that she had enriched herself using dyes concocted by witchcraft but he decided against that tactic madge was too well liked and respected i say to you that god is punishing us for heresy there are people in the world in this town even in this great cathedral today who question the authority of gods holy church and its ministers they doubt that the sacrament turns bread into the true body of christ they deny the efficacy of masses for the dead they claim that it is idolatry to pray before statues of the saints these were the usual heresies debated among student priests at oxford few people in kingsbridge cared about such arguments and godwyn saw disappointment and boredom on the faces in the crowd he sensed he was losing them again and he felt the panic rise desperately he added there are people in this city who practise witchcraft that got their attention there was a collective gasp we must be vigilant against false religion he said remember that only god can cure sickness prayer confession communion penance these are the remedies sanctioned by christianity he raised his voice a little all else is blasphemy this was not clear enough he decided he needed to be more specific for if god sends us a punishment and we try to escape it are we not defying his will we may pray to him to forgive us and perhaps in his wisdom he will heal our sickness but heretical cures will only make matters worse the audience was rapt and he warmed up i warn you magic spells appeals to the fairy folk unchristian incantations and especially heathen practices all are witchcraft all are forbidden by gods holy church his real audience today was the thirtytwo nuns standing behind him in the choir of the church so far only a few had registered their opposition to caris and their support for elizabeth by refusing to wear the mask against the plague as things stood caris would easily win next weeks election he needed to give the nuns the clear message that cariss medical ideas were heretical anyone who is guilty of such practices he paused for effect leaning forward and staring at the congregation anyone in town he turned and looked behind him at the monks and nuns in the choir or even in the priory he turned back i say anyone guilty of such practices should be shunned he paused for effect and may god have mercy on their souls paul bell was buried three days before christmas all those who stood at his frosty graveside in the december cold were invited to the bell to drink to his memory his daughter bessie now owned the place she did not want to grieve alone so she poured the taverns best ale generously lennie fiddler played sad tunes on his fivestringed instrument and the mourners became tearful and maudlin as they got drunker merthin sat in the corner with lolla at yesterdays market he had bought some sweet raisins from corinth an expensive luxury he was sharing them with lolla teaching her numbers at the same time he counted nine raisins for himself but when he was counting out hers he missed every other number saying one three five seven nine no she said thats not right she was laughing knowing that he was only teasing but i counted nine each he protested but youve got more well how did that happen you didnt count them right silly youd better count them then and see if you can do better bessie sat with them she was wearing her best dress which was a bit tight can i have some raisins she said lolla said yes but dont let daddy count them dont worry bessie said i know his tricks here you are merthin said to bessie one three nine thirteen oh thirteen is too many id better take some away he took back three raisins twelve eleven ten there now youve got ten raisins lolla thought this was hysterically funny but shes only got one she said did i count them wrong again yes she looked at bessie we know his tricks you count them then the door opened letting in a blast of icy air caris came in wrapped in a heavy cloak merthin smiled every time he saw her he felt glad she was still alive bessie looked at her warily but spoke a welcome hello sister she said its kind of you to remember my father caris said im very sorry you have lost him he was a good man she too was being formally polite merthin realized that these two women saw themselves as rivals for his affections he did not know what he had done to deserve such devotion thank you bessie said to caris will you have a cup of ale thats very kind but no i need to speak to merthin bessie looked at lolla shall we roast some nuts on the fire yes please bessie took lolla away they get on well together caris said merthin nodded bessie has a warm heart and no children of her own caris looked sad i have no children but perhaps i havent got the warm heart merthin touched her hand i know better he said you have such a warm heart you have to take care of not just one or two children but dozens of people its kind of you to see it that way its true thats all how are things at the hospital unbearable the place is full of people dying and i cant do anything for them except bury them merthin felt a surge of compassion she was always so competent so reliable but the strain told on her and she was willing to show it to him if to no one else you look tired he said i am god knows i suppose youre worrying about the election too i came to ask for your help with that merthin hesitated he was torn by contradictory feelings part of him wanted her to achieve her ambition and become prioress but then would she ever be his wife he had a shamefully selfish hope that she would lose the election and renounce her vows all the same he wanted to give her whatever help she asked for just because he loved her all right he said godwyns sermon yesterday hurt me will you never be rid of that old accusation of witchcraft its so absurd people are stupid the sermon had a big impact on the nuns as was intended of course no doubt of it few of them believed elizabeth when she said that my linen masks were heathenish only her close friends discarded the mask cressie elaine jeannie rosie and simone but when the others heard the message from the pulpit of the cathedral it was different the more impressionable sisters have all now discarded the mask a few avoid making an obvious choice by never coming into the hospital only a handful still wear it me and four nuns im close to i was afraid of this now that mother cecilia mair and old julie are dead there are only thirtytwo nuns eligible to vote seventeen votes are all you need to win elizabeth originally had five sworn supporters the sermon has given her eleven more with her own vote that makes seventeen i have only five and even if all the waverers came over to me i would lose merthin felt angry on her behalf it must be hurtful to be rejected like this after all she had done for the nunnery what can you do the bishop is my last hope if he sets his face against elizabeth and announces that he will not ratify her election some of her support may fall away and i could have a chance how can you influence him i cant but you could or at least the parish guild could i suppose so they have a meeting this evening youll be there i imagine yes think about it godwyn already has the town in a stranglehold hes close to elizabeth her family are tenants of the priory and godwyn has always been careful to favour them if she becomes prioress she will be as compliant as elfric godwyn will have no opposition in or out of the priory it will be the death of kingsbridge thats true but whether the guildsmen will agree to intercede with the bishop suddenly she looked terribly disheartened just try if they turn you down so be it her desperation touched him and he wished he could be more optimistic i will of course thank you she stood up you must have conflicting feelings about this thank you for being a true friend he smiled wryly he wanted to be her husband not her friend but he would take what he could get she went out into the cold merthin joined bessie and lolla at the fireside and sampled their roasted nuts but he was preoccupied godwyns influence was malign but all the same his power never ceased to grow why was that perhaps because he was an ambitious man with no conscience a potent combination as darkness fell he put lolla to bed and paid a neighbours daughter to watch her bessie left the barmaid sairy in charge of the tavern wearing heavy cloaks they walked up the main street to the guild hall for the midwinter meeting of the parish guild at the back of the long room there was a seasonal barrel of ale for the members the merrymaking seemed to have a driven quality this christmas merthin thought they had been drinking hard at paul bells wake and some of those people now followed merthin in and filled their tankards again as eagerly as if they had not tasted ale for a week perhaps it took their minds off the plague bessie was one of four people introduced as new members the other three were eldest sons of leading merchants who had died godwyn as overlord of the townspeople must be enjoying a rise in his income from inheritance tax merthin realized when the routine business had been dealt with merthin raised the subject of the election of the new prioress thats none of our business elfric said immediately on the contrary the result will affect commerce in this town for years to come perhaps decades merthin argued the prioress is one of the richest and most powerful people in kingsbridge and we ought to do what we can to get one who will do nothing to fetter trade but theres nothing we can do we have no vote we have influence we could petition the bishop its never been done before thats not much of an argument bill watkin interrupted who are the candidates merthin replied sorry i thought youd know sister caris and sister elizabeth i think we should support caris of course you do said elfric and we all know why there was a ripple of laughter everyone knew about the longstanding onoff love affair between merthin and caris merthin smiled go on laugh i dont mind just remember that caris grew up in the wool business and helped her father so she understands the problems and challenges that merchants face whereas her rival is the daughter of a bishop and more likely to sympathize with the prior elfric was looking red in the face partly because of the ale he had drunk merthin thought but mainly through anger why do you hate me merthin he said merthin was surprised i thought it was the other way around you seduced my daughter then refused to marry her you tried to prevent my building the bridge i thought wed got rid of you then you came back and humiliated me over the cracks in the bridge you hadnt been back more than a few days before you tried to get me ousted as alderman and replaced by your friend mark you even hinted that the cracks in the cathedral were my fault although it was built before i was born i repeat why do you hate me merthin did not know what to say how could elfric not know what he had done to merthin but merthin did not want to have this argument in front of the parish guild it seemed childish i dont hate you elfric you were a cruel master when i was an apprentice and youre a slipshod builder and you toady to godwyn but all the same i dont hate you one of the new members joseph blacksmith said is this what you do at the parish guild have stupid arguments merthin felt hard done by it was not he who had introduced the personal note but for him to say that would be seen as continuing a stupid argument so he said nothing and reflected that elfric was ever sly joes right said bill watkin we didnt come here to listen to elfric and merthin squabbling merthin was troubled by bills willingness to put him and elfric on the same level generally the guildsmen liked him and felt mildly hostile to elfric since the dispute over the bridge cracks indeed they would have ousted elfric if mark had not died but something had changed merthin said can we return to the matter in hand which is petitioning the bishop to favour caris as prioress im against it elfric said prior godwyn wants elizabeth a new voice spoke up im with elfric we dont want to quarrel with the father prior it was marcel chandler who had the contract to supply wax candles to the priory godwyn was his biggest customer merthin was not surprised however the next speaker shocked him it was jeremiah builder who said i dont think we should favour someone who has been accused of heresy he spat on the floor twice left and right and crossed himself merthin was too surprised to reply jeremiah had always been fearfully superstitious but merthin would never have imagined it would lead him to betray his mentor it was left to bessie to defend caris that charge was always ludicrous she said it was never disproved though said jeremiah merthin stared at him but jeremiah would not meet his eye whats got into you jimmie merthin said i dont want to die of the plague jeremiah said you heard the sermon anyone practising heathen remedies should be shunned were talking about asking the bishop to make her prioress thats not shunning her there was a murmur of assent and merthin realized that the tide of opinion had turned the others were not as credulous as jeremiah but they shared his fear the plague had spooked them all undermining their rationality godwyns sermon had been more effective than merthin had imagined he was ready to give up then he thought of caris and how weary and demoralized she had looked and he gave it one more try ive lived through this once in florence he said i warn you now priests and monks wont save anyone from the plague youll have handed the town to godwyn on a plate and all for nothing jeremiah said that sounds awfully close to blasphemy merthin looked around the others agreed with jeremiah they were too scared to think straight there was nothing more he could do they decided to take no action on the election for prioress and soon afterwards the meeting broke up in somewhat bad humour the members taking burning sticks from the fire to light their way home merthin decided it was too late to report to caris the nuns like the monks went to bed at nightfall and got up in the early hours of the morning however there was a figure wrapped in a big wool cloak waiting outside the guild hall and to his surprise his torch revealed the troubled face of caris what happened she said anxiously i failed he said im sorry in the torchlight she looked wounded what did they say they wont intervene they believed the sermon fools together they walked down the main street at the priory gates merthin said leave the nunnery caris not for my sake but for your own you cant work under elizabeth she hates you and shell block everything you want to do she hasnt won yet she will though you said so yourself renounce your vows and marry me marriage is a vow if i break my vow to god why would you trust me to keep my promise to you he smiled ill risk it let me think about it youve been thinking about it for months merthin said with resentment if you dont leave now you never will i cant leave now people need me more than ever he began to feel angry i wont keep asking for ever i know in fact i wont ask you again after tonight she began to cry im sorry but i cant abandon the hospital in the midst of a plague the hospital and the people of the town but what about yourself the flame of his torch made her tears glisten they need me so badly theyre ungrateful all of them nuns monks townspeople i should know by god it makes no difference he nodded accepting her decision suppressing his selfish anger it thats how you feel you must do your duty thank you for understanding i wish this had turned out differently so do i youd better take this torch thank you she took the burning branch from his hand and turned away he watched her thinking is this how it ends is this all she walked away with her characteristic stride determined and confident but her head was bowed she passed through the gateway and disappeared the lights of the bell shone cheerfully through the gaps around the shutters and the door he went inside the last few customers were saying drunken farewells and sairy was collecting tankards and wiping tables merthin checked on lolla who was fast asleep and paid the girl who had been watching her he thought of going to bed but he knew he would not sleep he was too upset why had he run out of patience tonight as opposed to any other time he had got angry but his anger came from fear he realized as he calmed down underneath it all he was terrified that caris would catch the plague and die he sat on a bench in the parlour of the inn and took off his boots he stayed there staring into the fire wondering why he could not have the one thing in life that he wanted most bessie came in and hung up her cloak sairy left and bessie locked up she sat opposite merthin taking the big chair that her father had always used im sorry about what happened at the guild she said im not sure whos right but i know youre disappointed thank you for supporting me anyway ill always support you perhaps its time for me to stop fighting cariss battles i agree with that but i can see that it makes you sad sad and angry i seem to have wasted half my life waiting for caris love is never wasted he looked up at her surprised after a pause he said youre a wise person theres no one else in the house except for lolla she said all the christmas guests have left she got up from her chair and knelt in front of him id like to comfort you she said any way i can he looked at her round friendly face and felt his body stir in response it was such a long time since he had held the soft body of a woman in his arms but he shook his head i dont want to use you she smiled im not asking you to marry me im not even asking you to love me ive just buried my father and youve been disappointed by caris and were both in need of someone warm to hold on to to dull the pain like a jug of wine she took his hand and kissed the palm better than wine she said she pressed his hand to her breast it was big and soft and he sighed as he caressed it she turned her face up and he leaned down and kissed her lips she gave a little moan of pleasure the kiss was delicious like a cold drink on a hot day and he did not want to stop eventually she broke away from him panting she stood upright and pulled her woollen dress over her head her naked body looked rosy in the firelight she was all curves round hips round belly round breasts still seated he put his hands on her waist and drew her to him he kissed the warm skin of her belly then the pink tips of her breasts he looked up at her flushed face do you want to go upstairs he murmured no she said breathlessly i cant wait that long the election for prioress was held on the day after christmas that morning caris felt so depressed she could hardly get out of bed when the bell rang for matins in the early hours she was strongly tempted to put her head under the blankets and say that she did not feel well but she could not pretend when so many were dying so in the end she forced herself she shuffled around the icecold flagstones of the cloisters side by side with elizabeth the two of them at the head of the procession to the church this protocol had been agreed because neither would yield precedence to the other while they were competing in the election but caris no longer cared the result was a foregone conclusion she stood yawning and shivering in the choir through the psalms and readings she was angry later today elizabeth would be elected prioress caris resented the nuns for rejecting her she hated godwyn for his enmity and she despised the towns merchants for refusing to intervene she felt as if her life had been a failure she had not built the new hospital she had dreamed of and now she never would she also resented merthin for making her an offer she could not accept he did not understand for him their marriage would be an adjunct to his life as an architect for her marriage would have to replace the work to which she had dedicated herself that was why she had vacillated for so many years it was not that she did not want him she longed for him with a hunger that she could hardly bear she mumbled the last of the responses and then mechanically walked out of the church at the front of the line as they walked around the cloisters again someone behind her sneezed she was too dispirited even to look and see who it was the nuns climbed the stairs to their dormitory when caris entered the room she heard heavy breathing and realized that someone had stayed behind her candle revealed the novice mistress sister simone a dour middleaged woman normally a conscientious nun not one to malinger caris bound a strip of linen around her own face then knelt by simones mattress simone was perspiring and looking scared caris said how do you feel awful simone said ive had strange dreams caris touched her forehead she was burning hot simone said can i have something to drink in a moment its just a cold i expect youre certainly running a fever i havent got the plague though have i its not that bad well take you to the hospital anyway caris said evasively can you walk simone struggled to her feet caris took a blanket off the bed and wrapped it around simones shoulders as they were heading for the door caris heard a sneeze this time she could see that it came from sister rosie the plump matricularius caris looked hard at rosie who appeared scared caris picked another nun at random sister cressie take simone to the hospital while i look at rosie cressie took simones arm and led her down the stairs caris held her candle up to rosies face she too was perspiring caris pulled down the neck of her robe there was a rash of small purple spots over her shoulders and breasts no rosie said no please it may be nothing at all caris lied i dont want to die of the plague rosie said her voice cracking caris said quietly just keep calm and come with me she took rosies arm firmly rosie resisted no ill be all right try saying a prayer caris said ave maria come on rosie began to pray and a moment later caris was able to lead her away the hospital was crammed with dying people and their families most of them awake despite the hour there was a strong odour of sweaty bodies vomit and blood the place was dimly lit by tallow lamps and the candles on the altar a handful of nuns attended to the patients bringing water and cleaning up some wore the mask others did not brother joseph was there the oldest of the monkphysicians and the most well liked he was giving the last rites to rick silvers the head of the jewellers guild bending to hear the mans whispered confession surrounded by the children and grandchildren caris made a space for rosie and persuaded her to lie down one of the nuns brought her a cup of clear fountain water rosie lay still but her eyes shifted restlessly this way and that she knew her fate and she was frightened brother joseph will come and see you shortly caris told her you were right sister caris said rosie what do you mean simone and i were among the original friends of sister elizabeth who refused to wear the mask and look what has happened to us caris had not thought of this would she be proved horribly right by the deaths of those who disagreed with her she would rather be wrong she went to look at simone she was lying down and holding the hand of cressie simone was older and calmer than rosie but there was fear in her eyes and she was gripping cressies hand hard caris glanced at cressie there was a dark stain above her lip caris reached out and wiped it with her sleeve cressie too was among the original group who had abandoned the mask she looked at the mark on cariss sleeve what is it she said blood said caris the election took place in the refectory an hour before dinner time caris and elizabeth were side by side behind a table at one end of the room and the nuns sat on benches in rows everything had changed simone rosie and cressie lay in the hospital stricken by the plague here in the refectory the other two who had originally refused the mask elaine and jeannie were both showing early symptoms elaine sneezing and jeannie sweating brother joseph who had been treating plague victims without a mask since the beginning had at last succumbed all the remaining nuns had resumed wearing the masks in the hospital if the mask was still a sign of support for caris she had won they were tense and restless sister beth the former treasurer and now the oldest nun read a prayer to open the meeting almost before she had finished several nuns spoke at once the voice that prevailed was that of sister margaret the former cellarer caris was right and elizabeth was wrong she cried those who refused the mask are now dying there was a collective rumble of agreement caris said i wish it were otherwise id rather have rosie and simone and cressie sitting here voting against me she meant it she was sick of seeing people die it made her think how trivial everything else was elizabeth stood up i propose we postpone the election she said three nuns are dead and three more are in the hospital we should wait until the plague is over that took caris by surprise she had thought there was nothing elizabeth could do to avoid defeat but she had been wrong no one would now vote for elizabeth but her supporters might prefer to avoid making any choice at all cariss apathy vanished suddenly she remembered all the reasons why she wanted to be prioress to improve the hospital to teach more girls to read and write to help the town prosper it would be a catastrophe if elizabeth were elected instead elizabeth was immediately supported by old sister beth we shouldnt hold the election in a panic and make a choice we might regret later when things have calmed down her statement sounded rehearsed elizabeth had obviously planned this but the argument was not unreasonable caris thought with some trepidation margaret said indignantly beth you only say that because you know elizabeth is going to lose caris held back from speaking for fear of prompting the same argument against herself sister naomi who was not committed to either side said the trouble is we have no leader mother cecilia rest her soul never appointed a subprioress after natalie died is that so bad elizabeth said yes margaret said we cant even make up our minds who is to go first in the procession caris decided to risk making a practical point there is a long list of decisions that need to be taken especially about inheritance of nunnery properties whose tenants have died of the plague it would be difficult to go much longer with no prioress sister elaine one of the original five friends of elizabeth now argued against postponement i hate elections she said she sneezed then went on they set sister against sister and cause acrimony i want to get this over with so that we can be united in the face of this dreadful plague that raised a cheer of support elizabeth glared angrily at elaine elaine caught her eye and said you see i cant even make a pacific remark like that without elizabeth looking at me as if ive betrayed her elizabeth dropped her gaze margaret said come on lets vote whoever is for elizabeth say aye for a moment no one spoke then beth said quietly aye caris waited for someone else to speak but beth was the only one cariss heart beat faster was she about to achieve her ambition margaret said who is for caris the response was instant there was a shout of aye it seemed to caris that almost all the nuns voted for her ive done it she thought im prioress now we can really begin margaret said in that case a male voice suddenly said wait several nuns gasped and one screamed they all looked at the door philemon stood there he must have been listening outside caris thought he said before you go any farther caris was not having this she stood up and interrupted him how dare you enter the nunnery she said you do not have permission and you are not welcome leave now im sent by the lord prior he has no right he is the senior religious in kingsbridge and in the absence of a prioress or a subprioress he has authority over the nuns we are no longer without a prioress brother philemon caris advanced towards him i have just been elected the nuns hated philemon and they all cheered he said father godwyn refuses to permit this election too late tell him mother caris is now in charge of the nunnery and she threw you out philemon backed away you are not prioress until your election has been ratified by the bishop out said caris the nuns took up the chant out out out philemon was intimidated he was not used to being defied she took another step towards him and he took another back he looked amazed by what was happening but also scared the chanting got louder suddenly he turned around and scurried out the nuns laughed and cheered but caris realized that his parting remark had been true her election would have to be ratified by bishop henri and godwyn would do everything in his power to prevent that a team of volunteers from the town had cleared an acre of rough woodland on the far side of the river and godwyn was in the process of consecrating the new land as a cemetery every churchyard within the town walls was full and the available space in the cathedral graveyard was shrinking fast godwyn paced the borders of the plot in a biting cold wind sprinkling holy water that froze when it hit the ground while monks and nuns marched behind him singing a psalm although the service was not yet over the gravediggers were already at work humps of raw earth stood in neat lines beside straightsided pits placed as close together as possible to save space but an acre would not last long and men were already at work clearing the next patch of woodland at moments such as this godwyn had to struggle to keep his composure the plague was like an incoming tide submerging everyone in its path unstoppable the monks had buried a hundred people during the week before christmas and the numbers were still rising brother joseph had died yesterday and two more monks were now ill where would it end would everyone in the world die would godwyn himself die he was so scared that he stopped staring at the gold aspergillum with which he was sprinkling the holy water as if he had no idea how it had got into his hand for a moment he was so panicked that he could not move then philemon at the head of the procession pushed him gently from behind godwyn stumbled forward and resumed his march he had to thrust these frightening thoughts from his mind he turned his brain to the problem of the nuns election reaction to his sermon had been so favourable that he had thought elizabeths victory secure the tide had turned with shocking rapidity and the infuriating revival in cariss popularity had taken him by surprise philemons lastditch intervention had been a desperate measure taken just too late when he thought of it godwyn wanted to scream but it was not yet over caris had mocked philemon but the truth was that she could not consider her position safe until she had bishop henris approval unfortunately godwyn had not yet had a chance to ingratiate himself with henri the new bishop who spoke no english had visited kingsbridge only once because he was so new philemon had not yet learned whether he had any fatal weaknesses but he was a man and a priest so he ought to side with godwyn against caris godwyn had written to henri saying that caris had bewitched the nuns into thinking she could save them from the plague he had detailed cariss history the accusation of heresy the trial and sentence eight years ago the rescue by cecilia he hoped henri would arrive in kingsbridge with his mind firmly prejudiced against caris but when would henri come it was extraordinary for the bishop to miss the christmas service in the cathedral a letter from the efficient unimaginative archdeacon lloyd had explained that henri was busy appointing clergy to replace those who had died of the plague lloyd might be against godwyn he was earl williams man owing his position to williams late brother richard and the father of william and richard earl roland had hated godwyn but lloyd would not make the decision henri would it was hard to know what might happen godwyn felt he had lost control his career was threatened by caris and his life was threatened by a remorseless plague a light snowfall began as the ceremony of consecration came to an end just beyond the cleared plot seven funeral processions were at a standstill waiting for the cemetery to be ready at godwyns signal they moved forward the first body was in a coffin but the rest were in shrouds on biers in the best of times coffins were a luxury for the prosperous but now that timber had become expensive and coffinmakers were overworked it was only the very rich who could afford to be buried in a wooden casket at the head of the first procession was merthin with snowflakes caught in his copperred hair and beard he was carrying his little girl the wealthy deceased in the coffin must be bessie bell godwyn deduced bessie had died without relatives and left the tavern to merthin money sticks to that man like wet leaves godwyn thought sourly merthin already had leper island and the fortune he had made in florence now he owned the busiest tavern in kingsbridge godwyn knew about bessies will because the priory was entitled to an inheritance tax and had taken a fat percentage of the value of the place merthin had paid the money in gold florins without hesitation the one good consequence of the plague was that the priory suddenly had plenty of cash godwyn conducted one burial service for all seven bodies this was now the norm one funeral in the morning and one in the afternoon regardless of the number of dead there were not enough priests in kingsbridge to bury each person individually that thought renewed godwyns feeling of dread he stumbled over the words of the service seeing himself in one of the graves then he managed to take hold of himself and continue at last the service was over and he led the procession of monks and nuns back to the cathedral they entered the church and fell out of formation in the nave the monks returned to their normal duties a novice nun approached godwyn nervously and said father prior would you kindly come to the hospital godwyn did not like to receive bossy messages via novices what for he snapped im sorry father i dont know i was just told to ask you ill come as soon as i can he said irritably he did not have anything urgent to do but just to make the point he delayed in the cathedral speaking to brother eli about the monks robes a few minutes later he crossed the cloisters and entered the hospital nuns were crowded around a bedstead that had been set up in front of the altar they must have an important patient he thought he wondered who it was one ol the attendant nuns turned to him she wore a linen mask over her nose and mouth but he recognized the goldflecked green eyes that he and all his family shared it was caris although he could see so little of her face he read an odd expression in her look he expected dislike and contempt but instead he saw compassion he moved closer to the bed with a feeling of trepidation when the other nuns saw him they moved aside deferentially a moment later he saw the patient it was his mother petranillas large head lay on a white pillow she was sweating and there was a steady trickle of blood from her nose a nun was in the act of wiping it away but it reappeared another nun offered the patient a cup of water there was a rash of purple spots on the wrinkled skin of petranillas throat godwyn cried out as if he had been struck he stared in horror his mother gazed at him with suffering eyes there was no room for doubt she had fallen victim to the plague no he shouted no no he felt an unbearable pain in his chest as if he had been stabbed he heard philemon beside him say in a frightened voice try to stay calm father prior but he could not he opened his mouth to scream but no sound came he suddenly felt detached from his body with no control over his movements then a black mist arose from the floor and engulfed him gradually rising up his body until it covered his nose and mouth so that he could not breathe and then his eyes so that he was blind and at last he lost consciousness godwyn was in bed for five days he ate nothing and drank only when philemon put a cup to his lips he could not think straight he could not move for it seemed he had no way of deciding what to do he sobbed and slept then woke up and sobbed again he was vaguely aware of a monk feeling his forehead taking a urine sample diagnosing brain fever and bleeding him then on the last day of december a scaredlooking philemon brought him the news that his mother was dead godwyn got up he had himself shaved put on a new robe and went to the hospital the nuns had washed and dressed the body petranillas hair was brushed and she wore a dress of costly italian wool seeing her like that with the pallor of death on her face and her eyes forever closed godwyn felt a resurgence of the panic that had overwhelmed him but this time he was able to fight it down take her body to the cathedral he ordered normally the honour of lying in state in the cathedral was reserved for monks nuns senior clergymen and the aristocracy but godwyn knew that no one would dare to contradict him when she had been moved into the church and placed in front of the altar he knelt beside her and prayed prayer helped him calm his terror and gradually he figured out what to do when at last he stood up he ordered philemon to call a meeting in the chapter house immediately he felt shaky but he knew he had to pull himself together he had always been blessed with the power of persuasion now he had to use it to the utmost when the monks had gathered he read to them from the book of genesis and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him godwyn looked up from the book the monks were watching him intently they all knew the story of abraham and isaac they were more interested in him godwyn they were alert wary wondering what would come next what does the story of abraham and isaac teach us he asked rhetorically god tells abraham to kill his son not just his eldest son but his only son born when he was a hundred years old did abraham protest did he plead for mercy did he argue with god did he point out that to kill isaac would be murder infanticide a terrible sin godwyn let the question hang for a moment then looked down at the book and read and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass he looked up again god may tempt us too he may order us to perform acts which seem wrong perhaps he will tell us to do something that appears to be a sin when that happens we must remember abraham godwyn was speaking in what he knew was his most persuasive preaching style rhythmic yet conversational he could tell that he had their rapt attention by the quiet in the octagonal chapter house no one fidgeted whispered or shuffled we must not question he said we must not argue when god leads us we must follow no matter how foolish sinful or cruel his wishes may seem to our feeble human minds we are weak and humble our understanding is fallible it is not given to us to make decisions or choices our duty is simple it is to obey then he told them what they had to do the bishop arrived after dark it was almost midnight when the entourage entered the precinct they had ridden by torchlight most of the priory had been in bed for hours but there was a group of nuns at work in the hospital and one of them came to wake caris the bishop is here she said why does he want me caris asked sleepily i dont know mother prior of course she didnt caris pulled herself out of bed and put on a cloak she paused in the cloisters she took a long drink of water and for a few moments she breathed deeply of the cold night air clearing her head of sleep she wanted to make a good impression on the bishop so that there would be no trouble about his ratifying her election as prioress archdeacon lloyd was in the hospital looking tired the pointed tip of his long nose red with cold come and greet your bishop he said crossly as if she ought to have been up and waiting she followed him out a servant stood outside the door with a burning torch they walked across the green to where the bishop sat on his horse he was a small man in a big hat and he looked thoroughly fed up caris said in norman french welcome to kingsbridge priory my lord bishop henri said peevishly who are you caris had seen him before but had never spoken to him i am sister caris prioresselect the witch her heart sank godwyn must have already tried to poison henris mind against her she felt indignant no my lord bishop there are no witches here she said with more acerbity than was prudent just a group of ordinary nuns doing their best for a town that has been stricken by the plague he ignored that where is prior godwyn in his palace no hes not archdeacon lloyd explained weve been there the building is empty really yes the archdeacon said irritably really at that moment caris spotted godwyns cat with the distinctive white tip to its tail the novices called it archbishop it walked across the west front of the cathedral and looked into the spaces between the pillars as if searching for its master caris was taken aback how strange perhaps godwyn decided to sleep in the dormitory with the other monks and why would he do that i hope theres no impropriety going on caris shook her head dismissively the bishop suspected unchastity but godwyn was not prone to that particular sin he reacted badly when his mother caught the plague he had some kind of fit and collapsed she died today if hes been unwell i should have thought he was all the more likely to sleep in his own bed anything might have happened godwyn was slightly unhinged by petranillas illness caris said would the lord bishop like to speak to one of his deputies henri answered crossly if i could find one yes perhaps if i take archdeacon lloyd to the dormitory as soon as you like lloyd got a torch from a servant and caris led him quickly through the cathedral into the cloisters the place was silent as monasteries generally were at this time of night they reached the foot of the staircase that led up to the dormitory and caris stopped youd better go up alone she said a nun should not see monks in bed of course lloyd went up the stairs with his torch leaving her in darkness she waited curious she heard him shout hello there was a strange silence then after a few moments he called down to her in an odd voice sister yes you can come up mystified she climbed the stairs and entered the dormitory she stood beside lloyd and peered into the room by the unsteady light or the burning torch the monks straw mattresses lay neatly in their places along either side of the room but not one of them was occupied theres no one here caris said not a soul lloyd agreed what on earth has happened i dont know but i can guess said caris then enlighten me please isnt it obvious she said theyve run away part six january to january when godwyn left he took with him all the valuables from the monks treasury and all the charters this included the nuns charters which they had never succeeded in retrieving from his locked chest he also took the sacred relics including the bones of st adolphus in their priceless reliquary caris discovered this on the morning afterwards the first day of january the feast of the circumcision of christ she went with bishop henri and sister elizabeth to the treasury off the south transept henris attitude to her was stiffly formal which was worrying but he was a peevish character so perhaps he was like that with everyone the flayed skin of gilbert hereford was still nailed to the door slowly turning hard and yellow and giving off a faint but distinct whiff of rottenness but the door was not locked they went in caris had not been inside this room since prior godwyn stole the nuns one hundred and fifty pounds to build his palace after that they had built their own treasury it was immediately obvious what had happened the flagstones that disguised the vaults in the floor had been lifted and not put back and the lid of the ironbound chest stood open vaults and chest were empty caris felt that her contempt for godwyn was vindicated a trained physician a priest and the leader of the monks he had fled just at the moment when the people needed him most now surely everyone would realize his true nature archdeacon lloyd was outraged he took everything caris said to henri and this is the man who wanted you to annul my election bishop henri grunted noncommittally elizabeth was desperate to find an excuse for godwyns behaviour im sure the lord prior took the valuables with him for safekeeping that stung the bishop into a response rubbish he said crisply if your servant empties your purse and disappears without warning hes not keeping your money safe hes stealing it elizabeth tried a different tack i believe this was philemons idea the subprior henri looked scornful godwyn is in charge not philemon godwyn is responsible elizabeth shut up godwyn must have recovered from the death of his mother caris thought at least temporarily it was quite an achievement to persuade every single one of the monks to follow him she wondered where they had gone bishop henri was thinking the same thing where did the wretched cowards go caris remembered merthin trying to persuade her to leave to wales or ireland he had said a remote village where they dont see a stranger from one year to the next she said to the bishop they will be hiding out in some isolated place where no one ever goes find out exactly where he said caris realized that all opposition to her election had vanished with godwyn she felt triumphant and made an effort not to look too pleased ill make some inquiries in the town she said somebody must have seen them leave good said the bishop however i dont think theyre coming back soon so in the meantime youre going to have to manage as best you can with no men continue the services as normally as possible with the nuns get a parish priest to come into the cathedral for mass if you can find one still alive you cannot perform the mass but you can hear confessions there has been a special dispensation from the archbishop because so many clergymen have died caris was not going to let him slide past the question of her election are you confirming me as prioress she said of course he said irritably in that case before i accept the honour you have no decision to make mother prioress he said indignantly it is your duty to obey me she wanted the post desperately but she resolved to pretend otherwise she was going to drive a hard bargain we live in strange times dont we she said youve given nuns authority to hear confessions youve shortened the training for priests but you still cant ordain them fast enough to keep up with deaths from the plague i hear is it your intention to exploit the difficulties the church is facing for some purpose of your own no but there is something you need to do to make it possible for me to carry out your instructions henri sighed clearly he did not like being spoken to in this way but as caris had suspected he needed her more than she needed him very well what is it i want you to convene an ecclesiastical court and reopen my trial for witchcraft for heavens sake why to declare me innocent of course until that happens it could be difficult for me to exercise authority anyone who disagrees with my decisions can all too easily undermine me by pointing out that i stand condemned the tidy secretarial mind of archdeacon lloyd liked that idea it would be good to have the issue disposed of once and for all my lord bishop very well then said henri thank you she felt a surge of delight and relief and bowed her head for fear that her triumph would show in her face i will do my best to bring honour to the position of prioress of kingsbridge lose no time in inquiring after godwyn id like some kind of answer before i leave town the alderman of the parish guild is a crony of godwyns hell know where theyve gone if anyone does ill go and see him right away please caris left bishop henri was charmless but he seemed competent and she thought she could work with him perhaps he would be the kind of leader who made decisions based on the merits of the case instead of siding with whomever he perceived as an ally that would be a pleasant change passing the bell she was tempted to go in and tell merthin her good news however she thought she had better find elfric first in the street in front of the holly bush she saw duncan dyer lying on the ground his wife winnie was sitting on the bench outside the tavern crying caris thought the man must have been hurt but winnie said hes drunk caris was shocked it isnt even dinner time yet his uncle peter dyer caught the plague and passed away his wife and children died too so duncan inherited all his money and he just spends it on wine i dont know what to do lets get him home caris said ill help you lift him they each took an arm and got duncan to his feet holding him upright they half dragged him down the street to his house they put him on the floor and covered him with a blanket winnie said hes like this every day hes says its not worth working because were all going to die of the plague what shall i do caris thought for a moment bury the money in the garden now while hes sleeping when he wakes up tell him he lost it all gambling with a chapman who left town i might do that winnie said caris crossed the street to elfrics house and went inside her sister alice was sitting in the kitchen sewing stockings they had not been close since alice married elfric and what little was left of their relationship had been destroyed by elfrics testifying against caris in the heresy trial forced to choose between sister and husband alice had been loyal to elfric caris understood that but it meant her sister had become like a stranger to her when alice saw her she stood up and dropped her sewing what are you doing here she said the monks have all disappeared caris told her they must have left in the night so that was what it was alice said did you see them no but i heard a whole crowd of men and horses they werent loud in fact now that i think of it they must have been making an effort to be quiet but you cant keep horses silent and men make a noise just walking along the street they woke me but i didnt get up to see it was too cold is that why youve entered my house for the first time in ten years you didnt know they were going to run off is that what theyve done run off because of the plague i assume so surely not whats the use of physicians who flee from sickness alice was troubled by this behaviour on the part of her husbands patron i cant understand it i was wondering if elfric knew anything about it if he does he hasnt told me where will i find him st peters rick silvers left some money to the church and the priest decided to pave the floor of the nave ill go and ask him caris wondered if she should make an attempt to be courteous alice had no children of her own but she had a stepdaughter how is griselda caris said very well and happy alice said with a touch of defiance as if she thought caris might prefer to hear otherwise and your grandson caris could not bring herself to use the childs name which was merthin lovely and another grandchild on the way im pleased for her yes its just as well she didnt marry your merthin the way things have turned out caris refused to be drawn ill go and find elfric st peters church was at the western end of the town as caris was threading her way through the winding streets she came upon two men fighting they were shouting curses at one another and punching wildly two women presumably their wives were screeching abuse while a small crowd of neighbours looked on the door of the nearest house had been broken down on the ground nearby was a cage made of twigs and rushes containing three live chickens caris went up to the men and stepped between them stop it this instant she said i command you in the name of god they did not take much persuading they had probably expended their wrath with the first few blows and might even be grateful for an excuse to stop they stepped back and dropped their arms whats this about caris demanded they both started speaking at once and so did their wives one at a time caris said she pointed at the larger of the two men a darkhaired fellow whose good looks were spoiled by a swelling around his eye youre joe blacksmith arent you explain i caught toby peterson stealing jack marrows chickens he broke down the door toby was a smaller man with a gamecock bravado he spoke through bleeding lips jack marrow owed me five shillings im entitled to those chickens joe said jack and all his family died of the plague two weeks ago ive been feeding his chickens ever since theyd be dead but for me if anyone should take them it ought to be me caris said well youre both entitled to them arent you toby because of the debt and joe because he kept them alive at his own expense they looked taken aback at the thought that they might both be right caris said joseph take one of the chickens out of the cage toby said wait a moment trust me toby caris said you know i wouldnt treat you unjustly dont you well i cant deny that joe opened the cage and picked up a scrawny brownfeathered chicken by its feet the birds head turned jerkily from side to side as if it was bewildered to see the world upside down caris said now give it to tobys wife what would i cheat you joseph joe reluctantly handed the chicken to tobys wife a pretty sulky type there you are then jane jane took it with alacrity caris said to her now thank joe jane looked petulant but she said i thank you joseph blacksmith caris said now toby give a chicken to ellie blacksmith toby obeyed with a sheepish grin joes wife ellie who was heavily pregnant smiled and said thank you toby peterson they were returning to normal and beginning to realize the foolishness of what they had been doing jane said what about the third chicken im coming to that caris said she looked at the watching crowd and pointed at a sensiblelooking girl of eleven or twelve whats your name im jesca mother prior the daughter of john constable take the other chicken to st peters church and give it to father michael say that toby and joe will be coming to ask forgiveness for the sin of covetousness yes sister jesca picked up the third chicken and went off joes wife ellie said you may remember mother caris that you helped my husbands baby sister minnie when she burned her arm in the forge oh yes of course caris said it had been a nasty burn she remembered she must be ten now thats right is she well right as rain thanks to you and gods grace im glad to hear it would you care to step into my house for a cup of ale mother prioress id love to but im in a hurry she turned to the men god bless you and no more fighting joe said thank you caris walked away toby called after her thank you mother she waved without looking back she noticed several more houses that appeared to have been broken into presumably to be looted after the occupants died someone ought to do something about it she thought but with elfric as alderman and a disappearing prior there was no one to take the initiative she reached st peters and found elfric with a team of paviours and their apprentices in the nave stone slabs were stacked all around and the men were preparing the ground pouring sand and smoothing it with sticks elfric was checking that the surface was level using a complicated piece of apparatus with a wooden frame and a dangling cord with a lead point at its end the apparatus looked like a miniature gallows and it reminded caris that elfric had tried to get her hanged for witchcraft ten years ago she was surprised to find that she felt no hatred for him he was too meanspirited and smallminded for that when she looked at him she felt nothing but contempt she waited for him to finish then said abruptly did you know that godwyn and all the monks have run away she intended to surprise him and she knew by his look of astonishment that he had no foreknowledge why would they when oh last night you didnt see them i heard something i saw them said a paviour he leaned on his spade to talk i was coming out of the holly bush it was dark but they had torches the prior was riding and the rest walking but they had a sight of baggage wine casks and wheels of cheese and i dont know what caris already knew that godwyn had emptied the monks food stores he had not tried to take any of the nuns supplies which were kept separately what time was that not late nine or ten oclock did you speak to them just to say goodnight any clue as to where they might have been headed the paviour shook his head they went over the bridge but i didnt see which road they took at gallows cross caris turned to elfric think back over the past few days did godwyn say anything to you that with hindsight might relate to this mention any place names monmouth york antwerp bremen no i had no clue elfric looked grumpy about not having been forewarned which made caris think he was telling the truth if elfric was surprised it was unlikely that anyone else had known what godwyn planned godwyn was fleeing from the plague and clearly he did not want anyone to follow him bringing the disease with them leave early go far and stay long merthin had said godwyn could be anywhere if you hear from him or any of the monks please tell me caris said elfric said nothing caris raised her voice to make sure the workmen heard godwyn has stolen all the precious ornaments she said there was a rumble of indignation the men felt proprietorial about the cathedral ornaments indeed the wealthier craftsmen had probably helped pay for some of them the bishop wants them back anyone who helps godwyn even just by concealing his whereabouts is guilty of sacrilege elfric looked bewildered he had based his life on ingratiating himself with godwyn now his patron had gone he said there may be some perfectly innocent explanation if there is why did godwyn tell no one or even leave behind a letter elfric could not think of anything to say caris realized she was going to have to speak to all the leading merchants and the sooner the better id like you to call a meeting she said to elfric then she thought of a more persuasive way of putting it the bishop wants the parish guild to meet today after dinner please inform the members very well said elfric they would all be there caris knew agog with curiosity she left st peters and headed back towards the priory as she passed the white horse tavern she saw something that made her pause a young girl was talking to an older man and there was something about the interaction that raised cariss hackles she always felt the vulnerability of girls very sharply perhaps because she remembered herself as an adolescent perhaps because of the daughter she had never had she drew back into a doorway and studied them the man was poorly dressed except for a costly fur hat caris did not know him but she guessed he was a labourer and had inherited the hat so many people had died that there was a glut of finery and you saw odd sights like this all the time the girl was about fourteen years old and pretty with an adolescent figure she was trying to be coquettish caris saw with disapproval though she was not very convincing the man took money from his purse and they seemed to be arguing then the man fondled the girls small breast caris had seen enough she marched up to the pair the man took one look at her nuns habit and walked quickly away the girl looked both guilty and resentful caris said what are you doing trying to sell your body no mother tell the truth why did you let him feel your breast i dont know what to do i havent got anything to eat and now youve chased him away she burst into tears caris could believe the girl was hungry she looked thin and pale come with me caris said ill give you something to eat she took the girls arm and steered her towards the priory whats your name she asked ismay how old are you thirteen they reached the priory and caris took ismay to the kitchen where the nuns dinner was being prepared under the supervision of a novice called oonagh the kitchener josephine had fallen to the plague give this child some bread and butter caris said to oonagh she sat and watched the girl eat ismay obviously had not had food for days she ate half of a fourpound loaf before slowing down caris poured her a cup of cider why were you starving she asked all my family died of the plague what was your father a tailor and i can sew very neatly but no one is buying clothes they can get anything they want from the homes of dead people so thats why you were trying to prostitute yourself she looked down im sorry mother prioress i was so hungry was that the first time that you tried she shook her head and would not look at caris tears of rage welled up in cariss eyes what kind of man would have sexual congress with a starving thirteenyearold what kind of god would drive a girl to such desperation would you like to live here with the nuns and work in the kitchen she said you would have plenty to eat ismay looked up with eagerness oh yes mother id like that then you shall you can begin by helping to prepare the nuns dinner oonagh heres a new kitchen hand thank you mother caris i need all the help i can get caris left the kitchen and went thoughtfully into the cathedral for the service of sext the plague was not just a physical sickness she was beginning to realize ismay had escaped the disease but her soul had been in peril bishop henri took the service leaving caris free to think at the parish guild meeting she needed to talk about more than just the flight of the monks she decided it was time to get the town organized to deal with the effects of the plague but how she mulled over the problems through dinner for all sorts of reasons this was a good time to make big decisions with the bishop here to back up her authority she might be able to push through measures that could otherwise meet with opposition this was also a good moment to get what she wanted from the bishop that was a fertile thought after dinner she went to see the bishop in the priors house where he was staying he was at table with archdeacon lloyd they had been fed by the nuns kitchen and were drinking wine while a priory servant cleared the table i hope you enjoyed your dinner my lord bishop she said formally he was a little less peevish than usual it was fine thank you mother caris a very tasty pike any news of the runaway prior he seems to have been careful to leave no clue as to his destination disappointing as i walked through the town making inquiries i saw several incidents that disturbed me a thirteenyearold girl prostituting herself two normally lawabiding citizens fighting over a dead mans property a man dead drunk at midday these are the effects of the plague its the same everywhere i believe we must act to counter those effects he raised his eyebrows it seemed he had not thought of taking such action how the prior is overlord of kingsbridge he is the one to take the initiative but he has vanished as bishop you are technically our abbot i believe you must stay here in kingsbridge permanently and take charge of the town this was in fact the last thing she wanted fortunately there was little chance of the bishop agreeing he had far too much to do elsewhere she was just trying to back him into a corner he hesitated and for a moment she worried that she might have misjudged him and he might accept her suggestion then he said out of the question every town in the diocese has the same problems shiring is worse i have to try to hold together the fabric of christianity here while my priests are dying i have no time to worry about drunks and prostitutes well somebody must act as prior of kingsbridge the town needs a moral leader archdeacon lloyd put in my lord bishop there is also the question of who is to receive monies owed to the priory maintain the cathedral and other buildings manage the lands and the serfs henri said well you will have to do all that mother caris she pretended to consider the suggestion as if she had not already thought of it i could handle all the less important tasks managing the monks money and their lands but i could not do what you can do my lord bishop i could not perform the holy sacraments weve already discussed that he said impatiently im creating new priests as fast as i can but you can do everything else it almost seems as if youre asking me to be acting prior of kingsbridge thats exactly what i want caris was careful not to show her elation it seemed too good to be true she was prior for all purposes except those she did not care about were there any hidden snags she had not thought of archdeacon lloyd said youd better let me write her a letter to that effect in case she needs to enforce her authority caris said if you want the town to abide by your wishes you may need to impress upon them that this is your personal decision a meeting of the parish guild is about to begin if youre willing bishop id like you to attend it and make an announcement all right let us go they left godwyns palace and walked up the main street to the guild hall the members were all waiting to hear what had happened to the monks caris began by telling them what she knew several people had seen or heard the exodus yesterday after dark although no one had realized or even suspected that every single one of the monks was leaving she asked them to be alert for talk among travellers about a large group of monks on the road with a lot of baggage but we have to accept the likelihood that the monks will not return soon and in connection with that the lord bishop has an announcement she wanted the words to come from him not her henri cleared his throat and said i have confirmed the election of caris as prioress and i have appointed her acting prior you will all please treat her as my representative and your overlord in all matters excepting only those reserved to ordained priests caris watched the faces elfric was furious merthin smiled faintly guessing that she had manoeuvred herself into this position pleased for her and for the town the rueful twist to his mouth showing that he knew this would keep her out of his arms everyone else seemed glad they knew and trusted her and she had won even more loyalty by staying while godwyn fled she would make the most of it three matters i want to take care of urgently on my first day as acting prior she said first drunkenness today i saw duncan dyer unconscious in the street before dinner time i believe this contributes to an atmosphere of debauchery in the town which is the last thing we need during this dreadful crisis there were loud sounds of approval the parish guild was dominated by the older and more conservative of the town merchants if they ever got drunk in the morning they did it at home where no one could see caris went on i want to give john constable an extra deputy and instruct him to arrest anyone found drunk in daylight he can put them in the jail until they sober up even elfric was nodding second is the question of what happens to the property of people who die without heirs this morning i found joseph blacksmith and toby peterson fighting in the street over three chickens belonging to jack marrow there was laughter at the idea of grown men fighting over such trifles caris had thought out her solution to that problem in principle such property reverts to the lord of the manor which for kingsbridge residents means the priory however i dont want the monastery buildings filled up with old clothes so i propose to waive the rule for anyone whose possessions are worth less than two pounds instead the two nearest neighbours should lock up the house to make sure nothing is taken then the property should be inventoried by the parish priest who will also hear the claims of any creditors where there is no priest they can come to me when any debts have been paid the deceaseds personal possessions clothing furniture food and drink will be divided up among the neighbours and any cash given to the parish church there was widespread approval for this too most people nodding and murmuring agreement finally i found a thirteenyearold orphan girl trying to sell her body outside the white horse her name is ismay and she did it because she had nothing to eat caris looked around the room with a challenging stare can anyone tell me how such a thing could possibly happen in a christian town all her family are dead but did they have no friends or neighbours who allows a child to starve edward butcher said in a low voice ismay taylor is a rather badly behaved child caris was not accepting excuses shes thirteen im just saying that she might have been offered help and spurned it since when did we allow children to make such decisions for themselves if a child is orphaned it is the duty of every one of us to take care of her what does your religion mean if not that they all looked shamefaced in future whenever a child is orphaned i want the two nearest neighbours to bring the child to me those who cannot be placed with a friendly family will move into the priory the girls can live with the nuns and we will turn the monks dormitory into a bedroom for boys they can all have lessons in the morning and do suitable work in the afternoon there was general approval for that too elfric spoke up have you finished mother caris i think so unless anyone wants to discuss the details of what i have suggested no one spoke up and the members began to move in their seats as if the meeting was over then elfric said some of the men here may remember that they elected me as alderman of the guild his voice was full of resentment everyone fidgeted impatiently we have now seen the prior of kingsbridge accused of theft and condemned without trial he went on that went down badly there was a rumble of dissent no one thought godwyn innocent elfric ignored the mood of the room and we have sat here like slaves and let a woman dictate the laws of the city to us by whose authority are drunks to be imprisoned hers who is the ultimate judge of inheritance she is who will dispose of the citys orphans she will what have you come to are you not men betty baxter said no the men laughed caris decided not to intervene it was unnecessary she glanced at the bishop wondering if he would assert himself against elfric and saw that he was sitting back mouth clamped shut plainly he too had realized that elfric was fighting a losing battle elfric raised his voice i say we reject a female prior even acting prior and we deny the right of the prioress to come to the parish guild and issue commandments several muttered mutinously two or three stood up as if about to walk out in disgust someone called out forget it elfric he persisted and this is a woman who was convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death all the men were standing now one walked out of the door come back elfric shouted i havent closed the meeting no one took any notice caris joined the group at the door she made way for the bishop and the archdeacon she was the last to leave she turned back at the exit and looked at elfric he sat alone at the head of the room she went out it was twelve years since godwyn and philemon had visited the cell of stjohnintheforest godwyn remembered being impressed by the neatness of the fields the trimmed hedges the cleared ditches and the apple trees in straight lines in the orchard it was the same today evidently saul whitehead had not changed either godwyn and his caravan crossed a chequerboard of frozen fields towards the clustered buildings of the monastery as they came closer godwyn saw that there had been some developments twelve years ago the little stone church with its cloister and dormitory had been surrounded by a scatter of small wooden structures kitchen stables dairy bakery now the flimsy timber outbuildings had gone and the stonebuilt complex attached to the church had grown correspondingly the compound is more secure than it used to be godwyn remarked because of the increase in outlawry by soldiers coming home from the french wars id guess philemon said godwyn frowned i dont recall being asked for my permission for the building programme you were not hmm unfortunately he could hardly complain someone might ask how it was possible for saul to have carried out such a programme without godwyns knowledge unless godwyn had neglected his duty of supervision besides it suited his purpose now for the place to be easily closed to intruders the twoday journey had somewhat calmed him the death of his mother had thrown him into a frenzy of fear every hour he remained in kingsbridge he had felt he was sure to die he had got just enough grip on his emotions to address the meeting in the chapter house and organize the exodus despite his eloquence a few of the monks had had misgivings about fleeing fortunately they were all sworn to obedience and the habit of doing as they were told had prevailed nevertheless he had not begun to feel safe until his group had crossed the double bridge torches blazing and headed off into the night he still felt close to the edge every now and again he would be mulling something over and would decide to ask petranilla what she thought then he would realize he could not ask her advice ever again and panic would rise like bile in his throat he was fleeing from the plague but he should have done it three months ago when mark webber died was he too late he fought down terror he would not feel safe until he was locked away from the world he wrenched his thoughts back to the present there was no one in the fields at this time of year but in a yard of beaten earth in front of the monastery he saw a handful of monks working one shoeing a horse another mending a plough and a small group turning the lever of a cider press they all stopped what they were doing and stared astonished at the crowd of visitors approaching them twenty monks half a dozen novices four carts and ten pack horses godwyn had left nobody behind but the priory servants one of those at the cider press detached himself from the group and came forward godwyn recognized him as saul whitehead they had met on sauls annual visits to kingsbridge but now for the first time godwyn noticed touches of grey in sauls distinctive ashblond hair twenty years ago they had been students together at oxford saul had been the star pupil quick to learn and agile in argument he had also been the most devoutly religious of them all he might have become prior of kingsbridge if he had been less spiritual and had thought strategically about his career instead of leaving such matters to god as it was when prior anthony had died and the election was held godwyn had easily outmanoeuvred saul all the same saul was not weak he had a streak of stubborn righteousness that godwyn feared would he go along obediently with godwyns plan today or would he make trouble once again godwyn fought down panic and struggled to remain cool he studied sauls face carefully the prior of st john was surprised to see him and clearly displeased his expression was carefully composed into a look of polite welcome but he was not smiling during the election campaign godwyn had made everyone believe that he himself did not want the job but he had eliminated every other reasonable candidate including saul did saul suspect how he had been hoodwinked good day to you father prior saul said as he approached this is an unexpected blessing so he was not going to be openly hostile no doubt he would think that such behaviour conflicted with his vow of obedience godwyn was relieved he said god bless you my son it is too long since i have visited my children at st john saul looked at the monks the horses and the carts loaded with supplies this appears to be more than a simple visit he did not offer to help godwyn down from his horse it was as if he wanted an explanation before he would invite them in which was ridiculous he had no right to turn away his superior all the same godwyn found himself explaining have you heard about the plague rumours saul said there are few visitors to bring us news that was good the lack of visitors was what drew godwyn here the disease has killed hundreds in kingsbridge i feared it might wipe out the priory thats why ive brought the monks here it may be the only way to ensure our survival you are welcome here of course whatever the reason for your visit it goes without saying godwyn said stiffly he felt angry that he had been nudged into justifying himself saul looked thoughtful im not sure where everyones going to sleep i shall decide that godwyn said reasserting his authority you can show me around while your kitchen is preparing our supper he got down from his horse unaided and walked into the monastery saul was obliged to follow the whole place had a bare scrubbed look that expressed how serious saul was about the monkish vow of poverty but today godwyn was more interested in how readily the place could be closed to outsiders fortunately sauls belief in order and control had led him to design buildings with few entrances there were only three ways into the priory through the kitchen the stable or the church each entrance had a stout door that could be firmly barred the dormitory was small normally accommodating nine or ten monks and there was no separate bedroom for the prior the only way to fit twenty extra monks in was to let them sleep in the church godwyn thought of taking over the dormitory for himself but there was nowhere in the room to hide the cathedral treasures and he wanted to keep them close fortunately the little church had a small side chapel that could be closed off and godwyn took that for his own room the rest of the kingsbridge monks spread straw on the stampedearth floor of the nave and made the best of it the food and wine went to the kitchen and the cellar but philemon brought the ornaments into godwyns chapelbedroom philemon had been chatting to the st john monks saul has his own way of running things he reported he demands rigid obedience to god and the rule of st benedict but they say he doesnt set himself up on a pedestal he sleeps in the dorm eats the same food as the others and in general takes no privileges needless to say they like him for that but theres one monk who is constantly being punished brother jonquil i remember him jonquil had always been in trouble while a novice at kingsbridge for lateness slovenliness laziness and greed he was without selfcontrol and had probably been drawn to the monastic life as a way of getting someone else to enforce the restraint he could not impose on himself i doubt that he will be much help to us he will break ranks given half a chance philemon said but he doesnt carry any authority no one will follow him and they have no complaints about saul doesnt he sleep late or dodge unpleasant chores or take the best wine for himself apparently not hmm saul was as upright as ever godwyn was disappointed but not very surprised during evensong godwyn noted how solemn and disciplined the st john men were over the years he had always sent problem monks here the mutinous the mentally ill those inclined to question the churchs teachings and take an interest in heretical ideas saul had never complained never sent anyone back it seemed he was able to turn such people into model monks after the service godwyn sent most of the kingsbridge men to the refectory for supper keeping only philemon and two strong young monks behind when they had the church to themselves he told philemon to guard the door that gave entrance from the cloisters then ordered the youngsters to move the carved wooden altar and dig a hole beneath where it normally stood when the hole was deep enough godwyn brought the cathedral ornaments from his chapel ready to be buried beneath the altar but before he could complete the job saul came to the door godwyn heard philemon say the lord prior wishes to be alone next came sauls voice then he may tell me so himself he has asked me to say so sauls voice rose i will not be shut out of my own church least of all by you will you offer violence to me the subprior of kingsbridge i will pick you up and throw you in the fountain if you continue to stand in my way godwyn intervened he would have preferred to keep saul in ignorance but it was not to be let him in philemon he called philemon stepped aside and saul marched in he saw the baggage and without asking permission opened the neck of a sack and looked inside my soul he exclaimed drawing out a silvergilt altar cruet whats all this godwyn was tempted to tell him not to interrogate his superiors saul might have accepted such a reproof he believed in humility at least in principle but godwyn did not want to let suspicion ferment in sauls mind so he said ive brought the cathedral treasures with me saul made a face of distaste i realize that such gewgaws are thought appropriate in a great cathedral but they will seem out of place at a humble cell in the forest you wont have to look at them im going to hide them theres no harm in your knowing where though i intended to spare you the burden of that knowledge saul looked suspicious why bring them at all for safekeeping saul was not so easily reassured im surprised the bishop was willing to let them be taken away the bishop had not been asked of course but godwyn did not say that at the moment things are so bad in kingsbridge that were not sure the ornaments are safe even at the priory safer than here though surely we are surrounded by outlaws you know thank god you didnt meet them on the road god is watching over us and over his jewellery i hope sauls attitude amounted almost to insubordination but godwyn did not reprimand him fearing that an overreaction would suggest guilt however he noted that sauls humility had its limits perhaps after all saul did know that he had been hoodwinked twelve years ago now godwyn said please ask all the monks to stay in the refectory after supper i will address them as soon as i have finished here saul accepted this dismissal and went out godwyn buried the ornaments the priory charters the relics of the saint and almost all the money the monks replaced the soil in the hole tamped it down and put the altar back in its place there was some loose earth left over which they took outside and scattered then they went to the refectory the little room was crowded now with the addition of the kingsbridge men a monk stood at the lectern reading a passage from marks gospel but he fell silent when godwyn walked in godwyn motioned the reader to a seat and took his place this is a holy retreat he began god has sent this terrible plague to punish us for our sins we have come here to purge those sins far away from the corrupting influence of the city godwyn had not intended to open a discussion but saul sang out what sins in particular father godwyn godwyn improvised men have challenged the authority of gods holy church women have become lascivious monks have failed to separate themselves completely from female society nuns have turned to heresy and witchcraft and how long will it take to purge these sins we will know we have triumphed when the plague dies away another st john monk spoke up and godwyn recognized jonquil a large uncoordinated man with a wild look in his eyes how will you purge yourself godwyn was surprised that the monks here felt so free to question their superiors by prayer meditation and fasting the fasting is a good idea said jonquil we havent got much food to spare there was a little laughter at that godwyn was worried that he might lose control of his audience he banged the lectern for quiet from now on anyone who comes here from the outside world is a danger to us he said i want all doors to the precinct barred from the inside day and night no monk is to go outside without my personal permission which will be granted only in emergency all callers are to be turned away we are going to lock ourselves in until this terrible plague is over jonquil said but what if godwyn interrupted him i havent asked for comments brother he glared around the room staring them all into silence you are monks and it is your duty to obey he said and now let us pray the crisis came the very next day godwyn sensed that his orders had been accepted by saul and the other monks in a provisional way everyone was taken by surprise and on the spur of the moment they could think of no great objections and so in default of a strong reason for rebellion they instinctively obeyed their superior but he knew the time would come when they would have to make a real decision however he did not expect it so soon they were singing the office of prime it was freezing cold in the little church godwyn was stiff and aching after an uncomfortable night he missed his palace with its fireplaces and soft beds the grey light of a winter dawn was beginning to appear in the windows when there was a banging on the heavy west door of the church godwyn tensed he wished he had been given an extra day or two to consolidate his position he signalled that the monks should ignore the knocking and continue with the service the knocking was then augmented by shouting saul stood up to go to the door but godwyn made sitdown signs with his hands and after a hesitation saul obeyed godwyn was determined to sit tight if the monks did nothing the intruders must go away however godwyn began to realize that persuading people to do nothing was extraordinarily difficult the monks were too distracted to concentrate on the psalm they were all whispering to one another and looking back over their shoulders towards the west end the singing became ragged and uncoordinated and eventually petered out until only godwyns voice was left he felt irate if they had followed his lead they could have ignored the disturbance angered by their weakness he at last left his place and walked down the short nave to the door which was barred what is it he shouted let us in came the muffled reply you cant come in godwyn shouted back go away saul appeared at his side are you turning them away from the church he said in a horrified tone i told you godwyn replied no visitors the banging resumed let us in saul shouted who are you there was a pause then the voice said we are men of the forest philemon spoke up outlaws he said saul said indignantly sinners like us and gods children too thats no reason to let them murder us perhaps we should find out whether thats what they intend saul went to the window on the right of the door the church was a low building and the window ledges were just below eye level none of them was glazed they were closed against the cold by shutters of translucent linen saul opened the shutter and stood on tiptoe to look out why have you come here he called godwyn heard the reply one of our number is sick godwyn said to saul i will speak to them saul stared at him come away from the window godwyn said reluctantly saul obeyed godwyn shouted we cannot let you in go away saul looked at him with incredulity are you going to turn away a sick man he said we are monks and physicians if the man has the plague there is nothing we can do for him by admitting him we will kill ourselves that is in gods hands surely god does not permit us to commit suicide you dont know what is wrong with the man he may have a broken arm godwyn opened the corresponding window on the left of the door and looked out he saw a group of six roughlooking characters standing around a stretcher that they had put down in front of the church door their clothes were costly but dirty as if they were sleeping rough in their sunday best this was typical of outlaws who stole fine clothes from travellers and made them shabby very quickly the men were heavily armed some with goodquality swords daggers and longbows which suggested they might be demobilized soldiers on the stretcher lay a man who was perspiring heavily even though it was a frosty january morning and bleeding from his nose suddenly without wishing it godwyn saw in his imagination that scene in the hospital when his mother lay dying and the trickle of blood on her upper lip kept returning no matter how often the nun wiped it away the thought that he might die like that made him so distracted that he wanted to throw himself from the roof of kingsbridge cathedral how much better it would be to die in one brief instant of overwhelming pain than over three four or five days of mad delirium and agonizing thirst that man has the plague godwyn exclaimed and he heard in his own voice a note of hysteria one of the outlaws stepped forward i know you he said youre the prior of kingsbridge godwyn tried to pull himself together he looked with fear and anger at the man who was evidently the leader he carried himself with the arrogant assurance of a nobleman and he had once been handsome though his looks had been marred by years of living rough godwyn said and who are you that comes banging on a church door while the monks are singing psalms to god some call me tam hiding the outlaw replied there was a gasp from the monks tam hiding was a legend brother jonquil shouted they will kill us all saul rounded on jonquil be silent he said all of us will die when god wills it and not before yes father saul returned to the window and said you stole our chickens last year im sorry father said tam we were starving yet now you come to me for help because you preach that god forgives godwyn said to saul let me deal with this sauls internal struggle was evident on his face which looked alternately ashamed and mutinous but at last he bowed his head godwyn said to tam god forgives those who truly repent well this mans name is win forester and he truly repents all his many sins he would like to come into the church to pray for healing or failing that to die in a holy place one of the other outlaws sneezed saul came away from his window and stood facing godwyn hands on hips we cannot turn him away godwyn tried to make himself calm you heard that sneeze dont you understand what it means he turned to the rest of the monks to make sure they heard what he said next theyve all got the plague they gave a collective murmur of fear godwyn wanted them frightened that way they would support him if saul decided to defy him saul said we must help them even if they have got the plague our lives are not our own to be protected like gold hidden under the earth we have given ourselves to god to use as he wishes and he will end our lives when it suits his holy purpose to let those outlaws in would be suicide theyll kill us all we are men of god for us death is the happy reunion with christ what do we have to fear father prior godwyn realized that he was sounding frightened whereas saul was speaking reasonably he forced himself to appear calm and philosophical it is a sin to seek our own death but if death comes to us in the course of our holy duty we embrace it gladly godwyn realized he could debate all day with saul and get nowhere this was not the way to impose his authority he closed his shutter shut your window brother saul and come here to roe he said he looked at saul waiting after a hesitation saul did as he was told godwyn said what are your three vows brother there was a pause saul knew what was happening here godwyn was refusing to engage with him as an equal at first saul looked as if he might refuse to answer but his training took over and he said poverty chastity obedience and who must you obey god and the rule of st benedict and my prior and your prior stands before you now do you acknowledge me yes you may say yes father prior yes father prior now i will tell you what you must do and you will obey godwyn looked around all of you return to your places there was a moment of frozen silence no one moved and no one spoke it could go either way godwyn thought compliance or mutiny order or anarchy victory or defeat he held his breath at last saul moved he bowed his head and turned away he walked up the short aisle and resumed his position in front of the altar all the others did the same there were a few more shouts from outside but they sounded like parting shots perhaps the outlaws had realized they could not force a physician to treat their sick comrade godwyn returned to the altar and turned to face the monks we will finish the interrupted psalm he said and he began singing glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost the singing was still ragged the monks were far too excited to adopt the proper attitude all the same they were back in their places and following their routine godwyn had prevailed as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end amen amen godwyn repeated one of the monks sneezed soon after godwyn fled elfric died of the plague caris was sorry for alice his widow but aside from that she could hardly help rejoicing that he was gone he had bullied the weak and toadied to the strong and the lies he had told at her trial almost got her hanged the world was a better place without him even his building business would be better off run by his soninlaw harold mason the parish guild elected merthin as alderman in elfrics place merthin said it was like being made captain of a sinking ship as the deaths went on and on and people buried their relatives neighbours friends customers and employees the constant horror seemed to brutalize many of them until no violence or cruelty seemed shocking people who thought they were about to die lost all restraint and followed their impulses regardless of the consequences together merthin and caris struggled to preserve something like normal life in kingsbridge the orphanage was the most successful part of cariss programme the children were grateful for the security of the nunnery after the ordeal of losing their parents to the plague taking care of them and teaching them to read and sing hymns brought out longsuppressed maternal instincts in some of the nuns there was plenty of food with fewer people competing for the winter stores and kingsbridge priory was full of the sound of children in the town things were more difficult there continued to be violent quarrels over the property of the dead people just walked into empty houses and picked up whatever took their fancy children who had inherited money or a warehouse full of cloth or corn were sometimes adopted by unscrupulous neighbours greedy to get their hands on the legacy the prospect of something for nothing brought out the worst in people caris thought despairingly caris and merthin were only partly successful against the decline in public behaviour caris was disappointed with the results of john constables crackdown on drunkenness the large numbers of new widows and widowers seemed frantic to find partners and it was not unusual to see middleaged people in a passionate embrace in a tavern or even a doorway caris had no great objection to this sort of thing in itself but she found that the combination of drunkenness and public licentiousness often led to fighting however merthin and the parish guild were unable to stop it just at the moment when the townspeople needed their spines stiffened the flight of the monks had the opposite effect it demoralized everyone gods representatives had left the almighty had abandoned the town some said that the relics of the saint had always brought good fortune and now that the bones had gone their luck had run out the lack of precious crucifixes and candlesticks at the sunday services was a weekly reminder that kingsbridge was considered doomed so why not get drunk and fornicate in the street out of a population of about seven thousand kingsbridge had lost at least a thousand by midjanuary other towns were similar despite the masks caris had invented the death toll was higher among the nuns no doubt because they were continually in contact with plague victims there had been thirtyfive nuns and now there were twenty but they heard of places where almost every monk or nun had died leaving a handful or sometimes just one to carry on the work so they counted themselves fortunate meanwhile caris had shortened the period of novitiate and intensified the training so that she would have more help in the hospital merthin hired the barman from the holly bush and put him in charge of the bell he also took on a sensible seventeenyearold girl called martina to nursemaid lolla then the plague seemed to die down having buried a hundred people a week in the runup to christmas caris found that the number dropped to fifty in january then twenty in february she allowed herself to hope that the nightmare might be coming to an end one of the unlucky people to fall ill during this period was a darkhaired man in his thirties who might once have been goodlooking he was a visitor to the town i thought i had a cold yesterday he said when he came through the door but now ive got this nosebleed that wont stop he was holding a bloody rag to his nostrils ill find you somewhere to lie down she said through her linen mask its the plague isnt it he said and she was surprised to hear calm resignation in his voice in place of the usual panic can you do anything to cure it we can make you comfortable and we can pray for you that wont do any good even you dont believe in it i can tell she was shocked by how easily he had read her heart you dont know what youre saying she protested weakly im a nun i must believe it you can tell me the truth how soon will i die she looked hard at him he was smiling at her a charming smile that she guessed had melted a few female hearts why arent you frightened she said everyone else is i dont believe what im told by priests he looked at her shrewdly and i have a suspicion that you dont either she was not about to have this discussion with a stranger no matter how charming almost everyone who falls ill with the plague dies within three to five days she said bluntly a few survive no one knows why he took it well as i thought you can lie down here he gave her the badboy grin again will it do me any good if you dont lie down soon youll fall down all right he lay on the palliasse she indicated she gave him a blanket whats your name tam she studied his face despite his charm she sensed a streak of cruelty he might seduce women she thought but if that failed he would rape them his skin was weathered by outdoor living and he had the red nose of a drinker his clothes were costly but dirty i know who you are she said arent you afraid youll be punished for your sins if i believed that i wouldnt have committed them are you afraid youll burn in hell it was a question she normally sidestepped but she felt that this dying outlaw deserved a true answer i believe that what i do becomes part of me she said when im brave and strong and care for children and the sick and the poor i become a better person and when im cruel or cowardly or tell lies or get drunk i turn into someone less worthy and i cant respect myself thats the divine retribution i believe in he looked at her thoughtfully i wish id met you twenty years ago she made a deprecatory noise i would have been twelve he raised an eyebrow suggestively that was enough she decided he was beginning to flirt and she was beginning to enjoy it she turned away youre a brave woman to do this work he said it will probably kill you i know she said turning to face him again but this is my destiny i cant run away from people who need me your prior doesnt seem to think that way hes vanished people cant vanish i mean no one knows where prior godwyn and the monks have gone i do said tam the weather at the end of february was sunny and mild caris left kingsbridge on a dun pony heading for stjohnintheforest merthin went with her riding a black cob normally eyebrows would have been raised by a nun going on a journey accompanied only by a man but these were strange times the danger from outlaws had receded many had fallen victim to the plague tam hiding had told her himself before he died also the sudden drop in population had brought about a countrywide surplus of food wine and clothing all the things outlaws normally stole those outlaws who survived the plague could walk into ghost towns and abandoned villages and take whatever they wanted caris had at first felt frustrated to learn that godwyn was no farther than two days journey from kingsbridge she had imagined him gone to a place so distant that he would never return however she was glad of the chance to retrieve the priorys money and valuables and in particular the nunnerys charters so vital whenever there was a dispute about property or rights when and if she was able to confront godwyn she would demand the return of the priorys property in the name of the bishop she had a letter from henri to back her up if godwyn still refused that would prove beyond doubt that he was stealing it rather than keeping it safe the bishop could then take legal action to get it back or simply arrive at the cell with a force of menatarms although disappointed that godwyn was not permanently out of her life caris relished the prospect of confronting him with his cowardice and dishonesty as she rode away from the town she recalled that her last long journey had been to france with mair a real adventure in every way she felt bereft when she thought of mair of all those who had died of the plague she missed mair the most her beautiful face her kind heart her love but it was a joy to have merthin to herself for two whole days following the road through the forest side by side on their horses they talked continuously about anything that sprang to mind just as they had when they were adolescents merthin was as full of bright ideas as ever despite the plague he was building shops and taverns on leper island and he told her he planned to demolish the tavern he had inherited from bessie bell and rebuild it twice as big caris guessed that he and bessie had been lovers why else would she have left her property to him but caris had only herself to blame she was the one merthin really wanted and bessie had been second best both women had known that all the same caris felt jealous and angry when she thought of merthin in bed with that plump barmaid they stopped at noon and rested by a stream they ate bread cheese and apples the food that all but the wealthiest travellers carried they gave the horses some grain grazing was not enough for a mount that had to carry a man or woman all day when they had eaten they lay in the sun for a few minutes but the ground was too cold and damp for sleep and they soon roused themselves and moved on they quickly slipped back into the affectionate intimacy of their youth merthin had always been able to make her laugh and she needed cheering up with people dying every day in the hospital she soon forgot to be angry about bessie they were taking a route that had been followed by kingsbridge monks for hundreds of years and they stopped for the night at the usual halfway point the red cow tavern in the small town of lordsborough they had roast beef and strong ale for supper by this time caris was aching for him the last ten years seemed to have vanished from memory and she longed to take him in her arms and make love to him the way they used to but it was not to be the red cow had two bedrooms one for men and one for women which was no doubt why it had always been the choice of the monks caris and merthin parted company on the landing and caris lay awake listening to the snores of a knights wife and the wheezing of a spiceseller touching herself and wishing the hand between her thighs was merthins she woke up tired and dispirited and ate her breakfast porridge mechanically but merthin was so happy to be with her that her mood soon lifted by the time they rode away from lordsborough they were talking and laughing as merrily as yesterday the second days journey was through dense woodland and they saw no other travellers all morning their conversation became more personal she learned more about his time in florence how he had met silvia and what kind of person she was caris wanted to ask what was it like to make love to her was she different from me how but she held back feeling that such questions would trespass on silvias privacy even though silvia was dead anyway she could guess a lot from merthins tone of voice he had been happy in bed with silvia she sensed even if the relationship had not been as intensely passionate as his with caris the unaccustomed hours on horseback were making her sore so she was relieved to stop for dinner and get off the pony when they had eaten they sat on the ground with their backs to a broad tree trunk to rest and let their food go down before resuming the journey caris was thinking about godwyn and wondering what she would find at stjohnintheforest when suddenly she realized that she and merthin were about to make love she could not have explained how she knew they were not even touching but she had no doubt she turned to look at him and saw that he sensed it too he smiled at her ruefully and in his eyes she saw ten years of hope and regrets pain and tears he took her hand and kissed her palm then he put his lips to the soft inside of her wrist and closed his eyes i can feel your pulse he said quietly you cant tell much from the pulse she breathed youll have to give me a thorough examination he kissed her forehead and her eyelids and her nose i hope you wont be embarrassed by my seeing your naked body dont fret im not taking my clothes off in this weather they both giggled he said perhaps you would be kind enough to lift the skirt of your robe so that i may proceed with the checkup she reached down and took hold of the hem of her dress she was wearing hose that came up to her knees she lifted her dress slowly revealing her ankles her shins her knees and then the white skin of her thighs she was feeling playful but in the back of her mind she wondered if he could detect the changes wrought in her body by the last ten years she had got thinner yet at the same time her bottom had spread her skin was a little less supple and smooth than it had been her breasts were not as firm and upright what would he think she suppressed the worry and played the game is that sufficient for medical purposes not quite but im afraid im not wearing underdrawers such luxuries are considered inappropriate for us nuns we physicians are obliged to be very thorough no matter how distasteful we find it oh dear she said with a smile what a shame all right then watching his face she slowly lifted her skirt until it was around her waist he stared at her body and she could see that he was breathing harder my my he said this is a very severe case in fact he looked up at her face swallowed and said i cant joke about this any more she put her arms around him and pulled his body to her own squeezing as hard as she could clinging to him as if she were saving him from drowning make love to me merthin she said now quickly the priory of stjohnintheforest looked tranquil in the afternoon light a sure sign that something was wrong caris thought the little cell was traditionally selfsufficient in food and was surrounded by fields moist with rain that needed ploughing and harrowing but no one was at work when they got closer they saw that the little cemetery next to the church had a row of fresh graves it seems the plague may have reached this far merthin said caris nodded so godwyns cowardly escape plan failed she could not help feeling a glow of vengeful satisfaction merthin said i wonder if he himself has fallen victim caris found herself hoping he had but was too ashamed to say so she and merthin rode around the silent monastery to what was obviously the stable yard the door was open and the horses had been let out and were grazing a patch of meadow around a pond but no one appeared to help the visitors unsaddle they walked through the empty stables into the interior it was eerily quiet and caris wondered if all the monks were dead they looked into a kitchen which caris observed was not as clean as it should be and a bakery with a cold oven their footsteps echoed around the cool grey arcades of the cloisters then approaching the entrance to the church they met brother thomas you found us he said thank god caris embraced him she knew that womens bodies did not present a temptation to thomas im glad youre alive she said i fell ill and got better he explained not many survive i know tell us what happened godwyn and philemon planned it well thomas said there was almost no warning godwyn addressed the chapter and told the story of abraham and isaac to show that god sometimes asks us to do things that appear wrong then he told us we were leaving that night most of the monks were glad to get away from the plague and those that had misgivings were instructed to remember their vow of obedience caris nodded i can imagine its not hard to obey orders when they are so strongly in your own selfinterest im not proud of myself caris touched the stump of his left arm i meant no reproof thomas merthin said all the same im surprised no one leaked the destination thats because godwyn didnt tell us where we were going most of us didnt know even after we arrived we had to ask the local monks what place this was but the plague caught up with you youve seen the graveyard all the st john monks are there except prior saul who is buried in the church almost all the kingsbridge men are dead a few ran away after the sickness broke out here god knows what happened to them caris recalled that thomas had always been close to one particular monk a sweetnatured man a few years younger than he hesitantly she said and brother matthias dead thomas said brusquely then tears came to his eyes and he looked away embarrassed caris put a hand on his shoulder im very sorry so many people have suffered bereavement he said caris decided it would be kinder not to dwell on matthias what about godwyn and philemon philemon ran away godwyn is alive and well he hasnt caught it i have a message for godwyn from the bishop i can imagine youd better take me to him hes in the church he set up a bed in a side chapel hes convinced thats why he hasnt fallen ill come with me they crossed the cloisters and entered the little church it smelled more like a dormitory the wall painting of the day of judgement at the east end seemed grimly appropriate now the nave was strewn with straw and littered with blankets as if a crowd of people had been sleeping here but the only person present was godwyn he was lying face down on the dirt floor in front of the altar his arms stretched out sideways for a moment she thought he was dead then she realized this was simply the attitude of extreme penitence thomas said you have visitors father prior godwyn remained in position caris would have assumed he was putting on a show but something about his stillness made her think he was sincerely seeking forgiveness then he got slowly to his feet and turned round he was pale and thin caris saw and he looked tired and anxious you he said youve been discovered godwyn she said she was not going to call him father he was a miscreant and she had caught him she felt deep satisfaction he said i suppose tam hiding betrayed me his mind was as sharp as ever caris noted you tried to escape justice but you failed i have nothing to fear from justice he said defiantly i came here in the hope of saving the lives of my monks my error was to leave it too late an innocent man doesnt sneak away under cover of night i had to keep my destination secret it would have defeated my purpose to allow anyone to follow us here you didnt have to steal the cathedral ornaments i didnt steal them i took them for safekeeping i shall return them to their rightful place when its safe to do so so why did you tell no one that you were taking them but i did i wrote to bishop henri did he not receive my letter caris felt a growing sense of dismay surely godwyn could not wriggle out of this certainly not she said no letter was received and i dont believe one was sent perhaps the messenger died of the plague before he could deliver it and what was the name of this vanishing messenger i never knew it philemon hired the man and philemon is not here how convenient she said sarcastically well you can say what you like but bishop henri accuses you of stealing the treasure and he has sent me here to demand its return i have a letter ordering you to hand everything to me immediately that wont be necessary ill take it to him myself that is not what your bishop commands you to do ill be the judge of whats best your refusal is proof of theft im sure i can persuade bishop henri to see things differently the trouble was caris thought despairingly that godwyn might well do just that he could be very plausible and henri like most bishops would generally avoid confrontation if he could she felt as if the victory trophy was slipping through her hands godwyn felt he had turned the tables on her and he permitted himself a small smile of satisfaction that infuriated her but she had no more to say all she could do now was return and tell bishop henri what had happened she could hardly believe it would godwyn really return to kingsbridge and resume his position as prior how could he possibly hold his head up in kingsbridge cathedral after all he had done to damage the priory the town and the church even if the bishop accepted him surely the townspeople would riot the prospect was dire yet stranger things had happened was there no justice she stared at him the look of triumph on his face must be matched she supposed by the defeat on her own then she saw something that turned the tables yet again on godwyns upper lip just below his left nostril there was a trickle of blood next morning godwyn did not get out of bed caris put on her linen mask and nursed him she bathed his face in rose water and gave him diluted wine whenever he asked for a drink every time she touched him she washed her hands in vinegar other than godwyn and thomas there were only two monks left both kingsbridge novices they too were dying of the plague so she brought them down from the dormitory to lie in the church and she took care of them as well flitting around the dimlit nave like a shade as she went from one dying man to the next she asked godwyn where the cathedral treasures were but he refused to say merthin and thomas searched the priory the first place they looked was under the altar something had been buried there quite recently they could tell by the looseness of the earth however when they made a hole thomas digging surprisingly well with one hand they found nothing whatever had been buried there had since been removed they checked every echoing room in the deserted monastery and even looked in the cold bakery oven and the dry brewery tanks but they found no jewels relics or charters after the first night thomas quietly vacated the dormitory without being asked and left merthin and caris to sleep there alone he made no comment not even a nudge or a wink grateful for his discreet connivance they huddled under a pile of blankets and made love afterwards caris lay awake an owl lived somewhere in the roof and she heard its nocturnal hooting and occasionally the scream of a small animal caught in its talons she wondered if she would become pregnant she did not want to give up her vocation but she could not resist the temptation of lying in merthins arms so she just refused to think about the future on the third day as caris merthin and thomas ate dinner in the refectory thomas said when godwyn asks for a drink refuse to give it to him until hes told you where he hid the treasure caris considered that it would be perfectly just but it would also amount to torture i cant do that she said i know he deserves it but all the same i cant do it if a sick man asks for a drink i must give it to him thats more important than all the jewelled ornaments in christendom you dont owe him compassion he never showed any to you ive turned the church into a hospital but i wont let it become a torture chamber thomas looked as if he might be inclined to argue further but merthin dissuaded him with a shake of the head think thomas he said when did you last see this stuff the night we arrived thomas said it was in leather bags and boxes on a couple of horses it was unloaded at the same time as everything else and i think it was carried into the church then what happened to it i never saw it again but after evensong when we all went to supper i noticed that godwyn and philemon stayed behind in the church with two other monks juley and john caris said let me guess juley and john were both young and strong yes merthin said so thats probably when they buried the treasure under the altar but when did they dig it up it had to be when nobody was in the church and they could be sure of that only at mealtimes were they absent from any other meals several probably godwyn and philemon always acted as if the rules didnt really apply to them their missing meals and services wasnt unusual enough for me to remember every instance caris said do you recall juley and john being absent a second time godwyn and philemon would have needed help again not necessarily merthin said its much easier to reexcavate ground that has already been loosened godwyn is fortythree and philemon is only thirtyfour they could have done it without help if they really wanted to that night godwyn began to rave some of the time he seemed to be quoting from the bible sometimes preaching and sometimes making excuses caris listened for a while hoping for clues great babylon is fallen and all the nations have drunk of the wrath of her fornication and out of the throne proceeded fire and thunder and all the merchants of the earth shall weep repent oh repent all ye who have committed fornication with the mother of harlots it was all done for a higher purpose all done for the glory of god because the end justifies the means give me something to drink for the love of god the apocalyptic tone of his delirium was probably suggested by the wall painting with its graphic depiction of the tortures of hell caris held a cup to his mouth where are the cathedral ornaments godwyn i saw seven golden candlesticks all covered with pearls and precious stones and wrapped in fine linen and purple and scarlet and lying in an ark made of cedar wood and sandalwood and silver i saw a woman riding upon a scarlet beast having seven heads and ten horns and full of the names of blasphemy the nave rang with the echoes of his ranting on the following day the two novices died that afternoon thomas and merthin buried them in the graveyard to the north of the priory it was a cold damp day but they sweated with the effort of digging thomas performed the funeral service caris stood at the grave with merthin when everything was falling apart the rituals helped to maintain a semblance of normality around them were the new graves of all the other monks except godwyn and saul sauls body lay under the little chancel of the church an honour reserved for the most highly regarded priors afterwards caris came back into the church and stared at sauls grave in the chancel that part of the church was paved with flagstones obviously the flags had been lifted so that the grave could be dug when they had been put back one of the stones had been polished and carved with an inscription it was hard to concentrate with godwyn in the corner raving about beasts with seven heads merthin noticed her thoughtful look and followed her gaze he immediately guessed what she was thinking in a horrified voice he said surely godwyn cant have hidden the treasure in saul whiteheads coffin its hard to imagine monks desecrating a tomb she said on the other hand the ornaments wouldnt have had to leave the church thomas said saul died a week before you arrived philemon disappeared two days later so philemon could have helped godwyn dig up the grave yes the three of them looked at one another trying to ignore the mad mumblings of godwyn theres only one way to find out merthin said merthin and thomas got their wooden shovels they lifted the memorial slab and the paving stones around it and started digging thomas had developed a onehanded technique he pushed the shovel into the earth with his good arm tilted it then ran his hand all the way down the shaft to the blade and lifted it his right arm had become very muscular as a result of this kind of adaptation nevertheless it took a long time many graves were shallow nowadays but for prior saul they had dug down the full six feet night was falling outside and caris fetched candles the devils in the wall painting seemed to move in the flickering light both thomas and merthin were standing in the hole with only their heads visible above floor level when merthin said wait somethings here caris saw some muddy white material that looked like the oiled linen sometimes used for shrouds youve found the body she said thomas said but wheres the coffin was he buried in a box coffins were only for the elite poor people were interred in a shroud thomas said saul was buried in a coffin i saw it theres plenty of wood here in the middle of the forest all the monks were put in coffins right up until brother silas fell ill he was the carpenter wait said merthin he pushed his shovel through the earth at the feet of the shroud and lifted a shovelful then he tapped with the blade and caris heard the dull thud of wood on wood heres the coffin underneath he said thomas said how did the body get out caris felt a shiver of fear over in the corner godwyn raised his voice and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and the smoke of his torment will rise up for ever and ever thomas said to caris cant you shut him up ive got no drugs with me merthin said theres nothing supernatural here my guess is that godwyn and philemon took the body out and filled the coffin with their stolen treasures thomas pulled himself together wed better look in the coffin then first they had to move the shrouded corpse merthin and thomas bent down grabbed it by the shoulders and knees and lifted it when they had raised it to the level of their shoulders the only way they could get it farther was to toss it out on to the floor it landed with a thump they both looked fearful even caris who did not believe much of what she was told about the spirit world felt frightened by what they were doing and found herself glancing nervously over her shoulder into the shadowed corners of the church merthin cleared the earth from the top of the coffin while thomas went to fetch an iron bar then they lifted the lid of the casket caris held two candles over the grave so that they could see better inside the coffin was another shrouded body thomas said this is very strange his voice was distinctly shaky lets just think sensibly about this merthin said he was sounding calm and collected but caris who knew him extraordinarily well could tell that his composure was taking a big effort who is in the coffin he said lets look he bent down grabbed the shroud in two hands and ripped it open along the stitched seam at the head the corpse was a week dead and there was a bad smell but it had not deteriorated much in the cold ground under the unheated church even in the unsteady light from cariss candles there was no doubt about the identity of the dead man the head was fringed with distinctively ashblond hair thomas said thats saul whitehead in his rightful coffin said merthin caris said so who is the other corpse merthin closed the shroud around sauls blond head and replaced the coffin lid caris knelt by the other corpse she had dealt with many dead bodies but she had never brought one up from its grave and her hands were shaky nevertheless she opened the shroud and exposed the face to her horror the eyes were open and seemed to be staring she forced herself to close the cold eyelids it was a big young monk she did not recognize thomas stood on tiptoe to look out of the grave and said thats brother jonquil he died the day after prior saul caris said and he was buried in the cemetery we all thought in a coffin yes except that hes here his coffin weighed enough thomas said i helped carry it merthin said i see what happened jonquil lay here in the church in his coffin prior to burial while the other monks were at dinner godwyn and philemon opened the coffin and took the body out they dug up sauls tomb and tumbled jonquil in on top of sauls coffin they closed the grave then they put the cathedral treasures in jonquils coffin and closed it again thomas said so we have to dig up jonquils grave caris glanced up at the windows of the church they were dark night had fallen while they were opening the tomb of saul we could leave it until morning she said both men were silent for a long moment then thomas said lets get it over with caris went to the kitchen picked two branches from the firewood pile lit them at the fire then returned to the church as the three of them went outside they heard godwyn cry and the winepress of the wrath of god was trodden outside the city and the grapes gave forth blood and the land was flooded to the height of the horses bridles caris shuddered it was a vile image from the revelation of st john the divine and it disgusted her she tried to put it out of her mind they walked quickly to the cemetery in the red light of the torches caris was relieved to be away from that wall painting and out of earshot of godwyns mad ravings they found jonquils headstone and began to excavate the two men had already dug two graves for the novices and redug sauls this was their fourth since dinner time merthin looked tired and thomas was sweating heavily but they worked on doggedly slowly the hole got deeper and the pile of earth beside it rose higher at last a shovel struck wood caris passed merthin the crowbar then she knelt on the edge of the pit holding both torches merthin prised open the coffin lid and threw it out of the grave there was no corpse in the box instead it was packed tightly with bags and boxes merthin opened a leather bag and pulled out a jewelled crucifix hallelujah he said wearily thomas opened a box to reveal a row of parchment rolls packed tightly together like fish in a crate the charters caris felt a weight of worry roll off her shoulders she had got the nunnery charters back thomas put his hand into another bag when he looked at what he had got hold of it was a skull he gave a fearful cry and dropped it st adolphus merthin said in a matteroffact voice pilgrims travel hundreds of miles to touch the box that holds his bones he picked up the skull lucky us he said and put it back into the bag if i may make a suggestion said caris we have to carry this stuff all the way back to kingsbridge in a cart why dont we leave it in the coffin its packed already and the casket may serve to deter thieves good idea merthin said well just lift the coffin out of the grave thomas returned to the priory and brought ropes and they lifted the coffin out of the hole they refixed the lid then tied the ropes around the box in order to drag it across the ground and into the church as they were about to start they heard a scream caris let out a cry of fear they all looked towards the church a figure was running towards them eyes staring blood coming from its mouth caris suffered a moment of utter terror when she suddenly believed every foolish superstition she had ever heard about spirits then she realized she was looking at godwyn somehow he had found the strength to rise from his death bed he had staggered out of the church and seen their torches and now in his madness he was running towards them they watched him transfixed he stopped and looked at the coffin then at the empty grave and in the restless torchlight caris thought she saw a glimmer of understanding on his grimacing face then he seemed to lose his strength and he collapsed he fell on the mound of earth beside jonquils empty grave then he rolled down the mound and into the pit they all stepped forward and looked into the grave godwyn lay there on his back looking up at them with open sightless eyes as soon as caris got back to kingsbridge she decided to leave again the image of stjohnintheforest that stayed with her was not the graveyard nor the corpses merthin and thomas had dug up but the neat fields with no one tilling them as she rode home with merthin beside her and thomas driving the cart she saw a lot of land in the same state and she foresaw a crisis the monks and nuns got most of their income from rents serfs grew crops and raised livestock on land belonging to the priory and instead of paying a knight or an earl for the privilege they paid the prior or prioress traditionally they brought a portion of their harvest to the cathedral a dozen sacks of flour three sheep a calf a cartload of onions but nowadays most people paid cash if no one was cultivating the land there would be no rent paid obviously and then what would the nuns eat the cathedral ornaments the money and the charters she had retrieved from stjohnintheforest were stashed safely in the new secret treasury that mother cecilia had commissioned jeremiah to build in a place where no one could easily find it all the ornaments had been found except one a gold candlestick given by the chandlers guild the group that represented the waxcandle makers of kingsbridge that had disappeared caris held a triumphant sunday service featuring the rescued bones of the saint she put thomas in charge of the boys in the orphanage some of them were old enough to require a strong male presence she herself moved into the priors palace thinking with pleasure how appalled the late godwyn would be that it was occupied by a woman then as soon as she had dealt with these details she went to outhenby the vale of outhen was a fertile valley of heavy clay soil a days journey from kingsbridge it had been given to the nuns a hundred years ago by a wicked old knight making a lastgasp attempt to win forgiveness for a lifetime of sins five villages stood at intervals along the banks of the river outhen on either side the great fields covered the land and the lower slopes of the hills the fields were divided into strips allocated to different families as she had feared many strips were not being cultivated the plague had changed everything but no one had had the brains or perhaps the courage to reorganize farming in the light of the new circumstances caris herself would have to do that she had a rough idea of what was required and she would work out the details as she went along with her was sister joan a young nun recently out of her novitiate joan was a bright girl who reminded caris of herself ten years ago not in appearance for she was blackhaired and blueeyed but in her questioning mind and brisk scepticism they rode to the largest of the villages outhenby the bailiff for the whole valley will lived there in a large timber house next to the church he was not at home but they found him in the farthest field sowing oats a big slowmoving man the next strip had been left fallow and wild grass and weeds were poking up grazed by a few sheep will bailiff visited the priory several times a year usually to bring the rents from the villages so he knew caris but he was disconcerted to meet her on his home ground sister caris he exclaimed when he recognized her what brings you here im mother caris now will and ive come to make sure the nuns lands are being properly husbanded ah he shook his head were doing our best as you see but weve lost so many men that its very very difficult bailiffs always said that times were difficult but in this case it was true caris dismounted walk with me and tell me about it a few hundred yards away on the gentle slope of a hillside she saw a peasant ploughing with a team of eight oxen he halted the team and looked at her curiously so she headed that way will began to recover his composure walking alongside her he said a woman of god such as yourself cant be expected to know much about tilling the soil of course but ill do my best to explain the finer points that would be kind she was used to being condescended to by men of wills type she had found that it was best not to challenge them but rather to lull them into a false sense of security that way she learned more how many men have you lost to the plague oh many men how many well now let me see there was william jones and his two sons then richard carpenter and his wife i dont need to know their names she said controlling her exasperation how many roughly speaking id have to think about that they had reached the plough managing the eightox team was a skilled job and ploughmen were often among the more intelligent villagers caris addressed the young man how many people in outhenby have died of the plague about two hundred id say caris studied him he was short but muscular with a bushy blond beard he had a cocksure look as young men often did who are you she asked my name is harry and my father was richard holy sister i am mother caris how do you work out that figure of two hundred theres fortytwo dead here in outhenby by my reckoning its just as bad in ham and shortacre making about a hundred and twenty longwater escaped completely but every soul in oldchurch is dead but old roger breton which is about eighty people making two hundred she turned to will out of about how many in the whole valley ah now let me see harry ploughman said a thousand near enough before the plague will said thats why you see me sowing my own strip which should be done by labourers but i have no labourers theyve all died harry said or theyve gone to work elsewhere for higher wages caris perked up oh who offers higher wages some of the wealthier peasants in the next valley will said indignantly the nobility pay a penny a day which is what labourers have always got and always should but there are some people who think they can do as they please but they get their crops sowed i suppose caris said but theres right and wrong mother caris said will caris pointed to the fallow strip where the sheep were and what about that land why has it not been ploughed will said that belonged to william jones he and his sons died and his wife went to live with her sister in shiring have you looked for a new tenant cant get them mother harry interjected again not on the old terms anyhow will glared at him but caris said what do you mean prices have fallen you see even though its spring when corn is usually dear caris nodded that was how markets worked everyone knew if there were fewer buyers the price fell but people must live somehow they dont want to grow wheat and barley and oats but they have to grow what theyre told at least in this valley so a man looking for a tenancy would rather go elsewhere and what will he get elsewhere will interrupted angrily they want to do as they please harry answered cariss question they want to be free tenants paying cash rent rather than serfs working one day a week on the lords land and they want to be able to grow different crops what crops hemp or flax or apples and pears things they know they can sell at the market maybe something different every year but thats never been allowed in outhenby harry seemed to recollect himself and added no offence to your holy order mother prioress nor to will bailiff an honest man as everyone knows caris saw how it was bailiffs were always conservative in good times it hardly mattered the old ways sufficed but this was a crisis she assumed her most authoritative manner all right listen carefully now will and ill tell you what youre going to do will looked startled he had thought he was being consulted not commanded first you are to stop ploughing the hillsides its foolish when weve got good land uncultivated but be quiet and listen offer every tenant an exchange acre for acre good valley bottom instead of hillside then what will we do with the hillside convert it to grazing cattle on the lower slopes and sheep on the higher you dont need many men for that just a few boys to herd them oh said will it was plain that he wanted to argue but he could not immediately think of an objection caris went on next any valleybottom land that is still untenanted should be offered as a free tenancy with cash rent to anyone who will take it on a free tenancy meant that the tenant was not a serf and did not have to work on the lords land or get his permission to marry or build a house all he had to do was pay his rent youre doing away with all the old customs she pointed at the fallow strip the old customs are letting my land go to waste can you think of another way to stop this happening well said will and there was a long pause then he shook his head silently thirdly offer wages of two pence a day to anyone who will work the land two pence a day caris felt she could not rely on will to implement these changes vigorously he would drag his feet and invent excuses she turned to the cocksure ploughman she would make him the champion of her reforms harry i want you to go to every market in the county over the next few weeks spread the word that anyone who is on the move can do well in outhenby if there are labourers looking for wages i want them to come here harry grinned and nodded though will still looked a bit dazed i want to see all this good land growing crops this summer she said is that clear yes said will thank you mother prioress caris went through all the charters with sister joan making a note of the date and subject of each she decided to have them copied one by one the idea godwyn had proposed though he had only pretended to be copying them as a pretext for taking them away from the nuns but it was a sound notion the more copies there were the harder it was for a valuable document to disappear she was intrigued by a deed dated which assigned to the monks the large farm near lynn in norfolk that they called lynn grange the gift was made on condition the priory took on as a novice monk a knight called sir thomas langley caris was taken back to her childhood and the day she had ventured into the wood with merthin ralph and gwenda and they had seen thomas receive the wound that had caused him to lose his arm she showed the charter to joan who shrugged and said its usual for such a gift to be made when someone from a wealthy family becomes a monk but look who the donor is joan looked again queen isabella isabella was the widow of edward ii and the mother of edward iii whats her interest in kingsbridge or in thomas said caris a few days later she had a chance to find out the bailiff of lynn grange andrew came to kingsbridge on his biannual visit a norfolkborn man of over fifty he had been in charge of the grange ever since it was gifted to the priory he was now whitehaired and plump which led caris to believe that the grange continued to prosper despite the plague because norfolk was several days journey away the grange paid its dues to the priory in coins rather than drive cattle or cart produce all that way and andrew brought the money in gold nobles the new coin worth a third of a pound with an image of king edward standing on the deck of a ship when caris had counted the money and given it to joan to stash in the new treasury she said to andrew why did queen isabella give us this grange twentytwo years ago do you know to her surprise andrews pink face turned pale he made several false starts at answering then said its not for me to question her majestys decisions no indeed caris said in a reassuring tone im just curious about her motive she is a holy woman who has performed many pious acts like murdering her husband caris thought but she said however there must be a reason she named thomas he petitioned the queen for a favour like hundreds of others and she graciously granted it as great ladies sometimes do usually when they have some connection with the petitioner no no im sure theres no connection his anxiety made caris sure he was lying and just as sure that he would not tell her the truth so she dropped the subject and sent andrew off to have supper in the hospital next morning she was accosted in the cloisters by brother thomas the only monk left in the monastery looking angry he said why did you interrogate andrew lynn because i was curious she said taken aback what are you trying to do im not trying to do anything she was offended by his aggressive manner but she did not want to quarrel with him to ease the tension she sat on the low wall around the edge of the arcade a spring sun was shining bravely into the quadrangle she spoke in a conversational tone whats this all about thomas said stiffly why are you investigating me im not she said calm down im going through all the charters listing them and having them copied i came across one that puzzled me youre delving into matters that are none of your business she bridled im the prioress of kingsbridge and the acting prior nothing here is secret from me well if you start digging up all that old stuff youll regret it i promise you it sounded like a threat but she decided not to challenge him she tried a different tack thomas i thought we were friends you have no right to forbid me to do anything and im disappointed that you should even try dont you trust me you dont know what youre asking then enlighten me what does queen isabella have to do with you me and kingsbridge nothing shes an old woman now living in retirement shes fiftythree shes deposed one king and she could probably depose another if she had a mind to and she has some longhidden connection with my priory which you are determined to keep from me for your own good she ignored that twentytwo years ago someone was trying to kill you was it the same person who having failed to do away with you paid you off by getting you admitted to the monastery andrew is going to go back to lynn and tell isabella that youve been asking these questions do you realize that why would she care why are people so afraid of you thomas everything will be answered when im dead none of it will matter then he turned round and walked away the bell rang for dinner caris went to the priors palace deep in thought godwyns cat archbishop was sitting on the doorstep it glared at her and she shooed it away she would not have it in the house she had got into the habit of dining every day with merthin traditionally the prior regularly dined with the alderman though to do so every day was unusual but these were unusual times that at any rate would have been her excuse had anyone challenged her but nobody did meanwhile they both looked out eagerly for another excuse to go on a trip so that they could again be alone together he came in muddy from his building site on leper island he had stopped asking her to renounce her vows and leave the priory he seemed content at least for the moment to see her every day and hope for future chances to be more intimate a priory employee brought them ham stewed with winter greens when the servant had gone caris told merthin about the charter and thomass reaction he knows a secret that could damage the old queen if it got out i think that must be right merthin said thoughtfully on all hallows day in after i ran away he caught you didnt he yes he made me help him bury a letter i had to swear to keep it secret until he dies then i am to dig it up and give it to a priest he told me all my questions would be answered when he died i think the letter is the threat he holds over his enemies they must know that its contents will be revealed when he dies so they fear to kill him in fact they have made sure he remains alive and well by helping him become a monk of kingsbridge can it matter still ten years after we buried the letter i told him i hadnt ever let the secret out and he said if you had youd be dead that scared me more than the vow mother cecilia told me that edward ii did not die naturally how would she know a thing like that my uncle anthony told her so i presume the secret is that queen isabella had her husband murdered half the country believes that anyway but if there were proof did cecilia say how he was killed caris thought hard no now that i think of it what she said was the old king did not die of a fall i asked her if he had been murdered but she died without answering still why put out a false story about his death if not to cover up foul play and thomass letter must somehow prove that there was foul play and that the queen was in on it they finished their dinner in thoughtful silence in the monastery day the hour after dinner was for rest or reading caris and merthin usually lingered for a while today however merthin was anxious about the angles of the roof timbers being erected in the new tavern the bridge that he was building on leper island they kissed hungrily but he tore himself away and hurried back to the site disappointed caris opened a book called ars medica a latin translation of a work by the ancient greek physician galen it was the cornerstone of university medicine and she was reading it to find out what priests learned at oxford and paris though she had so far found little that would help her the maid came back and cleared the table ask brother thomas to come and see me please caris said she wanted to make sure they were still friends despite their abrasive conversation before thomas arrived there was a commotion outside she heard several horses and the kind of shouting that indicated a nobleman wanting attention a few moments later the door was flung open and in walked sir ralph fitzgerald lord of tench he looked angry but caris pretended not to notice that hello ralph she said as amiably as she could this is an unexpected pleasure welcome to kingsbridge never mind all that he said rudely he walked up to where she sat and stood aggressively close do you realize youre ruining the peasantry of the entire county another figure followed him in and stood by the door a big man with a small head and caris recognized his longtime sidekick alan fernhill both were armed with swords and daggers caris was acutely aware that she was alone in the palace she tried to defuse the scene would you like some ham ralph ive just finished dinner ralph was not to be diverted youve been stealing my peasants peasants or pheasants alan fernhill burst out laughing ralph reddened and looked more dangerous and caris wished she had not made that joke if you poke fun at me youll be sorry he said caris poured ale into a cup im not laughing at you she said tell me exactly whats on your mind she offered him the ale her shaking hand betrayed her fear but he ignored the cup and wagged his finger at her labourers have been disappearing from my villages and when i inquire after them i find they have moved to villages belonging to you where they get higher wages caris nodded if you were selling a horse and two men wanted to buy it wouldnt you give it to the one who offered the higher price thats not the same i think it is have some ale with a sudden sideswipe of his hand he knocked the cup from her grasp it fell to the floor the ale spilling into the straw theyre my labourers her hand was bruised but she tried to ignore the pain she bent down picked up the cup and set it on the sideboard not really she said if theyre labourers that means youve never given them any land so they have the right to go elsewhere im still their lord damn it and another thing i offered a tenancy to a free man the other day and he refused it saying he could get a better bargain from kingsbridge priory same thing ralph i need all the people i can get so i give them what they want youre a woman you dont think things through you cant see that it will all end with everyone paying more for the same peasants not necessarily higher wages might attract some of those who at present do no work at all outlaws for example or those vagabonds who go around living off what they find in plagueemptied villages and some who are now labourers might become tenants and work harder because theyre cultivating their own land he banged the table with his fist and she blinked at the sudden noise youve no right to change the old ways i think i have he grabbed the front of her robe well im not putting up with it take your hands off me you clumsy oaf she said at that moment brother thomas came in you sent for me what the devil is going on here he stepped smartly across the room and ralph let go of cariss robe as if it had suddenly caught fire thomas had no weapons and only one arm but he had got the better of ralph once before and ralph was scared of him ralph took a step back then realized he had revealed his fear and looked ashamed were done here he said loudly and turned to the door caris said what im doing in outhenby and elsewhere is perfectly legitimate ralph its interfering with the natural order he said theres no law against it alan opened the door for his master you wait and see said ralph and he went out in march that year gwenda and wulfric went with nathan reeve to the midweek market at the small town of northwood they were working for sir ralph now gwenda and wulfric had escaped the plague so far but several of ralphs labourers had died of it so he needed help and nate the bailiff of wigleigh had offered to take them on he could afford to pay normal wages whereas perkin had been giving them nothing more than their food as soon as they announced they were going to work for ralph perkin discovered that he could now afford to pay them normal wages but he was too late on this day they took a cartload of logs from ralphs forest to sell in northwood a town that had had a timber market since time immemorial the boys sam and david went with them there was no one else to look after them gwenda did not trust her father and her mother had died two years ago wulfrics parents were long dead several other wigleigh folk were at the market father gaspard was buying seeds for his vegetable garden and gwendas father joby was selling freshly killed rabbits nate the bailiff was a stunted man with a twisted back and he could not lift logs he dealt with customers while wulfric and gwenda did the lifting at midday he gave them a penny to buy their dinner at the old oak one of the taverns around the square they got bacon boiled with leeks and shared it with the boys david at eight years of age still had a childs appetite but sam was a fastgrowing ten and perpetually hungry while they were eating they overheard a conversation that caught gwendas attention there was a group of young men standing in a corner drinking large tankards of ale they were all poorly dressed except one with a bushy blond beard who had the superior clothes of a prosperous peasant or a village craftsman leather trousers good boots and a new hat the sentence that caused gwenda to prick up her ears was we pay two pence a day for labourers at outhenby she listened hard trying to learn more but caught only scattered words she had heard that some employers were offering more than the traditional penny a day because of the shortage of workers caused by the plague she had hesitated to believe such stories which sounded too good to be true she said nothing for the moment to wulfric who had not heard the magic words but her heart beat faster she and her family had endured so many years of poverty was it possible that life might get better for them she had to find out more when they had eaten they sat on a bench outside watching the boys and some other children running around the broad trunk of the tree that gave the tavern its name wulfric she said quietly what if we could earn two pence a day each how by going to outhenby she told him what she had overheard it could be the beginning of a new life for us she finished am i never to get back my fathers lands then she could have hit him with a stick did he really still think that was going to happen how foolish could he be she tried to make her voice as gentle as possible its twelve years since you were disinherited she said in that time ralph has become more and more powerful and theres never been the least sign that he might mellow towards you what do you think the chances are he did not answer that question where would we live they must have houses in outhenby but will ralph let us go he cant stop us were labourers not serfs you know that but does ralph know it lets not give him the chance to object how could we manage that well she had not thought this through but now she saw that it would have to be done precipitately we could leave today from here it was a scary thought they had both lived their entire lives in wigleigh wulfric had never even moved house now they were contemplating going to live in a village they had never seen without even going back to say goodbye but wulfric was worrying about something else he pointed at the hunchbacked bailiff crossing the square to the chandlers shop what would nathan say we wont tell him what were planning well give him some story say we want to stay here overnight for some reason and return home tomorrow that way nobody will know where we are and well never go back to wigleigh never go back wulfric said despondently gwenda controlled her impatience she knew her husband once wulfric was set on a course he was unstoppable but he took a long time to decide he would come round to this idea eventually he was not closedminded just cautious and deliberate he hated to make decisions in a rush whereas she thought it was the only way the young man with the blond beard came out of the old oak gwenda looked around none of the wigleigh folk was in sight she stood up and accosted the man did i hear you say something about two pence a day for labourers she said thats right mistress he replied in the vale of outhenby just half a day southwest of here we need all we can get who are you im the ploughman of outhenby my name is harry outhenby must be a large and prosperous village to have a ploughman all of its own gwenda reasoned most ploughmen worked for a group of villages and who is lord of the manor the prioress of kingsbridge caris that was wonderful news caris could be trusted gwendas spirits lifted further yes she is the current prioress harry said a very determined woman i know she wants her fields cultivated so that she can feed the sisters and shes not listening to excuses do you have houses at outhenby for labourers to live in with their families plenty unfortunately weve lost many people to the plague you said it was southwest of here take the southerly road to badford then follow the outhen upstream caution returned to gwenda im not going she said quickly ah of course he did not believe her i was really asking on behalf of a friend she turned away well tell your friend to come as soon as he can weve got spring ploughing and sowing to finish yet all right she felt slightly dizzy as if she had taken a draught of strong wine two pence a day working for caris and miles away from ralph perkin and flirty annet it was a dream she sat back down beside wulfric did you hear all that she asked him yes he said he pointed to a figure standing by the tavern door and so did he gwenda looked it was her father put that horse in the traces nate said to wulfric around midafternoon its time to go home wulfric said well be needing our wages for the week so far youll be paid on saturday as usual nate said dismissively hitch that nag wulfric did not move towards the horse ill trouble you to pay me today he insisted i know youve got the money youve sold all that timber nate turned and looked directly at him why should you be paid early he said irritably because i shant be returning to wigleigh with you tonight nate was taken aback why not gwenda took over were going to melcombe she said what nate was outraged people like you have no business travelling to melcombe we met a fisherman who needs crew for two pence a day gwenda had worked out this story to throw any pursuit off the scent wulfric added our respects to sir ralph and may god be with him in the future gwenda added but we dont expect to see him ever again she said it just to hear the sweet sound of it never to see ralph again nathan said indignantly he may not wish you to leave were not serfs we have no land ralph cannot forbid us youre the son of a serf nathan said to wulfric but ralph denied me my inheritance wulfric replied he cannot now demand my fealty its a dangerous thing for a poor man to stand on his rights thats true wulfric conceded but im doing it all the same nate was beaten you shall hear more of this he said would you like me to put the horse to the cart nate scowled he could not do it himself because of his back he had difficulty with complicated physical tasks and the horse was taller than he yes of course he said ill be glad to would you kindly pay me first looking furious nate took out his purse and counted six silver pennies gwenda took the money and wulfric hitched up the horse nate drove away without another word well said gwenda thats done she looked at wulfric he was smiling broadly she asked him what is it i dont know he said i feel as if ive been wearing a collar for years and suddenly its been taken off good that was how she wanted him to feel now lets find a place to stay the night the old oak was in a prime position in the market square and charged top prices they walked around the little town looking for somewhere cheaper eventually they went into the gate house where gwenda negotiated accommodation for the four of them supper a mattress on the floor and breakfast for a penny the boys would need a decent nights sleep and some breakfast if they were to walk all morning she could hardly sleep for excitement she was also worried what was she taking her family to she had only the word of one man a stranger for what they would find when they reached outhenby she really ought to have sought confirmation before committing herself but she and wulfric had been stuck in a hole for ten years and harry ploughman of outhenby was the first person to offer them a way out of it the breakfast was meagre thin porridge and watery cider gwenda bought a big loaf of new bread for them to eat on the road and wulfric filled his leather flask with cold water from a well they passed through the city gate an hour after sunrise and set off on the road south as they walked she thought about joby her father as soon as he learned that she had not returned to wigleigh he would remember the conversation he had overheard and he would guess she had gone to outhenby he would not be fooled by the story about melcombe he was an accomplished deceiver himself too experienced to be taken in by a simple ruse but would anyone think to ask him where she had gone everyone knew she never spoke to her father and if they did ask him would he blurt out what he suspected or would some vestige of paternal feeling cause him to protect her there was nothing she could do about it so she put him out of her mind it was good weather for travelling the ground was soft with recent rain and there was no dust but today was a dry day with fitful sunshine neither cold nor hot the boys quickly grew tired especially david the younger but wulfric was good at distracting them with songs and rhymes quizzing them about the names of trees and plants playing number games and telling stories gwenda could hardly believe what they had done this time yesterday it had looked as if their life would never change hard work poverty and frustrated aspirations would be their lot for ever now they were on the road to a new life she thought of the house where she had lived with wulfric for ten years she had not left much behind a few cooking pots a stack of newly chopped firewood half a ham and four blankets she had no clothes other than what she was wearing and neither did wulfric or the boys no jewellery ribbons gloves or combs ten years ago wulfric had had chickens and pigs in his yard but they had gradually been eaten or sold during the years of penury their meagre possessions could be replaced with a weeks wages at the promised outhenby rates in accordance with harrys directions they took the road south to a muddy ford across the outhen then turned west and followed the river upstream as they progressed the river narrowed until the land funnelled between two ranges of hills good fertile soil wulfric said itll need the heavy plough though at noon they came to a large village with a stone church they went to the door of a timber manor house next to the church with trepidation gwenda knocked was she about to be told that harry ploughman did not know what he was talking about and there was no work here had she made her family walk half a day for nothing how humiliating it would be to have to return to wigleigh and beg to be taken on again by nate reeve a greyhaired woman came to the door she looked at gwenda with the suspicious glare that villagers everywhere gave to strangers yes good day mistress gwenda said is this outhenby it is were labourers looking for work harry ploughman told us to come here did he now was there something wrong gwenda wondered or was this woman just a grumpy old cow she almost asked the question out loud stopping herself she said does harry live at this house certainly not the woman replied hes just a ploughman this is the bailiffs house some conflict between bailiff and ploughman gwenda guessed perhaps we should see the bailiff then hes not here patiently gwenda said would you be kind enough to tell us where we might find him the woman pointed across the valley north field gwenda turned to look in the direction indicated when she turned back the woman had disappeared into the house wulfric said she didnt seem pleased to see us old women hate change gwenda commented lets find this bailiff the boys are tired they can rest soon they set off across the fields there was plenty of activity on the strips children were picking stones off ploughed land women were sowing seeds and men were carting manure gwenda could see the ox team in the distance eight mighty beasts patiently dragging the plough through the wet heavy soil they came upon a group of men and women trying to move a horsedrawn harrow that had got stuck in a ditch gwenda and wulfric joined in pushing it out wulfrics broad back made the difference and the harrow was freed all the villagers turned and looked at wulfric a tall man with an old burn mark disfiguring one side of his face said amiably youre a useful fellow who are you im wulfric and my wife is gwenda were labourers looking for work youre just what we need wulfric the man said im carl shaftesbury he stuck out his hand to shake welcome to outhenby ralph came eight days later wulfric and gwenda had moved into a small wellbuilt house with a stone chimney and an upstairs bedroom where they could sleep separately from the boys they got a wary reception from the older more conservative villagers notably will bailiff and his wife vi who had been so rude to them on the day they arrived but harry ploughman and the younger set were excited by the changes and glad to have help in the fields they were paid two pence a day as promised and gwenda looked forward eagerly to the end of their first full week when they each got twelve pence a shilling double the highest sum they had ever earned what would they do with all that money neither wulfric nor gwenda had worked anywhere but wigleigh and they were surprised to find that not all villages were the same the ultimate authority here was the prioress of kingsbridge and that made a difference ralphs rule was personal and arbitrary appealing to him was hazardous by contrast outhenby folk seemed to know what the prioress would want in most situations and they could settle disputes by figuring out what she would say if asked to adjudicate a mild disagreement of this kind was going on when ralph came they were all walking home from the fields at sundown the adults workweary the children running on ahead and harry ploughman bringing up the rear with the unharnessed oxen carl shaftesbury the man with the burned face who was a newcomer like gwenda and wulfric had caught three eels at dawn for his familys supper as it was friday the question was whether labourers had the same right as tenants to take fish from the outhen river on fast days harry ploughman said the privilege extended to all outhenby residents vi bailiff said that tenants owed customary dues to the landlord which labourers did not and those who had extra duties should have extra privileges will bailiff was called upon for a decision and he ruled against his wife i believe the mother prioress would say that if the church wishes people to eat fish then fish must be provided for them to eat he said and that was accepted by everyone looking towards the village gwenda saw two horsemen a cold wind gusted suddenly the visitors were half a mile away across the fields and heading for the houses at an angle to the path the villagers were taking she could tell they were menatarms they had big horses and their clothes looked bulky men of violence generally wore heavily padded coats she nudged wulfric ive seen them he said grimly such men had no casual reason to come to a village they despised the people who grew the crops and cared for the livestock they normally visited only to take from the peasants those things they were too proud to provide for themselves bread and meat and drink their view of what they were entitled to or how much they should pay always differed from that of the peasants so there was invariably trouble within the next couple of minutes all the villagers saw them and the group went quiet gwenda noticed that harry turned the oxen slightly and headed for the far end of the village though she could not immediately guess why gwenda felt sure the two men had come to find runaway labourers she found herself praying they would turn out to be the former employers of carl shaftesbury or one of the other newcomers however as the villagers came closer to the horsemen she recognized ralph fitzgerald and alan fernhill and her heart sank this was the moment she had dreaded she had known there was a chance ralph would find out where they had gone her father could make a good guess and he could not be relied upon to keep his mouth shut and although ralph had no right to take them back he was a knight and a nobleman and such people generally did as they pleased it was too late to run the group was walking along a path between broad ploughed fields if some of them broke away and fled ralph and alan would immediately see them and give chase and then gwenda and her family would lose whatever protection they might gain from being with other villagers they were trapped in the open she called to her boys sam david come here they did not hear or did not want to and they ran on gwenda went after them but they thought it was a game and tried to outrun her they were almost at the village now and she found she was too tired to catch them almost in tears she shouted come back wulfric took over he ran past her and easily caught up with david he scooped the boy up in his arms but he was too late to catch sam who ran laughing in among the scattered houses the horsemen were reined in by the church as sam ran towards them ralph nudged his horse forward then leaned down from the saddle and picked the boy up by his shirt sam gave a shout of fright gwenda screamed ralph sat the boy on his horses wither wulfric carrying david came to a stop in front of ralph ralph said your son i presume gwenda was appalled she was afraid for her son it would be beneath ralphs dignity to attack a child but there might be an accident and there was another danger seeing ralph and sam together wulfric might realize they were father and son sam was still a little boy of course with a childs body and face but he had ralphs thick hair and dark eyes and his bony shoulders were wide and square gwenda looked at her husband wulfrics expression showed no sign that he had seen what was so obvious to her she surveyed the faces of the other villagers they seemed oblivious to the stark truth except for vi bailiff who was giving gwenda a hard stare that old battleaxe might have guessed but no one else had yet will came forward and addressed the visitors good day to you sirs im will the bailiff of outhenby may i ask shut your mouth bailiff said ralph he pointed at wulfric what is he doing here gwenda sensed a slight easing of tension as the other villagers realized they were not the target of the lords wrath will replied my lord hes a labourer hired on the authority of the prioress of kingsbridge hes a runaway and hes got to come home ralph said will fell silent frightened carl shaftesbury said and what authority do you claim for this demand ralph peered at carl as if memorizing his face watch your tongue or ill disfigure the other side of your face will said nervously we dont want any bloodshed very wise bailiff said ralph who is this insolent peasant never you mind who i am knight said carl rudely i know who you are youre ralph fitzgerald and i saw you convicted of rape and sentenced to death at shiring court but im not dead am i ralph said you should be though and you have no feudal rights over labourers if you try to use force youll be taught a sharp lesson several people gasped this was a reckless way to speak to an armed knight wulfric said be quiet carl i dont want you killed for my sake its not for your sake carl said if this thug is allowed to drag you off next week someone will come for me we have to stick together were not helpless carl was a big man taller than wulfric and almost as broad and gwenda could see that he meant what he said she was appalled if they started fighting there would be terrible violence and her sam was still sitting on the horse with ralph well just go with ralph she said frantically it will be better carl said no it wont im going to stop him taking you away whether you want me to or not its for my own good there was a murmur of assent gwenda looked around most of the men were holding shovels or hoes and they looked ready to swing them though they also looked scared wulfric turned his back on ralph and spoke in a low urgent voice you women take the children into the church quickly now several women snatched up toddlers and grabbed youngsters by the arms gwenda stayed where she was and so did several of the younger women the villagers instinctively moved closer together standing shoulder to shoulder ralph and alan looked disconcerted they had not expected to face a crowd of fifty or more belligerent peasants but they were on horseback so they could get away any time they wanted ralph said well perhaps ill just take this little boy to wigleigh gwenda gasped with horror ralph went on then if his parents want him they can come back where they belong gwenda was beside herself ralph had sam and he could ride away at any moment she fought down a hysterical scream if he turned his horse she decided she would throw herself at him and try to drag him off the saddle she moved a step closer then behind ralph and alan she saw the oxen harry ploughman was driving them through the village from the other end eight massive beasts lumbered up to the scene in front of the church then stopped looking around dumbly not knowing which way to go harry stood behind them ralph and alan found themselves in a triangular trap hemmed in by the villagers the oxen and the stone church harry had planned this to stop ralph riding away with wulfric and herself gwenda guessed but the tactic did just as well for this situation carl said put the child down sir ralph and go in peace the trouble was gwenda thought it was now difficult for ralph to back down without losing face he was going to have to do something to avoid looking foolish which was the ultimate horror for proud knights they talked all the time about their honour but that meant nothing they were thoroughly dishonourable when it suited them what they really prized was their dignity they would rather die than be humiliated the tableau was frozen for several moments the knight and the child on the horse the mutinous villagers and the dumb oxen then ralph lowered sam to the ground tears of relief came to gwendas eyes sam ran to her threw his arms around her waist and began to cry the villagers relaxed the men lowering their shovels and hoes ralph pulled on his horses reins and shouted hup hup the horse reared he dug in his spurs and rode straight at the crowd they scattered alan rode behind him the villagers desperately threw themselves out of the way ending up in tangled heaps on the muddy ground they were trampled by one another but not miraculously by the horses ralph and alan laughed loudly as they rode out of the village as if the entire encounter had been nothing more than a huge joke but in reality ralph had been shamed and that gwenda felt sure meant that he would be back earlscastie had not changed twelve years ago merthin recalled he had been asked to demolish the old fortress and build a new modern palace fit for an earl in a peaceful country but he had refused preferring to design the new bridge at kingsbridge since then it seemed the project had languished for here was the same figureeight wall with two drawbridges and the oldfashioned keep ensconced in the upper loop where the family lived like frightened rabbits at the end of a burrow unaware that there was no longer any danger from the fox the place must have been much the same in the days of lady aliena and jack builder merthin was with caris who had been summoned here by the countess lady philippa earl william had fallen sick and philippa thought her husband had the plague caris had been dismayed she had thought the plague was over no one had died of it in kingsbridge for six weeks caris and merthin had set out immediately however the messenger had taken two days to travel from earlscastie to kingsbridge and they had taken the same time to get here so the likelihood was that the earl would now be dead or nearly so all i will be able to do is give him some poppy essence to ease the final agony caris had said as they rode along you do more than that merthin had said your presence comforts people youre calm and knowledgeable and you talk about things they understand swelling and confusion and pain you dont try to impress them with jargon about humours which just makes them feel more ignorant and powerless and frightened when youre there they feel that everything possible is being done and thats what they want i hope youre right if anything merthin was understating more than once he had seen a hysterical man or woman change after just a few calming moments with caris into a sensible person capable of coping with whatever should happen her inborn gift had been augmented since the advent of the plague by an almost supernatural reputation everyone for miles around knew that she and her nuns had carried on caring for the sick despite the risk to themselves even when the monks had fled they thought she was a saint the atmosphere inside the castle compound was subdued those who had routine tasks were performing them fetching firewood and water feeding horses and sharpening weapons baking bread and butchering meat many others secretaries menatarms messengers sat around doing nothing waiting for news from the sick room the rooks cawed a sarcastic welcome as merthin and caris crossed the inner bridge to the keep merthins father sir gerald always claimed to be directly descended from jack and alienas son earl thomas as merthin counted the steps to the great hall placing his feet carefully in the smooth hollows worn by thousands of boots he reflected that his ancestors had probably trodden on just these old stones to him such notions were intriguing but trivial by contrast his brother ralph was obsessed with restoring the family to its former glory caris was ahead of him and the sway of her hips as she climbed the steps made his lips twitch in a smile he was frustrated by not being able to sleep with her every night but the rare occasions when they could be alone together were all the more thrilling yesterday they had spent a mild spring afternoon making love in a sunlit forest glade while the horses grazed nearby oblivious to their passion it was an odd relationship but then she was an extraordinary woman a prioress who doubted much of what the church taught an acclaimed healer who rejected medicine as practised by physicians and a nun who made enthusiastic love to her man whenever she could get away with it if i wanted a normal relationship merthin told himself i should have picked a normal girl the hall was full of people some were working laying down fresh straw building up the fire preparing the table for dinner and others were simply waiting at the far end of the long room sitting near the foot of the staircase that led up to the earls private quarters merthin saw a welldressed girl of about fifteen she stood up and came towards them with a rather stately walk and merthin realized she must be lady philippas daughter like her mother she was tall with an hourglass figure i am the lady odila she said with a touch of hauteur that was pure philippa despite her composure the skin around her young eyes was red and creased with crying you must be mother caris thank you for coming to attend my father merthin said im the alderman of kingsbridge merthin bridger how is earl william he is very ill and both my brothers have been laid low merthin recalled that the earl and countess had two boys of nineteen and twenty or thereabouts my mother asks that the lady prioress should come to them immediately caris said of course odila went up the stairs caris took from her purse a strip of linen cloth and fastened it over her nose and mouth then followed merthin sat on a bench to wait although he was reconciled to infrequent sex that did not stop him looking out eagerly for extra opportunities and he surveyed the building with a keen eye figuring out the sleeping arrangements unfortunately the house had a traditional layout this large room the great hall would be where almost everyone ate and slept the staircase presumably led to a solar a bedroom for the earl and countess modern castles had a whole suite of apartments for family and guests but there appeared to be no such luxury here merthin and caris might lie side by side tonight on the floor here in the hall but they could do nothing more than sleep not without causing a scandal after a while lady philippa emerged from the solar and came down the stairs she entered a room like a queen aware that all eyes were on her merthin always thought the dignity of her posture only emphasized the alluring roundness of her hips and her proud bosom however today her normally serene face was blotchy and her eyes were red her fashionably piled hairstyle was slightly awry with stray locks of hair escaping from her headdress adding to her air of glamorous distraction merthin stood up and look at her expectantly she said my husband has the plague as i feared and so do both my sons the people around murmured in dismay it might turn out to be no more than the last remnants of the epidemic of course but it could just as easily be the start of a new outbreak god forbid merthin thought he said how is the earl feeling philippa sat on the bench next to him mother caris has eased his pain but she says hes near the end their knees were almost touching he felt the magnetism of her sexuality even though she was drowning in grief and he was dizzy with love for caris and your sons he said she looked down at her lap as if studying the pattern of gold and silver threads woven into her blue gown the same as their father merthin said quietly this is very hard for you my lady very hard she gave him a wary glance youre not like your brother are you merthin knew that ralph had been in love with philippa in his own obsessive way for many years did she realize that merthin did not know ralph had chosen well he thought if you were going to have a hopeless love you might as well pick someone singular ralph and i are very different he said neutrally i remember you as youngsters you were the cheeky one you told me to buy a green silk to match my eyes then your brother started a fight i sometimes think the younger of two brothers deliberately tries to be the opposite of the elder just to differentiate himself its certainly true of my two rollo is strongwilled and assertive like his father and grandfather and rick has always been sweetnatured and obliging she began to cry oh god im going to lose them all merthin took her hand you cant be sure what will happen he said gently i caught the plague in florence and i survived my daughter didnt catch it at all she looked up at him and your wife merthin looked down at their entwined hands philippas was perceptibly more wrinkled than his he saw even though there was only four years difference in their ages he said silvia died i pray to god that i will catch it if all my men die i want to go too surely not its the fate of noblewomen to marry men they dont love but i was lucky you see in william he was chosen for me but i loved him from the start her voice began to fail her i couldnt bear to have someone else you feel that way now of course it was odd to be talking like this while her husband was still alive merthin thought but she was so stricken by grief that she had little thought for niceties and said just what was in her mind she collected herself with an effort what about you she said have you remarried no he could hardly explain that he was having a love affair with the prioress of kingsbridge i think i could though if the right woman were willing you might come to feel the same eventually but you dont understand as the widow of an earl with no heirs i would have to marry someone king edward chose for me and the king would have no thought for my wishes his only concern would be who should be the next earl of shiring i see merthin had not thought of that he could imagine that an arranged marriage might be particularly loathsome to a widow who had truly loved her first husband how dreadful of me to be speaking of another husband while my first is alive she said i dont know what came over me merthin patted her hand sympathetically its understandable the door at the top of the stairs opened and caris came out drying her hands on a cloth merthin suddenly felt uncomfortable about holding philippas hand he was tempted to thrust it away from him but realized how guilty that would look and managed to resist the impulse he smiled at caris and said how are your patients cariss eyes went to their linked hands but she said nothing she came down the stairs untying her linen mask philippa unhurriedly withdrew her hand caris took off her mask and said im very sorry to have to tell you my lady that earl william is dead i need a new horse said ralph fitzgerald his favourite mount griff was getting old the spirited bay palfrey had suffered a sprain in its left hind leg that had taken months to heal and now it was lame again in the same leg ralph felt sad griff was the horse earl roland had given him when he was a young squire and it had been with him ever since even going to the french wars it might serve him a few years longer for unhurried trips from village to village within his domain but its hunting days were over we could go to shiring market tomorrow and buy another alan fernhill said they were in the stable looking at griffs fetlock ralph liked stables he enjoyed the earthy smell the strength and beauty of the horses and the company of roughhanded men engrossed in physical tasks it took him back to his youth when the world had seemed a simple place he did not at first respond to alans suggestion what alan did not know was that ralph did not have the money to buy a horse the plague had at first enriched him through the inheritance tax land that normally passed from father to son once in a generation had changed hands twice or more in a few months and he got a payment every time traditionally the best beast but often a fixed sum in cash but then land had started to fall into disuse for lack of people to farm it at the same time agricultural prices had dropped the upshot was that ralphs income in money and produce fell drastically things were bad he thought when a knight could not afford a horse then he remembered that nate reeve was due to come to tench hall today with the quarterly dues from wigleigh every spring that village was obliged to provide its lord with twentyfour hoggets yearold sheep they could be driven to shiring market and sold and they should raise enough cash to pay for a palfrey if not a hunter all right ralph said to alan lets see if the bailiff of wigleigh is here they went into the hall this was a feminine zone and ralphs spirits dropped immediately tilly was sitting by the fire nursing their threemonthold son gerry mother and baby were in vigorous good health despite tillys youth her slight girlish body had changed drastically she now had swollen breasts with large leathery nipples at which the baby sucked greedily her belly sagged loosely like that of an old woman ralph had not lain with her for many months and he probably never would again nearby sat the grandfather after whom the baby was named sir gerald with lady maud ralphs parents were now old and frail but every morning they walked from their house in the village to the manor house to see their grandson maud said the baby looked like ralph but he could not see the resemblance ralph was pleased to see that nate was also in the hall the hunchbacked bailiff sprang up from his bench good day to you sir ralph he said he had a hangdog look about him ralph observed whats the matter with you nate he said have you brought my hoggets no sir why the devil not weve got none sir there are no sheep left in wigleigh except for a few old ewes ralph was shocked has someone stolen them no but some have been given to you already as heriot when their owners died and then we couldnt find a tenant to take over jack shepherds land and many sheep died over the winter then there was no one to look to the early lambs this spring so we lost most of those and some of the mothers but this is impossible ralph said angrily how are noblemen to live if their serfs let the livestock perish we thought perhaps the plague was over when it died down in january and february but now it seems to be coming back ralph repressed a shudder of terror like everyone else he had been thanking god that he had escaped the plague surely it could not return nate went on perkin died this week and his wife peg and his son rob and his soninlaw billy howard thats left annet with all those acres to manage which she cant possibly do well there must be a heriot due on that property then there will be when i can find a tenant to take it over parliament was in the process of passing new legislation to stop labourers flitting about the country demanding even higher wages as soon as the ordinance became law ralph would enforce it and get his workers back even then he now realized he would be desperate to find tenants nate said i expect youve heard of the death of the earl no ralph was shocked again whats that sir gerald said earl william is dead of the plague nate explained tilly said poor uncle william the baby sensed her mood and wailed ralph spoke over the noise when did this happen only three days ago nate replied tilly gave the baby the nipple again and he shut up so williams elder son is the new earl ralph mused he cant be more than twenty nate shook his head rollo also died of the plague then the younger son dead too both sons ralphs heart leaped it had always been his dream to become the earl of shiring now the plague had given him the opportunity and the plague had also improved his chances for many likely candidates for the title had been wiped out he caught his fathers eye the same thought had occurred to sir gerald tilly said rollo and rick dead its so awful she began to cry ralph ignored her and tried to think through the possibilities lets see what surviving relatives are there gerald said to nate i presume the countess died too no sir lady philippa lives so does her daughter odila ah said gerald so whoever the king chooses will have to marry philippa in order to become earl ralph was thunderstruck since he was a lad he had dreamed of marrying lady philippa now there was an opportunity to achieve both his ambitions at one stroke but he was already married gerald said thats it then he sat back in his chair his excitement gone as quickly as it had come ralph looked at tilly suckling their child and weeping at the same time fifteen years old and barely five feet tall she stood like a castle wall between him and the future he had always yearned for he hated her earl williams funeral took place at kingsbridge cathedral there were no monks except brother thomas but bishop henri conducted the service and the nuns sang the hymns lady philippa and lady odila both heavily veiled followed the coffin despite their dramatic blackclad presence ralph found the occasion lacked the momentous feeling that usually attended the funeral of a magnate the sense of historical time passing by like the flow of a great river death was everywhere every day and even noble deaths were now commonplace he wondered whether someone in the congregation was infected and was even now spreading the disease through his breath or the invisible beams from his eyes the thought made ralph shaky he had faced death many times and learned to control his fear in battle but this enemy could not be fought the plague was an assassin who slid his long knife into people from behind then slipped away before he was spotted ralph shuddered and tried not to think about it next to ralph was the tall figure of sir gregory longfellow a lawyer who had been involved in suits concerning kingsbridge in the past gregory was now a member of the kings council an elite group of technical experts who advised the monarch not on what he should do for that was the job of parliament but on how he could do it royal announcements were often made at church services especially big ceremonies such as this today bishop henri took the opportunity to explain the new ordinance of labourers ralph guessed that sir gregory had brought the news and stayed to see how it was received ralph listened attentively he had never been summoned to parliament but he had talked about the labour crisis to earl william who had sat with the lords and to sir peter jeffries who represented shiring in the commons so he knew what had been discussed every man must work for the lord of the village where he lives and may not move to another village or work for another master unless his lord should release him the bishop said ralph rejoiced he had known this was coming but he was delighted that at last it was official before the plague there had never been a shortage of labourers on the contrary many villages had more than they knew what to do with when landless men could find no paid work they sometimes threw themselves on the charity of the lord which was an embarrassment to him whether he helped them or not so if they wanted to move to another village the lord was if anything relieved and certainly had no need of legislation to keep them where they were now the labourers had the whip hand a situation that obviously could not be allowed to continue there was a rumble of approval from the congregation at the bishops announcement kingsbridge folk themselves were not much affected but those in the congregation who had come in from the countryside for the funeral were predominantly employers rather than employees the new rules had been devised by and for them the bishop went on it is now a crime to demand to offer or to accept wages higher than those paid for similar work in ralph nodded approval even labourers who stayed in the same village had been demanding more money this would put a stop to that he hoped sir gregory caught his eye i see you nodding he said do you approve its what we wanted ralph said ill begin to enforce it in the next few days there are a couple of runaways from my territory that i particularly want to bring home ill come with you if i may the lawyer said i should like to see how things work out the priest at outhenby had died of the plague and there had been no services at the church since so gwenda was surprised when the bell began to toll on sunday morning wulfric went to investigate and came back to report that a visiting priest father derek had arrived so gwenda washed the boys faces quickly and they all went out it was a fine spring morning and the sun bathed the old grey stones of the little church in a clear light all the villagers turned out curious to view the newcomer father derek turned out to be a wellspoken city clergyman too richly dressed for a village church gwenda wondered whether any special significance attached to his visit was there a reason why the church hierarchy had suddenly remembered the existence of this parish she told herself that it was a bad habit always to imagine the worst but all the same she felt something was wrong she stood in the nave with wulfric and the boys watching the priest go through the ritual and her sense of doom grew stronger a priest usually looked at the congregation while he was praying or singing to emphasize that all this was for their benefit not a private communication between himself and god but father dereks gaze went over their heads she soon found out why at the end of the service he told them of a new law passed by the king and parliament landless labourers must work for the lord in their village of origin if required he said gwenda was outraged how can that be she shouted out the lord is not obliged to help the labourer in hard times i know my father was a landless labourer and when there was no work we went hungry so how can the labourer owe loyalty to a lord who gives him nothing a rumble of agreement broke out and the priest had to raise his voice this is what the king has decided and the king is chosen by god to rule over us so we must all do as he wishes can the king change the custom of hundreds of years gwenda persisted these are difficult times i know that many of you have come to outhenby in the last few weeks invited by the ploughman the voice of carl shaftesbury interrupted his scarred face was livid with rage invited by all the villagers the priest acknowledged and they were grateful to you for coming but the king in his wisdom has ruled that this kind of thing must not go on and poor people must remain poor carl said god has ordained it so each man in his place harry ploughman said and has god ordained how we are to till our fields with no help if all the newcomers leave we will never finish the work perhaps not all the newcomers will have to leave said derek the new law says only that they must go home if required that quietened them the immigrants were trying to figure out whether their lords would be able to track them down the locals were wondering how many labourers would be left here but gwenda knew what her own future held sooner or later ralph would come back for her and her family by then she decided they would be gone the priest retired and the congregation began to drift to the door weve got to leave here gwenda said to wulfric in a low voice before ralph comes back for us where will we go i dont know but perhaps thats better if we dont know where were going no one else will but how will we live well find another village where they need labourers are there many others i wonder he was always slowerthinking than she there must be lots she said patiently the king didnt pass this ordinance just for outhenby of course we should leave today she said decisively its sunday so were not losing any work she glanced at the church windows estimating the time of day its not yet noon we could cover a good distance before nightfall who knows we could be working in a new place tomorrow morning i agree wulfric said theres no telling how fast ralph might move say nothing to anyone well go home pick up whatever we want to take with us and just slip away all right they reached the door and stepped outside into the sunshine and gwenda saw that it was already too late six men on horseback were waiting outside the church ralph his sidekick alan a tall man in london clothes and three dirty scarred evillooking ruffians of the kind that could be hired for a few pennies in any low tavern ralph caught gwendas eye and smiled triumphantly gwenda looked around desperately a few days ago the men of the village had stood shoulder to shoulder against ralph and alan but this was different they were up against six men not two the villagers were unarmed coming out of church whereas previously they had been returning from the fields with tools in their hands and most important on that first occasion they had believed they had right on their side whereas today they were not so sure several men met her eye and looked quickly away that confirmed her suspicion the villagers would not fight today gwenda was so disappointed that she felt weak fearing that she might fall down she leaned on the stonework of the church porch for support her heart had turned into something heavy and cold and damp like a clod from a winter grave a grim hopelessness possessed her completely for a few days they had been free but it had just been a dream and now the dream was over ralph rode slowly through wigleigh leading wulfric by a rope around his neck they arrived late in the afternoon for speed ralph had let the two small boys ride sharing the horses of the hired men gwenda was walking behind ralph had not bothered to tie her in any way she could be relied upon to follow her children because it was sunday most of the wigleigh folk were outside their houses enjoying the sun as ralph had anticipated they all stared in horrified silence at the dismal procession ralph hoped the sight of wulfrics humiliation might deter others from going in search of higher wages they reached the small manor house that had been ralphs home before he moved to tench hall he released wulfric and sent him and his family off to their old home he paid off the hired men then took alan and sir gregory into the manor house it was kept clean and ready for his visits he ordered vira to bring wine then prepare supper it was too late now to go on to tench they could not get there before nightfall gregory sat down and stretched out his long legs he seemed like a man who could make himself comfortable anywhere his straight dark hair was now tweeded with grey but his long nose with its flared nostrils still gave him a supercilious look how do you feel that went he said ralph had been thinking about the new ordinance all the way home and he had his answer ready its not going to work he said gregory raised his eyebrows oh alan said i agree with sir ralph reasons ralph said first of all its difficult to find out where the runaways have gone alan put in it was only by luck that we traced wulfric someone had overheard him and gwenda planning where to go second ralph went on recovering them is too troublesome gregory nodded i suppose we have been all day at it and i had to hire those ruffians and get them horses i cant spend my time and money chasing all over the countryside after runaway labourers i see that third what is to stop them running away again next week alan said if they keep their mouths shut about where theyre headed we might never find them the only way it will work ralph said is if someone can go to a village find out who the migrants are and punish them gregory said youre talking about a sort of commission of labourers exactly appoint a panel in each county a dozen or so men who go from place to place ferreting out runaways you want someone else to do the work for you it was a taunt but ralph was careful not to appear stung not necessarily ill be one of the commissioners if you wish its just the way the job is to be done you cant reap a field of grass one blade at a time interesting said gregory vira brought a jug and some goblets and poured wine for the three of them gregory said youre a shrewd man sir ralph youre not a member of parliament are you no pity i think the king would find your counsel helpful ralph tried not to beam with pleasure youre very kind he leaned forward now that earl william is dead there is of course a vacancy he saw the door open and broke off nate reeve came in well done sir ralph if i may say so he said wulfric and gwenda back in the fold the two hardestworking people weve got ralph was annoyed with nate for interrupting at such a crucial moment he said irritably i trust the village will now be able to pay more of its dues yes sir if they stay ralph frowned nate had immediately fastened on the weakness in his position how was he going to keep wulfric in wigleigh he could not chain a man to a plough all day and all night gregory spoke to nate tell me bailiff do you have a suggestion for your lord yes sir i do i thought you might nate took that as an invitation addressing ralph he said there is one thing you could do that would guarantee that wulfric would stay here in wigleigh until the day he dies ralph sensed a trick but had to say go on give him back the lands his father held ralph would have yelled at him except that he did not want to give gregory a bad impression controlling his anger he said firmly i dont think so i cant get a tenant for the land nate persisted annet cant manage it and she has no male relations living i dont care said ralph he cant have the land gregory said why not ralph did not want to admit that he still held a grudge against wulfric because of a fight twelve years ago gregory had formed a good impression of ralph and ralph did not want to spoil it what would the kings counsellor think of a knight who acted against his own interests in pursuit of a boyhood squabble he cast about for a plausible excuse it would seem to be rewarding wulfric for running away he said finally hardly said gregory from what nate says youd be giving him something that no one else wants all the same it sends the wrong signal to the other villagers i think youre being too scrupulous gregory said he was not the kind of man to keep his opinions tactfully to himself everyone must know youre desperate for tenants he went on most landlords are the villagers will see that youre simply acting in your own interest and consider that wulfric is the lucky beneficiary nate added wulfric and gwenda will work twice as hard ii theyve got their own land ralph felt cornered he was desperate to look good in gregorys eyes he had started but not finished a discussion about the earldom he could not put that at risk just because of wulfric he had to give in perhaps youre right he said he realized he was speaking through gritted teeth and made an effort to be nonchalant after all he has been brought home and humiliated that may be enough im sure it is all right nate ralph said for a moment words stuck in his throat he hated so much to give wulfric his hearts desire but this was more important tell wulfric he can have his fathers lands back ill do that before nightfall nate said and he left gregory said what were you saying about the earldom ralph picked his words carefully after earl roland died at the battle of crécy i thought the king might have considered making me the earl of shiring especially as i had saved the life of the young prince of wales but roland had a perfectly good heir who himself had two sons exactly and now all three are dead hmm gregory took a draught from his goblet this is good wine gascon said ralph i suppose it comes into melcombe yes delicious gregory drank some more he seemed to be about to say something so ralph remained silent gregory took a long time choosing his words at last he said there is somewhere in the neighbourhood of kingsbridge a letter that ought not to exist ralph was mystified what was coming now gregory went on for many years this document was in the hands of someone who could be relied upon for various complicated reasons to keep it safe lately however certain questions have been asked suggesting to me that the secret may be in danger of getting out all this was too enigmatic ralph said impatiently i dont understand who has been asking embarrassing questions the prioress of kingsbridge oh its possible she may have simply picked up some hint and her questions may be harmless but what the kings friends fear is that the letter may have got into her possession what is in the letter once again gregory chose his words warily tiptoeing across a raging river on carefully placed stepping stones something touching the kings beloved mother queen isabella the old witch was still alive living in splendour in her castle at lynn spending her days reading romances in her native french so people said in short said gregory i need to find out whether the prioress has this letter or not but no one must know of my interest ralph said either you have to go to the priory and search through the nuns documents or the documents must come to you the second of those two ralph nodded he was beginning to understand what gregory wanted him to do gregory said i have made some very discreet inquiries and discovered that no one knows exactly where the nuns treasury is the nuns must know or some of them but they wont say however i understand youre an expert in persuading people to reveal secrets so gregory knew of the work ralph had done in france there was nothing spontaneous about this conversation ralph realized gregory must have planned it in fact it was probably the real reason he had come to kingsbridge ralph said i may be able to help the kings friends solve this problem good if i were promised the earldom of shiring as my reward gregory frowned the new earl will have to marry the old countess ralph decided to hide his eagerness instinct told him that gregory would have less respect for a man who was driven even just partly by lust for a woman lady philippa is five years older than i am but i have no objection to her gregory looked askance shes a very beautiful woman he said whoever the king gives her to should think himself a lucky man ralph realized he had gone too far i dont wish to appear indifferent he said hastily she is indeed a beauty but i thought you were already married gregory said have i made a mistake ralph caught alans eye and saw that he was keenly curious to hear what ralph would say next ralph sighed my wife is very ill he said she hasnt long to live gwenda lit the fire in the kitchen of the old house where wulfric had lived since he was born she found her cooking pots filled one with water at the well and threw in some early onions the first step in making a stew wulfric brought in more firewood the boys happily went out to play with their old friends unaware of the depth of the tragedy that had befallen their family gwenda busied herself with household chores as the evening darkened outside she was trying not to think everything that came into her mind just made her feel worse the future the past her husband herself wulfric sat and looked into the flames neither of them spoke their neighbour david johns appeared with a big jug of ale his wife was dead of the plague but his grownup daughter joanna followed him in gwenda was not happy to see them she wanted to be miserable in private but their intentions were kind and it was impossible to spurn them gwenda glumly wiped the dust from some wooden cups and david poured ale for everyone were sorry things worked out this way but were glad to see you he said as they drank wulfric emptied his cup with one huge swallow and held it out for more a little later aaron appletree and his wife ulla came in she carried a basket of small loaves i knew you wouldnt have any bread so i made some she said she handed them around and the house filled with the mouthwatering smell david johns poured them some ale and they sat down where did you get the courage to run away ulla asked admiringly i would have died of fright gwenda began to tell the story of their adventures jack and eli fuller arrived from the mill bringing a dish of pears baked in honey wulfric ate plenty and drank deep the atmosphere lightened and gwendas mood lifted a little more neighbours came each bringing a gift when gwenda told how the villagers of outhenby with their spades and hoes had faced down ralph and alan everyone rocked with delighted laughter then she came to the events of today and she descended into despair again everything was against us she said bitterly not just ralph and his ruffians but the king and the church we had no chance the neighbours nodded gloomily and then when he put a rope around my wulfrics neck she was filled with bleak despair her voice cracked and she could not go on she took a gulp of ale and tried again when he put a rope around wulfrics neck the strongest and bravest man ive ever known any of us has ever known led through the village like a beast and that heartless crass bullying ralph holding the rope i just wanted the heavens to fall in and kill us all these were strong words but the others agreed of all the things the gentry could do to peasants starve them cheat them assault them rob them the worst was to humiliate them they never forgot it suddenly gwenda wanted the neighbours to leave the sun had gone down and it was dusk outside she needed to lie down and close her eyes and be alone with her thoughts she did not want to talk even to wulfric she was about to ask everyone to go when nate reeve walked in the room went quiet what do you want gwenda said i bring you good news he said brightly she made a sour face there can be no good news for us today i disagree you havent heard it yet all right what is it sir ralph says wulfric is to have his fathers lands back wulfric leaped to his feet as a tenant he said not just to labour on as a tenant on the same terms as your father said nate expansively as if he were making the concession himself rather than simply passing on a message wulfric beamed with joy thats wonderful do you accept nate said jovially as if it were a mere formality gwenda said wulfric dont accept he looked at her bewildered as usual he was slow to see beyond the immediate discuss the terms she urged him in a low voice dont be a serf like your father demand a free tenancy with no feudal obligations youll never be in such a strong bargaining position again negotiate negotiate he said he wavered briefly then gave in to the happiness of the occasion this is the moment ive been hoping for for the last twelve years im not going to negotiate he turned to nate i accept he said and held up his cup they all cheered the hospital was full again the plague which had seemed to retreat during the first three months of came back in april with redoubled virulence on the day after easter sunday caris looked wearily at the rows of mattresses crammed together in a herringbone pattern packed so tightly that the masked nuns had to step gingerly between them moving around was a little easier however because there were so few family members at the bedsides of the sick sitting with a dying relative was dangerous you were likely to catch the plague yourself and people had become ruthless when the epidemic began they had stayed with their loved ones regardless mothers with children husbands with wives the middleaged with their elderly parents love overcoming fear but that had changed the most powerful of family ties had been viciously corroded by the acid of death nowadays the typical patient was brought in by a mother or father a husband or wife who then simply walked away ignoring the piteous cries that followed them out only the nuns with their face masks and their vinegarwashed hands defied the disease surprisingly caris was not short of help the nunnery had enjoyed an influx of novices to replace the nuns who had died this was partly because of cariss saintly reputation but the monastery was experiencing the same kind of revival and thomas now had a class of novice monks to train they were all searching for order in a world gone mad this time the plague had struck some leading townspeople who had previously escaped caris was dismayed by the death of john constable she had never much liked his roughandready approach to justice which was to hit troublemakers over the head with a stick and ask questions afterwards but it was going to be more difficult to maintain order without him fat betty baxter baker of special buns for every town festivity shrewd questioner at parish guild meetings was dead her business awkwardly shared out between four squabbling daughters and dick brewer had died the last of cariss fathers generation a cohort of men who knew how to make money and how to enjoy it caris and merthin had been able to slow the spread of the disease by cancelling major public gatherings there had been no big easter procession in the cathedral and there would be no fleece fair this whitsun the weekly market was held outside the city walls in lovers field and most townspeople stayed away caris had wanted such measures when the plague first struck but godwyn and elfric had opposed her according to merthin some italian cities had even closed their gates for a period of thirty or forty days called a trentine or a quarantine it was now too late to keep the disease out but caris still thought restrictions would save lives one problem she did not have was money more and more people bequeathed their wealth to the nuns having no surviving relatives and many of the new novices brought with them lands flocks orchards and gold the nunnery had never been so rich it was small consolation for the first time in her life she felt tired not just weary from hard work but drained of energy short of will power enfeebled by adversity the plague was worse than ever killing two hundred people a week and she did not know how she was going to carry on her muscles ached her head hurt and sometimes her vision seemed to blur where would it end she wondered dismally would everyone die two men staggered in through the door both bleeding caris hurried forward before she got within touching distance she picked up the sweetly rotten smell of drink on them they were both nearly helpless although it was not yet dinner time she groaned in frustration this was all too common she knew the men vaguely barney and lou two strong youngsters employed in the abattoir owned by edward slaughterhouse barney had one arm hanging limp possibly broken lou had a dreadful injury to his face his nose was crushed and one eye was a ghastly pulp both seemed too drunk to feel pain it was a fight barney slurred his words only just comprehensible i didnt mean it hes my best friend i love him caris and sister nellie got the two drunks lying down on adjacent mattresses nellie examined barney and said his arm was not broken but dislocated and sent a novice to fetch matthew barber the surgeon who would try to relocate it caris bathed lous face there was nothing she could do to save his eye it had burst like a softboiled egg this kind of thing made her furious the two men were not suffering from a disease or an accidental injury they had harmed one another while drinking to excess after the first wave of the plague she had managed to galvanize the townspeople into restoring law and order but the second wave had done something terrible to peoples souls when she called again for a return to civilized behaviour the response had been apathetic she did not know what to do next and she felt so tired as she contemplated the two maimed men lying shoulder to shoulder on the floor she heard a strange noise from outside for an instant she was transported back three years to the battle of crécy and the terrifying booming sound made by king edwards new machines that shot stone balls into the enemy ranks a moment later the noise came again and she realized it was a drum several drums in fact being struck in no particular rhythm then she heard pipes and bells whose notes failed to form any kind of tune then hoarse cries wailing and shouts that might have indicated triumph or agony or both it was not unlike the noise of battle but without the swish of deadly arrows or the screams of maimed horses frowning she went outside a group of forty or so people had come on to the cathedral green dancing a mad antic jig some played on musical instruments or rather sounded them for there was no melody or harmony to the noise their flimsy lightcoloured clothes were ripped and stained and some were half naked carelessly exposing the intimate parts of their bodies all those who did not have instruments were carrying whips a crowd of townspeople followed staring in curiosity and amazement the dancers were led by friar murdo fatter than ever but cavorting energetically sweat pouring down his dirty face and dripping from his straggly beard he led them to the great west door of the cathedral where he turned to face them we have all sinned he roared his followers cried out in response inarticulate shrieks and groans we are dirt he said thrillingly we wallow in lasciviousness like pigs in filth we yield quivering with desire to our fleshly lusts we deserve the plague yes what must we do suffer they called we must suffer one of the followers dashed forward flourishing a whip it had three leather thongs each of which appeared to have sharp stones attached to a knot he threw himself at murdos feet and began to lash his own back the whip tore the thin material of his robe and drew blood from the skin of his back he cried out in pain and the rest of murdos followers groaned in sympathy then a woman came forward she pulled her robe down to her waist and turned exposing her bare breasts to the crowd then lashed her bare back with a similar whip the followers moaned again as they came forward in ones and twos flogging themselves caris saw that many of them had bruises and halfhealed cuts on their skin they had done this before some of them many times did they go from town to town repeating the performance given murdos involvement she felt sure that sooner or later someone would start collecting money a woman in the watching crowd suddenly ran forward screaming me too i must suffer caris was surprised to see that it was mared the browbeaten young wife of marcel chandler caris could not imagine that she had committed many sins but perhaps she had at last seen a chance to make her life dramatic she threw off her dress and stood stark naked before the friar her skin was unmarked in fact she looked beautiful murdo gazed at her for a long moment then said kiss my feet she knelt in front of him exposing her rear obscenely to the crowd and lowered her face to his filthy feet he took a whip from another penitent and handed it to her she lashed herself then shrieked in pain and red marks appeared instantly on her white skin several more ran forward eagerly from the crowd mostly men and murdo went through the same ritual with each soon there was an orgy when they were not whipping themselves they were banging their drums and clanging their bells and dancing their fiendish jig their actions had a mad abandon but cariss professional eye noted that the strokes of the whips though dramatic and undoubtedly painful did not appear to inflict permanent damage merthin appeared beside caris and said what do you think of this she frowned and said why does it make me feel indignant i dont know if people want to whip themselves why should i object perhaps it makes them feel better i agree with you though merthin said theres generally something fraudulent about anything murdo is involved with thats not it the mood here was not one of penitence she decided these dancers were not looking back contemplatively over their lives feeling sorrow and regret for sins committed people who genuinely repented tended to be quiet thoughtful and undemonstrative what caris sensed in the air here was quite different it was excitement this is a debauch she said only instead of drink theyre overindulging in selfloathing and theres a kind of ecstasy in it but no sex give them time murdo led the procession off again heading out of the priory precincts caris noticed that some of the flagellants had produced bowls and were begging coins from the crowd they would go through the principal streets of the town like this she guessed they would probably finish up at one of the larger taverns where people would buy them food and drink merthin touched her arm you look pale he said how do you feel just tired she said curtly she had to soldier on regardless of how she felt and it did not help her to be reminded of her tiredness however it was kind of him to notice and she softened her tone to say come to the priors house its almost dinner time they walked across the green as the procession disappeared they stepped inside the palace as soon as they were alone caris put her arms around merthin and kissed him she suddenly felt very physical and she thrust her tongue into his mouth which she knew he liked in response he took both her breasts in his hands and squeezed gently they had never kissed like this inside the palace and caris wondered vaguely whether something about friar murdos bacchanal had weakened her normal inhibitions your skin is hot merthin said in her ear she wanted merthin to pull down her robe and put his mouth to her nipples she felt she was losing control and might find herself recklessly making love right here on the floor where they might so easily be caught then a girls voice said i didnt mean to spy caris was shocked she sprang guiltily away from merthin she turned around looking for the speaker at the far end of the room sitting on a bench was a young woman holding a baby it was ralph fitzgeralds wife tilly said caris tilly stood up she looked exhausted and frightened im so sorry to startle you she said caris was relieved tilly had attended the nuns school and lived at the nunnery for years and she was fond of caris she could be trusted not to make a fuss about the kiss she had seen but what was she doing here are you all right caris said im a bit tired tilly said she staggered and caris caught her arm the baby cried merthin took the child and rocked him expertly there there my little nephew he said the crying fell to a mild grizzle of discontent caris said to tilly how did you get here i walked from tench hall carrying gerry the baby was now six months old and no easy burden it took me three days my goodness has something happened i ran away didnt ralph come after you yes with alan i hid in the forest while they went by gerry was very good and didnt cry the picture brought a lump to cariss throat but she swallowed but why did you run away because my husband wants to kill me tilly said and she burst into tears caris sat her down and merthin brought her a cup of wine they let her sob caris sat on the bench beside her and put an arm around her shoulders while merthin cradled baby gerry when at last tilly had cried herself out caris said what has ralph done tilly shook her head nothing its just the way he looks at me i know he wants to murder me merthin muttered i wish i could say my brother is incapable of that caris said but why would he want to do such a terrible thing i dont know tilly said miserably ralph went to uncle williams funeral there was a lawyer from london there sir gregory longfellow i know him caris said a clever man but i dont like him it started after that i have a feeling its all to do with gregory caris said you wouldnt have walked all this way carrying a baby because of something you just imagined i know it sounds fanciful but he just sits and glares at me hatefully how can a man look at his wife like that well youve come to the right place caris said youre safe here can i stay she begged you wont send me back will you certainly not said caris she caught merthins eye she knew what he was thinking it would be rash to give tilly a guarantee fugitives might take refuge in churches as a general principle but it was very doubtful whether a nunnery had the right to shelter a knights wife and keep her from him indefinitely moreover ralph would certainly be entitled to make her give up the baby his son and heir all the same caris put as much confidence into her voice as she could and said you can stay here just as long as you like oh thank you caris silently prayed that she would be able to keep her promise you could live in one of the special guest rooms upstairs in the hospital she said tilly looked troubled but what if ralph should come in he wouldnt dare but if it makes you feel safer you can have mother cecilias old room at the end of the nuns dormitory yes please a priory servant came in to lay the table for dinner caris said to tilly ill take you to the refectory you can have dinner with the nuns then lie down in the dormitory and rest she stood up suddenly she felt dizzy she put a hand on the table to steady herself merthin still holding baby gerry said anxiously whats wrong ill be fine in a moment caris said im just tired then she fell to the floor merthin felt a tidal wave of panic for an instant he was stunned caris had never been ill never helpless she was the one who took care of the sick he could not think of her as a victim the moment passed like a blink fighting down his fear he carefully handed the baby to tilly the servant girl had stopped laying the table and stood staring in shock at the unconscious form of caris on the floor merthin deliberately made his voice calm but urgent and said to her run to the hospital and tell them mother caris is ill bring sister oonagh go on now as quick as you can she hurried away merthin knelt beside caris can you hear me my darling he said he picked up her limp hand and patted it then touched her cheek then lifted an eyelid she was out cold tilly said shes got the plague hasnt she oh god merthin took caris in his arms he was a slight man but he had always been able to lift heavy objects building stones and timber beams he lifted her easily and stood upright then laid her gently on the table dont die he whispered please dont die he kissed her forehead her skin was hot he had felt it when they embraced a few minutes ago but he had been too excited to worry perhaps that was why she had been so passionate fever could have that effect sister oonagh came in merthin was so grateful to see her that tears came to his eyes she was a young nun only a year or two out of her novitiate but caris thought highly of her nursing skill and was grooming her to take responsibility for the hospital one day oonagh wrapped a linen mask over her mouth and nose and tied it in a knot behind her neck then she touched cariss forehead and cheek did she sneeze she said merthin wiped his eyes no he answered he felt sure he would have noticed a sneeze was an ominous sign oonagh pulled down the front of cariss robe to merthin she looked agonizingly vulnerable with her small breasts exposed but he was glad to see there was no rash of purpleblack spots on her chest oonagh covered her up again she looked up cariss nostrils no bleeding she said she felt cariss pulse thoughtfully after a few moments she looked at merthin this may not be the plague but it seems a serious illness shes feverish her pulse is rapid and her breathing is shallow carry her upstairs lie her down and bathe her face with rose water anyone who attends her must wear a mask and wash their hands as if she had the plague that includes you she gave him a linen strip tears rolled down his face as he tied the mask he carried caris upstairs put her on the mattress in her room and straightened her clothing the nuns brought rose water and vinegar merthin told them of cariss instructions regarding tilly and they took the young mother and baby to the refectory merthin sat beside caris patting her forehead and cheeks with a rag damped with the fragrant liquid praying for her to come round at last she did she opened her eyes frowned in puzzlement then looked anxious and said what happened you fainted he said she tried to sit up keep still he said youre sick its probably not the plague but you have a serious illness she must have felt weak for she lay back on the pillow without further protest ill just rest for an hour she said she was in bed for two weeks after three days the whites of her eyes turned the colour of mustard and sister oonagh said she had the yellow jaundice oonagh prepared an infusion of herbs sweetened with honey which caris drank hot three times a day the fever receded but caris remained weak she inquired anxiously about tilly every day and oonagh answered her questions but refused to discuss any other aspect of life in the nunnery in case it should tire caris caris was too enfeebled to fight her merthin did not leave the priors palace in the daytime he sat downstairs close enough to hear her call and his employees came to him for instructions about the various buildings they were putting up or tearing down at night he lay on a mattress beside her and slept lightly waking every time her breathing changed or she turned over in her bed lolla slept in the next room at the end of the first week ralph showed up my wife has disappeared he said as he walked into the hall of the priors palace merthin looked up from a drawing he was making on a large slate hello brother he said ralph looked shifty he thought clearly he had mixed feelings about tillys disappearance he was not fond of her but on the other hand no man likes his wife to run away perhaps i have mixed feelings too merthin thought guiltily after all i did help his wife to leave him ralph sat on a bench have you got any wine im parched merthin went to the sideboard and poured from a jug it crossed his mind to say he had no idea where tilly could be but his instinct revolted from the idea of lying to his own brother especially about something so important besides tillys presence at the priory could not be kept secret too many nuns novices and employees had seen her here it was always best to be honest merthin thought except in dire emergency handing the cup to ralph he said tilly is here at the nunnery with the baby i thought she might be ralph lifted the cup in his left hand showing the stumps of his three severed fingers he took a long draught whats the matter with her she ran away from you ralph you should have let me know i feel bad about that but i couldnt betray her shes frightened of you why take sides with her against me im your brother because i know you if shes scared theres probably a reason this is outrageous ralph was trying to appear indignant but the act was unconvincing merthin wondered what he really felt we cant throw her out merthin said shes asked for sanctuary gerrys my son and heir you cant keep him from me not indefinitely no if you start a legal action im sure youll win but you wouldnt try to separate him from his mother would you if he comes home she will that was probably true merthin was casting around for another way of persuading ralph when brother thomas came in bringing alan fernhill with him with his one hand thomas was holding alans arm as if to prevent him from running away i found him snooping he said i was just looking around alan protested i thought the monastery was empty merthin said as you see its not weve got one monk six novices and a couple of dozen orphan boys thomas said anyway he wasnt in the monastery he was in the nuns cloisters merthin frowned he could hear a psalm being sung in the distance alan had timed his incursion well all the nuns and novices were in the cathedral for the service of sext most of the priory buildings were deserted at this hour alan had probably been walking around unhindered for some time this did not seem like idle curiosity thomas added fortunately a kitchen hand saw him and came to fetch me out of the church merthin wondered what alan had been looking for tilly surely he would not have dared to snatch her from a nunnery in broad daylight he turned to ralph what are you two plotting ralph batted the question off to alan what did you think you were doing he said wrathfully though merthin thought the anger was faked alan shrugged just looking around while i waited for you it was not plausible idle menatarms waited for their masters in stables and taverns not cloisters ralph said well dont do it again merthin realized that ralph was going to stick with this story i was honest with him but hes not being honest with me he thought sadly he returned to the more important subject why dont you leave tilly be for a while he said to ralph shell be perfectly all right here and perhaps after a while shell realize you mean her no harm and come back to you its too shaming ralph said not really a noblewoman sometimes spends a few weeks at a monastery if she feels the need to retire from the world for a while usually when shes been widowed or her husband has gone off to war not always though when theres no obvious reason people always say she wants to get away from her husband how bad is that you might like some time away from your wife perhaps youre right ralph said merthin was startled by this response he had not expected ralph to be so easily persuaded it took him a moment to get over the surprise then he said thats it give her three months then come back and talk to her merthin had a feeling that tilly would never relent but at least this proposal would postpone the crisis three months said ralph all right he stood up to go merthin shook his hand how are mother and father i havent seen them for months getting old father doesnt leave their house now ill come and visit as soon as caris is better shes recovering from yellow jaundice give her my best wishes merthin went to the door and watched ralph and alan ride away he felt deeply disturbed ralph was up to something and it was not simply getting tilly back he returned to his drawing and sat staring at it without seeing it for a long time by the end of the second week it was clear that caris was going to get better merthin was exhausted but happy feeling like a man reprieved he put lolla to bed early and went out for the first time it was a mild spring evening and the sun and balmy air made him lightheaded his own tavern the bell was closed for rebuilding but the holly bush was doing brisk business customers sitting on benches outside with their tankards there were so many people out enjoying the weather that merthin stopped and asked the drinkers if it was a holiday today thinking he might have lost track of the date every days a holiday now one said whats the point in working when were all going to die of the plague have a cup of ale no thanks merthin walked on he noticed that many people wore very fancy clothes elaborate headgear and embroidered tunics that they would not normally have been able to afford he presumed they had inherited these garments or perhaps just taken them from wealthy corpses the effect was a bit nightmarish velvet hats on filthy hair gold threads and food stains ragged hose and jewelencrusted shoes he saw two men dressed all in womens clothing floorlength gowns and wimples they were walking along the main street arm in arm like merchants wives showing off their wealth but they were unmistakably male with big hands and feet and hair on their chins merthin began to feel disoriented as if nothing could be relied on any more as the dusk thickened he crossed the bridge to leper island he had built a street of shops and taverns there between the two parts of the bridge the work was finished but the buildings were untenanted with boards nailed across their doors and windows to keep vagrants out no one lived there but rabbits the premises would remain empty until the plague died out and kingsbridge returned to normal merthin supposed if the plague never went away they would never be occupied but in that eventuality renting his property would be the least of his worries he returned to the old city just as the gate was closing there seemed to be a huge party going on at the white horse inn the house was full of lights and the crowd filled the road in front of the building whats going on merthin asked a drinker young daveys got the plague and he has no heirs to bequeath the inn to so hes giving all the ale away the man said grinning with delight drink as much as you can hold its free he and many other people had clearly been working on the same principle and dozens of them were reeling drunk merthin pushed his way into the crowd someone was banging a drum and others were dancing he saw a circle of men and looked over their shoulders to see what they were hiding a very drunk woman of about twenty years was bending over a table while a man entered her from behind several other men were clearly waiting their turn merthin turned away in distaste at the side of the building half concealed by empty barrels his eye lit on ozzie ostler a wealthy horse dealer kneeling in front of a younger man and sucking his penis that was against the law in fact the penalty was death but clearly no one cared ozzie a married man who was on the parish guild caught merthins eye but did not stop in fact he continued with more enthusiasm as if excited by being watched merthin shook his head amazed just outside the tavern door was a table laden with partly eaten food joints of roasted meat smoked fish puddings and cheese a dog was standing on the table tearing at a ham a man was throwing up into a bowl of stew beside the tavern door davey whitehorse sat in a big wooden chair with a huge cup of wine he was sneezing and sweating and the characteristic trickle of blood came from his nose but he was looking around and cheering the revellers on he seemed to want to kill himself with drink before the plague finished him off merthin felt nauseated he left the scene and hurried back to the priory to his surprise he found caris up and dressed im better she said im going to return to my usual work tomorrow seeing his sceptical look she added sister oonagh said i could if youre taking orders from someone else you cant be back to normal he said and she laughed the sight brought tears to his eyes she had not laughed for two weeks and there had been moments when he had wondered whether he would ever hear the sound again where have you been she asked he told her about his walk around the town and the disturbing sights he had seen none of it was very wicked he said i just wonder what theyll do next when all their inhibitions have gone will they start to kill one another a kitchen hand brought a tureen of soup for their supper caris sipped warily for a long time all food had made her feel sick however she seemed to find the leek soup palatable and drank a bowlful when the maid had cleared away caris said while i was ill i thought a lot about dying you didnt ask for a priest whether ive been good or bad i dont think god will be fooled by a lastminute change of heart what then i asked myself if there was anything i really regretted and was there lots of things im bad friends with my sister i havent any children i lost that scarlet coat my father gave my mother on the day she died how did you lose it i wasnt allowed to bring it with me when i entered the nunnery i dont know what happened to it what was your biggest regret there were two i havent built my hospital and ive spent too little time in bed with you he raised his eyebrows well the second one is easily rectified i know what about the nuns nobody cares any more you saw what it was like in the town here in the nunnery were too busy dealing with the dying to fuss about the old rules joan and oonagh sleep together every night in one of the upstairs rooms of the hospital it doesnt matter merthin frowned its odd that they do that and still go to church services in the middle of the night how do they reconcile the two things listen st lukes gospel says he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none how do you think the bishop of shiring reconciles that with his chest full of robes everybody takes what they like from the teachings of the church and ignores the parts that dont suit them and you i do the same but im honest about it so im going to live with you as your wife and if anyone questions me i shall say that these are strange times she got up went to the door and barred it youve been sleeping here for two weeks dont move out you dont have to lock me in he said with a laugh ill stay voluntarily he put his arms around her she said we started something a few minutes before i fainted tilly interrupted us you were feverish in that way i still am perhaps we should pick up where we left off we could go to bed first all right holding hands they went up the stairs ralph and his men hid in the forest north of kingsbridge waiting it was may and the evenings were long when night fell ralph encouraged the others to take a nap while he sat up watching with him were alan fernhill and four hired men soldiers demobilized from the kings army fighters who had failed to find their niche in peacetime alan had hired them at the red lion in gloucester they did not know who ralph was and had never seen him in daylight they would do as they were told take their money and ask no questions ralph stayed awake noting the passing of time automatically as he had when with the king in france he had found that if he tried too hard to figure out how many hours had gone by he became doubtful but if he simply guessed what came into his head was always right monks used a burning candle marked with rings for the hours or an hourglass with sand or water trickling through a narrow funnel but ralph had a better measure in his head he sat very still with his back to a tree staring into the low fire they had built he could hear the rustle of small animals in the undergrowth and the occasional hoot of a predatory owl he never felt so calm as in the waiting hours before action there was quiet and darkness and time to think the knowledge of danger to come which made most men jumpy actually soothed him the main risk tonight did not in fact come from the hazards of fighting there would be some handtohand combat but the enemy would consist of fat townsmen or softskinned monks the real peril was that ralph might be recognized what he was about to do was shocking it would be talked of with outrage in every church in the land perhaps in europe gregory longfellow for whom ralph was doing this would be the loudest in condemning it if the fact ever got out that ralph was the villain he would be hanged but if he succeeded he would be the earl of shiring when he judged it was two hours past midnight he roused the others they left their tethered horses and walked out of the woodland and along the road to the city alan was carrying the equipment as he always had when they fought in france he had a short ladder a coil of rope and a grappling iron they had used when attacking city walls in normandy in his belt were a masons chisel and a hammer they might not need these tools but they had learned that it was best to be prepared alan also had several large sacks rolled up tightly and tied with string in a bundle when they came within sight of the city ralph gave out hoods with holes for the eyes and mouth and they all put them on ralph also wore a mitten on his left hand to conceal the telltale stumps of his three missing fingers he was completely unrecognizable unless of course he should be captured they all pulled felt bags over their boots tying them to their knees to muffle their footsteps it was hundreds of years since kingsbridge had been attacked by an army and security was slack especially since the advent of the plague nevertheless the southern entrance to the town was firmly closed at the townward end of merthins great bridge was a stone gatehouse barred with a mighty wooden door but the river defended the town only on the east and south sides to the north and west no bridge was needed and the town was protected by a wall that was in poor repair that was why ralph was approaching from the north mean houses huddled outside the walls like dogs at the back of a butchers shop alan had scouted the route several days ago when the two of them had come to kingsbridge and inquired about tilly now ralph and the hired men followed alan padding between the hovels as quietly as possible even paupers in the suburbs could raise the alarm if awakened a dog barked and ralph tensed but someone cursed the animal and it fell silent in another moment they came to a place where the wall was broken down and they could easily clamber over the fallen stones they found themselves in a narrow alley behind some warehouses it came out just inside the north gate of the city at the gate ralph knew was a sentry in a booth the six men approached silently although they were now within the walls a sentry would question them if he saw them and shout for help if he was not satisfied with their answers but to ralphs relief the man was fast asleep sitting on a stool and leaning against the side of his box a stub of candle guttering on a shelf beside him all the same ralph decided not to risk the mans waking up he tiptoed close leaned into the booth and slit the sentrys throat with a long knife the man woke up and tried to scream with pain but all that came out of his mouth was blood as he slumped ralph caught him and held him for the few moments it took him to lose consciousness then he propped the body back up against the wall of the booth he wiped his bloody blade on the dead mans tunic and sheathed the knife the large double door that stopped the gateway had within it a smaller mansized doorway ralph unbarred this little door ready for a quick getaway later the six men walked silently along the street that led to the priory there was no moon ralph had chosen tonight for that reason but they were faintly lit by starlight he looked anxiously at the upstairs windows of the houses on either side if sleepless people happened to look out they would see the unmistakably sinister sight of six masked men fortunately it was not quite warm enough to leave windows open at night and all the shutters were closed just the same ralph pulled up the hood of his cloak and dragged it forward as far as it would go in the hope of shadowing his face and concealing the mask then he signed to the others to do the same this was the city where he had spent his adolescence and the streets were familiar his brother merthin still lived here although ralph was not sure exactly where they went down the main street past the holly bush closed for the night and locked up hours ago they turned into the cathedral close the entrance had tall ironbound timber gates but they stood open not having been closed for years their hinges rusted and seized up the priory was dark except for a dim light in the windows of the hospital ralph reckoned this would be the time when the monks and nuns were sleeping most deeply in an hour or so they would be wakened for the service of matins which started and finished before dawn alan who had reconnoitred the priory led the team around the north side of the church they walked silently through the graveyard and past the priors palace then turned along the narrow strip of land that divided the east end of the cathedral from the river bank alan propped his short ladder up against a blank wall and whispered nuns cloisters follow me he went up the wall and over the roof his feet made little noise on the slates happily he did not need to use the grappling iron which might have made an alarming clang the others followed ralph last on the inside they dropped from the roof and landed with soft thumps on the turf of the quadrangle once there ralph looked warily at the regular stone columns of the cloisters around him the arches seemed to stare at him like watchmen but nothing stirred it was a good thing monks and nuns were not allowed to have pet dogs alan led them around the deepshadowed walkway and through a heavy door kitchen he whispered the room was dimly lit by the embers of a big fire move slowly so that you dont knock over any pots ralph waited letting his eyes adjust soon he could make out the outlines of a big table several barrels and a stack of cooking vessels find somewhere to sit or lie down and try to make yourselves comfortable he said to them we stay here until they all get up and go into the church peering out of the kitchen an hour later ralph counted the nuns and novices shuffling out of the dormitory and heading through the cloisters towards the cathedral some carrying lamps that threw antic shadows on the vaulted ceiling twentyfive he whispered to alan as he had expected tilly was not among them visiting noblewomen were not expected to attend services in the middle of the night when they had all disappeared he moved the others remained behind there were only two places where tilly might be sleeping the hospital and the nuns dormitory ralph had guessed she would feel safer in the dormitory and headed there first he went softly up the stone steps his boots still muffled by felt overshoes he peeped into the dorm it was lit by a single candle he was hoping that all the nuns would be in the church for he did not want miscellaneous people confusing the situation he was afraid one or two might have stayed behind because of illness or laziness but the room was empty not even tilly was there he was about to retreat when he saw a door at the far end he padded the length of the dormitory picking up the candle and went through the door silently the unsteady light revealed the young head of his wife on a pillow her hair in disarray around her face she looked so innocent and pretty that ralph felt a stab of remorse and had to remind himself of how much he hated her for standing in the way of his advancement the baby his son gerry lay in a crib next to her eyes closed mouth open sleeping peacefully ralph crept closer and with a swift movement clamped his right hand hard over tillys mouth waking her and at the same time stopping her making any noise tilly opened her eyes wide and stared at him in dread he put the candle down in his pocket he had an assortment of useful odds and ends including rags and leather thongs he stuffed a rag into tillys mouth to keep her quiet despite his mask and glove he had a feeling she recognized him even though he had not spoken perhaps she could smell him like a dog it did not matter she was not going to tell anyone he tied her hands and feet with leather thongs she was not struggling now but she would later he checked that her gag was secure then he settled down to wait he could hear the singing from the church a strong choir of females and a ragged few male voices trying to match them tilly kept staring at him with big pleading eyes he turned her over so that he could not see her face she had guessed he was going to kill her she had read his mind she must be a witch perhaps all women were witches anyway she had known his intention almost as soon as he had formed it she had started to watch him especially in the evenings her fearful eyes following him around the room no matter what he did she had lain stiff and alert beside him at night while he fell asleep and in the mornings when he awoke she was invariably up already then after a few days of this she had disappeared ralph and alan had searched for her without success then he had heard a rumour that she had taken refuge in kingsbridge priory which happened to fit in with his plans very neatly the baby snuffled in his sleep and it occurred to ralph that he might cry what if the nuns came back just then he thought it through one or two would probably come in here to see if tilly needed help he would just kill them he decided it would not be the first time he had killed nuns in france at last he heard them shuffling back into the dormitory alan would be watching from the kitchen counting them as they returned when they were all safely inside the room alan and the other four men would draw their swords and make their move ralph lifted tilly to her feet her face was streaked with tears he turned her so that her back was to him then put an arm around her waist and lifted her hoisting her on to his hip she was as light as a child he drew his long dagger from outside he heard a man say silence or you die it was alan he knew although the hood muffled the voice this was a crucial moment there were other people on the premises nuns and patients in the hospital monks in their own quarters and ralph did not want them to appear and complicate matters despite alans warning there were several shouts of shock and shrieks of fear but ralph thought not too loud so far so good he threw open the door and stepped into the dormitory carrying tilly on his hip he could see by the light of the nuns lamps at the far end of the room alan had a woman in his grasp his knife to her throat in the same pose as ralph with tilly two more men stood behind alan the other two hirelings would be on guard at the foot of the stairs listen to me ralph said when he spoke tilly jerked convulsively she had recognized his voice but that did not matter so long as no one else did there was a terrified silence ralph said which of you is treasurer no one spoke ralph touched the edge of his blade to the skin of tillys throat she began to struggle but she was too small and he held her easily now he thought now is the time to kill her but he hesitated he had killed many people women as well as men but suddenly it seemed terrible to stick a knife into the warm body of someone he had embraced and kissed and slept with the woman who had borne his child also he told himself the effect on the nuns would be more shocking if one of their own died he nodded to alan with one strong cut alan slit the throat of the nun he was holding blood gushed out of her neck on to the floor someone screamed it was not merely a cry or a shriek but a fortissimo yell of pure terror that might have awakened the dead and it went on until one of the hired men hit the screamer a mighty blow over her head with his club and she fell unconscious to the floor blood trickling down her cheek ralph said again which of you is treasurer merthin had woken up briefly when the bell rang for matins and caris slipped out of bed as usual he turned over and fell into a light doze so that when she returned it seemed as if she had been away only for a minute or two she was cold when she got back into bed and he drew her to him and wrapped his arms around her they often stayed awake for a while talking and usually made love before going to sleep it was merthins favourite time she pressed up against him her breasts squashed comfortably against his chest he kissed her forehead when she had warmed up he reached between her legs and gently stroked the soft hair there but she was feeling talkative did you hear yesterdays rumour outlaws in the woods north of town it seems a bit unlikely he said i dont know the walls are decrepit on that side but what are they going to steal anything they want is theirs for the taking if they need meat there are thousands of sheep and cattle unguarded in the fields with no one to claim ownership thats what makes it strange these days stealing is like leaning over the fence to breathe your neighbours air she sighed three months ago i thought this terrible plague was over how many more people have we lost weve buried a thousand since easter that seemed about right to merthin i hear that other towns are similar he felt her hair move against his shoulder as she nodded in the dark she said i believe something like a quarter of the population of england is gone already and more than half the priests thats because they make contact with so many people every time they hold a service they can hardly escape so half the churches are closed a good thing if you ask me im sure crowds spread the plague faster than anything anyway most people have lost respect for religion to caris that was no great tragedy she said perhaps theyll stop believing in mumbojumbo medicine and start thinking about what treatments actually make a difference you say that but its hard for ordinary people to know what is a genuine cure and what a false remedy ill give you four rules he smiled in the dark she always had a list all right one if there are dozens of different remedies for a complaint you can be sure none of them works why because if one worked people would forget the rest logical two just because a remedy is unpleasant doesnt mean its any good raw larks brains do nothing for a sore throat even though they make you heave whereas a nice cup of hot water and honey will soothe you thats good to know three human and animal dung never does anyone any good it usually makes them worse im relieved to hear it four if the remedy looks like the disease the spotted feathers of a thrush for the pox say or sheeps urine for yellow jaundice its probably imaginative rubbish you should write a book about this she made a scornful noise universities prefer ancient greek texts not a book for university students one for people like you nuns and midwives and barbers and wise women wise women and midwives cant read some can and others have people who can read for them i suppose people might like a little book that tells them what to do about the plague she was thoughtful for a few moments in the silence there was a scream what was that merthin said it sounded like a shrew being caught by an owl she said no it didnt he said and he got up one of the nuns stepped forward and addressed ralph she was young they were nearly all young with black hair and blue eyes please dont hurt tilly she begged im sister joan the treasurer well give you anything you want please dont do any more violence i am tam hiding ralph said where are the keys to the nuns treasury i have them here on my belt take me there joan hesitated perhaps she sensed that ralph did not know where the treasury was on their reconnaissance trip alan had been able to scout the nunnery quite thoroughly before he was caught he had plotted their way in identified the kitchen as a good hiding place and located the nuns dormitory but he had not been able to find the treasury clearly joan did not want to reveal its location ralph had no time to lose he did not know who might have heard that scream he pressed the point of his knife into tillys throat until it drew blood i want to go to the treasury he said all right just dont hurt tilly ill show you the way i thought you would ralph said he left two of the hired men in the dormitory to keep the nuns quiet he and alan followed joan down the steps to the cloisters taking tilly at the foot of the stairs the other two hired men were detaining at knife point three more nuns ralph guessed that those on duty in the hospital had come to investigate the scream he was pleased another threat had been neutralized but where were the monks he sent the extra nuns up into the dormitory he left one hired man on guard at the foot of the stairs and took the other with him joan led them into the refectory which was at ground level directly under the dorm her flickering lamp revealed trestle tables benches a lectern and a wall painting of jesus at a wedding feast at the far end of the room joan moved a table to reveal a trapdoor in the floor it had a keyhole just like a normal upright door she turned a key in the lock and lifted the trapdoor it gave on to a narrow spiral of stone steps she descended the stairs ralph left the hired man on guard and went down awkwardly carrying tilly and alan followed him ralph reached the bottom of the staircase and looked around him with a satisfied air this was the holy of holies the nuns secret treasury it was a cramped underground room like a dungeon but better built the walls were of ashlar smoothly squaredoff stones as used in the cathedral and the floor was paved with closely set flagstones the air felt cool and dry ralph put tilly trussed like a chicken on the floor most of the room was taken up by a huge lidded box like a coffin for a giant chained to a ring in the wall there was not much else two stools a writing desk and a shelf bearing a stack of parchment rolls presumably the nunnerys account books on a hook on the wall hung two heavy wool coats and ralph guessed they were for the treasurer and her assistant to wear when working down here in the coldest months of the winter the box was far too large to have come down the staircase it must have been brought here in pieces and assembled in situ ralph pointed to the clasp and joan unlocked it with another of the keys on her belt ralph looked inside there were scores more parchment rolls obviously all the charters and title deeds that proved the nunnerys ownership of its property and rights a pile of leather and wool bags that undoubtedly held jewelled ornaments and another smaller chest that probably contained money at this point he had to be subtle his object was those charters but he did not want that to be apparent he had to steal them but appear not to have done so he ordered joan to open the small chest it contained a few gold coins ralph was puzzled by how little money there was perhaps more was hidden somewhere in this room possibly behind stones in the wall however he did not stop to ponder he was only pretending to be interested in the money he poured the coins into the purse at his belt meanwhile alan unrolled a capacious sack and began filling it with cathedral ornaments having let joan see that ralph ordered her back up the stairs tilly was still here watching with wide terrified eyes but it did not matter what she saw she would never have a chance to tell ralph unrolled another sack and began loading the parchment rolls into it as fast as he could when they had bagged everything ralph told alan to break up the wooden chests with his hammer and chisel he took the wool coats from the hook bundled them up and held the tip of his candle flame to the bundle the wool caught fire immediately he piled wood from the chests on top of the burning wool soon there was a merry bonfire and the smoke caught in his throat he looked at tilly lying helpless on the floor he drew his knife then once again he hesitated from the priors palace a small door led directly into the chapter house which itself communicated with the north transept of the cathedral merthin and caris took this route in their search for the source of the scream the chapter house was empty and they went into the church their single candle was too dim to illuminate the vast interior but they stood in the centre of the crossing and listened hard they heard the click of a latch merthin said whos there and was ashamed of the fear that made his voice tremble brother thomas they heard the voice came from the south transept a moment later thomas moved into the light of their candle i thought i heard someone scream he said so did we but theres no one here in the church lets look around what about the novices and the boys i told them to go back to sleep they passed through the south transept into the monks cloisters once again they saw no one and heard nothing from here they followed a passage through the kitchen stores to the hospital the patients lay in their beds as normal some sleeping and some moving and groaning in pain but merthin realized after a moment there were no nuns in the room this is strange said caris the scream might have come from here but there was no sign of emergency or of any kind of disturbance they went into the kitchen which was deserted as they would have expected thomas sniffed deeply as if trying to pick up a scent merthin said what is it he found himself whispering monks are clean thomas murmured in reply someone dirty has been here merthin could not smell anything unusual thomas picked up a cleaver the kind a cook would use to chop through meat and bones they went to the kitchen door thomas held up the stump of his left arm in a warning gesture and they halted there was a faint light in the nuns cloisters it seemed to be coming from the recess at the near end it was the reflected gleam of a distant candle merthin guessed it might be coming from the nuns refectory or from the flight of stone steps that led up to their dormitory or both thomas stepped out of his sandals and went forward his bare feet making no sound on the flagstones he melted into the shadows of the cloister merthin could just about make him out as he edged towards the recess a faint but pungent aroma came to merthins nose it was not the smell of dirty bodies that thomas had detected in the kitchen but something quite different and new a moment later merthin identified it as smoke thomas must have picked it up too for he froze in place up against the wall someone unseen gave a grunt of surprise then a figure stepped out from the recess into the cloister walk faintly but clearly visible the weak light outlining the silhouette of a man with some kind of hood covering his entire head and face the man turned towards the refectory door thomas struck the cleaver glinted briefly in the dark then there was a sickening thud as it sank into the mans body he gave a shout of terror and pain as he fell thomas swung again and the mans cry turned into a sickening gurgle then stopped he hit the stone pavement with a lifeless thump beside merthin caris gasped with horror merthin ran forward whats going on he cried thomas turned to him making goback motions with the cleaver quiet he hissed the light changed in a heartbeat suddenly the cloisters were illuminated with the bright glow of a flame someone came running out of the refectory with a heavy tread it was a big man carrying a sack in one hand and a blazing torch in the other he looked like a ghost until merthin realized he was wearing a crude hood with holes for the eyes and mouth thomas stepped in front of the running man and raised his cleaver but he was a moment too late before he could strike the man cannoned into him sending him flying thomas crashed into a pillar and there was a crack that sounded like his head hitting the stone he slumped to the ground out cold the running man lost his balance and fell to his knees caris pushed past merthin and knelt beside thomas several more men appeared all hooded some carrying torches it seemed to merthin that some emerged from the refectory and others came down the stairs from the dorm at the same time he heard the sound of women screaming and wailing for a moment the scene was chaos merthin rushed to cariss side and tried to protect her with his body from the stampede the intruders saw their fallen comrade and they all paused in their rush suddenly shocked into stillness by the light of their torches they could see that he was unquestionably dead his neck sliced almost all the way through his blood spilled copiously over the stone floor of the cloisters they looked around moving their heads from side to side peering through the holes in their hoods looking like fish in a stream one of them spotted thomass cleaver red with blood lying on the ground next to thomas and caris and pointed at it to show the others with a grunt of anger he drew a sword merthin was terrified for caris he stepped forward attracting the swordsmans attention the man moved towards merthin and raised his weapon merthin retreated drawing the man away from caris as the danger to her receded he felt more frightened for himself walking backwards shaking with fear he slipped on the dead mans blood his feet flew from under him and he fell flat on his back the swordsman stood over him weapon raised high to kill him then one of the others intervened he was the tallest of the intruders and moved with surprising speed with his left hand he grabbed the upraised arm of merthins assailant he must have had authority for without speaking he simply shook his hooded head from side to side in negation and the swordsman lowered his weapon obediently merthin noticed that his saviour wore a mitten on his left hand but nothing on the right the interaction lasted only as long as it might take a man to count to ten and ended as suddenly as it had begun one of the hooded men turned towards the kitchen and broke into a run and the others followed they must have planned to escape that way merthin realized the kitchen had a door that gave on to the cathedral green and that was the quickest way out they disappeared and without the blaze of their torches the cloisters went dark merthin stood still unsure what to do should he run after the intruders go up to the dormitory and find out why the nuns were screaming or find out where the fire was he knelt beside caris is thomas alive he said i think hes banged his head and hes unconscious but hes breathing and theres no blood behind him merthin heard the familiar voice of sister joan help me please he turned she stood in the doorway of the refectory her face lit up grotesquely by the candle lamp in her hand her head wreathed in smoke like a fashionable hat for gods sake come quickly he stood up joan disappeared back into the refectory and merthin ran after her her lamp threw confusing shadows but he managed to avoid falling over the furniture as he followed her to the end of the room smoke was pouring from a hole in the floor merthin saw immediately that the hole was the work of a careful builder it was perfectly square with neat edges and a wellmade trapdoor he guessed this was the nuns hidden treasury built in secrecy by jeremiah but tonights thieves had found it he got a lungful of smoke and coughed he wondered what was burning down there and why but he had no intention of finding out it looked too dangerous then joan screamed at him tilly is in there dear god merthin said despairingly and he went down the steps he had to hold his breath he peered through the smoke despite his fear his builders eye noticed that the spiral stone staircase was well made each step exactly the same size and shape and each set at precisely the same angle to the next so that he was able to go down with confidence even when he could not see what was underfoot in a second he reached the underground chamber he could see flames near the middle of the room the heat was intense and he knew he would not be able to stand it for more than a few instants the smoke was thick he was still holding his breath but now his eyes began to water and his vision blurred he wiped his eyes with his sleeve and peered into the murk where was tilly he could not see the floor he dropped to his knees visibility improved slightly the smoke was less dense lower down he moved around on all fours staring into the corners of the room sweeping with his hands where he could not see tilly he shouted tilly where are you the smoke caught in his throat and he suffered a coughing fit that would have drowned any reply she made he could not last any longer he was coughing convulsively but every breath seemed to choke him with more smoke his eyes watered copiously and he was nearly blind in desperation he went so close to the fire that the flames began to singe his sleeve if he collapsed and lost consciousness he would die for certain then his hand touched flesh he grabbed it was a human leg a small leg a girls leg he pulled her towards him her clothes were smouldering he could hardly see her face and could not tell whether she was conscious but she was tied hand and foot with leather thongs so she could not move of her own accord striving to stop coughing he got his arms under her and picked her up as soon as he stood upright the smoke became blindingly thick suddenly he could not remember which way the stairs were he staggered away from the flames and crashed into the wall almost dropping tilly left or right he went left and came to a corner changing his mind he retraced his steps he felt as if he was drowning his strength gone he dropped to his knees that saved him once again he found he could see better close to the floor and a stone step appeared like a vision from heaven right in front of him desperately holding on to the limp form of tilly he moved forward on his knees and made it to the staircase with a last effort he got to his feet he put one foot on the lowest step and hauled himself up then he managed the next step coughing uncontrollably he forced himself upward until there were no more steps he staggered fell to his knees dropped tilly and collapsed on the refectory floor someone bent over him he spluttered close the trapdoor stop the fire a moment later he heard a bang as the wooden door slammed shut he was grabbed under the arms he opened his eyes for a moment and saw cariss face upside down then his vision blurred she dragged him across the floor the smoke thinned and he began to suck air into his lungs he sensed the transition from indoors to out and tasted clean night air caris put him down and he heard her footsteps run back inside he gasped coughed gasped and coughed slowly he began to breathe more normally his eyes stopped watering and he saw that dawn was breaking the faint light showed him a crowd of nuns standing around him he sat upright caris and another nun dragged tilly out of the refectory and put her beside him caris bent over her merthin tried to speak coughed and tried again how is she shes been stabbed through the heart caris said she began to cry she was dead before you got to her merthin opened his eyes to bright daylight he had slept late the angle of the suns rays shining through the bedroom window told him it was the middle of the morning he recalled the events of the previous night like a bad dream and for a moment he cherished the thought that they might not really have happened but his chest hurt when he breathed and the skin of his face was painfully scorched the horror of tillys murder came back to him and sister nellie too both innocent young women how could god permit such things to happen he realized what had awakened him when his eye lit on caris putting a tray down on the small table near the bed her back was to him but he could tell by the hunch of her shoulders and the set of her head that she was angry it was not surprising she was grieving for tilly and enraged that the sanctity and safety of the nunnery had been violated merthin got up caris pulled two stools to the table and they both sat down he studied her face fondly there were lines of strain around her eyes he wondered if she had slept there was a smear of ash on her left cheek so he licked his thumb and gently wiped it off she had brought new bread with fresh butter and a jug of cider merthin found he was hungry and thirsty and he tucked in caris bottling up fury ate nothing through a mouthful of bread merthin said how is thomas this morning hes lying down in the hospital his head hurts but he can talk coherently and answer questions so theres probably no permanent damage to his brain good there will have to be an inquest on tilly and nellie ive sent a message to the sheriff of shiring they will probably blame it on tam hiding tam hiding is dead he nodded he knew what was coming his spirits had been lifted by the breakfast but now they sank again he swallowed and pushed away his plate caris went on whoever it was that came here last night he wanted to conceal his identity so he told a lie not knowing that tam died in my hospital three months ago who do you think it could have been someone we know hence the masks perhaps outlaws dont wear masks it was true living outside the law they did not care who knew about them and the crimes they committed last nights intruders were different the masks strongly suggested they were respected citizens who were afraid of being recognized caris went on with merciless logic they killed nellie to make joan open up the treasury but they had no need to kill tilly they were already inside the treasury by then they wanted her dead for some other reason and they were not content to leave her to be suffocated by smoke and burned to death they also stabbed her fatally for some reason they had to be sure she was dead what does that tell you caris did not answer the question tilly thought ralph wanted to kill her i know one of the hooded men was about to do away with you at one point her voice caught in her throat and she had to stop she took a sip of merthins cider composing herself then she went on but the leader stopped him why would he do that they had already murdered a nun and a noblewoman why scruple to kill a mere builder you think it was ralph dont you yes merthin sighed heavily did you see his mitten i noticed he was wearing gloves merthin shook his head only one on his left hand not a glove with fingers but a mitten to hide his injury i cant be sure and we certainly couldnt prove anything but i have a dreadful conviction about it caris stood up lets inspect the damage they went to the nuns cloisters the novices and the orphans were cleaning the treasury bringing sacks of charred wood and ashes up the spiral staircase giving anything not completely destroyed to sister joan and carrying the detritus out to the dunghill laid out on a refectory table merthin saw the cathedral ornaments gold and silver candlesticks crucifixes and vessels all finely wrought and studded with precious stones he was surprised didnt they take these he said yes but they seem to have had second thoughts and dumped them in a ditch outside town a peasant on his way in with eggs to sell found them this morning luckily he was honest merthin picked up a gold aquamanile a jug for washing the hands made in the shape of a cockerel the feathers of its neck beautifully chased its hard to sell something like this only a few people could afford to buy it and most of those would guess it had been stolen the thieves could have melted it down and sold the gold obviously they decided that was too much trouble perhaps she was not convinced nor was merthin his own explanation did not quite fit the robbery had been carefully planned that was evident so why would the thieves not have made up their minds in advance about the ornaments either to take them or leave them behind caris and merthin went down the steps and into the chamber merthins stomach clenching in fear as he was grimly reminded of last nights ordeal more novices were cleaning the walls and floor with mops and buckets caris sent the novices away to take a break when she and merthin were alone she picked up a length of wood from a shelf and used it to prise up one of the flagstones underfoot merthin had not previously noticed that the stone was not fitted as tightly as most having a narrow gap all around it now he saw that underneath was a spacious vault containing a wooden box caris reached into the hole and pulled out the box she opened it with a key from her belt it was full of gold coins merthin was surprised they missed that there are three more concealed vaults caris told him another in the floor and two in the walls they missed them all they cant have looked very hard most treasuries have hiding places people know that especially robbers so maybe the cash wasnt their first priority exactly caris locked the chest and put it back in its vault if they didnt want the ornaments and they werent sufficiently interested in cash to search the treasury thoroughly for hidden vaults why did they come here at all to kill tilly the robbery was a cover merthin thought about that they didnt need an elaborate cover story he said after a pause if all they wanted was to kill tilly they could have done it in the dormitory and been far away from here by the time the nuns got back from matins if they had done it carefully suffocated her with a feather pillow say we would not even have been sure she had been murdered it would have looked as if she had died in her sleep then theres no explanation for the attack they ended up with next to nothing a few gold coins merthin looked around the underground chamber where are the charters he said they must have burned it doesnt much matter ive got copies of everything parchment doesnt burn very well ive never tried to light it it smoulders shrinks and distorts but it doesnt catch fire perhaps the charters have been retrieved from the debris lets check they climbed back up the steps and left the vault outside in the cloisters caris asked joan have you found any parchment among the ashes she shook her head nothing at all could you have missed it i dont think so not unless it has burned to cinders merthin says it doesnt burn she turned to him who would want our charters theyre no use to anyone else merthin followed the thread of his own logic just to see where it might lead suppose theres a document that youve got or you might have or they think you might have and they want it what could it be merthin frowned documents are intended to be public the whole point of writing something down is so that people can look at it in the future a secret document is a strange thing then he thought of something he drew caris away from joan and walked casually around the cloisters with her until he was sure they could not be overheard then he said but of course we do know of one secret document the letter thomas buried in the forest yes but why would anyone imagine it might be in the nunnerys treasury well think has anything happened lately that might arouse such a suspicion a look of dismay came over cariss face oh my soul she exclaimed there is something i told you about lynn grange being given to us by queen isabella for accepting thomas all those years ago did you speak to anyone else about it yes the bailiff of lynn and thomas was angry that i had done so and said there would be dire consequences so someone is afraid you might have got hold of thomass secret letter ralph i dont think ralph is aware of the letter i was the only one of us children who saw thomas burying it hes certainly never mentioned it ralph must be acting on behalf of someone else caris looked scared queen isabella or the king himself is it possible that the king ordered ralph to invade a nunnery not personally no he would have used an intermediary someone loyal ambitious and with absolutely no scruples i came across such men in florence hanging around the doges palace theyre the scum of the earth i wonder who it was i think i can guess said merthin gregory longfellow met ralph and alan two days later at wigleigh in the small timber manor house wigleigh was more discreet than tench at tench hall there were too many people watching ralphs every move servants followers his parents here in wigleigh the peasants had their own backbreaking business to do and no one would question ralph about the contents of the sack alan was carrying i gather it went off as planned gregory said news of the invasion of the nunnery had spread all over the county in no time no great difficulty ralph said he was a bit let down by gregorys muted reaction after all the trouble that had been taken to get the charters gregory might have shown some elation the sheriff has announced an inquest of course gregory said dourly theyll blame it on outlaws you were not recognized we wore hoods gregory looked at ralph strangely i did not know that your wife was at the nunnery a useful coincidence ralph said it enabled me to kill two birds with one stone the strange look intensified what was the lawyer thinking was he going to pretend to be shocked that ralph had killed his wife if so ralph was ready to point out that gregory was complicit in everything that had happened at the nunnery he had been the instigator he had no right to judge ralph waited for gregory to speak but after a long pause all he said was lets have a look at these charters they sent the housekeeper vira on a lengthy errand and ralph made alan stand at the door to keep out casual callers then gregory tipped the charters out of the sack on to the table he made himself comfortable and began to examine them some were rolled and tied with string others bundled flat a few sewn together in booklets he opened one read a few lines in the strong sunlight coming through the open windows then threw the charter back into the sack and picked up another ralph had no idea what gregory was looking for he had only said that it might embarrass the king ralph could not imagine what kind of document caris might possess that would embarrass a king he got bored watching gregory read but he was not going to leave he had delivered what gregory wanted and he was going to sit here until gregory confirmed his half of the deal the tall lawyer worked his way patiently through the documents one caught his attention and he read it all the way through but then he threw it in the sack with the others ralph and alan had spent most of the last week in bristol it was not likely that they would be asked to account for their movements but they had taken precautions anyway they had caroused at taverns every evening except the night they went to kingsbridge their companions would remember the free drinks but probably would not recall that on one night of the week ralph and alan had been absent or if they did they certainly would not know whether it was the fourth wednesday after easter or the thursday but two before whitsun at last the table was clear and the sack was full again ralph said did you not find what you were looking for gregory did not answer the question you brought everything everything good so you havent found it gregory chose his words carefully as always the specific item is not here however i did come across a deed that may explain why this issue has arisen in recent months so youre satisfied ralph persisted yes and the king need no longer be anxious gregory looked impatient you should not concern yourself with the kings anxieties ill do that then i can expect my reward immediately oh yes said gregory you shall be the earl of shiring by harvest time ralph felt a glow of satisfaction the earl of shiring at last he had won the prize he had always longed for and his father was still alive to hear the news thank you he said if i were you said gregory i should go and woo lady philippa woo her ralph was astonished gregory shrugged she has no real choice in the matter of course but still the formalities should be observed tell her that the king has given you permission to ask for her hand in marriage and say you hope she will learn to love you as much as you love her oh said ralph all right take her a present said gregory on the morning of tillys burial caris and merthin met on the roof of the cathedral at dawn the roof was a world apart calculating the acreage of slates was a perennial geometry exercise in the advanced mathematics class at the priory school workmen needed constant access for repairs and maintenance so a network of walkways and ladders linked the slopes and ridges corners and gulleys turrets and pinnacles gutters and gargoyles the crossing tower had not yet been rebuilt but the view from the top of the west façade was impressive the priory was already busy this would be a big funeral tilly had been a nobody in life but now she was the victim of a notorious murder a noblewoman killed in a nunnery and she would be mourned by people who had never spoken three words to her caris would have liked to discourage mourners because of the risk of spreading the plague but there was nothing she could do the bishop was already here in the best room of the priors palace which was why caris and merthin had spent the night apart she in the nuns dormitory and he and lolla at the holly bush the grieving widower ralph was in a private room upstairs at the hospital his baby gerry was being taken care of by the nuns lady philippa and her daughter odila the only other surviving relatives of the dead girl were also staying at the hospital neither merthin nor caris had spoken to ralph when he arrived yesterday there was nothing they could do no way to get justice for tilly for they could prove nothing but all the same they knew the truth so far they had told no one what they believed there was no point during todays obsequies they would have to pretend something like normalcy with ralph it was going to be difficult while the important personages slept the nuns and the priory employees were hard at work preparing the funeral dinner smoke was rising from the bakery where dozens of long fourpound loaves of wheat bread were already in the oven two men were rolling a new barrel of wine across to the priors house several novice nuns were setting up benches and a trestle table on the green for the common mourners as the sun rose beyond the river throwing a slanting yellow light on the rooftops of kingsbridge caris studied the marks made on the town by nine months of plague from this height she could see gaps in the rows of houses like bad teeth timber buildings collapsed all the time of course because of fire rain damage incompetent construction or just old age what was different now was that no one bothered to repair them if your house fell down you just moved into one of the empty homes in the same street the only person building anything was merthin and he was seen as a mad optimist with too much money across the river the gravediggers were already at work in another newly consecrated cemetery the plague showed no signs of relenting where would it end would the houses just continue to fall down one at a time until there was nothing left and the town was a wasteland of broken tiles and scorched timbers with a deserted cathedral in the middle and a hundredacre graveyard at its edge im not going to let this happen she said merthin did not at first understand the funeral he said frowning caris made a sweeping gesture to take in the city and the world beyond it everything drunks maiming one another parents abandoning their sick children on the doorstep of my hospital men queuing to fuck a drunken woman on a table outside the white horse livestock dying in the pastures halfnaked penitents whipping themselves then collecting pennies from bystanders and most of all a young mother brutally murdered here in my nunnery i dont care if we are all going to die of the plague as long as were still alive im not going to let our world fall apart what are you going to do she smiled gratefully at merthin most people would have told her she was powerless to fight the situation but he was always ready to believe in her she looked at the stone angels carved on a pinnacle their faces blurred by two hundred years of wind and rain and she thought of the spirit that had moved the cathedral builders were going to reestablish order and routine here were going to force kingsbridge people to return to normal whether they like it or not were going to rebuild this town and its life despite the plague all right he said this is the moment to do it because everyone is so angry about tilly and because theyre frightened at the thought that armed men can come into the town at night and murder whomever they will they think no ones safe what will you do im going to tell them it must never happen again this must never happen again she cried and her voice rang out across the graveyard and echoed off the ancient walls of the cathedral a woman could never speak out as part of a service in church but the graveside ceremony was a grey area a solemn moment that took place outside the church a time when lay people such as the family of the deceased would sometimes make speeches or pray aloud all the same caris was sticking her neck out bishop henri was officiating backed up by archdeacon lloyd and canon claude lloyd had been diocesan clerk for decades and claude was a colleague of henris from france in such distinguished clerical company it was audacious for a nun to make an unscheduled speech such considerations had never meant much to caris of course she spoke just as the small coffin was being lowered into the grave several of the congregation had begun to cry the crowd was at least five hundred strong but they fell silent at the sound of her voice armed men have come into our town at night and killed a young woman in the nunnery and i will not stand for it she said there was a rumble of assent from the crowd she raised her voice the priory will not stand for it the bishop will not stand for it and the men and women of kingsbridge will not stand for it the support became louder the crowd shouting no and amen people say the plague is sent by god i say that when god sends rain we take shelter when god sends winter we build up the fire when god sends weeds we pull them up by the roots we must defend ourselves she glanced at bishop henri he was looking bemused he had had no warning of this sermon and if he had been asked for his permission he would have refused it but he could tell that caris had the people on her side and he did not have the nerve to intervene what can we do she looked around all faces were turned to her expectantly they had no idea what to do but they wanted a solution from her they would cheer at anything she said if only it gave them hope we must rebuild the city wall she cried they roared their approval a new wall that is taller and stronger and longer than the brokendown old one she caught the eye of ralph a wall that will keep murderers out the crowd shouted yes ralph looked away and we must elect a new constable and a force of deputies and sentries to uphold the law and enforce good behaviour yes there will be a meeting of the parish guild tonight to work out the practical details and the guilds decisions will be announced in church next sunday thank you and god bless you all at the funeral banquet in the grand dining hall of the priors palace bishop henri sat at the head of the table on his right was lady philippa the widowed countess of shiring next to her was seated the chief mourner tillys widower sir ralph fitzgerald ralph was delighted to be next to philippa he could stare at her breasts while she concentrated on her food and every time she leaned forward he could peek down the square neckline of her light summer dress she did not know it yet but the time was not far away when he would command her to take off her clothes and stand naked in front of him and he would see those magnificent breasts in their entirety the dinner provided by caris was ample but not extravagant he noted there were no gilded swans or towers of sugar but there was plenty of roasted meat boiled fish new bread beans and spring berries he helped philippa to some soup made of minced chicken with almond milk she said to him gravely this is a terrible tragedy you have my most profound sympathy people had been so compassionate that sometimes for a few moments ralph thought of himself as the pitiable victim of a dreadful bereavement and forgot that he was the one who had slid the knife into tillys young heart thank you he said solemnly tilly was so young but we soldiers get used to sudden death one day a man will save your life and swear eternal friendship and loyalty and the next day he is struck down by a crossbow bolt through the heart and you forget him she gave him an odd look that reminded him of the way sir gregory had regarded him with a mixture of curiosity and distaste and he wondered what it was about his attitude to tillys death that provoked this reaction philippa said you have a baby boy gerry the nuns are looking after him today but ill take him home to tench hall tomorrow ive found a wet nurse he saw an opportunity to drop a hint of course he needs someone to mother him properly yes he recalled her own bereavement but you know what it is to lose your spouse i was fortunate to have my beloved william for twentyone years you must be lonely this might not be the moment to propose but he thought to edge the conversation towards the subject indeed i lost my three men william and our two sons the castle seems so empty but not for long perhaps she stared at him as if she could not believe her ears and he realized he had said something offensive she turned away and spoke to bishop henri on her other side on ralphs right was philippas daughter odila would you like some of this pasty he said to her its made with peacocks and hares she nodded and he cut her a slice how old are you he asked ill be fifteen this year she was tall and had her mothers figure already a full bosom and wide womanly hips you seem older he said looking at her breasts he intended it as a compliment young people generally wanted to seem older but she blushed and looked away ralph looked down at his trencher and speared a chunk of pork cooked with ginger he ate it moodily he was not very good at what gregory called wooing caris was seated on the left of bishop henri with merthin as alderman on her other side next to merthin was sir gregory longfellow who had come for the funeral of earl william three months ago and had not yet left the neighbourhood caris had to suppress her disgust at being at a table with the murdering ralph and the man who had almost certainly put him up to it but she had work to do at this dinner she had a plan for the revival of the town rebuilding the walls was only the first part for the second she had to get bishop henri on her side she poured the bishop a goblet of clear red gascon wine and he took a long draught he wiped his mouth and said you preach a good sermon thank you she said noting the ironic reproof that underlay his compliment life in this town is degenerating into disorder and debauchery and if were to put it right we need to inspire the townspeople im sure you agree its a little late to ask whether i agree with you however i do henri was a pragmatist who did not refight lost battles she had been counting on that she served herself some heron roasted with pepper and cloves but did not begin to eat she had too much to say theres more to my plan than the walls and the constabulary i thought there might be i believe that you as the bishop of kingsbridge should have the tallest cathedral in england he raised his eyebrows i wasnt expecting that two hundred years ago this was one of englands most important priories it should be so again a new church tower would symbolize the revival and your eminence among bishops he smiled wryly but he was pleased he knew he was being flattered and he liked it caris said the tower would also serve the town being visible from a distance it would help pilgrims and traders find their way here how would you pay for it the priory is wealthy he was surprised again prior godwyn complained of money problems he was a hopeless manager he struck me as rather competent he struck a lot of people that way but he made all the wrong decisions right at the start he refused to repair the fulling mill which would have brought him an income but he spent money on this palace which returned him nothing and how have things changed ive sacked most of the bailiffs and replaced them with younger men who are willing to make changes ive converted about half the land to grazing which is easier to manage in these times of labour shortage the rest ive leased for cash rents with no customary obligations and weve all benefited from inheritance taxes and from the legacies of people who died without heirs because of the plague the monastery is now as rich as the nunnery so all the tenants are free most instead of working one day a week on the demesne farm and carting the landlords hay and folding their sheep on the landlords field and all those complicated services they just pay money they like it better and it certainly makes our life simpler a lot of landlords abbots especially revile that type of tenancy they say it ruins the peasantry caris shrugged what have we lost the power to impose petty variations favouring some serfs and persecuting others keeping them all subservient monks and nuns have no business tyrannizing peasants farmers know what crops to sow and what they can sell at market they work better left to themselves the bishop looked suspicious so you feel the priory can pay for a new tower he had been expecting her to ask him for money she guessed yes with some assistance from the towns merchants and thats where you can help us i thought there must be something im not asking you for money what i want from you is worth more than money im intrigued i want to apply to the king for a borough charter as she said the words caris felt her hands begin to shake she was taken back to the battle she had fought with godwyn ten years ago that had ended in her being accused of witchcraft the issue then had been the borough charter and she had nearly died fighting for it circumstances now were completely different but the charter was no less important she put down her eating knife and clasped her hands together in her lap to keep them still i see said henri noncommittally caris swallowed hard and went on its essential for the regeneration of the towns commercial life for a long time kingsbridge has been held back by the dead hand of priory rule priors are cautious and conservative and instinctively say no to any change or innovation merchants live by change theyre always looking for new ways to make money or at least the good ones are if we want the men of kingsbridge to help pay for our new tower we must give them the freedom they need to prosper a borough charter the town would have its own court set its own regulations and be ruled by a proper guild rather than the parish guild we have now which has no real power but would the king grant it kings like boroughs which pay lots of taxes but in the past the prior of kingsbridge has always opposed a charter you think priors are too conservative timid well said the bishop with a laugh timidity is a thing youll never be accused of caris pressed her point i think a charter is essential if were to build the new tower yes i can see that so do you agree to the tower or the charter they go together henri seemed amused are you making a deal with me mother caris if youre willing all right build me a tower and ill help you get a charter no it has to be the other way around we need the charter first so i must trust you is that difficult to be honest no good then were agreed yes caris leaned forward and looked past merthin sir gregory yes mother caris she forced herself to be polite to him have you tried this rabbit in sugar gravy i recommend it gregory accepted the bowl and took some thank you caris said to him you will recall that kingsbridge is not a borough i certainly do gregory had used that fact more than a decade ago to outmanoeuvre caris in the royal court in the dispute over the fulling mill the bishop thinks its time for us to ask the king for a charter gregory nodded i believe the king might look favourably on such a plea especially if it were presented to him in the right way hoping that her distaste was not showing on her face she said perhaps you would be kind enough to advise us may we discuss this in more detail later gregory would require a bribe of course though he would undoubtedly call it a lawyers fee by all means she said repressing a shudder the servants began clearing away the food caris looked down at her trencher she had not eaten anything our families are related ralph was saying to lady philippa not closely of course he added hastily but my father is descended from that earl of shiring who was the son of lady aliena and jack builder he looked across the table at his brother merthin the alderman i think i inherited the blood of the earls and my brother that of the builders he looked at philippas face to see how she took that she did not seem impressed i was brought up in the household of your late fatherinlaw earl roland he went on i remember you as a squire i served under the earl in the kings army in france at the battle of crécy i saved the life of the prince of wales my goodness how splendid she said politely he was trying to get her to see him as an equal so that it would seem more natural when he told her that she was to be his wife but he did not appear to be getting through to her she just looked bored and a bit puzzled by the direction of his conversation the dessert was served sugared strawberries honey wafers dates and raisins and spiced wine ralph drained a cup of wine and poured more hoping that the drink would help him relax with philippa he was not sure why he found it difficult to talk to her because this was his wifes funeral because philippa was a countess or because he had been hopelessly in love with her for years and could not believe that now at last she really was to be his wife when you leave here will you go back to earlscastle he asked her yes we depart tomorrow will you stay there long where else would i go she frowned why do you ask i will come and visit you there if i may her response was frosty to what end i want to discuss with you a subject that it would not be appropriate to raise here and now what on earth do you mean ill come and see you in the next few days she looked agitated in a raised voice she said what could you possibly have to say to me as i said it wouldnt be appropriate to speak of it today because this is your wifes funeral he nodded she went pale oh my god she said you cant mean to suggest i told you i dont want to discuss it now but i must know she cried are you planning to propose marriage to me he hesitated shrugged and then nodded but on what grounds she said surely you need the kings permission he looked at her and raised his eyebrows briefly she stood up suddenly no she said everyone around the table looked at her she stared at gregory is this true she said is the king going to marry me to him she jerked a thumb contemptuously at ralph ralph felt stabbed he had not expected her to display such revulsion was he so repellent gregory looked reproachfully at ralph this was not the moment to raise the matter philippa cried so its true god save me ralph caught odilas eye she was staring at him in horror what had he ever done to earn her dislike philippa said i cant bear it why ralph said what is so wrong what right have you to look down on me and my family he looked around at the company his brother his ally gregory the bishop the prioress minor noblemen and leading citizens they were all silent shocked and intrigued by philippas outburst philippa ignored his question addressing gregory she said i will not do it i will not do you hear me she was white with rage but tears ran down her cheeks ralph thought how beautiful she was even while she was rejecting and humiliating him so painfully gregory said coolly it is not your decision lady philippa and it certainly is not mine the king will do as he pleases you may force me into a wedding dress and you may march me up the aisle philippa raged she pointed at bishop henri but when the bishop asks me if i take ralph fitzgerald to be my husband i will not say yes i will not never never never she stormed out of the room and odila followed when the banquet was over the townspeople returned to their homes and the important guests went to their rooms to sleep off the feast caris supervised the clearing up she felt sorry for philippa profoundly sorry knowing as philippa did not that ralph had killed his first wife but she was concerned about the fate of an entire town not just one person her mind was on her scheme for kingsbridge things had gone better than she imagined the townspeople had cheered her and the bishop had agreed to everything she proposed perhaps civilization would return to kingsbridge despite the plague outside the back door where there was a pile of meat bones and crusts of bread she saw godwyns cat archbishop delicately picking at the carcase of a duck she shooed it away it scampered a few yards then slowed to a stiff walk its whitetipped tail arrogantly upstanding deep in thought she went up the stairs of the palace thinking of how she would begin implementing the changes agreed to by henri without pausing she opened the door of the bedroom she shared with merthin and stepped inside for a moment she was disoriented two men stood in the middle of the room and she thought i must be in the wrong house and then i must be in the wrong room before she remembered that her room being the best bedroom had naturally been given to the bishop the two men were henri and his assistant canon claude it took caris a moment to realize that they were both naked with their arms around one another kissing she stared at them in shock oh she said they had not heard the door until she spoke they did not realize they were observed when they heard her gasp of surprise they both turned towards her a look of horrified guilt came over henris face and his mouth fell open im sorry caris said the men sprang apart as if hoping they might be able to deny what was going on then they remembered they were naked henri was plump with a round belly and fat arms and legs and grey hair on his chest claude was younger and slimmer with very little body hair except for a blaze of chestnut at his groin caris had never before looked at two erect penises at the same time i beg your pardon she said mortified with embarrassment my mistake i forgot she realized that she was babbling and they were dumbstruck it did not matter nothing that anyone could say would make the situation any better coming to her senses she backed out of the room and slammed the door merthin walked away from the banquet with madge webber he was fond of this small chunky woman with her chin jutting out in front and her bottom jutting out behind he admired the way she had carried on after her husband and children had died of the plague she had continued the enterprise weaving cloth and dyeing it red according to cariss recipe she said to him good for caris shes right as usual we cant go on like this youve continued normally despite everything he said my only problem is finding the people to do the work everyone is the same i cant get builders raw wool is cheap but rich people will still pay high prices for good scarlet cloth madge said i could sell more if i could produce more merthin said thoughtfully you know i saw a faster type of loom in florence a treadle loom oh she looked at him with alert curiosity i never heard of that he wondered how to explain in any loom you stretch a number of threads over the frame to form what you call the warp then you weave another thread crossways through the warp under one thread and over the next under and over from one side to the other and back again to form the weft thats how simple looms work yes ours are better i know to make the process quicker you attach every second warp thread to a movable bar called a heddle so that when you shift the heddle half the threads are lifted away from the rest then instead of going over and under over and under you can simply pass the weft thread straight through the gap in one easy movement then you drop the heddle below the warp for the return pass yes by the way the weft thread is wound on a bobbin each time you pass the bobbin through the warp from left to right you have to put it down then use both hands to move the heddle then pick up the bobbin again and bring it back from right to left exactly in a treadle loom you move the heddle with your feet so you never have to put the bobbin down really my soul that would make a difference wouldnt it a huge difference you could weave twice as much more thats what i thought shall i build one for you to try yes please i dont remember exactly how it was constructed i think the treadle operated a system of pulleys and levers he frowned thinking anyway im sure i can figure it out late in the afternoon as caris was passing the library she met canon claude coming out carrying a small book he caught her eye and stopped they both immediately thought of the scene caris had stumbled upon an hour ago at first claude looked embarrassed but then a grin lifted the corners of his mouth his put his hand to his face to cover it obviously feeling it was wrong to be amused caris remembered how startled the two naked men had been and she too felt inappropriate laughter bubbling up inside her on impulse she said what was in her mind the two of you did look funny claude giggled despite himself and caris could not help chuckling too and they made each other worse until they fell into one anothers arms tears streaming down their cheeks helpless with laughter that evening caris took merthin to the southwest corner of the priory grounds where the vegetable garden grew alongside the river the air was mild and the moist earth gave up a fragrance of new growth caris could see spring onions and radishes so your brother is to be the earl of shiring she said not if lady philippa has anything to do with it a countess has to do what she is told by the king doesnt she all women should be subservient to men in theory merthin said with a grin some defy convention though i cant think who you mean merthins mood changed abruptly what a world he said a man murders his wife and the king elevates him to the highest rank of the nobility we know these things happen she said but its shocking when its your own family poor tilly merthin rubbed his eyes as if to erase visions why have you brought me here to talk about the final element in my plan the new hospital ah i was wondering could you build it here merthin looked around i dont see why not its a sloping site but the entire priory is built on a slope and were not talking about putting up another cathedral one storey or two one but i want the building divided into mediumsized rooms each containing just four or six beds so that diseases dont spread so quickly from one patient to everyone else in the place it must have its own pharmacy a large welllit room for the preparation of medicines with a herb garden outside and a spacious airy latrine with piped water very easy to keep clean in fact the whole building must have lots of light and space but most importantly it has to be at least a hundred yards from the rest of the priory we have to separate the sick from the well thats the key feature ill do some drawings in the morning she glanced around and seeing that they were not observed she kissed him this is going to be the culmination of my lifes work do you realize that youre thirtytwo isnt it a little early to be talking about the culmination of your lifes work it hasnt happened yet it wont take long ill start on it while im digging the foundations for the new tower then as soon as the hospital is built i can switch my masons to work on the cathedral they started to walk back she could tell that his real enthusiasm was for the tower how tall will it be four hundred and five feet how high is salisbury four hundred and four so it will be the highest building in england until someone builds a higher one yes so he would achieve his ambition too she thought she put her arm through his as they walked to the priors palace she felt happy that was strange wasnt it thousands of kingsbridge people had died of the plague and tilly had been murdered but caris felt hopeful it was because she had a plan of course she always felt better when she had a plan the new walls the constabulary the tower the borough charter and most of all the new hospital how would she find time to organize it all arm in arm with merthin she walked into the priors house bishop henri and sir gregory were there deep in conversation with a third man who had his back to caris there was something unpleasantly familiar about the newcomer even from behind and caris felt a tremor of unease then he turned around and she saw his face sardonic triumphant sneering and full of malice it was philemon bishop henri and the other guests left kingsbridge the next morning caris who had been sleeping in the nuns dormitory returned to the priors palace after breakfast and went upstairs to her room she found philemon there it was the second time in two days that she had been startled by men in her bedroom however philemon was alone and fully dressed standing by the window looking at a book seeing him in profile she realized that the trials of the last six months had left him thinner she said what are you doing here he pretended to be surprised by the question this is the priors house why should i not be here because its not your room i am the subprior of kingsbridge i have never been dismissed from that post the prior is dead who else should live here me of course youre not even a monk bishop henri made me acting prior and last night despite your return he did not dismiss me from this post i am your superior and you must obey me but youre a nun and you must live with the nuns not with the monks ive been living here for months alone suddenly caris saw that she was on shaky ground philemon knew that she and merthin had been living more or less as man and wife they had been discreet not flaunting their relationship but people guessed these things and philemon had a wild beasts instinct for weakness she considered she could insist on philemons leaving the building immediately if necessary she could have him thrown out thomas and the novices would obey her not philemon but what then philemon would do all he could to call attention to what merthin and she were up to in the palace he would create a controversy and leading townspeople would take sides most would support caris almost whatever she did such was her reputation but there would be some who would censure her behaviour the conflict would weaken her authority and undermine everything else she wanted to do it would be better to admit defeat you may have the bedroom she said but not the hall i use that for meetings with leading townspeople and visiting dignitaries when youre not attending services in the church you will be in the cloisters not here a subprior does not have a palace she left without giving him a chance to argue she had saved face but he had won she had been reminded last night of how wily philemon was questioned by bishop henri he seemed to have a plausible explanation for everything dishonourable that he had done how did he justify deserting his post at the priory and running away to stjohnintheforest the monastery had been in danger of extinction and the only way to save it had been to flee in accordance with the saying leave early go far and stay long it was still by general consent the only sure way to avoid the plague their sole mistake had been to remain too long in kingsbridge why then had no one informed the bishop of this plan philemon was sorry but he and the other monks were only obeying the orders of prior godwyn then why had he run away from st john when the plague caught up with them there he had been called by god to minister to the people of monmouth and godwyn had given him permission to leave how come brother thomas did not know about this permission in fact denied firmly that it had ever been given the other monks had not been told of godwyns decision for fear it would cause jealousy why then had philemon left monmouth he had met friar murdo who had told him that kingsbridge priory needed him and he regarded this as a further message from god caris concluded that philemon had run from the plague until he had realized he must be one of those fortunate people who were not prone to catch it then he had learned from murdo that caris was sleeping with merthin in the priors palace and he had immediately seen how he could exploit that situation to restore his own fortunes god had nothing to do with it but bishop henri had believed philemons tale philemon was careful to appear humble to the point of obsequiousness henri did not know the man and failed to see beneath the surface she left philemon in the palace and walked to the cathedral she climbed the long narrow spiral staircase in the northwest tower and found merthin in the masons loft drawing designs on the tracing floor in the light from the tall northfacing windows she looked with interest at what he had done it was always difficult to read plans she found the thin lines scratched in the mortar had to be transformed in the viewers imagination into thick walls of stone with windows and doors merthin regarded her expectantly as she studied his work he was obviously anticipating a big reaction at first she was baffled by the drawing it looked nothing like a hospital she said but youve drawn a cloister exactly he said why should a hospital be a long narrow room like the nave of a church you want the place to be light and airy so instead of cramming the rooms together ive set them around a quadrangle she visualized it the square of grass the building around the doors leading to rooms of four or six beds the nuns moving from room to room in the shelter of the covered arcade its inspired she said i would never have thought of it but it will be perfect you can grow herbs in the quadrangle where the plants will have sunshine but be sheltered from the wind there will be a fountain in the middle of the garden for fresh water and it can drain through the latrine wing to the south and into the river she kissed him exuberantly youre so clever then she recalled the news she had to tell him he must have seen her face fall for he said whats the matter we have to move out of the palace she said she told him about her conversation with philemon and why she had given in i foresee major conflicts with philemon i dont want this to be the one on which i make my stand that makes sense he said his tone of voice was reasonable but she knew by his face that he was angry he stared at his drawing though he was not really thinking about it and theres something else she said were telling everyone they have to live as normally as possible order in the streets a return to real family life no more drunken orgies we ought to set an example he nodded a prioress living with her lover is about as abnormal as could be i suppose he said once again his equable tone was contradicted by his furious expression im very sorry she said so am i but we dont want to risk everything we both want your tower my hospital the future of the town no but were sacrificing our life together not entirely well have to sleep separately which is painful but well have plenty of opportunities to be together where she shrugged here for example an imp of mischief possessed her she walked away from him across the room slowly lifting the skirt of her robe and went to the doorway at the top of the stairs i dont see anyone coming she said as she raised her dress to her waist you can hear them anyway he said the door at the foot of the stairs makes a noise she bent over pretending to look down the staircase can you see anything unusual from where you are he chuckled she could usually pull him out of an angry mood by being playful i can see something winking at me he laughed she walked back towards him still holding her robe up around her waist smiling triumphantly you see we dont have to give up everything he sat on a stool and pulled her towards him she straddled his thighs and lowered herself on to his lap youd better get a straw mattress up here she said her voice thick with desire he nuzzled her breasts how would i explain the need for a bed in a masons loft he murmured just say that masons need somewhere soft to put their tools a week later caris and thomas langley went to inspect the rebuilding of the city wall it was a big job but simple and once the line had been agreed the actual stonework could be done by inexperienced young masons and apprentices caris was glad the project had begun so promptly it was necessary that the town be able to defend itself in troubled times but she had a more important motive getting the townspeople to guard against disruption from outside would lead naturally she hoped to a new awareness of the need for order and good behaviour among themselves she found it deeply ironic that fate had cast her in this role she had never been a rule keeper she had always despised orthodoxy and flouted convention she felt she had the right to make her own rules now here she was clamping down on merrymakers it was a miracle that no one had yet called her a hypocrite the truth was that some people flourished in an atmosphere of anarchy and others did not merthin was one of those who were better off without constraints she recalled the carving he had made of the wise and foolish virgins it was different from anything anyone had seen before so elfric had made that his excuse for destroying it regulation only served to handicap merthin but men such as barney and lou the slaughterhouse workers had to have laws to stop them maiming one another in drunken fights all the same her position was shaky when you were trying to enforce law and order it was difficult to explain that the rules did not actually apply to you personally she was mulling over this as she returned with thomas to the priory outside the cathedral she found sister joan pacing up and down in a state of agitation im so angry with philemon she said he claims you have stolen his money and i must give it back just calm down caris said she led joan into the porch of the church and they sat on a stone bench take a deep breath and tell me what happened philemon came up to me after terce and said he needed ten shillings to buy candles for the shrine of st adolphus i said i would have to ask you quite right he became very angry and shouted that it was the monks money and i had no right to refuse him he demanded my keys and i think he would have tried to snatch them from me but i pointed out that they would be no use to him as he didnt know where the treasury was what a good idea it was to keep that secret caris said thomas was standing beside them listening he said i notice he picked a time when i was off the premises the coward caris said joan you did absolutely right to refuse him and im sorry he tried to bully you thomas go and find him and bring him to me at the palace she left them and walked through the graveyard deep in thought clearly philemon was set on making trouble but he was not the kind of blustering bully whom she could have overpowered with ease he was a wily opponent and she must watch her step when she opened the door of the priors house philemon was there in the hall sitting at the head of the long table she stopped in the doorway you shouldnt be here she said i specifically told you i was looking for you he said she realized she would have to lock the building otherwise he would always find a pretext for flouting her orders she controlled her anger you looked for me in the wrong place she said ive found you now though havent i she studied him he had shaved and cut his hair since his arrival and he wore a new robe he was every inch the priory official calm and authoritative she said ive been speaking to sister joan shes very upset so am i she realized he was sitting in the big chair and she was standing in front of him as if he were in charge and she a supplicant how clever he was at manipulating these things she said if you need money you must ask me im the subprior and im the acting prior which makes me your superior she raised her voice so the first thing you must do is stand up when youre speaking to me he started shocked by her tone then he controlled himself with insulting slowness he pulled himself out of the chair caris sat down in his place and let him stand he seemed unabashed i understand youre using monastery money to pay for the new tower by order of the bishop yes a flash of annoyance crossed his face he had hoped to ingratiate himself and make the bishop his ally against caris even as a child he had toadied unendingly to people in authority that was how he had gained admission to the monastery he said i must have access to the monasterys money its my right the monks assets should be in my charge the last time you were in charge of the monks assets you stole them he went pale that arrow had struck the bulls eye ridiculous he blustered trying to cover his embarrassment prior godwyn took them for safekeeping well nobody is going to take them for safekeeping while im acting prior you should at least give me the ornaments they are sacred jewels to be handled by priests not women thomas has been dealing with them quite adequately taking them out for services and restoring them to our treasury afterwards its not satisfactory caris remembered something and interrupted him besides you havent yet returned all that you took the money the ornaments theres a gold candlestick missing a gift from the chandlers guild what happened to that his reaction surprised her she was expecting another blustering denial but he looked embarrassed and said that was always kept in the priors room she frowned and i kept it separate from the other ornaments she was astonished are you telling me that you have had the candlestick all this time godwyn asked me to look after it and so you took it with you on your travels to monmouth and elsewhere that was his wish this was a wildly implausible tale and philemon knew it the fact was that he had stolen the candlestick do you still have it he nodded uncomfortably at that moment thomas came in there you are he said to philemon caris said thomas go upstairs and search philemons room what am i looking for the lost gold candlestick philemon said no need to search youll see it on the priedieu thomas went upstairs and came down again carrying the candlestick he handed it to caris it was heavy she looked at it curiously the base was engraved with the names of the twelve members of the chandlers guild in tiny letters why had philemon wanted it not to sell or melt down obviously he had had plenty of time to get rid of it but he had not done so it seemed he had just wanted to have his own gold candlestick did he gaze at it and touch it when he was alone in his room she looked at him and saw tears in his eyes he said are you going to take it from me it was a stupid question of course she replied it belongs in the cathedral not in your bedroom the chandlers gave it for the glory of god and the beautification of church services not the private pleasure of one monk he did not argue he looked bereft but not penitent he did not understand that he had done wrong his grief was not remorse for wrongdoing but regret for what had been taken from him he had no sense of shame she realized i think that ends our discussion about your access to the priorys valuables she said to philemon now you may go he went out she handed the candlestick back to thomas take it to sister joan and tell her to put it away she said well inform the chandlers that it has been found and use it next sunday thomas went off caris stayed where she was thinking philemon hated her she wasted no time wondering why he made enemies faster than a tinker made friends but he was an implacable foe and completely without scruples clearly he was determined to make trouble for her at every opportunity things would never get better each time she overcame him in one of these little skirmishes his malice would burn hotter but if she let him win he would only be encouraged in his insubordination it was going to be a bloody battle and she could not see how it would end the flagellants came back on a saturday evening in june caris was in the scriptorium writing her book she had decided to begin with the plague and how to deal with it then go on to lesser ailments she was describing the linen face masks she had introduced in the kingsbridge hospital it was hard to explain that the masks were effective but did not offer total immunity the only certain safeguard was to leave town before the plague arrived and stay away until it had gone but that was never going to be an option for the majority of people partial protection was a difficult concept for people who believed in miracle cures the truth was that some masked nuns still caught the plague but not as many as would otherwise have been expected she decided to compare the masks to shields a shield did not guarantee that a man would survive attack but it certainly gave him valuable protection and no knight would go into battle without one she was writing this down on a pristine sheet of blank parchment when she heard the flagellants and groaned in dismay the drums sounded like drunken footsteps the bagpipes like a wild creature in pain and the bells like a parody of a funeral she went outside just as the procession entered the precincts there were more of them this time seventy or eighty and they seemed wilder than before their hair long and matted their clothing a few shreds their shrieks more lunatic they had already been around the town and gathered a long tail of followers some looking on in amusement others joining in tearing their clothes and lashing themselves she had not expected to see them again the pope clement vi had condemned flagellants but he was a long way away at avignon and it was up to others to enforce his rulings friar murdo led them as before when he approached the west front of the cathedral caris saw to her astonishment that the great doors were open wide she had not authorized that thomas would not have done it without asking her philemon must be responsible she recalled that philemon on his travels had met up with murdo she guessed that murdo had forewarned philemon of this visit and they had conspired together to get the flagellants into the church no doubt philemon would argue that he was the only ordained priest in the priory therefore he had the right to decide what kind of services were conducted but what was philemons motive why did he care about murdo and the flagellants murdo led the procession through the tall central doorway and into the nave the townspeople crowded in afterwards caris hesitated to join in such a display but she felt the need to know what was going on so she reluctantly followed the crowd inside philemon was at the altar friar murdo joined him philemon raised his hands for quiet then said we come here today to confess our wickedness repent our sins and do penance in propitiation philemon was no preacher and his words drew a muted reaction but the charismatic murdo immediately took over we confess that our thoughts are lascivious and our deeds are filthy he cried and they shouted their approval the proceedings took the same form as before worked into a frenzy by murdos preaching people came to the front cried out that they were sinners and flogged themselves the townspeople looked on mesmerized by the violence and nudity it was a performance but the lashes were real and caris shuddered to see the weals and cuts on the backs of the penitents some of them had done this many times before and were scarred others had recent wounds that were reopened by the fresh whipping townspeople soon joined in as they came forward philemon held out a collection bowl and caris realized that his motivation was money nobody got to confess and kiss murdos feet until they put a coin in philemons bowl murdo was keeping an eye on the takings and caris assumed the two men would share out the coins afterwards there was a crescendo of drumming and piping as more and more townspeople came forward philemons bowl filled up rapidly those who had been forgiven danced ecstatically to the mad music eventually all the penitents were dancing and no more were coming forward the music built to a climax and stopped suddenly whereupon caris noticed that murdo and philemon had disappeared she assumed they had slipped out through the south transept to count their takings in the monks cloisters the spectacle was over the dancers lay down exhausted the spectators began to disperse drifting out through the open doors into the clean air of the summer evening soon murdos followers found the strength to leave the church and caris did the same she saw that most of the flagellants were heading for the holly bush she returned with relief to the cool hush of the nunnery as dusk gathered in the cloisters the nuns attended evensong and ate their supper before going to bed caris went to check on the hospital the place was still full the plague raged unabated she found little to criticize sister oonagh followed cariss principles face masks no bloodletting fanatical cleanliness caris was about to go to bed when one of the flagellants was brought in it was a man who had fainted in the holly bush and cracked his head on a bench his back was still bleeding and caris guessed that loss of blood was as much responsible as the blow to his head for the loss of consciousness oonagh bathed his wounds with salt water while he was unconscious to bring him round she set fire to the antler of a deer and wafted the pungent smoke under his nose then she made him drink two pints of water mixed with cinnamon and sugar to replace the fluid his body had lost but he was only the first several more men and women were brought in suffering from some combination of loss of blood excess of strong drink and injuries received in accidents or fights the orgy of flagellation increased the number of saturdaynight patients tenfold there was also a man who had flogged himself so many times that his back was putrid finally after midnight a woman was brought in after having been tied up flogged and raped fury stoked up in caris as she worked with the other nuns to tend these patients all their injuries arose from the perverted notions of religion put about by men such as murdo they said the plague was gods punishment for sin but people could avoid the plague by punishing themselves another way it was as if god were a vengeful monster playing a game with insane rules caris believed that gods sense of justice must be more sophisticated than that of the twelveyearold leader of a boys gang she worked until matins on sunday morning then went to sleep for a couple of hours when she got up she went to see merthin he was now living in the grandest of the houses he had built on leper island it was on the south shore and stood in a broad garden newly planted with apple and pear trees he had hired a middleaged couple to take care of lolla and maintain the place their names were arnaud and emily but they called one another arn and em caris found em in the kitchen and was directed to the garden merthin was showing lolla how her name was written using a pointed stick to form the letters in a patch of bare earth and he made her laugh by drawing a face in the o she was four years old a pretty girl with olive skin and brown eyes watching them caris suffered a pang of regret she had been sleeping with merthin for almost half a year she did not want to have a baby for it would mean the end of all her ambitions yet a part of her was sorry that she had not become pregnant she was torn which was probably why she had taken the risk but it had not happened she wondered whether she had lost the ability to conceive perhaps the potion mattie wise had given her to abort her pregnancy a decade ago had harmed her womb in some way as always she wished she knew more about the body and its ills merthin kissed her and they walked around the grounds with lolla running in front of them playing in her imagination an elaborate and impenetrable game that involved talking to each tree the garden looked raw all the plants new the soil carted in from elsewhere to enrich the islands stony ground ive come to talk to you about the flagellants caris said and she told him about last night at the hospital i want to ban them from kingsbridge she finished good idea merthin said the whole performance is just another moneymaker for murdo and philemon he was holding the bowl will you talk to the parish guild of course as acting prior caris was in the position of lord of the manor and she could theoretically have banned the flagellants herself without asking anyone else however her application for a borough charter was before the king and she expected soon to hand over the government of the town to the guild so she treated the current situation as a transition besides it was always smarter to win support before trying to enforce a rule she said id like to have the constable escort murdo and his followers out of town before the midday service philemon will be furious he shouldnt have opened the church to them without consulting anyone caris knew there would be trouble but she could not allow fear of philemons reaction to prevent her doing the right thing for the town weve got the pope on our side if we handle this discreetly and move fast we can solve the problem before philemons had breakfast all right said merthin ill try to get the guildsmen together at the holly bush ill meet you there in an hour the parish guild was badly depleted like every other organization in town but a handful of leading merchants had survived the plague including madge webber jake chepstow and edward slaughterhouse the new constable johns son mungo attended and his deputies waited outside for their instructions the discussion did not last long none of the leading citizens had taken part in the orgy and they ail disapproved of such public displays the popes ruling clinched the matter formally caris as prior promulgated a bylaw forbidding whipping in the streets and public nudity with violators to be expelled from the town by the constable on the instructions of any three guildsmen the guild then passed a resolution supporting the new law then mungo went upstairs and roused friar murdo from his bed murdo did not go quietly coming down the stairs he raved he wept he prayed and he cursed two of mungos deputies took him by the arms and half carried him out of the tavern in the street he became louder mungo led the way and the guildsmen followed some of murdos adherents came to protest and were themselves put under escort a few townspeople tagged along as the group headed down the main street towards merthins bridge none of the citizens objected to what was being done and philemon did not appear even some who had flogged themselves yesterday said nothing today looking a bit shamefaced about it all the crowd fell away as the group crossed the bridge with a reduced audience murdo became quieter his righteous indignation was replaced by smouldering malevolence released at the far end of the double bridge he stumped away through the suburbs without looking back a handful of disciples trailed after him uncertainly caris had a feeling she would not see him again she thanked mungo and his men then returned to the nunnery in the hospital oonagh was releasing the overnight accident cases to make room for new plague victims caris worked in the hospital until midday then left gratefully and led the procession into the church for the main sunday service she found she was looking forward to an hour or two of psalms and prayers and a boring sermon it would seem restful philemon had a thunderous look when he led thomas and the novice monks in he had obviously heard about the expulsion of murdo no doubt he had seen the flagellants as a source of income for himself independent of caris that hope had been dashed and he was livid for a moment caris wondered what he would do in his anger then she thought let him do what he likes if it were not this it would be something else whatever she did sooner or later philemon would be angry with her there was no point in worrying about it she nodded off during the prayers and woke up when he began to preach the pulpit seemed to heighten his charmlessness and his sermons were poorly received in general however today he grabbed the attention of his audience at the start by announcing that his subject would be fornication he took as his text a verse from st pauls first letter to the early christians at corinth he read it in latin then translated it in ringing tones now i have written to you not to keep company with anyone who is a fornicator he elaborated tediously on the meaning of keeping company dont eat with them dont drink with them dont live with them dont talk to them but caris was wondering anxiously where he was going with this surely he would not dare to attack her directly from the pulpit she glanced across the choir to thomas on the other side with the novice monks and caught a worried look from him she looked again at philemons face dark with resentment and realized he was capable of anything who does this refer to he asked rhetorically not to outsiders the saint specifically writes it is for god to judge them but he says you are judges within the fellowship he pointed at the congregation you he looked down again at the book and read put away from among yourselves that wicked person the congregation was quiet they sensed that this was not the usual generalized exhortation to better behaviour philemon had a message we must look around ourselves he said in our town in our church in our priory are there any fornicators if so they must be put out there was no doubt now in cariss mind that he was referring to her and the more astute townspeople would have come to the same conclusion but what could she do she could hardly get up and contradict him she could not even walk out of the church for that would underline his point and make it obvious to the stupidest member of the congregation that she was the target of his tirade so she listened mortified philemon was speaking well for the first time ever he did not hesitate or stumble he enunciated clearly and projected his voice and he managed to vary his usual dull monotone for him hatred was inspirational no one was going to put her out of the priory of course even if she had been an incompetent prioress the bishop would have kept her on simply because the scarcity of clergy was chronic churches and monasteries all over the country were closing because there was no one to hold services or sing psalms bishops were desperate to appoint more priests monks and nuns not sack them anyway the townspeople would have revolted against any bishop who tried to get rid of caris all the same philemons sermon was damaging it would now be more difficult for the towns leaders to turn a blind eye to cariss liaison with merthin this kind of thing undermined peoples respect they would forgive a man for a sexual peccadillo more readily than a woman and as she was painfully aware her position invited the accusation of hypocrisy she sat grinding her teeth through the peroration which was the same message shouted louder and the remainder of the service as soon as the nuns and monks had processed out of the church she went to her pharmacy and sat down to compose a letter to bishop henri asking him to move philemon to another monastery instead henri promoted him it was two weeks after the expulsion of friar murdo they were in the north transept of the cathedral the summer day was hot but the interior of the church was always cool the bishop sat on a carved wooden chair and the others on benches philemon caris archdeacon lloyd and canon claude im appointing you prior of kingsbridge henri said to philemon philemon smirked with delight and shot a triumphant look at caris she was appalled two weeks ago she had given henri a long list of sound reasons why philemon could not be permitted to continue in a responsible position here starting with his theft of a gold candlestick but it seemed her letter had had the opposite effect she opened her mouth to protest but henri glared at her and raised his hand and she decided to remain silent and find out what else he had to say he continued to address philemon im doing this despite not because of your behaviour since you returned here youve been a malicious troublemaker and if the church were not desperate for people i wouldnt promote you in a hundred years then why do it now caris wondered but we have to have a prior and it simply is not satisfactory for the prioress to play that role despite her undoubted ability caris would have preferred him to appoint thomas but thomas would have refused she knew he had been scarred by the bitter struggle over who was to succeed prior anthony twelve years ago and had sworn then never again to get involved in a priory election in fact the bishop might well have spoken to thomas without cariss knowledge and learned this however your appointment is fenced about with provisos henri said to philemon first you will not be confirmed in the role until kingsbridge has obtained its borough charter you are not capable of running the town and i wont put you in that position in the interim therefore mother caris will continue as acting prior and you will live in the monks dormitory the palace will be locked up if you misbehave in the waiting period i will rescind the appointment philemon looked angry and wounded by this but he kept his mouth shut tight he knew he had won and he was not going to argue about the conditions secondly you will have your own treasury but brother thomas is to be the treasurer and no money will be spent nor precious objects removed without his knowledge and consent furthermore i have ordered the building of a new tower and i have authorized payments according to a schedule prepared by merthin bridger the priory will make these payments from the monks funds and neither philemon nor anyone else shall have the power to alter this arrangement i dont want half a tower merthin would get his wish at least caris thought gratefully henri turned to caris i have one more command to issue and it is for you mother prioress now what she thought there has been an accusation of fornication caris stared at the bishop thinking about the time she had surprised him and claude naked how did he dare to raise this subject he went on i say nothing about the past but for the future it is not possible that the prioress of kingsbridge should have a relationship with a man she wanted to say but you live with your lover however she suddenly noticed the expression on henris face it was a pleading look he was begging her not to make the accusation that he well knew would show him up as a hypocrite he knew that what he was doing was unjust she realized but he had no choice philemon had forced him into this position she was tempted all the same to sting him with a rebuke but she restrained herself it would do no good henris back was to the wall and he was doing his best caris clamped her mouth shut henri said may i have your assurance mother prioress that from this moment on there will be absolutely no grounds for the accusation caris looked at the floor she had been here before once again her choice was to give up everything she had worked for the hospital the borough charter the tower or to part with merthin and once again she chose her work she raised her head and looked him in the eye yes my lord bishop she said you have my word she spoke to merthin in the hospital surrounded by other people she was trembling and close to tears but she could not see him in private she knew that if they were alone her resolve would weaken and she would throw her arms around him and tell him that she loved him and promise to leave the nunnery and marry him so she sent a message and greeted him at the door of the hospital then spoke to him in a matteroffact voice her arms folded tightly across her chest so that she would not be tempted to reach out with a fond gesture and touch the body she loved so much when she had finished telling him about the bishops ultimatum and her decision he looked at her as if he could kill her this is the last time he said what do you mean if you do this its permanent im not going to wait around any more hoping that one day you will be my wife she felt as if he had hit her he went on delivering another blow with each sentence if you mean what youre saying im going to try to forget you now im thirtythree years old i dont have for ever my father is dying at the age of fiftyeight ill marry someone else and have more children and be happy in my garden the picture he painted tortured her she bit her lip trying to control her grief but hot tears ran down her face he was remorseless im not going to waste my life loving you he said and she felt as if he had stabbed her leave the nunnery now or stay there for ever she tried to look steadily at him i wont forget you i will always love you but not enough she was silent for a long moment it wasnt like that she knew her love was not weak or inadequate it just presented her with impossible choices but there seemed no point in arguing is that what you really believe she said it seems obvious she nodded though she did not really agree im sorry she said more sorry than i have ever been in my whole life so am i he said and he turned away and walked out of the building sir gregory longfellow at last went back to london but he returned surprisingly quickly as if he had bounced off the wall of that great city like a football he showed up at tench hall at supper time looking harassed breathing hard through his flared nostrils his long grey hair matted with perspiration he walked in with something less than his usual air of being in command of all men and beasts that crossed his path ralph and alan were standing by a window looking at a new broadbladed style of dagger called a basilard without speaking gregory threw his tall figure into ralphs big carved chair whatever might have happened he was still too grand to wait for an invitation to sit ralph and alan stared at him expectantly ralphs mother sniffed censoriously she disliked bad manners finally gregory said the king does not like to be disobeyed that scared ralph he looked anxiously at gregory and asked himself what he had done that could possibly be interpreted as disobedient by the king he could think of nothing nervously he said im sorry his majesty is displeased i hope its not with me youre involved gregory said with annoying vagueness and so am i the king feels that when his wishes are frustrated it sets a bad precedent i quite agree that is why you and i are going to leave here tomorrow ride to earlscastle see the lady philippa and make her marry you so that was it ralph was mainly relieved he could not be held responsible for philippas recalcitrance in all fairness not that fairness made much difference to kings but reading between the lines he guessed that the person taking the blame was gregory and so gregory was now determined to rescue the kings plan and redeem himself there was fury and malice in gregorys expression he said by the time i have finished with her i promise you she will beg you to marry her ralph could not imagine how this was to be achieved as philippa herself had pointed out you could lead a woman up the aisle but you could not force her to say i do he said to gregory someone told me that a widows right to refuse remarriage is actually guaranteed by magna carta gregory gave him a malevolent look dont remind me i made the mistake of mentioning that to his majesty ralph wondered in that case what threats or promises gregory planned to use to bend philippa to his will himself he could think of no way to marry her short of abducting her by force and carrying her off to some isolated church where a generously bribed priest would turn a deaf ear to her cries of no never they set off early next morning with a small entourage it was harvest time and in the north field the men were reaping tall stalks of rye while the women followed behind binding the sheaves lately ralph had spent more time worrying about the harvest than about philippa this was not because of the weather which was fine but the plague he had too few tenants and almost no labourers many had been stolen from him by unscrupulous landlords such as prioress caris who seduced other lords men by offering high wages and attractive tenancies in desperation ralph had given some of his serfs free tenancies which meant they had no obligation to work on his land an arrangement that left ralph denuded of labour at harvest time in consequence it was likely that some of his crops would rot in the fields however he felt his troubles would be over if he could marry philippa he would have ten times the land he now controlled plus income from a dozen other sources including courts forests markets and mills and his family would be restored to its rightful place in the nobility sir gerald would be the father of an earl before he died he wondered again what gregory had in mind philippa had set herself a challenging task in defying the formidable will and powerful connections of gregory ralph would not have wished to be standing in her beaded silk shoes they arrived at earlscastle shortly before noon the sound of the rooks quarrelling on the battlements always reminded ralph of the time he had spent here as a squire in the service of earl roland the happiest days of his life he sometimes thought but the place was very quiet now without an earl there were no squires playing violent games in the lower compound no warhorses snorting and stamping as they were groomed and exercised outside the stables no menatarms throwing dice on the steps of the keep philippa was in the oldfashioned hall with odila and a handful of female attendants mother and daughter were working on a tapestry together sitting side by side on a bench in front of the loom the picture looked as if it would show a forest scene when finished philippa was weaving brown thread for the tree trunks and odila bright green for the leaves very nice but it needs more life ralph said making his voice cheerful and friendly a few birds and rabbits and maybe some dogs chasing a deer philippa was as immune to his charm as ever she stood up and stepped back away from him the girl did the same ralph noticed that mother and daughter were equal in height philippa said why have you come here have it your way ralph thought resentfully he half turned away from her sir gregory here has something to say to you he said and he went to a window and looked out as if bored gregory greeted the two women formally and said he hoped he was not intruding on them it was rubbish he did not give a hoot for their privacy but the courtesy seemed to mollify philippa who invited him to sit down then he said the king is annoyed with you countess philippa bowed her head i am very sorry indeed to have displeased his majesty he wishes to reward his loyal servant sir ralph by making him earl of shiring at the same time he will be providing a young vigorous husband for you and a good stepfather for your daughter philippa shuddered but gregory ignored that he is mystified by your stubborn defiance philippa looked scared as well she might things would have been different if she had had a brother or an uncle to stick up for her but the plague had wiped out her family as a woman without male relations she had no one to defend her from the kings wrath what will he do she said apprehensively he has not mentioned the word treason yet ralph was not sure philippa could legally be accused of treason but all the same the threat caused her to turn pale gregory went on he has asked me in the first instance to reason with you philippa said of course the king sees marriage as a political matter it is political gregory interrupted if your beautiful daughter here were to fancy herself in love with the charming son of a scullery maid you would say to her as i say to you that noblewomen may not marry whomever they fancy and you would lock her in her room and have the boy flogged outside her window until he renounced her for ever philippa looked affronted she did not like being lectured on the duties of her station by a mere lawyer i understand the obligations of an aristocratic widow she said haughtily i am a countess my grandmother was a countess and my sister was a countess until she died of the plague but marriage is not just politics it is also a matter of the heart we women throw ourselves on the mercy of the men who are our lords and masters and who have the duty of wisely deciding our fate and we beg that what we feel in our hearts be not entirely ignored such pleas are usually heard she was upset ralph could see but still in control still full of contempt that word wisely had a sarcastic sting in normal times perhaps you would be right but these are strange days gregory replied usually when the king looks around him for someone worthy of an earldom he sees a dozen wise strong vigorous men loyal to him and keen to serve him in any way they can any of whom he could appoint to the title with confidence but now that so many of the best men have been struck down by the plague the king is like a housewife who goes to the fishmonger at the end of the afternoon forced to take whatever is left on the slab ralph saw the force of the argument but also felt insulted however he pretended not to notice philippa changed her tack she waved a servant over and said bring us a jug of the best gascon wine please and sir gregory will be having dinner here so lets have some of this seasons lamb cooked with garlic and rosemary yes my lady gregory said youre most kind countess philippa was incapable of coquetry to pretend that she was simply being hospitable with no ulterior motive was beyond her she returned straight to the subject sir gregory i have to tell you that my heart my soul and my entire being revolt against the prospect of marrying sir ralph fitzgerald but why said gregory hes a man like any other no hes not she said they were speaking about ralph as if he were not there in a way that he found deeply offensive but philippa was desperate and would say anything and he was curious to know just what it was about him that she disliked so much she paused collecting her thoughts if i say rapist torturer murderer the words just seem too abstract ralph was taken aback he did not think of himself that way of course he had tortured people in the kings service and he had raped annet and he had murdered several men women and children in his days as an outlaw at least he consoled himself philippa did not appear to have guessed that he was the hooded figure who had killed tilly his own wife philippa went on human beings have within them something that prevents them from doing such things it is the ability no the compulsion to feel anothers pain we cant help it you sir gregory could not rape a woman because you would feel her grief and agony you would suffer with her and this would compel you to relent you could not torture or murder for the same reason one who lacks the faculty to feel anothers pain is not a man even though he may walk on two legs and speak english she leaned forward lowering her voice but even so ralph heard her clearly and i will not lie in bed with an animal ralph burst out i am not an animal he expected gregory to back him up instead gregory seemed to give in is that your final word lady philippa ralph was astonished was gregory going to let that pass as if it might be even half true philippa said to gregory i need you to go back to the king and tell him that i am his loyal and obedient subject and that i long to win his favour but that i could not marry ralph if the archangel gabriel commanded me i see gregory stood up we will not stay to dinner was that all ralph had been waiting for gregory to produce his surprise a secret weapon some irresistible bribe or threat did the clever court lawyer really have nothing up his costly brocade sleeve philippa seemed equally startled to find the argument so suddenly terminated gregory went to the door and ralph had no choice but to follow philippa and odila stared at the two of them unsure what to make of this cool walkout the ladiesinwaiting fell silent philippa said please beg the king to be merciful he will be my lady said gregory he has authorized me to tell you that in the light of your obstinacy he will not force you to marry a man you loathe thank you she said you have saved my life ralph opened his mouth to protest he had been promised he had committed sacrilege and murder for this reward surely it could not be taken from him now but gregory spoke first instead he said it is the kings command that ralph will marry your daughter he paused and pointed at the tall fifteenyearold girl standing beside her mother odila he said as if there were any need to emphasize who he was talking about philippa gasped and odila screamed gregory bowed good day to you both philippa cried wait gregory took no notice and went out stunned ralph followed gwenda was weary when she woke up it was harvest time and she was spending every hour of the long august days in the fields wulfric would swing the scythe tirelessly from sunrise to nightfall mowing down the corn gwendas job was to bundle the sheaves all day long she bent down and scooped up the mown stalks bent and scooped bent and scooped until her back seemed to burn with pain when it was too dark to see she staggered home and fell into bed leaving the family to feed themselves with whatever they could find in the cupboard wulfric woke at dawn and his movements penetrated gwendas deep slumber she struggled to her feet they all needed a good breakfast and she put cold mutton bread butter and strong beer on the table sam the tenyearold got up but davy who was only eight had to be shaken awake and pulled to his feet this holding was never farmed by one man and his wife gwenda said grumpily as they ate wulfric was irritatingly positive you and i got the harvest in on our own the year the bridge collapsed he said cheerfully i was twelve years younger then but youre more beautiful now she was in no mood for gallantry even when your father and brother were alive you took on hired labour at harvest time never mind its our land and we planted the crops so well benefit from the harvest instead of earning just a penny a day wages the more we work the more we get thats what you always wanted isnt it i always wanted to be independent and selfsufficient if thats what you mean she went to the door a west wind and a few clouds in the sky wulfric looked worried we need the rain to hold off for another two or three days i think it will come on boys time to go to the field you can eat walking along she was bundling the bread and meat into a sack for their dinner when nate reeve hobbled in through the door oh no she said not today weve almost got our harvest in the lord has a harvest to get in too said the bailiff nate was followed in by his tenyearold son jonathan known as jonno who immediately started making faces at sam gwenda said give us three more days on our own land dont bother to dispute with me about this nate said you owe the lord one day a week and two days at harvest time today and tomorrow you will reap his barley in brookfield the second day is normally forgiven thats been the practice for a long time it was in times of plentiful labour the lord is desperate now so many people have negotiated free tenancies that he has hardly anyone to bring in his harvest so those who negotiated with you and demanded to be freed of their customary duties are rewarded while people like us who accepted the old terms are punished with twice as much work on the lords land she looked accusingly at wulfric remembering how he had ignored her when she told him to argue terms with nate something like that nate said carelessly hell gwenda said dont curse said nate youll get a free dinner there will be wheat bread and a new barrel of ale isnt that something to look forward to sir ralph feeds oats to the horses he means to ride hard dont be long now nate went out his son jonno poked out his tongue at sam sam made a grab for him but jonno slipped out of his grasp and ran after his father wearily gwenda and her family trudged across the fields to where ralphs barley stood waving in the breeze they got down to work wulfric reaped and gwenda bundled sam followed behind picking up the stray stalks she missed gathering them until he had enough for a sheaf then passing them to her to be tied david had small nimble fingers and he plaited straws into tough cords for tying the sheaves those other families still working under oldstyle tenancies laboured alongside them while the cleverer serfs reaped their own crops when the sun was at its highest nate drove up in a cart with a barrel on the back true to his word he provided each family with a big loaf of delicious new wheat bread everyone ate their fill then the adults lay down in the shade to rest while the children played gwenda was dozing off when she heard an outbreak of childish screaming she knew immediately from the voice that neither of her boys was making the noise but all the same she leaped to her feet she saw her son sam fighting with jonno reeve although they were roughly the same age and size sam had jonno on the ground and was punching and kicking him mercilessly gwenda moved towards the boys but wulfric was quicker and he grabbed sam with one hand and hauled him off gwenda looked at jonno in dismay the boy was bleeding from his nose and mouth and his face around one eye was inflamed and already beginning to swell he was holding his stomach moaning and crying gwenda had seen plenty of scraps between boys but this was different jonno had been beaten up gwenda stared at her tenyearold son his face was unmarked it looked as if jonno had not landed a single blow sam showed no sign of remorse at what he had done rather he looked smugly triumphant it was a vaguely familiar expression and gwenda searched her memory for its likeness she did not take long to recall who she had seen looking like that after giving someone a beating she had seen the same expression on the face of ralph fitzgerald sams real father two days after ralph and gregory visited earlscastle lady philippa came to tench hall ralph had been considering the prospect of marrying odila she was a beautiful young girl but you could buy beautiful young girls for a few pennies in london ralph had already had the experience of being married to someone who was little more than a child after the initial excitement wore off he had been bored and irritated by her he wondered for a while whether he might marry odila and get philippa too the idea of marrying the daughter and keeping the mother as his mistress intrigued him he might even have them together he had once had sex with a motherdaughter pair of prostitutes in calais and the element of incest had created an exciting sense of depravity but on reflection he knew that was not going to happen philippa would never consent to such an arrangement he might look for ways to coerce her but she was not easily bullied i dont want to marry odila he had said to gregory as they rode home from earlscastle you wont have to gregory had said but he refused to elaborate philippa arrived with a ladyinwaiting and a bodyguard but without odila as she entered tench hall for once she did not look proud she did not even look beautiful ralph thought clearly she had not slept for two nights they had just sat down to dinner ralph alan gregory a handful of squires and a bailiff philippa was the only woman in the room she walked up to gregory the courtesy he had shown her previously was forgotten he did not stand but rudely looked her up and down as if she were a servant girl with a grievance well he said at last i will marry ralph oh he said in mock surprise will you now yes rather than sacrifice my daughter to him i will marry him myself my lady he said sarcastically you seem to think that the king has led you to a table laden with dishes and asked you to choose which you like best you are mistaken the king does not ask what is your pleasure he commands you disobeyed one command so he issued another he did not give you a choice she looked down i am very sorry for my behaviour please spare my daughter if it were up to me i would decline your request as punishment for your intransigence but perhaps you should plead with sir ralph she looked at ralph he saw rage and despair in her eyes he felt excited she was the most haughty woman he had ever met and he had broken her pride he wanted to lie with her now right away but it was not yet over he said you have something to say to me i apologize come here ralph was sitting at the head of the table and she approached and stood by him he caressed the head of a lion carved into the arm of his chair go on he said i am sorry that i spurned you before i would like to withdraw everything i said i accept your proposal i will marry you but i have not renewed my proposal the king orders me to many odila if you ask the king to revert to his original plan surely he will grant your plea and that is what you are asking me to do yes she looked him in the eye and swallowed her final humiliation i am asking you i am begging you please sir ralph make me your wife ralph stood up pushing his chair back kiss me then she closed her eyes he put his left arm around her shoulders and pulled her to him he kissed her lips she submitted unresponsively with his right hand he squeezed her breast it was as firm and heavy as he had always imagined he ran his hand down her body and between her legs she flinched but remained unresistingly in his embrace and he pressed his palm against the fork of her thighs he grasped her mound cupping its triangular fatness in his hand then holding that position he broke the kiss and looked around the room at his friends at the same time as ralph was created earl of shiring a young man called david caerleon became earl of monmouth he was only seventeen and related rather distantly to the dead man but all nearer heirs to the title had been wiped out by the plague a few days before christmas that year bishop henri held a service in kingsbridge cathedral to bless the two new earls afterwards david and ralph were guests of honour at a banquet given by merthin in the guild hall the merchants were also celebrating the granting of a borough charter to kingsbridge ralph considered david to have been extraordinarily lucky the boy had never been outside the kingdom nor had he ever fought in battle yet he was an earl at seventeen ralph had marched all through normandy with king edward risked his life in battle after battle lost three fingers and committed countless sins in the kings service yet he had had to wait until the age of thirtytwo however he had made it at last and sat next to bishop henri at the table wearing a costly brocade coat woven with gold and silver threads people who knew him pointed him out to strangers wealthy merchants made way for him and bowed their heads respectfully as he passed and the maidservants hand shook with nervousness as she poured wine into his cup his father sir gerald confined to bed now but hanging on tenaciously to life had said im the descendant of an earl and the father of an earl im satisfied it was all profoundly gratifying ralph was keen to talk to david about the problem of labourers it had eased temporarily now that the harvest was in and the autumn ploughing was finished at this time of year the days were short and the weather was cold so not much work could be done in the fields unfortunately as soon as the spring ploughing began and the ground was soft enough for the serfs to sow seeds the trouble would start again labourers would recommence agitating for higher wages and if refused would illegally run off to more extravagant employers the only way to stop this was for the nobility collectively to stand firm resist demands for higher pay and refuse to hire runaways this was what ralph wanted to say to david however the new earl of monmouth showed no inclination to talk to ralph he was more interested in ralphs stepdaughter odila who was near his own age they had met before ralph gathered philippa and her first husband william had often been guests at the castle when david had been a squire in the service of the old earl whatever their history they were friends now david was talking animatedly and odila was hanging on every word agreeing with his opinions gasping at his stories and laughing at his jokes ralph had always envied men who could fascinate women his brother had the ability and consequently was able to attract the most beautiful women despite being a short plain man with red hair all the same ralph felt sorry for merthin ever since the day that earl roland had made ralph a squire and condemned merthin to be a carpenters apprentice merthin had been doomed even though he was the elder it was ralph who was destined to become the earl merthin now sitting on the other side of earl david had to console himself with being a mere alderman and having charm ralph could not even charm his own wife she hardly spoke to him she had more to say to his dog how was it possible ralph asked himself for a man to want something as badly as he had wanted philippa and then to be so dissatisfied when he got it he had yearned for her since he was a squire of nineteen now after three months of marriage he wished with all his heart that he could get rid of her yet it was hard for him to complain philippa did everything a wife was obliged to do she ran the castle efficiently as she had been doing ever since her first husband had been made earl after the battle of crécy supplies were ordered bills were paid clothes were sewn fires were lit and food and wine arrived on the table unfailingly and she submitted to ralphs sexual attentions he could do anything he liked tear her clothes thrust his fingers ungently inside her take her standing up or from behind she never complained but she did not reciprocate his caresses her lips never moved against his her tongue never slipped into his mouth she never stroked his skin she kept a vial of almond oil handy and lubricated her unresponsive body with it whenever he wanted sex she lay as still as a corpse while he grunted on top of her the moment he rolled off she went to wash herself the only good thing about the marriage was that odila was fond of little gerry the baby brought out her nascent maternal instinct she loved to talk to him sing him songs and rock him to sleep she gave him the kind of affectionate mothering he would never really get from a paid nurse all the same ralph was regretful philippas voluptuous body which he had stared at with longing for so many years was now revolting to him he had not touched her for weeks and he probably never would again he looked at her heavy breasts and round hips and wished for the slender limbs and girlish skin of tilly tilly whom he had stabbed with a long sharp knife that went up under her ribs and into her beating heart that was a sin he did not dare to confess how long he wondered wretchedly would he suffer for it in purgatory the bishop and his colleagues were staying in the priors palace and the monmouth entourage filled the priorys guest rooms so ralph and philippa and their servants were lodging at an inn ralph had chosen the bell the rebuilt tavern owned by his brother it was the only threestorey house in kingsbridge with a big open room at ground level male and female dormitories above and a top floor with six expensive individual guest rooms when the banquet was over ralph and his men removed to the tavern where they installed themselves in front of the fire called for more wine and began to play at dice philippa remained behind talking to caris and chaperoning odila with earl david ralph and his companions attracted a crowd of admiring young men and women such as always gathered around freespending noblemen ralph gradually forgot his troubles in the euphoria of drink and the thrill of gambling he noticed a young fairhaired woman watching him with a yearning expression as he cheerfully lost stacks of silver pennies on the throw of the dice he beckoned her to sit beside him on the bench and she told him her name was ella at moments of tension she grabbed his thigh as if captured by the suspense though she probably knew exactly what she was doing women usually did he gradually lost interest in the game and transferred his attention to her his men carried on betting while he got to know ella she was everything philippa was not happy sexy and fascinated by ralph she touched him and herself a lot she would push her hair off her face then pat his arm then hold her hand to her throat then push his shoulder playfully she seemed very interested in his experiences in france to ralphs annoyance merthin came into the tavern and sat down with him merthin was not running the bell himself he had rented it to the youngest daughter of betty baxter but he was keen that the tenant should make a success of it and he asked ralph if everything was to his satisfaction ralph introduced his companion and merthin said yes i know ella in a dismissive tone that was uncharacteristically discourteous today was only the third or fourth time the two brothers had met since the death of tilly on previous occasions such as ralphs wedding to philippa there had hardly been time to talk all the same ralph knew from the way his brother looked at him that merthin suspected him of being tillys killer the unspoken thought was a looming presence never addressed but impossible to ignore like the cow in the cramped oneroom hovel of a poor peasant if it was mentioned ralph felt that would be the last time they ever spoke so tonight as if by mutual consent they once again exchanged a few meaningless platitudes then merthin left saying he had work to do ralph wondered briefly what work he was going to do at dusk on a december evening he really had no idea how merthin spent his time he did not hunt or hold court or attend on the king was it possible to spend all day every day making drawings and supervising builders such a life would have driven ralph mad and he was baffled by how much money merthin seemed to make from his enterprises ralph himself had been short of money even when he had been lord of tench merthin never seemed to lack it ralph turned his attention back to ella my brothers a bit grumpy he said apologetically its because he hasnt had a woman for half a year she giggled he used to shag the prioress but she had to throw him out after philemon came back ralph pretended to be shocked nuns arent supposed to be shagged mother caris is a wonderful woman but shes got the itch you can tell by the way she walks ralph was aroused by such frank talk from a woman its very bad for a man he said playing along to go for so long without a woman i think so too it leads to swelling she put her head on one side and raised her eyebrows he glanced down at his own lap she followed his gaze oh dear she said that looks uncomfortable she put her hand on his erect penis at that moment philippa appeared ralph froze he felt guilty and scared and at the same time he was furious with himself for caring whether philippa saw what he was doing or not she said im going upstairs oh ella did not release her hold in fact she squeezed ralphs penis gently while looking up at philippa and smiling triumphantly philippa flushed red her face registering shame and distaste ralph opened his mouth to speak then did not know what to say he was not willing to apologize to his virago of a wife feeling that she had brought this humiliation on herself but he also felt somewhat foolish sitting there with a tavern tart holding his prick while his wife the countess stood in front of them looking embarrassed the tableau lasted only a moment ralph made a strangled sound ella giggled and philippa said oh in a tone of exasperation and disgust then philippa turned and walked away head held unnaturally high she approached the broad staircase and went up as graceful as a deer on a hillside and disappeared without looking back ralph felt both angry and ashamed though he reasoned that he had no need to feel either however his interest in ella diminished visibly and he took her hand away have some more wine she said pouring from the jug on the table but ralph felt the onset of a headache and pushed the wooden cup away ella put a restraining hand on his arm and said in a low warm voice dont leave me in the lurch now that youve got me all you know excited he shook her off and stood up her face hardened and she said well youd better give me something by way of compensation he dipped into his purse and took out a handful of silver pennies without looking at ella he dumped the money on the table not caring whether it was too much or too little she began to scoop up the coins hastily ralph left her and went upstairs philippa was on the bed sitting upright with her back against the headboard she had taken off her shoes but was otherwise fully dressed she stared accusingly at ralph as he walked in he said you have no right to be angry with me im not angry she said but you are she could always twist words around so that she was in the right and he in the wrong before he could think of a reply she said wouldnt you like me to leave you he stared at her astonished this was the last thing he had expected where would you go here she said i wont become a nun but i could live in the convent nevertheless i would bring just a few servants a maid a clerk and my confessor ive already spoken to mother caris and she is willing my last wife did that what will people think a lot of noblewomen retire to nunneries either temporarily or permanently at some point in their lives people will think youve rejected me because im past the age for conceiving children which i probably am anyway do you care what people say the thought briefly flashed across his mind that he would be sorry to see gerry lose odila but the prospect of being free of philippas proud disapproving presence was irresistible all right whats stopping you tilly never asked permission i want to see odila married first who to she looked at him as if he were stupid oh he said young david i suppose he is in love with her and i think they would be well suited hes under age hell have to ask the king thats why ive raised it with you will you go with him to see the king and speak in support of the marriage if you do this for me i swear i will never ask you for anything ever again i will leave you in peace she was not asking him to make any sacrifices an alliance with monmouth could do ralph nothing but good and youll leave earlscastle and move into the nunnery yes as soon as odila is married it was the end of a dream ralph realized but a dream that had turned into a sour bleak reality he might as well acknowledge the failure and start again all right he said feeling regret mingled with liberation its a bargain easter came early in the year and there was a big fire blazing in merthins hearth on the evening of good friday the table was laid with a cold supper smoked fish soft cheese new bread pears and a flagon of rhenish wine merthin was wearing clean underclothes and a new yellow robe the house had been swept and there were daffodils in a jug on the sideboard merthin was alone lolla was with his servants arn and em their cottage was at the end of the garden but lolla who was five loved to stay there overnight she called it going on pilgrimage and took a travelling bag containing her hair brush and a favourite doll merthin opened a window and looked out a cold breeze blew across the river from the meadow on the south side the last of the evening was fading the light seeming to fall out of the sky and sink into the water where it disappeared in the blackness he visualized a hooded figure emerging from the nunnery he saw it tread a worn diagonal across the cathedral green hurry past the lights of the bell and descend the muddy main street the face shadowed speaking to no one he imagined it reaching the foreshore did it glance sideways into the cold black river and remember a moment of despair so great as to give rise to thoughts of selfdestruction if so the recollection was quickly dismissed and it stepped forward on to the cobbled roadbed of his bridge it crossed the span and made landfall again on leper island there it diverted from the main road and passed through low shrubbery across scrubby grass cropped by rabbits and around the ruins of the old lazar house until it came to the southwest shore then it tapped on merthins door he closed the window and waited no tap came he was wishfully a little ahead of schedule he was tempted to drink some wine but he did not a ritual had developed and he did not want to change the order of events the knock came a few moments later he opened the door she stepped inside threw back her hood and dropped the heavy grey cloak from her shoulders she was taller than he by an inch or more and a few years older her face was proud and could be haughty although now her smile radiated warmth like the sun she wore a robe of bright kingsbridge scarlet he put his arms around her pressing her voluptuous body to his own and kissed her wide mouth my darling he said philippa they made love immediately there on the floor hardly undressing he was hungry for her and she was if anything more eager he spread her cloak on the straw and she lifted the skirt of her robe and lay down she clung to him like one drowning her legs wrapped around his her arms crushing him to her soft body her face buried in his neck she had told him that after she left ralph and moved into the priory she had thought no one would ever touch her again until the nuns laid out her cold body for burial the thought almost made merthin cry for his part he had loved caris so much that he felt no other woman would ever arouse his affection for him as well as philippa this love had come as an unexpected gift a spring of cold water bubbling up in a bakinghot desert and they both drank from it as if they were dying of thirst afterwards they lay entwined by the fire panting and he recalled the first time soon after she moved to the priory she had taken an interest in the building of the new tower a practical woman she had trouble filling the long hours that were supposed to be spent in prayer and meditation she enjoyed the library but could not read all day she came to see him in the masons loft and he showed her the plans she quickly got into the habit of visiting every day talking to him while he worked he had always admired her intelligence and strength and in the intimacy of the loft he came to know the warm generous spirit beneath her stately manner he discovered that she had a lively sense of humour and he learned how to make her laugh she responded with a rich throaty chuckle that somehow led him to think of making love to her one day she had paid him a compliment youre a kind man she had said there arent enough of them her sincerity had touched him and he had kissed her hand it was a gesture of affection but one she could reject if she wished without drama she simply had to withdraw her hand and take a step back and he would have known he had gone a little too far but she had not rejected it on the contrary she had held his hand and looked at him with something like love in her eyes and he had wrapped his arms around her and kissed her lips they had made love on the mattress in the loft and he had not remembered until afterwards that caris had encouraged him to put the mattress there with a joke about masons needing a soft place for their tools caris did not know about him and philippa no one did except philippas maid and am and em she went to bed in her private room on the upper floor of the hospital soon after nightfall at the same time as the nuns retired to their dormitory she slipped out while they were asleep using the outside steps that permitted important guests to come and go without passing through the common peoples quarters she returned by the same route before dawn while the nuns were singing matins and appeared at breakfast as if she had been in her room all night he was surprised to find that he could love another woman less than a year after caris had left him for the final time he certainly had not forgotten caris on the contrary he thought about her every day he felt the urge to tell her about something amusing that had happened or he wanted her opinion on a knotty problem or he found himself performing some task the way she would want it done such as carefully bathing lollas grazed knee with warm wine and then he saw her most days the new hospital was almost finished but the cathedral tower was barely begun and caris kept a close eye on both building projects the priory had lost its power to control the town merchants but nevertheless caris took an interest in the work merthin and the guild were doing to create all the institutions of a borough establishing new courts planning a wool exchange and encouraging the craft guilds to codify standards and measures but his thoughts about her always had an unpleasant aftertaste like the bitterness left at the back of the throat by sour beer he had loved her totally and she had in the end rejected him it was like remembering a happy day that had ended with a fight do you think im peculiarly attracted to women who arent free he said idly to philippa no why it does seem odd that after twelve years of loving a nun and nine months of celibacy i should fall for my brothers wife dont call me that she said quickly it was no marriage i was wedded against my will i shared his bed for no more than a few days and he will be happy if he never sees me again he patted her shoulder apologetically but still we have to be secretive just as i did with caris what he was not saying was that a man was entitled by law to kill his wife if he caught her committing adultery merthin had never known it happen certainly among the nobility but ralphs pride was a terrible thing merthin knew and had told philippa that ralph had killed his first wife tilly she said your father loved your mother hopelessly for a long time didnt he so he did merthin had almost forgotten that old story and you fell for a nun and my brother spent years pining for you the happily married wife of a nobleman as the priests say the sins of the fathers are visited upon the sons but enough of this do you want some supper in a moment theres something you want to do first you know he did know he knelt between her legs and kissed her belly and her thighs it was a peculiarity of hers that she always wanted to come twice he began to tease her with his tongue she groaned and pressed the back of his head yes she said you know how i like that especially when im full of your seed he lifted his head i do he said then he bent again to his task the spring brought a respite in the plague people were still dying but fewer were falling ill on easter sunday bishop henri announced that the fleece fair would take place as usual this year at the same service six novices took their vows and so became fullfledged monks they had all had an extraordinarily short novitiate but henri was keen to raise the number of monks at kingsbridge and he said the same thing was going on all over the country in addition five priests were ordained they too benefiting from an accelerated training programme and sent to replace plague victims in the surrounding countryside and two kingsbridge monks came down from university having received their degrees as physicians in three years instead of the usual five or seven the new doctors were austin and sime caris remembered both of them rather vaguely she had been guest master when they left three years ago to go to kingsbridge college in oxford on the afternoon of easter monday she showed them around the almostcompleted new hospital no builders were at work as it was a holiday both had the bumptious selfconfidence that the university seemed to instil in its graduates along with medical theories and a taste for gascon wine however years of dealing with patients had given caris a confidence of her own and she described the hospitals facilities and the way she planned to run it with brisk assurance austin was a slim intense young man with thinning fair hair he was impressed with the innovative new cloisterlike layout of the rooms sime a little older and roundfaced did not seem eager to learn from cariss experience she noticed that he always looked away when she was talking i believe a hospital should always be clean she said on what grounds sime inquired in a condescending tone as if asking a little girl why dolly had to be spanked cleanliness is a virtue ah so it has nothing to do with the balance of humours in the body i have no idea we dont pay too much attention to the humours that approach has failed spectacularly against the plague and sweeping the floor has succeeded at a minimum a clean room lifts patients spirits austin put in you must admit sime that some of the masters at oxford share the mother prioresss new ideas a small group of the heterodox caris said the main point is to take patients suffering from the type of illnesses that are transmitted from the sick to the well and isolate them from the rest to what end said sime to restrict the spread of such diseases and how is it that they are transmitted no one knows a little smile of triumph twitched simes mouth then how do you know by what means to restrict their spread may i ask he thought he had trumped her in argument it was the main thing they learned at oxford but she knew better from experience she said a shepherd doesnt understand the miracle by which lambs grow in the womb of a ewe but he knows it wont happen if he keeps the ram out of the field hm caris disliked the way he said hm he was clever she thought but his cleverness never touched the world she was struck by the contrast between this kind of intellectual and merthins kind merthins learning was wide and the power of his mind to grasp complexities was remarkable but his wisdom never strayed far from the realities of the material world for he knew that if he went wrong his buildings would fall down her father edmund had been like that clever but practical sime like godwyn and anthony would cling to his faith in the humours of the body regardless of whether his patients lived or died austin was smiling broadly shes got you there sime he said evidently amused that his smug friend had failed to overwhelm this uneducated woman we may not know exactly how illnesses spread but it cant do any harm to separate the sick from the well sister joan the nuns treasurer interrupted their conversation the bailiff of outhenby is asking for you mother caris did he bring a herd of calves outhenby was obliged to supply the nuns with twelve oneyearold calves every easter yes pen the beasts and ask the bailiff to come here please sime and austin took their leave and caris went to inspect the tiled floor in the latrines the bailiff found her there it was harry ploughman she had sacked the old bailiff who was too slow to respond to change and she had promoted the brightest young man in the village he shook her hand which was overfamiliar of him but caris liked him and did not mind she said it must be a nuisance your having to drive a herd all the way here especially when the spring ploughing is under way it is that he said like most ploughmen he was broadshouldered and strongarmed strength as well as skill was required for driving the communal eightox team as they pulled the heavy plough through wet clay soil he seemed to carry with him the air of the healthy outdoors wouldnt you rather make a money payment caris said most manorial dues are paid in cash these days it would be more convenient his eyes narrowed with peasant shrewdness but how much a yearold calf normally fetches ten to twelve shillings at market though prices are down this season they are by half you can buy twelve calves for three pounds or six pounds in a good year he grinned enjoying the negotiation theres your problem but you would prefer to pay cash if we can agree the amount make it eight shillings but then if the price of a calf is only five shillings where do we villagers get the extra money i tell you what in future outhenby can pay the nunnery either five pounds or twelve calves the choice is yours harry considered that looking for snags but could find none all right he said shall we seal the bargain how should we do that to her surprise he kissed her he held her slender shoulders in his rough hands bent his head and pressed his lips to hers if brother sime had done this she would have recoiled but harry was different and perhaps she had been titillated by his air of vigorous masculinity whatever the reason she submitted to the kiss letting him pull her unresisting body to his own and moving her lips against his bearded mouth he pressed up against her so that she could feel his erection she realized that he would cheerfully take her here on the newly laid tiles of the latrine floor and that thought brought her to her senses she broke the kiss and pushed him away stop she said what do you think youre doing he was unabashed kissing you my dear he said she realized that she had a problem no doubt gossip about her and merthin was widespread they were probably the two bestknown people in shiring while harry surely did not know the truth the rumours had been enough to embolden him this kind of thing could undermine her authority she must squash it now you must never do anything like that again she said as severely as she could you seemed to like it then your sin is all the greater for you have tempted a weak woman to perjure her holy vows but i love you it was true she realized and she could guess why she had swept into his village reorganized everything and bent the peasants to her will she had recognized harrys potential and elevated him above his fellows he must think of her as a goddess it was not surprising that he had fallen in love with her he had better fall out of love as soon as possible if you ever speak to me like that again ill have to get another bailiff in outhenby oh he said that stopped him short more effectively than the accusation of sin now go home very well mother caris and find yourself another woman preferably one who has not taken a vow of chastity never he said but she did not believe him he left but she stayed where she was she felt restless and lustful if she could have felt sure of being alone for a while she would have touched herself this was the first time in nine months that she had been bothered by physical desire after finally splitting up with merthin she had fallen into a kind of neutered state in which she did not think about sex her relationships with other nuns gave her warmth and affection she was fond of both joan and oonagh though neither loved her in the physical way mair had her heart beat with other passions the new hospital the tower and the rebirth of the town thinking of the tower she left the hospital and walked across the green to the cathedral merthin had dug four enormous holes the deepest anyone had ever seen outside the church around the foundations of the old tower he had built great cranes to lift the earth out throughout the wet autumn months oxcarts had lumbered all day long down the main street and across the first span of the bridge to dump the mud on rocky leper island there they had picked up building stones from merthins wharf then climbed the street again to stack the stones around the grounds of the church in evergrowing piles as soon as the winter frost was over his masons had begun laying the foundations caris went to the north side of the cathedral and looked into the hole in the angle formed by the outside wall of the nave and the outside wall of the north transept it was dizzyingly deep the bottom was already covered with neat masonry the squaredoff stones laid in straight lines and joined by thin layers of mortar because the old foundations were inadequate the tower was being built on its own new independent foundations it would rise outside the existing walls of the church so no demolition would be needed over and above what elfric had already done in taking down the upper levels of the old tower only when it was finished would merthin remove the temporary roof elfric had built over the crossing it was a typical merthin design simple yet radical a brilliant solution to the unique problems of the site as at the hospital no builders were at work on easter monday but she saw movement in the hole and realized someone was walking around on the foundations a moment later she recognized merthin she went to one of the surprisingly flimsy ropeandbranch ladders the masons used and clambered shakily down she was glad to reach the bottom merthin helped her off the ladder smiling you look a little pale he said its a long way down how are you getting on fine it will take many years why the hospital seems more complicated and thats finished two reasons the higher we go the fewer masons will be able to work on it right now ive got twelve men laying the foundations but as it rises it will get narrower and there just wont be room for them all the other reason is that mortar takes so long to set we have to let it harden over a winter before we put too much weight on it she was hardly listening watching his face she was remembering making love to him in the priors palace between matins and lauds with the first gleam of daylight coming in through the open window and falling over their naked bodies like a blessing she patted his arm well the hospital isnt taking so long you should be able to move in by whitsun im glad although were having a slight respite from the plague fewer people are dying thank god he said fervently perhaps it may be coming to an end she shook her head bleakly we thought it was over once before remember about this time last year then it came back worse heaven forbid she touched his cheek with her palm feeling his wiry beard at least youre safe he looked faintly displeased as soon as the hospital is finished we can start on the wool exchange i hope youre right to think that business must pick up soon if it doesnt well all be dead anyway dont say that she kissed his cheek we have to act on the assumption that were going to live he said it irritably as if she had annoyed him but the truth is that we dont know lets not think about the worst she put her arms around his waist and hugged him pressing her breasts against his thin body feeling his hard bones against her yielding flesh he pushed her away violently she stumbled backwards and almost fell dont do that he shouted she was as shocked as if he had slapped her whats the matter stop touching me i only just dont do it you ended our relationship nine months ago i said it was the last time and i meant it she could not understand his anger but i only hugged you well dont im not your lover you have no right i have no right to touch you no i didnt think i needed some kind of permission of course you knew you dont let people touch you youre not people were not strangers but as she said these things she knew she was wrong and he was right she had rejected him but she had not accepted the consequences the encounter with harry from outhenby had fired her lust and she had come to merthin looking for release she had told herself she was touching him in affectionate friendship but that was a lie she had treated him as if he were still available to her as a rich and idle lady might put down a book and pick it up again having denied him the right to touch her all this time it was wrong of her to try to reinstate the privilege just because a muscular young ploughman had kissed her all the same she would have expected merthin to point this out in a gentle and affectionate way but he had been hostile and brutal had she thrown away his friendship as well as his love tears came to her eyes she turned away from him and went back to the ladder she found it hard to climb up it was tiring and she seemed to have lost her energy she stopped for a rest and looked down merthin was standing on the bottom of the ladder steadying it with his weight when she was almost at the top she looked down again he was still there it occurred to her that her unhappiness would be over if she fell it was a long drop to those unforgiving stones she would die instantly merthin seemed to sense what she was thinking for he gave an impatient wave indicating that she should hurry up and get off the ladder she thought of how devastated he would be if she killed herself and for a moment she enjoyed imagining his misery and guilt she felt sure god would not punish her in the afterlife if there was an afterlife then she climbed the last few rungs and stood on solid ground how foolish she had been just for a moment she was not going to end her life she had too much to do she returned to the nunnery it was time for evensong and she led the procession into the cathedral as a young novice she had resented the time wasted in services in fact mother cecilia had taken care to give her work that permitted her to be excused for much of the time now she welcomed the chance to rest and reflect this afternoon had been a low moment she decided but she would recover all the same she found herself fighting back tears as she sang the psalms for supper the nuns had smoked eel chewy and strongly flavoured it was not cariss favourite dish tonight she was not hungry anyway she ate some bread after the meal she retired to her pharmacy two novices were there copying out cariss book she had finished it soon after christmas many people had asked for copies apothecaries prioresses barbers even one or two physicians copying the book had become part of the training of nuns who wanted to work in the hospital the copies were cheap the book was short and there were no elaborate drawings or costly inks and the demand seemed neverending three people made the room feel crowded caris was looking forward to the space and light of the pharmacy in the new hospital she wanted to be alone so she sent the novices away however she was not destined to get her wish a few moments later lady philippa came in caris had never warmed to the reserved countess but sympathized with her plight and was glad to give sanctuary to any woman fleeing from a husband such as ralph philippa was an easy guest making few demands spending a lot of time in her room she had only a limited interest in sharing the nuns life of prayer and selfdenial but caris of all people could understand that caris invited her to sit on a stool at the bench philippa was a remarkably direct woman despite her courtly manners without preamble she said i want you to leave merthin alone what caris was astonished and offended of course you have to talk to him but you should not kiss or touch him how dare you what did philippa know and why did she care hes not your lover any more stop bothering him merthin must have told her about their quarrel this afternoon but why would he tell you before the question was out of her mouth she guessed the answer philippa confirmed it with her next utterance hes not yours now hes mine oh my soul caris was flabbergasted you and merthin yes are you have you actually yes i had no idea she felt betrayed though she knew she had no right when had this happened but how where you dont need to know the details of course not at his house on leper island she supposed at night probably how long it doesnt matter caris could work it out philippa had been here less than a month you moved fast it was an unworthy jibe and philippa had the grace to ignore it he would have done anything to keep you but you threw him over now let him go its been difficult for him to love anyone else after you but he has managed it dont you dare interfere caris wanted to rebuff her furiously tell her angrily that she had no right to give orders and make moral demands but the trouble was that philippa was in the right caris had to let merthin go for ever she did not want to show her heartbreak in front of philippa would you leave me now please she said with an attempt at philippas style of dignity i would like to be alone philippa was not easily pushed around will you do as i say she persisted caris did not like to be cornered but she had no spirit left yes of course she said thank you philippa left when she was sure philippa was out of earshot caris began to cry philemon as prior was no better than godwyn he was overwhelmed by the challenge of managing the assets of the priory caris had made a list during her spell as acting prior of the monks main sources of income rents a share of profits from commerce and industry tithing agricultural profits on land not rented out profits from grain mills and other industrial mills waterway tolls and a share of all fish landed stallage in markets proceeds of justice fees and fines from courts pious gifts from pilgrims and others sale of books holy water candles etc she had given the list to philemon and he had thrown it back at her as if insulted godwyn better than philemon only in that he had a certain superficial charm would have thanked her and quietly ignored her list in the nunnery she had introduced a new method of keeping accounts one she had learned from buonaventura caroli when she was working for her father the old method was simply to write in a parchment roll a short note of every transaction so that you could always go back and check the italian system was to record income on the lefthand side and expenditure on the right and add them up at the foot of the page the difference between the two totals showed whether the institution was gaining or losing money sister joan had taken this up with enthusiasm but when she offered to explain it to philemon he refused curtly he regarded offers of help as insults to his competence he had only one talent and it was the same as godwyns a flair for manipulating people he had shrewdly weeded the new intake of monks sending the modernminded physician brother austin and two other bright young men to stjohnintheforest where they would be too far away to challenge his authority but philemon was the bishops problem now henri had appointed him and henri would have to deal with him the town was independent and caris had her new hospital the hospital was to be consecrated by the bishop on whit sunday which was always seven weeks after easter a few days beforehand caris moved her equipment and supplies into the new pharmacy there was plenty of room for two people to work at the bench preparing medicines and a third to sit at a writing desk caris was preparing an emetic oonagh was grinding dried herbs and a novice greta was copying out cariss book when a novice monk came in with a small wooden chest it was josiah a teenage boy usually called joshie he was embarrassed to be in the presence of three women where shall i put this he said caris looked at him what is it a chest i can see that she said patiently the fact that someone was capable of learning to read and write did not unfortunately make him intelligent what does the chest contain books and why have you brought me a chest of books i was told to realising after a moment that this answer was insufficiently informative he added by brother sime caris raised her eyebrows is sime making me a gift of books she opened the chest joshie made his escape without answering the question the books were medical texts all in latin caris looked through them they were the classics avicennas poem on medicine hippocrates diet and hygiene galens on the parts of medicine and de urinis by isaac judaeus all had been written more than three hundred years ago joshie reappeared with another chest what now said caris medical instruments brother sime says you are not to touch them he will come and put them in their proper places caris was dismayed sime wants to keep his books and instruments here is he planning to work here joshie did not know anything about simes intentions of course before caris could say any more sime appeared accompanied by philemon sime looked around the room then without explanation began unpacking his things he moved some of cariss vessels from a shelf and replaced them with his books he took out sharp knives for opening veins and the teardropshaped glass flasks used for examining urine samples caris said neutrally are you planning to spend a great deal of time here in the hospital brother sime philemon answered for him clearly having anticipated the question with relish where else he said his tone was indignant as if caris had challenged him already this is the hospital is it not and sime is the only physician in the priory how shall people be treated if not by him suddenly the pharmacy did not seem so spacious any more before caris could say anything a stranger appeared brother thomas told me to come here he said i am jonas powderer from london the visitor was a man of about fifty dressed in an embroidered coat and a fur hat caris noted his ready smile and affable manner and guessed that he made his living by selling things he shook hands then looked around the room nodding with apparent approval at cariss neat rows of labelled jars and vials remarkable he said i have never seen such a sophisticated pharmacy outside london are you a physician sir philemon asked his tone was cautious he was not sure of jonass status apothecary i have a shop in smithfield next to st bartholomews hospital i shouldnt boast but it is the largest such business in the city philemon relaxed an apothecary was a mere merchant well below a prior in the pecking order with a hint of a sneer he said and what brings the biggest apothecary in london all the way down here i was hoping to acquire a copy of the kingsbridge panacea the what jonas smiled knowingly you cultivate humility father prior but i see this novice nun making a copy right here in your pharmacy caris said the book its not called a panacea yet it contains cures for all ills there was a certain logic to that she realized but how do you know of it i travel a good deal searching for rare herbs and other ingredients while my sons take care of the shop i met a nun of southampton who showed me a copy she called it a panacea and told me it was written in kingsbridge was the nun sister claudia yes i begged her to lend me the book just long enough to make a copy but she would not be parted from it i remember her claudia had made a pilgrimage to kingsbridge stayed in the nunnery and nursed plague victims with no thought for her own safety caris had given her the book in thanks a remarkable work jonas said warmly and in english its for healers who arent priests and therefore dont speak much latin there is no other book of its kind in any language is it so unusual the arrangement of subjects jonas enthused instead of the humours of the body or the classes of illness the chapters refer to the pains of the patient so whether the customers complaint is stomach ache or bleeding or fever or diarrhoea or sneezing you can just go to the relevant page philemon said impatiently suitable enough for apothecaries and their customers i am sure jonas appeared not to hear the note of derision i assume father prior that you are the author of this invaluable book certainly not he said then who i wrote it caris said a woman jonas marvelled but where did you get all the information virtually none of it appears in other texts the old texts have never proved very useful to me jonas i was first taught how to make medicines by a wise woman of kingsbridge called mattie who sadly left town for fear of being persecuted as a witch i learned more from mother cecilia who was prioress here before me but gathering the recipes and treatments is not difficult everyone knows a hundred of them the difficulty is to identify the few effective ones in all the dross what i did was to keep a diary over the years of the effects of every cure i tried in my book i included only those i have seen working with my own eyes time after time i am awestruck to be speaking to you in person well you shall have a copy of my book im flattered that someone should come such a long way for it she opened a cupboard this was intended for our priory of stjohnintheforest but they can wait for another copy jonas handled it as if it were a holy object i am most grateful he produced a bag of soft leather and gave it to caris and in token of my gratitude accept a modest gift from my family to the nuns of kingsbridge caris opened the bag and took out a small object swathed in wool when she unwrapped the material she found a gold crucifix embedded with precious stones philemons eyes glittered with greed caris was startled this is a costly present she exclaimed that was less than charming she realized she added extraordinarily generous of your family jonas he made a deprecatory gesture we are prosperous thanks be to god philemon said enviously that for a book of old womens nostrums jonas said ah father prior you are above such things of course we do not aspire to your intellectual heights we do not try to understand the bodys humours just as a child sucks on a cut finger because that eases the pain so we administer cures only because they work as to why and how these things happen we leave that to greater minds than ours gods creation is too mysterious for the likes of us to comprehend caris thought jonas was speaking with barely concealed irony she saw oonagh smother a grin sime too picked up the undertone of mockery and his eyes flashed anger but philemon did not notice and he seemed mollified by the flattery a sly look came over his face and caris guessed he was wondering how he could share in the credit for the book and get some jewelled crucifixes for himself the fleece fair opened on whit sunday as always it was traditionally a busy day for the hospital and this year was no exception elderly folk fell ill after making a long journey to the fair babies and children got diarrhoea from strange food and foreign water men and women drank too much in the taverns and injured themselves and each other for the first time caris was able to separate the patients into two categories the rapidly diminishing number of plague victims and others who had catching illnesses such as stomach upsets and poxes went into the new building which was officially blessed by the bishop early in the day victims of accidents and fights were treated in the old hospital safe from the risk of infection gone were the days when someone would come into the priory with a dislocated thumb and die there of pneumonia the crisis came on whit monday early in the afternoon caris happened to be at the fair taking a stroll after dinner looking around it was quiet by comparison with the old days when hundreds of visitors and thousands of townspeople thronged not just the cathedral green but all the principal streets nevertheless this years fair was better than expected after last years cancellation caris figured that people had noticed how the grip of the plague seemed to be weakening those who had survived so far thought they must be invulnerable and some were though others were not for it continued to kill people madge webbers cloth was the talking point of the fair the new looms designed by merthin were not just faster they also made it easier to produce complex patterns in the weave she had sold half her stock already caris was talking to madge when the fight started madge was embarrassing her by saying as she had often said before that without caris she would still be a penniless weaver caris was about to give her customary denial when they heard shouts caris recognized immediately the deepchested sound of aggressive young men it came from the neighbourhood of an ale barrel thirty yards away the shouts increased rapidly and a young woman screamed caris hurried over to the place hoping to stop the fight before it got out of control she was a little too late the fracas was well under way four of the towns young tearaways were fighting fiercely with a group of peasants identifiable as such by their rustic clothing and probably all from the same village a pretty girl no doubt the one who had screamed was struggling to separate two men who were punching one another mercilessly one of the town boys had drawn a knife and the peasants had heavy wooden shovels as caris arrived more people were joining in on both sides she turned to madge who had followed her send someone to fetch mungo constable quick as you can hes probably in the basement of the guild hall madge hurried off the fight was getting nastier several town boys had knives out a peasant lad was lying on the ground bleeding copiously from his arm and another was fighting on despite a gash in his face as caris watched two more townies started kicking the peasant on the ground caris hesitated another moment then stepped forward she grabbed the nearest fighter by the shirt willie bakerson stop this right now she shouted in her most authoritative voice it almost worked willie stepped back from his opponent startled and looked at caris guiltily she opened her mouth to speak again but at that instant a shovel struck her a violent blow on the head that had surely been intended for willie it hurt like hell her vision blurred she lost her balance and the next thing she knew she hit the ground she lay there dazed trying to recover her wits while the world seemed to sway around her then someone grabbed her under the arms and dragged her away are you hurt mother caris the voice was familiar though she could not place it her head cleared at last and she struggled to her feet with the help of her rescuer whom she now identified as the muscular corn merchant megg robbins im just a bit stunned caris said we have to stop these boys killing each other here come the constables lets leave it to them sure enough mungo and six or seven deputies appeared all wielding clubs they waded into the fight cracking heads indiscriminately they were doing as much damage as the original fighters but their presence confused the battleground the boys looked bewildered and some ran off in a remarkably few moments the fight was over caris said megg run to the nunnery and fetch sister oonagh and tell her to bring bandages megg hurried away the walking wounded quickly disappeared caris began to examine those who were left a peasant boy who had been knifed in the stomach was trying to hold his guts in there was little hope for him the one with the gashed arm would live if caris could stop the bleeding she took off his belt wound it around his upper arm and tightened it until the flow of blood slowed to a trickle hold that there she told him and moved on to a town boy who seemed to have broken some bones in his hand her head was still hurting but she ignored it oonagh and several more nuns appeared a moment later matthew barber arrived with his bag between them they patched up the wounded under cariss instructions volunteers picked up the worst victims and carried them to the nunnery take them to the old hospital not the new one she said she stood up from a kneeling position and felt dizzy she grabbed oonagh to steady herself whats the matter said oonagh ill be all right wed better get to the hospital they threaded their way through the market stalls to the old hospital when they went in they saw immediately that none of the wounded were here caris cursed the fools have taken them all to the wrong place she said it was going to take a while for people to learn the importance of the difference she concluded she and oonagh went to the new building the cloister was entered through a wide archway as they went in they met the volunteers corning out you brought them to the wrong place caris said crossly one said but mother caris dont argue theres no time she said impatiently just carry them to the old hospital stepping into the cloisters she saw the boy with the gashed arm being carried into a room where she knew there were five plague victims she rushed across the quadrangle stop she yelled furiously what do you think youre doing a mans voice said they are carrying out my instructions caris stopped and looked around it was brother sime dont be a fool she said hes got a knife wound do you want him to die of the plague his round face turned pink i dont propose to submit my decision to you for approval mother caris that was stupid and she ignored it all these injured boys must be kept away from plague victims or theyll catch it i think youre overwrought i suggest you go and lie down lie down she was outraged ive just patched up all these men now ive got to look at them properly but not here thank you for your emergency work mother you can now leave me to examine the patients thoroughly you idiot youll kill them please leave the hospital until you have calmed down you cant throw me out of here you stupid boy i built this hospital with the nuns money im in charge here are you he said coolly caris realized that although she had not anticipated this moment he almost certainly had he was flushed but he had his feelings under control he was a man with a plan she paused thinking fast looking around she saw that the nuns and volunteers were all watching waiting to see how this would turn out we have to attend to these boys she said while were standing here arguing theyre bleeding to death well compromise for now she raised her voice put every one down exactly where they are please the weather was warm there was no need for the patients to be indoors well see to their needs first then decide later where they are to be bedded the volunteers and nuns knew and respected caris whereas sime was new to them and they obeyed her with alacrity sime saw that he was beaten and a look of utter fury came over his face i cannot treat patients in these circumstances he said and he stalked out caris was shocked she had tried to save his pride with her compromise and she had not thought he would walk away from sick people in a fit of petulance she quickly put him out of her mind as she began to look again at the injured for the next couple of hours she was busy bathing wounds sewing up gashes and administering soothing herbs and comforting drinks matthew barber worked alongside her setting broken bones and fixing dislocated joints matthew was in his fifties now but his son luke assisted him with equal skill the afternoon was cooling into evening when they finished they sat on the cloister wall to rest sister joan brought them tankards of cool cider caris still had a headache she had been able to ignore it while she was busy but now it bothered her she would go to bed early she decided while they were drinking their cider young joshie appeared the lord bishop asks you to attend on him in the priors palace at your convenience mother prioress she grunted irritably no doubt sime had complained this was the last thing she needed tell him ill come immediately she said in a lower voice she added might as well get it over with she drained her tankard and left wearily she walked across the green the stallholders were packing up for the night covering their goods and locking their boxes she passed through the graveyard and entered the palace bishop henri sat at the head of the table canon claude and archdeacon lloyd were with him philemon and sime were also there godwyns cat archbishop was sitting on henris lap looking smug the bishop said please sit down she sat beside claude he said kindly you look tired mother caris ive spent the afternoon patching up stupid boys who got into a big fight also i got a bang on the head myself we heard about the fight henri added and about the argument in the new hospital i assume thats why im here yes the whole idea of the new place is to separate patients with infectious illnesses i know what the argument is about henri interrupted he addressed the group caris ordered that those injured in the fight be taken to the old hospital sime countermanded her orders they had an unseemly row in front of everyone sime said i apologize for that my lord bishop henri ignored that before we go any farther i want to get something clear he looked from sime to caris and back again i am your bishop and ex officio the abbot of kingsbridge priory i have the right and power to command you all and it is your duty to obey me do you accept that brother sime sime bowed his head i do henri turned to caris do you mother prioress there was no argument of course henri was completely in the right yes she said she felt confident that henri was not stupid enough to force injured hooligans to catch the plague henri said allow me to state the arguments the new hospital was built with the nuns money to the specifications of mother caris she intended it to provide a place for plague victims and others whose illnesses may according to her be spread from the sick to the well she believes it is essential to compartmentalize the two types of patient she feels she is entitled in all the circumstances to insist that her plan be carried out is that fair mother yes brother sime was not here when caris conceived her plan so he could not be consulted however he has spent three years studying medicine at the university and has been awarded a degree he points out that caris has no training and apart from what she has picked up by practical experience little understanding of the nature of disease he is a qualified physician and more than that he is the only one in the priory or indeed in kingsbridge exactly said sime how can you say i have no training caris burst out after all the years ive cared for patients be quiet please henri said hardly raising his voice and something in his quiet tone caused caris to shut up i was about to mention your history of service your work here has been invaluable you are known far and wide for your dedication during the plague that is still with us your experience and practical knowledge are priceless thank you bishop on the other hand sime is a priest a university graduate and a man the learning he brings with him is essential to the proper running of a priory hospital we do not want to lose him caris said some of the masters at the university agree with my methods ask brother austin philemon said brother austin has been sent to stjohnintheforest and now we know why caris said the bishop said i have to make this decision not austin nor the masters at the university caris realized that she had not prepared for this showdown she was exhausted she had a headache and she could hardly think straight she was in the middle of a power struggle and she had no strategy if she had been fully alert she would not have come when the bishop called she would have gone to bed and got over her bad head and woken up refreshed in the morning and she would not have met with henri until she had worked out her battle plan was it yet too late for that she said bishop i dont feel adequate to this discussion tonight perhaps we could postpone it until tomorrow when im feeling better no need said henri ive heard simes complaint and i know your views besides i will be leaving at sunrise he had made up his mind caris realized nothing she said would make any difference but what had he decided which way would he jump she really had no idea and she was too tired to do anything but sit and listen to her fate humankind is weak henri said we see as the apostle paul puts it as through a glass darkly we err we go astray we reason poorly we need help that is why god gave us his church and the pope and the priesthood to guide us because our own resources are fallible and inadequate if we follow our own way of thinking we will fail we must consult the authorities it looked as if he was going to back sime caris concluded how could he be so stupid but he was brother sime has studied the ancient texts of medical literature under the supervision of the masters at the university his course of study is endorsed by the church we must accept its authority and therefore his his judgement cannot be subordinated to that of an uneducated person no matter how brave and admirable she may be his decisions must prevail caris felt so weary and ill that she was almost glad the interview was over sime had won she had lost and all she wanted to do was sleep she stood up henri said im sorry to disappoint you mother caris his voice tailed off as she walked away she heard philemon say insolent behaviour henri said quietly let her go she reached the door and went out without turning back the full meaning of what had happened became clear to her as she walked slowly through the graveyard sime was in charge of the hospital she would have to follow his orders there would be no separation of different categories of patient there would be no face masks or hand washing in vinegar weak people would be made weaker by bleeding starved people would be made thinner by purging wounds would be covered with poultices made of animal dung to encourage the body to produce pus no one would care about cleanliness or fresh air she spoke to nobody as she walked across the cloisters up the stairs and through the dormitory to her own room she lay face down on her bed her head pounding she had lost menhin she had lost her hospital she had lost everything head injuries could be fatal she knew perhaps she would go to sleep now and never wake up perhaps that would be for the best merthins orchard had been planted in the spring of a year later most of the trees were established and came out in a scatter of brave leaves two or three were struggling and only one was inarguablv dead he did not expect any of them to bear fruit yet but by july to his surprise one precocious sapling had a dozen or so tiny darkgreen pears small as yet and as hard as stones but promising ripeness in the autumn one sunday afternoon he showed them to lolla who refused to believe that they would grow into the tangy juicy fruits she loved she thought or pretended to think that he was playing one of his teasing games when he asked her where she imagined ripe pears came from she looked at him reproachfully and said the market silly she too would ripen one day he thought although it was hard to imagine her bony body rounding out into the soft shape of a woman he wondered whether she would bear him grandchildren she was five years old so that day might be only a decade or so away his thoughts were on ripeness when he saw philippa coming towards him through the garden and it struck him how round and full her breasts were it was unusual for her to visit him in daylight and he wondered what had brought her here in case they were observed he greeted her with only a chaste kiss on the cheek such as a brotherinlaw might give without arousing comment she looked troubled and he realized that for a few days now she had been more reserved and thoughtful than usual as she sat beside him on the grass he said something on your mind ive never been good at breaking news gently she said im pregnant good god he was too shocked to hold back his reaction im surprised because you told me i know i was sure i was too old for a couple of years my monthly cycle was irregular and then it stopped altogether i thought but ive been vomiting in the morning and my nipples hurt i noticed your breasts as you came into the garden but can you be sure ive been pregnant six times previously three children and three miscarriages and i know the feeling theres really no doubt he smiled well were going to have a child she did not return the smile dont look pleased you havent thought through the implications im the wife of the earl of shiring i havent slept with him since october havent lived with him since february yet in july im two or at most three months pregnant he and the whole world will know that the baby is not his and that the countess of shiring has committed adultery but he wouldnt kill me he killed tilly didnt he oh my god yes he did but and if he killed me he might kill my baby too merthin wanted to say it was not possible that ralph would not do such a thing but he knew otherwise i have to decide what to do said philippa i dont think you should try to end the pregnancy with potions its too dangerous i wont do that so youll have the baby yes but then what suppose you stayed in the nunnery and kept the baby secret the place is full of children orphaned by the plague but what couldnt be kept secret is a mothers love everyone would know that the child was my particular care and then ralph would find out youre right i could go away vanish london york paris avignon not tell anyone where i was going so that ralph could never come after me and i could go with you but then you wouldnt finish your tower and you would miss odila philippas daughter had been married to earl david for six months merthin could imagine how hard it would be for philippa to leave her and the truth was that he would find it agony to abandon his tower all his adult life he had wanted to build the tallest building in england now that he had at last begun it would break his heart to abandon the project thinking of the tower brought caris to mind he knew intuitively that she would be devastated by this news he had not seen her for weeks she had been ill in bed after suffering a blow on the head at the fleece fair and now though she was completely recovered she rarely emerged from the priory he guessed that she had lost some kind of power struggle for the hospital was being run by brother sime philippas pregnancy would be another shattering blow for caris philippa added and odila too is pregnant so soon thats good news but even more reason why you cant go into exile and never see her or your grandchild i cant run and i cant hide but if i do nothing ralph will kill me there must be a way out of this merthin said i can think of only one answer he looked at her she had thought this out already he realized she had not told him about the problem until she had the solution but she had been careful to show him that all the obvious answers were wrong that meant he was not going to like the plan she had settled on tell me he said we have to make ralph think the baby is his but then youd have to yes i see the thought of philippa sleeping with ralph was loathsome to merthin this was not so much jealousy though that was a factor what weighed most with him was how terrible she would feel about it she had a physical and emotional revulsion from ralph merthin understood the revulsion though he did not share it he had lived with ralphs brutishness all his life and the brute was his brother and somehow that fact remained no matter what ralph did all the same it made him sick to think that philippa would have to force herself to have sex with the man she hated most in the world i wish i could think of a better way he said so do i he looked hard at her youve already decided yes im very sorry so am i but will it even work can you seduce him i dont know she said ill just have to try the cathedral was symmetrical the masons loft was at the west end in the low north tower overlooking the north porch in the matching southwest tower was a room of similar size and shape that looked over the cloisters it was used to store items of small value that were used only rarely all the costumes and symbolic objects employed in the mystery plays were there together with an assortment of notquiteuseless things wooden candlesticks rusty chains cracked pots and a book whose vellum pages had rotted with age so that the words penned so painstakingly were no longer legible merthin went there to check how upright the wall was by dangling a lead pointer on a long string from the window and while there he made a discovery there were cracks in the wall cracks were not necessarily a sign of weakness their meaning had to be interpreted by an experienced eye all buildings moved and cracks might simply show how a structure was adjusting to accommodate change merthin judged that most of the cracks in the wall of this storeroom were benign but there was one that puzzled him by its shape it did not look normal a second glance told him that someone had taken advantage of a natural crack to loosen a small stone he removed the stone he realized immediately that he had found someones secret hiding place the space behind the stone was a thiefs stash he took the objects out one by one there was a womans brooch with a large green stone a silver buckle a silk shawl and a scroll with a psalm written on it right at the back he found the object that gave him the clue to the identity of the thief it was the only thing in the hole that had no monetary value a simple piece of polished wood it had letters carved into its surface that read mphmnamat m was just an initial amat was the latin for loves and phmn was surely philemon someone whose name began with m boy or girl had once loved philemon and given him this and he had hidden it with his stolen treasures since childhood philemon had been rumoured to be lightfingered around him things went missing it seemed that this was where he hid them merthin imagined him coming up here alone perhaps at night to pull out the stone and gloat over his loot no doubt it was a kind of sickness there had never been any rumours about philemon having lovers like his mentor godwyn he seemed to be one of that small minority of men in whom the need for sexual love was weak but someone had fallen for him at some time and he cherished the memory merthin replaced the objects putting them back exactly the way he had found them he had a good memory for that sort of thing he replaced the loose stone then thoughtfully he left the room and went back down the spiral staircase ralph was surprised when philippa came home it was a rare fine day in a wet summer and he would have liked to be out hawking but to his anger he was not able to go the harvest was about to begin and most of the twenty or thirty stewards bailiffs and reeves in the earldom needed to see him urgently they all had the same problem crops ripening in the fields and insufficient men and women to harvest them he could do nothing to help he had taken every opportunity to prosecute labourers who defied the ordinance by leaving their villages in search of higher wages but those few who could be caught just paid the fine out of their earnings and ran off again so his bailiffs had to make do however they all wanted to explain their difficulties to him and he had no choice but to listen and give his approval to their makeshift plans the hall was full of people bailiffs knights and menatarms a couple of priests and a dozen or more loitering servants when they all went quiet ralph suddenly heard the rooks outside their harsh call sounding like a warning he looked up and saw philippa in the doorway she spoke first to the servants martha this table is still dirty from dinner fetch hot water and scrub it now dickie ive just seen the earls favourite courser covered with what looks like yesterdays mud and youre here whittling a stick get back to the stables where you belong and clean up that horse you boy put that puppy outside its just pissed on the floor the only dog allowed in the hall is the earls mastiff you know that the servants were galvanized into action even those to whom she had not spoken suddenly finding work to do ralph did not mind philippa issuing orders to the domestic servants they got lazy without a mistress to harry them she came up to him and made a deep curtsey as was only appropriate after a long absence she did not offer to kiss him he said neutrally this is unexpected philippa said irritably i shouldnt have had to make the journey at all ralph groaned inwardly what brings you here he said whatever it was there would be trouble he felt sure my manor of ingsby philippa had a small number of properties of her own a few villages in gloucestershire that paid tribute to her rather than to the earl since she had gone to live at the nunnery the bailiffs from these villages had been visiting her at kingsbridge priory ralph knew and accounting to her directly for their dues but ingsby was an awkward exception the manor paid tribute to him and he passed it on to her which he had forgotten to do since she left damn he said it slipped my mind thats all right she said youve got a lot to think about that was surprisingly conciliatory she went upstairs to the private chamber and he returned to his work half a year of separation had improved her a little he thought as another bailiff enumerated the fields of ripening corn and bemoaned the shortage of reapers still he hoped she did not plan to stay long lying beside her at night was like sleeping with a dead cow she reappeared at supper time she sat next to ralph and spoke politely to several visiting knights during the meal she was as cool and reserved as ever there was no affection not even any humour but he saw no sign of the implacable icy hatred she had shown after their wedding it was gone or at least deeply hidden when the meal was over she retired again leaving him to drink with the knights he considered the possibility that she was planning to come back permanently but in the end he dismissed the idea she would never love him or even like him it was just that a long absence had blunted the edge of her resentment the underlying feeling would probably never leave her he assumed she would be asleep when he went upstairs but to his surprise she was at the writing desk in an ivorycoloured linen nightgown a single candle throwing a soft light over her proud features and thick dark hair in front of her was a long letter in a girlish hand which he guessed was from odila now the countess of monmouth philippa was penning a reply like most aristocrats she dictated business letters to a clerk but wrote personal ones herself he stepped into the garderobe then came out and took off his outer clothing it was summer and he normally slept in his underdrawers philippa finished her letter stood up and knocked over the jar of ink on the desk she jumped back too late somehow it fell towards her disfiguring her white nightdress with a broad black stain she cursed he was mildly amused she was so prissily particular that it was funny to see her splashed with ink she hesitated for a moment then pulled the nightdress off over her head he was startled she was not normally quick to take off her clothes she had been disconcerted by the ink he realized he stared at her naked body she had put on a little weight at the nunnery her breasts seemed larger and rounder than before her belly had a slight but discernible bulge and her hips had an attractive swelling curve to his surprise he felt aroused she bent down to mop the ink off the tiled floor with her bundledup nightgown her breasts swayed as she rubbed the tiles she turned and he got a full view of her generous behind if he had not known her better he would have suspected her of trying to inflame him but philippa had never tried to inflame anyone let alone him she was just awkward and embarrassed and that made it even more stimulating to stare at her exposed nakedness while she wiped the floor it was several weeks since he had been with a woman and the last one had been a very unsatisfactory whore in salisbury by the time philippa stood up he had an erection she saw him staring dont look at me she said go to bed she threw the soiled garment into the laundry hamper she went to the clothes press and lifted its lid she had left most of her clothes here when she went to kingsbridge it was not considered seemly to dress richly when living in a nunnery even for noble guests she found another nightdress ralph raked her with his eyes as she lifted it out he stared at her uplifted breasts and the mound of her sex with its dark hair and his mouth went dry she caught his look dont you touch me she said if she had not said that he would probably have lain down and gone to sleep but her swift rejection stung him im the earl of shiring and youre my wife he said ill touch you any time i like you wouldnt dare she said and she turned away to put on the gown that angered him as she lifted the garment to put it on over her head he slapped her bottom it was a hard slap on bare skin and he could tell that it hurt her she jumped and cried out so much for not daring he said she turned to him a protest on her lips and on impulse he punched her in the mouth she was knocked back and fell to the floor her hands flew to her mouth and blood seeped through her fingers but she was on her back naked with her legs spread and he could see the triangle of hair at the fork of her thighs with its cleft slightly parted in what looked like an invitation he fell on her she wriggled furiously but he was bigger than she and strong he overcame her resistance effortlessly a moment later he was inside her she was dry but somehow that excited him it was all over quite quickly he rolled off her panting after a few moments he looked at her there was blood on her mouth she did not look back at him her eyes were closed yet it seemed to him that there was a curious expression on her face he thought about it for a while until he worked it out then he was even more puzzled than before she looked triumphant merthin knew that philippa had returned to kingsbridge because he saw her maid in the bell he expected his lover to come to his house that night and was disappointed when she did not no doubt she felt awkward he thought no lady would be comfortable with what she had done even though the reasons were compelling even though the man she loved knew and understood another night went by without her appearing then it was sunday and he felt sure he would see her in church but she did not come to the service it was almost unheardof for the nobility to miss sunday mass what had kept her away after the service he sent lolla home with arn and em then went across the green to the old hospital on the upper floor were three rooms for important guests he took the outside staircase in the corridor he came face to face with caris she did not bother to ask what he was doing here the countess doesnt want you to see her but you probably should she said merthin noted the odd turn of phrase not the countess doesnt want to see you but the countess doesnt want you to see her he looked at the bowl caris was carrying it contained a bloodstained rag fear struck his heart whats wrong nothing too serious caris said the baby is unharmed thank god youre the father of course please dont ever let anyone hear you say that she looked sad all the years you and i were together and i only conceived that one time he looked away which room is she in sorry to talk about myself im the last thing youre interested in lady philippa is in the middle room he caught the poorly suppressed grief in her voice and paused despite his anxiety for philippa he touched cariss arm please dont believe im not interested in you he said ill always care what happens to you and whether youre happy she nodded and tears came to her eyes i know she said im being selfish go and see philippa he left caris and entered the middle room philippa was kneeling on the priedieu with her back to him he interrupted her prayers are you all right she stood up and turned to him her face was a mess her lips were swollen to three times their normal size and badly scabbed he guessed that caris had been bathing the wound hence the bloody rag what happened he said can you speak she nodded i sound queer but i can talk her voice was a mumble but comprehensible how badly are you hurt my face looks awful but its not serious other than that im fine he put his arms around her she laid her head on his shoulder he waited holding her after a while she began to cry he stroked her hair and her back while she shook with sobs he said there there and kissed her forehead but he did not try to silence her slowly her weeping subsided he said can i kiss your lips she nodded gently he brushed them with his own he tasted almonds caris had smeared the cuts with oil tell me what happened he said it worked he was fooled he will be sure its his baby he touched her mouth with his fingertip and he did this dont be angry i tried to provoke him and succeeded be glad he hit me glad why because he thinks he had to force me he believes i would not have submitted without violence he has no inkling that i intended to seduce him he will never suspect the truth which means im safe and so is our baby he put his hand on her belly but why didnt you come and see me looking like this i want to be with you even more when youre hurt he moved his hand to her breast besides ive missed you she took his hand away i cant go from one to the other like a whore oh he had not thought of it that way do you understand i think so he could see that a woman would feel cheap although a man might be proud of doing exactly the same thing but how long she sighed and moved away its not how long what do you mean weve agreed to tell the world that this is ralphs baby and ive made sure hell believe that now hes going to want to raise it merthin was dismayed i hadnt thought about the details but i imagined you would continue to live in the priory ralph wont allow his child to be raised in a nunnery especially if its a boy so what will you do go back to earlscastle yes the child was nothing yet of course not a person not even a baby just a swelling in philippas belly but all the same merthin felt a stab of grief lolla had become the great joy of his life and he had been looking forward eagerly to another child but at least he had philippa for a little while longer when will you go he asked immediately she said she saw the look on his face and tears came to her eyes i cant tell you how sorry i am but i would just feel wrong making love to you and planning to return to ralph it would be the same with any two men the fact that youre brothers just makes it uglier his eyes blurred with tears so its over with us already now she nodded and theres another thing i have to tell you one more reason why we can never be lovers again ive confessed my adultery merthin knew that philippa had her own personal confessor as was appropriate for a highranking noblewoman since she came to kingsbridge he had been living with the monks a welcome addition to their thinned ranks so now she had told him of her affair merthin hoped he could keep the secrets of the confessional philippa said i have received absolution but i must not continue the sin merthin nodded she was right they had both sinned she had betrayed her husband and he had betrayed his brother she had an excuse she had been forced into the marriage he had none a beautiful woman had fallen in love with him and he had loved her back even though he had no right the yearning ache of grief and loss he was feeling now was the natural consequence of such behaviour he looked at her the cool greygreen eyes the smashed mouth the ripe body and realized that he had lost her perhaps he had never really had her in any case it had always been wrong and now it was over he tried to speak to say goodbye but his throat seemed to seize up and nothing came out he could hardly see for crying he turned away fumbled for the door and somehow got out of the room a nun was coming along the corridor carrying a jug he could not see who it was but he recognized cariss voice when she said merthin are you all right he made no reply he went in the opposite direction and passed through the door and down the outside staircase weeping openly not caring who saw he walked across the cathedral green down the main street and across the bridge to his island september was cold and wet but all the same there was a sense of euphoria as damp sheaves of wheat were gathered in the surrounding countryside only one person died of the plague in kingsbridge marge taylor a dressmaker sixty years old no one caught the disease in october november or december it seemed to have vanished merthin thought gratefully at least for the time being the ageold migration of enterprising restless people from countryside to town had been reversed during the plague but now it recommenced they came to kingsbridge moved into empty houses fixed them up and paid rent to the priory some started new businesses bakeries breweries candle manufactories to replace the old ones that had disappeared when the owners and all their heirs died off merthin as alderman had made it easier to open a shop or a market stall sweeping away the lengthy process of obtaining permission that had been imposed by the priory the weekly market grew busier one by one merthin rented out the shops houses and taverns he had built on leper island his tenants either enterprising newcomers or existing tradesmen who wanted a better location the road across the island between the two bridges had become an extension of the main street and therefore prime commercial property as merthin had foreseen twelve years ago when people had thought he was mad to take the barren rock as payment for his work on the bridge winter drew in and once again the smoke from thousands of fires hung over the town in a low brown cloud but the people still worked and shopped ate and drank played dice in taverns and went to church on sundays the guild hall saw the first christmas eve banquet since the parish guild had become a borough guild merthin invited the prior and prioress they no longer had power to overrule the merchants but they were still among the most important people in town philemon came but caris declined the invitation she had become worryingly withdrawn merthin sat next to madge webber she was now the richest merchant and the largest employer in kingsbridge perhaps in the whole county she was deputy alderman and probably should have been alderman but that it was unusual to have a woman in that position among merthins many enterprises was a workshop turning out the treadle looms that had improved the quality of kingsbridge scarlet madge bought more than half his production but enterprising merchants came from as far away as london to place orders for the rest the looms were complex pieces of machinery that had to be made accurately and assembled with precision so merthin had to employ the best carpenters available but he priced the finished product at more than double what it cost him to make and still people could hardly wait to give him the money several people had hinted that he should marry madge but the idea did not tempt him or her she had never been able to find a man to match mark who had had the physique of a giant and the disposition of a saint she had always been chunky but these days she was quite fat now in her forties she was growing into one of those women who looked like barrels almost the same width all the way from shoulders to bottom eating and drinking well were now her chief pleasures merthin thought as he watched her tuck into gingered ham with a sauce made of apples and cloves that and making money at the end of the meal they had a mulled wine called hippocras madge took a long draught belched and moved closer to merthin on the bench we have to do something about the hospital she said oh he was not aware of a problem now that the plague has ended i would have thought people didnt have much need of a hospital of course they do she said briskly they still get fevers and bellyache and cancer women want to get pregnant and cant or they suffer complications giving birth children burn themselves and fall out of trees men are thrown by their horses or knifed by their enemies or have their heads broken by angry wives yes i get the picture merthin said amused by her garrulousness whats the problem nobody will go to the hospital any more they dont like brother sime and more importantly they dont trust his learning while we were all coping with the plague he was at oxford reading ancient textbooks and he still prescribes remedies such as bleeding and cupping that no one believes in any more they want caris but she never appears what do people do when theyre sick if they dont go to the hospital they see matthew barber or silas pothecary or a newcomer called maria wisdom who specializes in womens problems so whats worrying you theyre starting to mutter about the priory if they dont get help from the monks and nuns they say why should they pay towards building the tower oh the tower was a huge project no individual could possibly finance it a combination of monastery nunnery and city funds was the only way to pay for it if the town defaulted the project could be threatened yes i see said merthin worriedly that is a problem it had been a good year for most people caris thought as she sat through the christmas day service people were adjusting to the devastation of the plague with astonishing speed as well as bringing terrible suffering and a nearbreakdown of civilized life the disease had provided the opportunity for a shakeup almost half the population had died by her calculations but one effect was that her remaining peasants were farming only the most fertile soils so each man produced more despite the ordinance of labourers and the efforts of noblemen such as earl ralph to enforce it she was gratified to see that people continued to move to where the pay was highest which was usually where the land was most productive grain was plentiful and herds of cattle and sheep were growing again the nunnery was thriving and because caris had reorganized the monks affairs as well as the nuns after the flight of godwyn the monastery was now more prosperous than it had been for a hundred years wealth created wealth and good times in the countryside brought more business to the towns so kingsbridge craftsmen and shopkeepers were beginning to return to their former affluence as the nuns left the church at the end of the service prior philemon spoke to her i need to talk to you mother prioress would you come to my house there had been a time when she would have politely acceded to such a request without hesitation but those days were over no she said i dont think so he reddened immediately you cant refuse to speak to me i didnt i refused to go to your palace i decline to be summoned before you like a subordinate what do you want to talk about the hospital there have been complaints speak to brother sime hes in charge of it as you well know is there no reasoning with you he said exasperatedly if sime could solve the problem i would be talking to him not you by now they were in the monks cloisters caris sat on the low wall around the quadrangle the stone was cold we can talk here what do you have to say to me philemon was annoyed but he gave in he stood in front of her and now he was the one who seemed like a subordinate he said the townspeople are unhappy about the hospital im not surprised merthin complained to me at the guilds christmas dinner they dont come here any more but see charlatans like silas pothecary hes no more of a charlatan than sime philemon realized that several novices were standing nearby listening to the argument go away all of you he said get to your studies they scurried off philemon said to caris the townspeople think you ought to be at the hospital so do i but i wont follow simes methods at best his cures have no effect much of the time they make patients worse thats why people no longer come here when theyre ill your new hospital has so few patients that were using it as a guest house doesnt that bother you that jibe went home caris swallowed and looked away it breaks my heart she said quietly then come back figure out a compromise with sime you worked under monkphysicians in the early days when you first came here brother joseph was the senior doctor then he had the same training as sime youre right in those days we felt that the monks sometimes did more harm than good but we could work with them most of the time we didnt call them in at all we just did what we thought best when they did attend we didnt always follow their instructions exactly you cant believe they were always wrong no sometimes they cured people i remember joseph opening a mans skull and draining accumulated fluid that had been causing unbearable headaches it was very impressive so do the same now its no longer possible sime put an end to that didnt he he moved his books and equipment into the pharmacy and took charge of the hospital and im sure he did so with your encouragement in fact it was probably your idea she could tell from philemons expression that she was right you and he plotted to push me out you succeeded and now youre suffering the consequences we could go back to the old system ill make sime move out she shook her head there have been other changes ive learned a lot from the plague im surer than ever that the physicians methods can be fatal i wont kill people for the sake of a compromise with you you dont realize how much is at stake he had a faintly smug look so there was something else she had been wondering why he had brought this up it was not like him to fret about the hospital he had never cared much for the work of healing he was interested only in what would raise his status and defend his fragile pride all right she said what have you got up your sleeve the townspeople are talking about cutting off funds for the new tower why should they pay extra to the cathedral they say when theyre not getting what they want from us and now that the town is a borough i as prior can no longer enforce the payment and if they dont pay your beloved merthin will have to abandon his pet project philemon said triumphantly caris could see that he thought this was his trump card and indeed there had been a time when the revelation would have jolted her but no longer merthin isnt my beloved any more is he she said you put a stop to that too a look of panic crossed his face but the bishop has set his heart on this tower you cant put that at risk caris stood up cant i she said why not she turned away heading for the nunnery he was flabbergasted he called after her how can you be so reckless she was going to ignore him then she changed her mind and decided to explain she turned back you see all that i ever held dear has been taken from me she said in a matteroffact tone and when youve lost everything her façade began to crumble and her voice broke but she made herself carry on when youve lost everything youve got nothing to lose the first snow fell in january it formed a thick blanket on the roof of the cathedral smoothed out the delicate carving of the spires and masked the faces of the angels and saints sculpted over the west door the new masonry of the tower foundations had been covered with straw to insulate the new mortar against winter frost and now the snow overlaid the straw there were few fireplaces in a priory the kitchen had fires of course which was why work in kitchens was always popular with novices but there was no fire in the cathedral where the monks and nuns spent seven or eight hours every day when churches burned down it was usually because some desperate monk had brought a charcoal brazier into the building and a spark had flown from the fire to the timber ceiling when not in church or labouring the monks and nuns were supposed to walk and read in the cloisters which were out of doors the only concession to their comfort was the warming room a small chamber off the cloisters where a fire was lit in the most severe weather they were allowed to come into the warming room from the cloisters for short periods as usual caris ignored rules and traditions and permitted nuns to wear woollen hose in the winter she did not believe that god needed his servants to get chilblains bishop henri was so worried about the hospital or rather about the threat to his tower that he drove from shiring to kingsbridge through the snow he came in a charette a heavy wooden cart with a waxed canvas cover and cushioned seats canon claude and archdeacon lloyd came with him they paused at the priors palace only long enough to dry their clothes and drink a warming cup of wine before summoning a crisis meeting with philemon sime caris oonagh merthin and madge caris knew it would be a waste of time but she went anyway it was easier than refusing which would have required her to sit in the nunnery and deal with endless messages begging commanding and threatening her she looked at the snowflakes falling past the glazed windows as the bishop drearily summarized a quarrel in which she really had no interest this crisis has been brought about by the disloyal and disobedient attitude of mother caris henri said that stung her into a response i worked in the hospital here for ten years she said my work and the work of mother cecilia before me are what made it so popular with the townspeople she pointed a rude finger at the bishop you changed it dont try to blame others you sat in that chair and announced that brother sime would henceforth be in charge now you should take responsibility for the consequences of your foolish decision you must obey me he said his voice rising to a screech in frustration you are a nun you have taken a vow the grating sound disturbed the cat archbishop and it stood up and walked out of the room i realize that caris said it puts me in an intolerable position she spoke without forethought but as the words came out she realized they were not really illconsidered in fact they were the fruit of months of brooding i can no longer serve god in this way she went on her voice calm but her heart pounding that is why i have decided to renounce my vows and leave the nunnery henri actually stood up you will not he shouted i will not release you from your holy vows i expect god will though she said scarcely disguising her contempt that made him angrier this notion that individuals can deal with god is wicked heresy there has been too much of such loose talk since the plague do you think that might have happened because when people approached the church for help during the plague they so often found that its priest and monks here she looked at philemon had fled like cowards henri held up a hand to stifle philemons indignant response we may be fallible but all the same it is only through the church and its priests that men and women may approach god you would think that of course caris said but that doesnt make it right youre a devil canon claude intervened all things considered my lord bishop a public quarrel between yourself and caris would not be helpful he gave her a friendly smile he had been well disposed towards her ever since the day she had caught him and the bishop kissing and had said nothing about it her present noncooperation must be set against many years of dedicated sometimes heroic service and the people love her henri said but what if we do release her from her vows how would that solve the problem at this point merthin spoke for the first time i have a suggestion he said everyone looked at him he said let the town build a new hospital i will donate a large site on leper island let it be staffed by a convent of nuns quite separate from the priory a new group they will be under the spiritual authority of the bishop of shiring of course but have no connection with the prior of kingsbridge or any of the physicians at the monastery let the new hospital have a lay patron who would be a leading citizen of the town chosen by the guild and would appoint the prioress they were all quiet for a long moment letting this radical proposal sink in caris was thunderstruck a new hospital on leper island paid for by the townspeople staffed by a new order of nuns having no connection with the priory she looked around the group philemon and sime clearly hated the idea henri claude and lloyd just looked bemused at last the bishop said the patron will be very powerful representing the townspeople paying the bills and appointing the prioress whoever plays that role will control the hospital yes said merthin if i authorize a new hospital will the townspeople be willing to resume paying for the tower madge webber spoke for the first time if the right patron is appointed yes and who should it be said henri caris realized that everyone was looking at her a few hours later caris and merthin wrapped themselves in heavy cloaks put on boots and walked through the snow to the island where he showed her the site he had in mind it was on the west side not far from his house overlooking the river she was still dizzy from the sudden change in her life she was to be released from her vows as a nun she would become a normal citizen again after almost twelve years she found she could contemplate leaving the priory without anguish the people she had loved were all dead mother cecilia old julie mair tilly she liked sister joan and sister oonagh well enough but it was not the same and she would still be in charge of a hospital having the right to appoint and dismiss the prioress of the new institution she would be able to run the place according to the new thinking that had grown out of the plague the bishop had agreed to everything i think we should use the cloister layout again merthin said it seemed to work really well for the short time you were in charge she stared at the sheet of unmarked snow and marvelled at his ability to imagine walls and rooms where she could see only whiteness the entrance arch was used almost like a hall she said it was the place where people waited and where the nuns first examined the patients before deciding what to do with them you would like it larger i think it should be a real reception hall all right she was bemused this is hard to believe everything has turned out just as i would have wanted it he nodded thats how i worked it out really i asked myself what you would wish for then i figured out how to achieve it she stared at him he had said it lightly as if merely explaining the reasoning process that had led him to his conclusions he seemed to have no idea how momentous it was to her that he should be thinking about her wishes and how to achieve them she said has philippa had the baby yet yes a week ago what did she have a boy congratulations have you seen him no as far as the world is concerned im only his uncle but ralph sent me a letter have they named him roland after the old earl caris changed the subject the river water isnt very pure this far downstream a hospital really needs clean water ill lay a pipe to bring you water from farther upstream the snowfall eased and then stopped and they had a clear view of the island she smiled at him you have the answer to everything he shook his head these are the easy questions clean water airy rooms a reception hall and what are the difficult ones he turned to face her there were snowflakes in his red beard he said questions like does she still love me they stared at one another for a long moment caris was happy part seven march to november wulfric at forty was still the handsomest man gwenda had ever seen there were threads of silver now in his tawny hair but they just made him look wise as well as strong when he was young his broad shoulders had tapered dramatically to a narrow waist whereas nowadays the taper was not so sharp nor the waist so slim but he could still do the work of two men and he would always be two years younger than she she thought she had changed less she had the kind of dark hair that did not go grey until late in life she was no heavier than she had been twenty years ago although since having the children her breasts and belly were not quite as taut as formerly it was only when she looked at her son davey at his smooth skin and the restless spring in his step that she felt her years now twenty he looked like a male version of herself at that age she too had had a face with no lines and she had walked with a jaunty stride a lifetime of working in the fields in all weathers had wrinkled her hands and given her cheeks a raw redness just beneath the skin and taught her to walk slowly and conserve her strength davey was small like her and shrewd and secretive since he was little she had never been sure what he was thinking sam was the opposite big and strong not clever enough to be deceitful but with a mean streak that gwenda blamed on his real father ralph fitzgerald for several years now the two boys had been working alongside wulfric in the fields until two weeks ago when sam had vanished they knew why he had gone all winter long he had been talking about leaving wigleigh and moving to a village where he could earn higher wages he had disappeared the moment the spring ploughing began gwenda knew he was right about the wages it was a crime to leave your village or to accept pay higher than the levels of but all over the country restless young men were flouting the law and desperate farmers were hiring them landlords such as earl ralph could do little more than gnash their teeth sam had not said where he would go and he had given no warning of his departure if davey had done the same gwenda would have known he had thought things out carefully and decided this was the best way but she felt sure sam had just followed an impulse someone had mentioned the name of a village and he had woken up early the next morning and decided to go there immediately she told herself not to worry he was twentytwo years old big and strong no one was going to exploit him or illtreat him but she was his mother and her heart ached if she could not find him no one else could she figured and that was good all the same she yearned to know where he was living and if he was working for a decent master and whether the people were kind to him that winter wulfric had made a new light plough for the sandier acres of his holding and one day in spring gwenda and he went to northwood to buy an iron ploughshare the one part they could not make for themselves as usual a small group of wigleigh folk travelled together to the market jack and eli who operated the fulling mill for madge webber were stocking up on supplies they had no land of their own so they bought all their food annet and her eighteenyearold daughter amabel had a dozen hens in a crate to sell at the market the bailiff nathan came too with his grown son jonno the childhood enemy of sam annet still flirted with every goodlooking man who crossed her path and most of them grinned foolishly and flirted back on the journey to northwood she chatted with davey although he was less than half her age she simpered and tossed her head and smacked his arm in mock reproach just as if she were twentytwo rather than fortytwo she was not a girl any more but she did not seem to know it gwenda thought sourly annets daughter amabel who was as pretty as annet had once been walked a little apart and seemed embarrassed by her mother they reached northwood at midmorning after wulfric and gwenda had made their purchase they went to get their dinner at the old oak tavern for as long as gwenda could remember there had been a venerable oak outside the inn a thick squat tree with malformed branches that looked like a bent old man in winter and cast a welcome deep shade in summer her sons had chased one another around it as little boys but it must have died or become unstable for it had been chopped down and now there was a stump as wide across as wulfric was tall used by the customers as a chair a table and for one exhausted carter a bed sitting on its edge drinking ale from a huge tankard was harry ploughman the bailiff of outhenby gwenda was taken back twelve years in a blink what came to her mind so forcefully that it brought tears to her eyes was the hope that had lifted her heart as she and her family had set out that morning in northwood to walk through the forest to outhenby and a new life the hope had been crushed in less than a fortnight and wulfric had been taken back to wigleigh the memory still made her burn with rage with a rope around his neck but ralph had not had things all his own way since then circumstances had forced him to give wulfric back the lands his father had held which for gwenda had been a savagely satisfying outcome even though wulfric had not been smart enough to win a free tenancy unlike some of his neighbours gwenda was glad they were now tenants rather than labourers and wulfric had achieved his lifes ambition but she still longed for more independence a tenancy free of feudal obligations with a cash rent to pay the whole agreement written down in the manorial records so that no lord could go back on it it was what most serfs wanted and more of them were getting it since the plague harry greeted them effusively and insisted on buying them ale soon after wulfric and gwendas brief stay at outhenby harry had been made bailiff by mother caris and he still held that position though caris had long ago renounced her vows and mother joan was now prioress outhenby continued prosperous to judge by harrys double chin and alehouse belly as they were preparing to leave with the rest of the wigleigh folk harry spoke to gwenda in a low voice ive got a young man called sam labouring for me gwendas heart leaped my sam cant possibly be no she was bewildered why mention him in that case but harry tapped his winered nose and gwenda realized he was being enigmatic this sam assures me that his lord is a hampshire knight ive never heard of who has given him permission to leave his village and work elsewhere whereas your sams lord is earl ralph who never lets his labourers go obviously i couldnt employ your sam gwenda understood that would be harrys story if official questions were asked so hes in outhenby oldchurch one of the smaller villages in the valley is he well she asked eagerly thriving thank god a strong boy and a good worker though he can be quarrelsome she knew that is he living in a warm house lodging with a goodhearted older couple whose own son has gone to kingsbridge to be apprenticed to a tanner gwenda had a dozen questions but suddenly she noticed the bent figure of nathan reeve leaning on the doorpost of the tavern entrance staring at her she suppressed a curse there was so much she wanted to know but she was terrified of giving nate even a clue to sams whereabouts she needed to be content with what she had and she was thrilled that at least she knew where he could be found she turned away from harry trying to give the impression of casually ending an unimportant conversation out of the corner of her mouth she said dont let him get into fights ill do what i can she waved perfunctorily and went after wulfric walking home with the others wulfric carried the heavy ploughshare on his shoulder with no apparent effort gwenda was bursting to tell him the news but she had to wait until the group straggled out along the road and she and her husband were separated from the others by a few yards then she repeated the conversation speaking quietly wulfric was relieved at least we know where the lad has got to he said breathing easily despite his load i want to go to outhenby gwenda said wulfric nodded i thought you might he rarely challenged her but now he expressed a misgiving dangerous though youll have to make sure no one finds out where youve gone exactly nate mustnt know how will you manage that hes sure to notice that im not in the village for a couple of days well have to think of a story we can say youre sick too risky hell probably come to the house to check we could say youre at your fathers place nate wont believe that he knows i never stay there longer than i have to she gnawed at a hangnail racking her brains in the ghost stories and fairy tales that people told around the fire on long winter evenings the characters generally believed one anothers lies without question but real people were less easily duped we could say ive gone to kingsbridge she said at last what for to buy laying hens at the market perhaps you could buy hens from annet i wouldnt buy anything from that bitch and people know it true and nate knows ive always been a friend of caris so hell believe i could be staying with her all right it was not much of a story but she could not think of anything better and she was desperate to see her son she left the next morning she slipped out of the house before dawn wrapped in a heavy cloak against the cold march wind she walked softly through the village in pitch darkness finding her way by touch and memory she did not want to be seen and questioned before she had even left the neighbourhood but no one was up yet nathan reeves dog growled quietly then recognized her tread and she heard a soft thump as he wagged his tail against the side of his wooden kennel she left the village and followed the road through the fields when dawn broke she was a mile away she looked at the road behind her it was empty no one had followed her she chewed a crust of stale bread for breakfast then stopped at midmorning at a tavern where the wigleightokingsbridge road crossed the northwoodtoouthenby road she recognized no one at the inn she watched the door nervously as she ate a bowl of saltfish stew and drank a pint of cider every time someone came in she got ready to hide her face but it was always a stranger and no one took any notice of her she left quickly and set off on the road to outhenby she reached the valley around midafternoon it was twelve years since she had been here but the place had not changed much it had recovered from the plague remarkably quickly apart from some small children playing near the houses most of the villagers were at work ploughing and sowing or looking after new lambs they stared at her across the fields knowing she was a stranger wondering about her identity some of them would recognize her close up she had been here for only ten days but those had been dramatic times and they would remember villagers did not often see such excitement she followed the river outhen as it meandered along the flat plain between two ranges of hills she went from the main village through smaller settlements that she knew from the time she had spent here as ham shortacre and longwater to the smallest and most remote oldchurch her excitement grew as she approached and she even forgot her sore feet oldchurch was a hamlet with thirty hovels none big enough to be a manor house or even a bailiffs home however in accordance with the name there was an old church it was several hundred years of age gwenda guessed it had a squat tower and a short nave all built of crude masonry with tiny square windows placed apparently at random in the thick walls she walked to the fields beyond she ignored a group of shepherds in a distant pasture shrewd harry ploughman would not waste big sam on such light work he would be harrowing or clearing a ditch or helping to manage the eightox plough team searching the three fields methodically she looked for a crowd of mostly men with warm hats and muddy boots and big voices to call to one another across the acres and a young man a head taller than the others when she did not at first see her son she suffered renewed apprehension had he already been recaptured had he moved to another village she found him in a line of men digging manure into a newly ploughed strip he had his coat off despite the cold and he was hefting an oak spade the muscles of his back and arms bunching and shifting under his old linen shirt her heart filled with pride to see him and to think that such a man had come from her diminutive body they all looked up as she approached the men stared at her in curiosity who was she and what was she doing here she walked straight up to sam and embraced him even though he stank of horse dung hello mother he said and all the other men laughed she was puzzled by their hilarity a wiry man with one empty eye socket said there there sam youll be all right now and they laughed again gwenda realized they thought it funny that a big man such as sam should have his little mother come and check on him as if he were a wayward boy how did you find me sam said i met harry ploughman at northwood market i hope no one tracked you here i left before it was light your father was to tell people i went to kingsbridge no one followed me they talked for a few minutes then he said he had to get back to work or the other men would resent his leaving it all to them go back to the village and find old liza he said she lives opposite the church tell her who you are and shell give you some refreshment ill be there at dusk gwenda glanced up at the sky it was a dark afternoon and the men would be forced to stop work in an hour or so she kissed sams cheek and left him she found liza in a house slightly larger than most it had two rooms rather than one the woman introduced her husband rob who was blind as sam had promised liza was hospitable she put bread and pottage on the table and poured a cup of ale gwenda asked about their son and it was like turning on a tap liza talked unstoppably about him from babyhood to apprenticeship until the old man interrupted her harshly with one word horse they fell silent and gwenda heard the rhythmic thud of a trotting horse smallish mount blind rob said a palfrey or a pony too little for a nobleman or a knight though it might be carrying a lady gwenda felt a shiver of fear two visitors within an hour rob observed must be connected that was what gwenda was afraid of she got up and looked out of the door a sturdy black pony was trotting along the path between the houses she recognized the rider immediately and her heart sank it was jonno reeve the son of the bailiff of wigleigh how had he found her she tried to duck quickly back into the house but he had seen her gwenda he shouted and reined in his horse you devil she said i wonder what youre doing here he said mockingly how did you get here no one was following me my father sent me to kingsbridge to see what mischief you might be making there but on the way i stopped at the cross roads tavern and they remembered you taking the road to outhenby she wondered whether she could outwit this shrewd young man and why should i not visit my old friends here no reason he said wheres your runaway son not here though i hoped he might be he looked momentarily uncertain as if he thought she might be telling the truth then he said perhaps hes hiding ill look around he kicked his horse on gwenda watched him go she had not fooled him but perhaps she had planted a doubt in his mind if she could get to sam first she might be able to conceal him she walked quickly through the little house with a hasty word to liza and rob and left by the back door she headed across the field staying close to the hedge looking back towards the village she could see a man on horseback moving out at an angle to her direction the day was dimming and she thought her own small figure might be indistinguishable against the dark background of the hedge she met sam and the others coming back their spades over their shoulders their boots thick with muck from a distance at first sight sam could have been ralph the figure was the same and the confident stride and the set of the handsome head on the strong neck but as he talked she could see wulfric in him too he had a way of turning his head a shy smile and a deprecating gesture of the hand that exactly imitated his foster father the men spotted her they had been tickled by her arrival earlier and now the oneeyed man called out hello mother and they all laughed she took sam aside and said jonno reeve is here hell im sorry you said you werent followed i didnt see him but he picked up my trail damn now what do i do im not going back to wigleigh hes looking for you but he left the village heading east she scanned the darkening landscape but could not see much if we hurry back to oldchurch we could hide you in the church perhaps all right they picked up their pace gwenda said over her shoulder if you men come across a bailiff called jonno you havent seen sam from wigleigh never heard of him mother said one and the others concurred serfs were generally ready to help one another outwit the bailiff gwenda and ralph reached the settlement without seeing jonno they headed for the church gwenda thought they could probably get in country churches were usually empty and bare inside and generally left open but if this one should turn out to be an exception she was not sure what they would do they threaded through the houses and came within sight of the church as they passed lizas front door gwenda saw a black pony she groaned jonno must have doubled back under cover of the dusk he had gambled that gwenda would find sam and bring him to the village and he had been right he had his father nates low cunning she took sams arm to hurry him across the road and into the church then jonno stepped out from lizas house sam he said i thought youd be here gwenda and sam stopped and turned sam leaned on his wooden spade what are you going to do about it jonno was grinning triumphantly take you back to wigleigh id like to see you try a group of peasants mostly women appeared from the west side of the village and stopped to watch the confrontation jonno reached into his ponys saddlebag and brought out some kind of metal device with a chain im going to put a leg iron on you he said and if youve got any sense you wont resist gwenda was surprised by jonnos nerve did he really expect to arrest sam all on his own he was a beefy lad but not as big as sam did he hope the villagers would help him he had the law on his side but few peasants would think his cause just typical young man he had no sense of his own limitations sam said i used to beat the shit out of you when we were boys and ill do the same today gwenda did not want them to fight whoever won sam would be wrong in the eyes of the law he was a runaway she said its too late to go anywhere now why dont we discuss this in the morning jonno gave a disparaging laugh and let sam slip away before dawn the way you sneaked out of wigleigh certainly not he sleeps in irons tonight the men sam had been working with appeared and stopped to see what was going on jonno said all lawabiding men have a duty to help me arrest this runaway and anyone who hinders me will be subject to the punishment of the law you can rely on me said the oneeyed man ill hold your horse the others chuckled there was little sympathy for jonno on the other hand no villager spoke in sams defence jonno moved suddenly with the leg iron in both hands he stepped towards sam and bent down trying to snap the device on to sams leg in one surprise move it might have worked on a slowmoving older man but sam reacted quickly he stepped back then kicked out landing one muddy boot on jonnos outstretched left arm jonno gave a grunt of pain and anger straightening up he drew back his right arm and swung the iron intending to hit sam over the head with it gwenda heard a frightened scream and realized it came from herself sam darted back another step out of range jonno saw that his blow was going to miss and let go of the iron at the last moment it flew through the air sam flinched away turning and ducking but he could not dodge it the iron hit his ear and the chain whipped across his face gwenda cried out as if she herself had been hurt the onlookers gasped sam staggered and the iron fell to the ground there was a moment of suspense blood came from sams ear and nose gwenda took a step towards him stretching out her arms then sam recovered from the shock he turned back to jonno and swung his heavy wooden spade in one graceful movement jonno had not quite recovered his balance after the effort of his throw and he was unable to dodge the edge of the spade caught him on the side of the head sam was strong and the sound of wood on bone rang out across the village street jonno was still reeling when sam hit him again now the spade came straight down from above swung by both sams arms it landed on top of jonnos head edge first with tremendous force this time the impact did not ring out but sounded more like a dull thud and gwenda feared jonnos skull had cracked as jonno slumped to his knees sam hit him a third time another fullforce blow with the oak blade this one across his victims forehead an iron sword could hardly have been more damaging gwenda thought despairingly she stepped forward to restrain sam but the village men had had the same idea a moment earlier and got there before her they pulled sam away two of them holding each arm jonno lay on the ground his head in a pool of blood gwenda was sickened by the sight and could not help thinking of the boys father nate and how grieved he would be by his sons injuries jonnos mother had died of the plague so at least she was in a place where grief could not afflict her gwenda could see that sam was not badly hurt he was bleeding but still struggling with his captors trying to get free so that he could attack again gwenda bent over jonno his eyes were closed and he was not moving she put a hand on his heart and felt nothing she tried for a pulse the way caris had shown her but there was none jonno did not seem to be breathing the implications of what had happened dawned on her and she began to weep jonno was dead and sam was a murderer on easter sunday that year caris and merthin had been married ten years standing in the cathedral watching the easter procession caris recalled their wedding because they had been lovers off and on for so long they had seen the ceremony as no more than confirmation of a longestablished fact and they had foolishly envisaged a small quiet event a lowkey service in st marks church and a modest dinner for a few people afterwards at the bell but father joffroi had informed them the day before that by his calculation at least two thousand people were planning to attend the wedding and they had been forced to move it to the cathedral then it turned out that without their knowledge madge webber had organized a banquet in the guild hall for leading citizens and a picnic in lovers field for everyone else in kingsbridge so in the end it had been the wedding of the year caris smiled at the recollection she had worn a new robe of kingsbridge scarlet a colour the bishop probably thought appropriate for such a woman merthin had dressed in a richly patterned italian coat chestnut brown with gold threads and had seemed to glow with happiness they both had realized belatedly that their drawnout love affair which they had imagined to be a private drama had been entertaining the citizens of kingsbridge for years and everyone wanted to celebrate its happy ending her pleasant memories evaporated as her old enemy philemon mounted the pulpit in the decade since the wedding he had grown quite fat his monkish tonsure and shaved face revealed a ring of blubber around his neck and the priestly robes billowed like a tent he preached a sermon against dissection dead bodies belonged to god he said christians were instructed to bury them in a carefully specified ritual the saved in consecrated ground the unforgiven elsewhere to do anything else with corpses was against gods will to cut them up was sacrilege he said with uncharacteristic passion there was even a tremor in his voice as he asked the congregation to imagine the horrible scene of a body being opened its parts separated and sliced and pored over by socalled medical researchers true christians knew there was no excuse for these ghoulish men and women the phrase men and women was not often heard from philemons mouth caris thought and could not be without significance she glanced at her husband standing next to her in the nave and he raised his eyebrows in an expression of concern the prohibition against examining corpses was standard dogma propounded by the church since before caris could remember but it had been relaxed since the plague progressive younger clergymen were vividly aware of how badly the church had failed its people then and they were keen to change the way medicine was taught and practised by priests however conservative senior clergy clung to the old ways and blocked any change in policy the upshot was that dissection was banned in principle and tolerated in practice caris had been performing dissections at her new hospital from the start she never talked about it outside the building there was no point in upsetting the superstitious but she did it every chance she got in recent years she had usually been joined by one or two younger monkphysicians many trained doctors never saw inside the body except when treating very bad wounds traditionally the only carcases they were allowed to open were those of pigs thought to be the animals most like humans in their anatomy caris was puzzled as well as worried by philemons attack he had always hated her she knew though she had never been sure why but since the great standoff in the snowfall of he had ignored her as if in compensation for his loss of power over the town he had furnished his palace with precious objects tapestries carpets silver tableware stainedglass windows illuminated manuscripts he had become ever more grand demanding elaborate deference from his monks and novices wearing gorgeous robes for services and travelling when he had to go to other towns in a charette that was furnished like a duchesss boudoir there were several important visiting clergymen in the choir for the service bishop henri of shiring archbishop piers of monmouth and archdeacon reginald of york and presumably philemon was hoping to impress them with this outburst of doctrinal conservatism but to what end was he looking for promotion the archbishop was ill he had been carried into the church but surely philemon could not aspire to that post it was something of a miracle that the son of joby from wigleigh should have risen to be prior of kingsbridge besides elevation from prior to archbishop would be an unusually big jump a bit like going from knight to duke without becoming a baron or an earl in between only a special favourite could hope for such a rapid rise however there was no limit to philemons ambition it was not that he felt himself to be superbly well qualified caris thought that had been godwyns attitude arrogant selfconfidence godwyn had assumed that god made him prior because he was the cleverest man in town philemon was at the opposite extreme in his heart he believed he was a nobody his life was a campaign to convince himself that he was not completely worthless he was so sensitive to rejection that he could not bear to consider himself undeserving of any post no matter how lofty she thought of speaking to bishop henri after the service she might remind him of the tenyearold agreement that the prior of kingsbridge had no jurisdiction over the hospital of st elizabeth on leper island which came under the bishops direct control so that any attack on the hospital was an attack on the rights and privileges of henri himself but on further reflection she realized that such a protest would confirm to the bishop that she was conducting dissections and turn what might now be only a vague suspicion easily ignored into a known fact that must be dealt with so she decided to remain silent standing beside her were merthins two nephews the sons of earl ralph gerry age thirteen and roley ten both boys were enrolled in the monks school they lived in the priory but spent much of their free time with merthin and caris at their house on the island merthin had his hand resting casually on the shoulder of roley only three people in the world knew that roley was not his nephew but his son they were merthin himself caris and the boys mother philippa merthin tried not to show special favour to roley but found it hard to disguise his true feelings and was especially delighted when roley learned something new or did well at school caris often thought about the child she had conceived with merthin and then aborted she always imagined it to have been a girl she would be a woman now caris mused twentythree years old probably married with children of her own the thought was like the ache of an old wound painful but too familiar to be distressing when the service was over they all left together the boys were invited to sunday dinner as always outside the cathedral merthin turned to look back at the tower that now soared high over the middle of the church as he examined his almostfinished work frowning at some detail visible only to him caris studied him fondly she had known him since he was eleven years old and had loved him almost as long he was fortyfive now his red hair was receding from his brow and stood up around his head like a curly halo he had carried his left arm stiffly ever since a small carved stone corbel dropped from the scaffolding by a careless mason had fallen on his shoulder but he still had the expression of boyish eagerness that had drawn the tenyearold caris to him on all hallows day a third of a century ago she turned to share his view the tower appeared to stand neatly on the four sides of the crossing and to be exactly two bays square even though in fact its weight was held up by massive buttresses built into the exterior corners of the transepts which themselves rested on new foundations separate from the old original ones the tower looked light and airy with slender columns and multiple window openings through which you could see blue sky in fine weather above the square top of the tower a web of scaffolding was rising for the final stage the spire when caris brought her gaze back down to ground level she saw her sister approaching alice was only a year older at fortyfive but caris felt she was from another generation her husband elfric had died in the plague but she had not remarried becoming frumpy as if she thought that was how a widow should be caris had quarrelled with alice many years ago over elfrics treatment of merthin the passage of time had blunted the edge of their mutual hostility but there was still a resentful tilt to alices head when she said hello with her was griselda her stepdaughter though only a year younger than alice griseldas son known as merthin bastard stood beside her towering over her a big man with superficial charm just like his father the longgone thurstan and about as different from merthin bridger as could be also with her was her sixteenyearold daughter petranilla griseldas husband harold mason had taken over the business after elfric died he was not much of a builder according to merthin but he was doing all right although he did not have the monopoly of priory repairs and extensions that had made elfric rich he stood next to merthin now and said people think youre going to build the spire with no formwork caris understood formwork or centering was the wooden frame that held the masonry in place until the mortar dried merthin said not much room for formwork inside that narrow spire and how would it be supported his tone was polite but caris could tell from its briskness that he did not like harold i could believe it if the spire was going to be round caris understood this too a round spire could be built by placing one circle of stones on top of another each a little narrower than the last no formwork was needed because the circle was selfsupporting the stones could not fall inwards because they pressed on one another the same was not true of any shape with corners youve seen the drawings merthin said its an octagon the corner turrets on the top of the square tower faced diagonally outwards easing the eye as it progressed upwards to the different shape of the narrower spire merthin had copied this feature from chartres but it made sense only if the tower was octagonal harold said but how can you build an octagonal tower without formwork wait and see said merthin and he moved away as they walked down the main street caris said why wont you tell people how youre going to do it so that they cant fire me he replied when i was building the bridge as soon as id done the hard part they got rid of me and hired someone cheaper i remember they cant do that now because no one else can build the spire you were a youngster then now youre alderman no one would dare sack you perhaps not but its nice to feel they cant at the bottom of the main street where the old bridge had stood there was a disreputable tavern called the white horse caris saw merthins sixteenyearold daughter lolla leaning on the wall outside with a group of older friends lolla was an attractive girl with olive skin and lustrous dark hair a generous mouth and sultry brown eyes the group was crowded around a dice game and they were all drinking ale from large tankards caris was sorry though not surprised to see her stepdaughter carousing on the street at midday merthin was angry he went up to lolla and took her arm youd better come home for your dinner he said in a tight voice she tossed her head shaking her thick hair in a gesture that was undoubtedly meant for the eyes of someone other than her father i dont want to go home im happy here she said i didnt ask what you wanted merthin replied and he jerked her away from the others a goodlooking boy of about twenty detached himself from the crowd he had curly hair and a mocking smile and he was picking his teeth with a twig caris recognized jake riley a lad of no particular profession who nevertheless always seemed to have money to spend he sauntered over whats going on he said he spoke with the twig sticking out of his mouth like an insult none of your damn business merthin said jake stood in his way the girl doesnt want to leave youd better get out of my way son unless you want to spend the rest of the day in the town stocks caris froze with anxiety merthin was in the right he was entitled to discipline lolla who was still five years short of adulthood but jake was the kind of boy who might punch him anyway and take the consequences however caris did not intervene knowing it might make merthin angry with her instead of with jake jake said i suppose youre her father you know perfectly well who i am and you can call me alderman and speak respectfully to me or suffer the consequences jake stared insolently at merthin a moment longer then turned aside casually saying yes all right caris was relieved that the confrontation had not turned into fisticuffs merthin never got into fights but lolla was capable of driving him to distraction they walked on towards the bridge lolla shook herself free of her fathers grasp and walked on ahead arms folded under her breasts head down frowning and muttering to herself in a fulldress sulk this was not the first time lolla had been seen in bad company merthin was horrified and enraged that his little girl should be so determined to seek out such people why does she do it he said to caris as they followed lolla across the bridge to leper island god knows caris had observed that this kind of behaviour was more common in youngsters who had suffered the loss of a parent after silvia died lolla had been mothered by bessie bell lady philippa merthins housekeeper em and of course caris herself perhaps she was confused about who she should obey but caris did not voice this thought as it might seem to suggest that merthin had somehow failed as a parent i had terrible fights with aunt petranilla when i was that age what about similar things she didnt like me spending time with mattie wise thats completely different you didnt go to low taverns with rogues petranilla thought mattie was bad company its not the same i suppose not you learned a lot from mattie lolla was undoubtedly learning a lot from handsome jake riley but caris kept that inflammatory thought to herself merthin was furious enough already the island was entirely built up now and an integral part of the city it even had its own parish church where once they had wandered across waste ground they now followed a footpath that ran straight between houses and turned sharp corners the rabbits had long gone the hospital occupied most of the western end although caris went there every day she still felt a glow of pride when she looked at the clean grey stonework the large windows in regular rows and the chimneys lined up like soldiers they passed through a gate into merthins grounds the orchard was mature and blossom covered the apple trees like snow as always they went in through the kitchen door the house had a grand entrance on the river side which no one ever used even a brilliant architect can make a mistake caris thought with amusement but once again she decided to give the thought no voice today lolla stamped upstairs to her room from the front room a woman called hello everyone the two boys rushed into the parlour with glad cries it was their mother philippa merthin and caris greeted her warmly caris and philippa had become sistersinlaw when caris married merthin but their past rivalry had continued to make caris feel awkward in philippas presence for some years eventually the boys had brought them together when first gerry then roley enrolled at the priory school it was natural for merthin to look after his nephews and then it became normal for philippa to call at merthins house whenever she was in kingsbridge at first caris had felt jealous of philippa for having attracted merthin sexually merthin had never tried to pretend that his love for philippa had been merely superficial he clearly still cared about her but philippa nowadays cut a sad figure she was fortynine and looked older her hair grey and her face lined with disappointment she lived now for her children she was a frequent guest of her daughter odila the countess of monmouth and when she was not there she often visited kingsbridge priory to be close to her sons she managed to spend very little time at earlscastle with her husband ralph ive got to take the boys to shiring she said explaining her presence here ralph wants them to attend the county court with him he says its a necessary part of their education hes right caris said gerry would be the earl if he lived long enough and if he did not roley would inherit the title so they both needed to be familiar with courts philippa added i intended to be in the cathedral for the easter service but my charette broke a wheel and i made an overnight stop well now that youre here lets have dinner caris said they went into the dining hall caris opened the windows that looked on to the river cool fresh air came in she wondered what merthin would do about lolla he said nothing leaving her to stew upstairs to cariss relief a brooding adolescent at the dinner table could bring down everyones spirits they ate mutton boiled with leeks merthin poured red wine and philippa drank thirstily she had become fond of wine perhaps it was her consolation while they were eating em came in looking anxious theres somebody at the kitchen door to see the mistress she said merthin said impatiently well who is it he wouldnt mention his name but he said the mistress would know him what kind of person a young man by his clothes a peasant not a town dweller em had a snobbish dislike of villagers well he sounds harmless let him come in a moment later in walked a tall figure with a hood pulled forward to cover most of his face when he drew it back caris recognized gwendas elder son sam caris had known him all his life she had seen him born had watched his slimy head emerge from the small body of his mother she had observed him as he grew and changed and became a man she saw wulfric in him now in the way he walked and stood and raised a hand slightly as he was about to speak she had always suspected that wulfric was not in fact his father but close as she was to gwenda she had never mentioned her doubt some questions were better left unasked however the suspicion had inevitably returned when she heard that sam was wanted for the murder of jonno reeve for sam when born had had a look of ralph now he came up to caris lifted his hand in that gesture of wulfrics hesitated then went down on one knee save me please he said caris was horrified how can i save you hide me ive been on the run for days i left oldchurch in the dark and walked through the night and ive hardly rested since just now i tried to buy something to eat in a tavern and someone recognized me and i had to run he looked so desperate that she felt a surge of compassion nevertheless she said but you cant hide here youre wanted for murder it was no murder it was a fight jonno struck first he hit me with a leg iron look sam touched his face in two places ear and nose to indicate two scabbed gashes the physician in caris could not help noting that the injuries were about five days old and the nose was healing well enough though the ear really needed a stitch but her main thought was that sam should not be here you have to face justice she said theyll take jonnos side theyre sure to i ran away from wigleigh for higher wages in outhenby jonno was trying to take me back theyll say he was entitled to chain a runaway you should have thought of that before you hit him he said accusingly you employed runaways at outhenby when you were prioress she was stung runaways yes killers no they will hang me caris was torn how could she turn him away merthin spoke there are two reasons why you cant hide here sam one is that its a crime to conceal a fugitive and im not willing to put myself on the wrong side of the law for your sake fond though i am of your mother but the second reason is that everyone knows your mother is an old friend of cariss and if the kingsbridge constables are searching for you this is the first place they will look is it sam said he was not very bright caris knew his brother davey had all the brains merthin said you could hardly think of a worse place than this to hide he softened drink a cup of wine and take a loaf of bread with you and get out of town he said more kindly ill have to find mungo constable and report that you were here but i can walk slowly he poured wine into a wooden cup thank you your only hope is to go far away where you arent known and start a new life youre a strong boy youll always find work go to london and join a ship and dont get into fights philippa said suddenly i remember your mother gwenda sam nodded philippa turned to caris i met her at casterham when william was alive she came to me about that girl in wigleigh who had been raped by ralph annet yes philippa turned back to sam you must be the baby she had in her arms at the time your mother is a good woman im sorry for her sake that youre in trouble there was a moment of quiet sam drained the cup caris was thinking as no doubt philippa and merthin were too about the passage of time and how it can change an innocent beloved baby into a man who commits murder in the silence they heard voices it sounded like several men at the kitchen door sam looked around him like a trapped bear one door led to the kitchen the other outside to the front of the house he dashed to the front door flung it open and ran out without pausing he headed down towards the river a moment later em opened the door from the kitchen and mungo constable came into the dining hall with four deputies crowding behind him all carrying wooden clubs merthin pointed at the front door he just left after him lads said mungo and they all ran through the room and out of the door caris stood up and hurried outside and the others followed her the house was built on a low rocky bluff only three or four feet high the river flowed rapidly past the foot of the little cliff to the left merthins graceful bridge spanned the water to the right was a muddy beach across the river trees were coming into leaf in the old plague graveyard pokey little suburban hovels had grown up like weeds either side of the cemetery sam could have turned left or right and caris saw with a feeling of despair that he had made the wrong choice he had gone right which led nowhere she saw him running along the foreshore his boots leaving big impressions in the mud the constables were chasing him like dogs after a hare she felt sorry for sam as she always felt sorry for the hare it was nothing to do with justice merely that he was the quarry seeing he had nowhere to go he waded into the water mungo had stayed on the paved footpath at the front of the house and now he turned in the opposite direction to the left and ran towards the bridge two of the deputies dropped their clubs pulled off their boots got out of their coats and jumped into the water in their undershirts the other two stood on the shoreline presumably unable to swim or perhaps unwilling to jump into the water on a cold day the two swimmers struck out after sam sam was strong but his heavy winter coat was now sodden and dragging him down caris watched with horrid fascination as the deputies gained on him there was a shout from the other direction mungo had reached the bridge and was running across and he had stopped to beckon the two nonswimming deputies to follow him they acknowledged his signal and ran after him he continued across the bridge sam reached the far shore just before the swimmers caught up with him he gained his footing and staggered through the shallows shaking his head water running from his clothing he turned and saw a deputy almost on him the man stumbled bending forward inadvertently and sam swiftly kicked him in the face with a heavy waterlogged boot the deputy cried out and fell back the second deputy was more cautious he approached sam then stopped still out of reach sam turned and ran forward coming out of the water on to the turf of the plague graveyard but the deputy followed him sam stopped again and the deputy stopped sam realized he was being toyed with he gave a roar of anger and rushed at his tormentor the deputy ran back but he had the river behind him he ran into the shallows but the water slowed him and sam was able to catch him sam grabbed the man by the shoulders turned him and headbutted him on the far side of the river caris heard a crack as the poor mans nose broke sam tossed him aside and he fell spurting blood into the river water sam turned again for the shore but mungo was waiting for him now sam was lower down the slope of the foreshore and hampered by the water mungo rushed at him stopped let him come forward then raised his heavy wooden club he feinted sam dodged then mungo struck hitting sam on the top of his head it looked a dreadful blow and caris herself gasped with shock as if she had been hit sam roared with pain and reflexively put his hands over his head mungo experienced in fighting with strong young men hit him again with the club this time in his unprotected ribs sam fell into the water the two deputies who had run across the bridge now arrived on the scene both jumped on sam holding him down in the shallows the two he had wounded took their revenge kicking and punching him savagely while their colleagues held him down when there was no fight left in him they at last let up and dragged him out of the water mungo swiftly tied sams hands behind his back then the constables marched the fugitive back towards the town how awful said caris poor gwenda the town of shiring had a carnival air during sessions of the county court all the inns around the square were busy their parlours crowded with men and women dressed in their best clothes all shouting for drinks and food the town naturally took the opportunity to hold a market and the square itself was so closely packed with stalls that it took half an hour to move a couple of hundred yards as well as the legitimate stallholders there were dozens of strolling entrepreneurs bakers with trays of buns a busking fiddle player maimed and blind beggars prostitutes showing their breasts a dancing bear a preaching friar earl ralph was one of the few people who could cross the square quickly he rode with three knights ahead of him and a handful of servants behind and his entourage went through the melee like a ploughshare turning the crowd aside by the force of their momentum and their carelessness for the safety of people in their way they rode on up the hill to the sheriffs castle in the courtyard they wheeled with a flourish and dismounted the servants immediately began shouting for ostlers and porters ralph liked people to know he had arrived he was tense the son of his old enemy was about to be tried for murder he was on the brink of the sweetest revenge imaginable but some part of him feared it might not happen he was so on edge that he felt slightly ashamed he would not have wanted his knights to know how much this meant to him he was careful to conceal even from alan fernhill how eager he was that sam should hang he was afraid something would go wrong at the last minute no one knew better than he how the machinery of justice could fail after all he himself had escaped hanging twice he would sit on the judges bench during the trial as was his right and do his best to make sure there was no upset he handed his reins to a groom and looked around the castle was not a military fortification it was more like a tavern with a courtyard though strongly built and well guarded the sheriff of shiring could live here safe from the vengeful relatives of the people he arrested there were basement dungeons in which to keep prisoners and guest apartments where visiting judges could stay unmolested sheriff bernard showed ralph to his room the sheriff was the kings representative in the county responsible for collecting taxes as well as administering justice the post was lucrative the salary usefully supplemented by gifts bribes and percentages skimmed off the top of fines and forfeited bail money the relationship between earl and sheriff could be fractious the earl ranked higher but the sheriffs judicial power was independent bernard a rich wool merchant of about ralphs age treated ralph with an uneasy mixture of camaraderie and deference philippa was waiting for ralph in the apartment set aside for them her long grey hair was tied up in an elaborate headdress and she wore an expensive coat in drab shades of grey and brown her haughty manner had once made her a proud beauty but now she just looked like a grumpy old woman she might have been his mother he greeted his sons gerry and roley he was not sure how to deal with children and he had never seen much of his own as babies they had been cared for by women of course and now they were at the monks school he addressed them somewhat as if they were squires in his service giving them orders at one moment and joshing them in a friendly way the next he would find them easier to talk to when they were older it did not seem to matter they regarded him as a hero whatever he did tomorrow you shall sit on the judges bench in the court room he said i want you to see how justice is done gerry the elder said can we look around the market this afternoon yes get dickie to go with you dickie was one of the earlscastle servants here take some money to spend he gave them each a handful of silver pennies the boys went out ralph sat down across the room from philippa he never touched her and tried always to keep his distance so that it would not happen by accident he felt sure that she dressed and acted like an old woman to make sure he was not attracted to her she also went to church every day it was a strange relationship for two people who had once conceived a child together but they had been stuck in it for years and it would never change at least it left him free to fondle servant girls and tumble tavern wenches however they had to talk about the children philippa had strong views and over the years ralph had realized it was easier to discuss things with her rather than make unilateral decisions and then have a fight when she disagreed now ralph said gerald is old enough to be a squire philippa said i agree good said ralph surprised he had expected an argument ive already spoke to david monmouth about him she added that explained her willingness she was one jump ahead i see he said playing for time david agrees and suggests we send him as soon as he is fourteen gerry was only just thirteen philippa was in fact postponing gerrys departure by almost a year but this was not ralphs main worry david earl of monmouth was married to philippas daughter odila being a squire is supposed to turn a boy into a man ralph said but gerry will get too easy a ride with david his stepsister is fond of him shell probably protect him he could have it too soft after a moments reflection he added i expect thats why you want him to go there she did not deny it but said i thought you would be glad to strengthen your alliance with the earl of monmouth she had a point david was ralphs most important ally in the nobility placing gerry in the monmouth household would create another bond between the two earls david might become fond of the boy in later years perhaps davids sons would be squires at earlscastle such family connections were priceless will you undertake to make sure the boy isnt mollycoddled there ralph said of course well all right then good im glad thats settled philippa stood up but ralph was not finished now what about roley he could go too so that they would be together philippa did not like this idea at all ralph could tell but she was too clever to contradict him flatly roleys a bit young she said as if thinking it over and he hasnt properly learned his letters yet letters arent as important to a nobleman as learning to fight after all he is second in line to the earldom if anything should happen to gerry which god forbid amen all the same i think he should wait until hes fourteen i dont know roleys always been a bit womanish sometimes he reminds me of my brother merthin he saw a flash of fear in her eyes she was afraid of letting her baby go he guessed he was tempted to insist just to torture her but ten was young for a squire well see he said noncommittally hell have to be toughened up sooner or later all in good time said philippa the judge sir lewis abingdon was not a local man but a london lawyer from the kings court sent on tour to try serious cases in countycourts he was a beefy type with a pink face and a fair beard he was also ten years younger than ralph ralph told himself he should not be surprised he was now fortyfour half his own generation had been wiped out by the plague nevertheless he continued to be startled by distinguished and powerful men who were younger than he they waited with gerry and roley in a side chamber at the courthouse inn while the jury assembled and the prisoners were brought down from the castle it turned out that sir lewis had been at crécy as a young squire though ralph did not recall him he treated ralph with wary courtesy ralph tried subtly to probe the judge and find out how tough he was the statute of labourers is difficult to enforce we find he said when peasants see a way to make money they lose all respect for the law for every runaway who is working for an illegal wage there is an employer who is paying it the judge said exactly the nuns of kingsbridge priory have never obeyed the statute difficult to prosecute nuns i dont see why sir lewis changed the subject you have a special interest in this mornings proceedings he asked he had probably been told that it was unusual for ralph to exercise his right to sit beside the judge the murderer is a serf of mine ralph admitted but the main reason im here is to give these boys a look at how justice works one of them is likely to be the earl when i give up the ghost they can watch the hangings tomorrow too the sooner they get used to seeing men die the better lewis nodded agreement the sons of the nobility cannot afford to be softhearted they heard the clerk of the court bang his gavel and the hubbub from the next room died down ralphs anxiety was not allayed sir lewiss conversation had not told him much perhaps that in itself was revealing it might mean he was not easily influenced the judge opened the door and stood aside for the earl to go first at the near end of the room two large wooden chairs were set on a dais next to them was a low bench a murmur of interest arose from the crowd as gerry and roley sat on the bench the people were always fascinated to see the children who would grow into their overlords but more than that ralph thought there was a look of innocence about the two prepubescent boys that was strikingly out of place in a court whose business was violence theft and dishonesty they looked like lambs in a pigpen ralph sat in one of the two chairs and thought of the day twentytwo years ago when he had stood in this very courtroom as a criminal accused of rape a ludicrous charge to bring against a lord when the socalled victim was one of his own serfs philippa had been behind that malicious prosecution well he had made her suffer for it at that trial ralph had fought his way out of the room as soon as the jury pronounced him guilty and then had been pardoned when he joined the kings army and went to france sam was not going to escape he had no weapon and his ankles were chained and the french wars seemed to have petered out so there were no more free pardons ralph studied sam as the indictment was read he had wulfrics build not gwendas he was a tall lad broad across the shoulders he might have made a useful manatarms if he had been more nobly born he did not really look like wulfric though something about the cast of his features rang a bell like so many accused men he wore an expression of superficial defiance overlaying fear thats just how i felt ralph thought nathan reeve was the first witness he was the father of the dead man but more importantly he testified that sam was a serf of earl ralphs and had not been given leave to go to oldchurch he said he had sent his son jonno to follow gwenda in the hope of tracking down the runaway he was not likeable but his grief was clearly genuine ralph was pleased it was damning testimony sams mother was standing next to him the top of her head level with her sons shoulder gwenda was not beautiful her dark eyes were set close to a beaky nose and her forehead and chin both receded sharply giving her the look of a determined rodent yet there was something strongly sexual about her even in middle age it was more than twenty years since ralph had lain with her but he remembered her as if it were yesterday they had done it in a room at the bell in kingsbridge and he had made her kneel up on the bed he could picture it now and the memory of her compact body excited him she had a lot of dark hair he recollected suddenly she met his eye she held his gaze and seemed to sense what he was thinking on that bed she had been indifferent and motionless to begin with accepting his thrusts passively because he had coerced her but at the end something strange had come over her and almost against her own will she had moved in rhythm with him she must have remembered the same thing for an expression of shame came over her plain face and she looked quickly away next to her was another young man presumably the second son this one was more like her small and wiry with a crafty look about him he met ralphs gaze with a stare of intense concentration as if he was curious what went on in the mind of an earl and thought he might find the answer in ralphs face but ralph was most interested in the father he had hated wulfric since their fight at the fleece fair of he touched his broken nose reflexively several other men had wounded him in later years but none had hurt his pride so badly however ralphs revenge on wulfric had been terrible i deprived him of his birthright for a decade ralph thought i lay with his wife i gave him that scar across his cheek when he tried to stop me escaping from this very courtroom i dragged him home when he tried to run away and now im going to hang his son wulfric was heavier than he used to be but he carried it well he had a saltandpepper beard that did not grow over the long scar of the sword wound ralph had given him his face was lined and weatherbeaten where gwenda looked angry wulfric was griefstricken as the peasants of oldchurch testified that sam had killed jonno with an oak spade gwendas eyes flashed defiance whereas wulfrics broad forehead creased in anguish the foreman of the jury asked whether sam had been in fear for his life ralph was displeased the question implied an excuse for the killer a thin peasant with one eye responded he wasnt in fear of the bailiff no i think he was scared of his mother though the crowd tittered the foreman asked whether jonno had provoked the attack another question that bothered ralph by indicating sympathy for sam provoked said the oneeyed man only by hitting him across the face with a leg iron if you call that provoking they laughed loudly wulfric looked bewildered how can people be amused his expression said when my sons life is at stake ralph was feeling more anxious the foreman seemed unsound sam was called to testify and ralph noticed that the young man resembled wulfric more when he spoke there was a tilt of the head and a gesture of the hand that immediately brought wulfric to mind sam told how he had offered to meet jonno the following morning and jonno had responded by trying to put an iron on his leg ralph spoke to the judge in an undertone none of this makes any difference he said with suppressed indignation whether he was in fear whether he was provoked whether he offered to meet the following day sir lewis said nothing ralph said the bare fact is that hes a runaway and he killed the man who came to fetch him he certainly did that said sir lewis guardedly giving ralph no satisfaction ralph looked at the spectators while the jury questioned sam merthin was in the crowd with his wife before becoming a nun caris had enjoyed dressing fashionably and after renouncing her vows she had reverted to type today she wore a gown made of two contrasting fabrics one blue and the other green with a furtrimmed cloak of kingsbridge scarlet and a little round hat ralph remembered that caris had been a childhood friend of gwendas in fact she had been there the day they all saw thomas langley kill two menatarms in the woods merthin and caris would be hoping for gwendas sake that sam would be treated mercifully not if i have anything to do with it ralph thought cariss successor as prioress mother joan was in court presumably because the nunnery owned the vale of outhenby and was therefore the illegal employer of sam joan ought to be in the dock with the accused ralph thought but when he caught her eye she gave him an accusing glance as if she thought the murder was his fault more than hers the prior of kingsbridge had not shown up sam was prior philemons nephew but philemon would not want to draw attention to the fact that he was the uncle of a murderer philemon had once had a protective affection for his younger sister ralph recalled but perhaps that had faded with the years sams grandfather the disreputable joby was present a whitehaired old man now bent and toothless why was he here he had been at odds with gwenda for years and was not likely to have much affection for his grandson he had probably come to steal coins from peoples purses while they were absorbed in the trial sam stood down and sir lewis spoke briefly his summingup pleased ralph was sam wigleigh a runaway he asked did jonno reeve have the right to arrest him and did sam kill jonno with his spade if the answer to all three questions is yes then sam is guilty of murder ralph was surprised and relieved there was no nonsense about whether sam was provoked the judge was sound after all what is your verdict the judge asked ralph looked at wulfric the man was stricken this is what happens to those who defy me ralph thought and he wished he could say it out loud wulfric caught his eye ralph held his gaze trying to read wulfrics mind what emotion was there ralph saw that it was fear wulfric had never shown fear to ralph before but now he crumbled his son was going to die and that had weakened him fatally a profound satisfaction filled ralphs being as he stared into wulfrics frightened eyes i have crushed you at last he thought after twentyfour years finally youre scared the jury conferred the foreman seemed to be arguing with the others ralph watched them impatiently surely they could not be in doubt after what the judge had said but there was no certainty with juries it cant all go wrong at this stage ralph thought can it they seemed to come to a resolution though he could not guess who had prevailed the foreman stood up we find sam wigleigh guilty of murder he said ralph kept his eyes fixed on his old enemy wulfric looked as if he had been stabbed his face went pale and he closed his eyes as if in pain ralph tried not to smile in triumph sir lewis turned to ralph and ralph tore his gaze away from wulfric what are your thoughts about the sentence said the judge theres only one choice as far as im concerned sir lewis nodded the jury has made no recommendation for mercy they dont want a runaway to get away with murdering his bailiff the ultimate penalty then of course the judge turned back to the court ralph locked his gaze on wulfric again everyone else looked at sir lewis the judge said sam wigleigh you have murdered the son of your bailiff and you are sentenced to death you shall be hanged in shiring market square tomorrow at dawn and may god have mercy on your soul wulfric staggered the younger son grabbed his fathers arm and held him upright otherwise he might have fallen to the floor let him drop ralph wanted to say hes finished ralph looked at gwenda she was holding sams hand but she was looking at ralph her expression surprised him he expected grief tears screams hysterics but she stared back at him steadily there was hatred in her eyes and something else defiance unlike her husband she did not look crushed she did not believe the case was over she looked ralph thought with dismay as if she had something up her sleeve caris was in tears as sam was taken away but merthin could not pretend to be griefstricken it was a tragedy for gvenda and he felt desperately sorry for wulfric however it was no bad thing for the rest of the world that sam should be hanged jonno reeve had been carrying out the law it might well be a bad law an unjust law an oppressive law but that did not give sam the right to kill jonno after all nate reeve was also bereaved the fact that nobody liked nate made no difference a thief was brought up before the bench and merthin and caris left the courtroom and went into the parlour of the tavern merthin got some wine and poured a cup for caris a moment later gwenda came up to where they sat its noon she said we have eighteen hours to save sam merthin looked up at her in surprise what do you propose he said we must get ralph to ask the king to pardon him that seemed highly unlikely how would you persuade him to do that i cant obviously gwenda said but you can merthin felt trapped he did not believe sam deserved a pardon on the other hand it was hard to refuse a pleading mother he said i intervened with my brother on your behalf once before do you remember of course gwenda said over wulfric not inheriting his fathers land he turned me down flat i know she said but you have to try im not sure im the best person who else would he even listen to that was right merthin had little chance of success but no one else had any caris could see that he was reluctant and she threw her weight in on gwendas side please merthin she said think how you would feel if it was lolla he was about to say that girls dont get into fights then he realized that in lollas case it was all too likely he sighed i think this is a doomed enterprise he said he looked at caris but for your sake ill try gwenda said why dont you go now because ralph is still in court its almost dinner time theyll be finished soon you could wait in the private chamber he had to admire her resolve all right he said he left the parlour and walked around to the back of the tavern a guard was standing outside the judges private room im the earls brother merthin said to the sentry alderman merthin of kingsbridge yes alderman i know you the guard said im sure it will be all right for you to wait inside merthin went into the little room and sat down he felt uncomfortable asking his brother for a favour the two of them had not been close for decades ralph had long ago turned into something merthin did not recognize merthin did not know the man who could rape annet and murder tilly it seemed impossible that such a one could have grown from the boy merthin had called his brother since their parents had died they had not met except on formal occasions and even then they spoke little it was presumptuous of him to use their relationship as justification for asking for a privilege he would not have done it for gwenda but for caris he had to he did not wait long after a few minutes the judge and the earl came in merthin noticed that his brothers limp the result of a wound suffered in the french wars was getting worse as he aged sir lewis recognized merthin and shook hands ralph did the same and said ironically a visit from my brother is a rare pleasure it was not an unfair jibe and merthin acknowledged it with a nod on the other hand he said i suppose that if anyone is entitled to plead with you for mercy i am what need do you have of mercy did you kill someone not yet sir lewis chuckled ralph said what then you and i have known gwenda since we were all children together ralph nodded i shot her dog with that bow you made merthin had forgotten that incident it was an early sign of how ralph was going to turn out he realized with hindsight perhaps you owe her mercy on that account i think nate reeves son is worth more than a damn dog dont you i didnt mean to suggest otherwise just that you might balance cruelty then with kindness now balance ralph said with anger rising in his voice and merthin knew then that his cause was lost balance he tapped his broken nose what should i balance against this he pointed a finger aggressively at merthin ill tell you why i wont give sam a pardon because i looked at wulfrics face in the courtroom today as his son was declared guilty of murder and do you know what i saw there fear that insolent peasant is afraid of me at last he has been tamed he means so much to you id hang six men to see that look merthin was ready to give up then he thought of gwendas grief and he tried once more if youve conquered him your work is done isnt it he argued so let the boy go ask the king for a pardon no i want to keep wulfric the way he is merthin wished he had not come putting pressure on ralph only brought out the worst in him merthin was appalled by his vengefulness and malice he never wanted to speak to his brother again the feeling was familiar he had been through this with ralph before somehow it always came as a shock to be reminded of what he was really like merthin turned away well i had to try he said goodbye ralph became cheery come up to the castle for dinner he said the sheriff lays a good table bring caris well have a real talk philippas with me you like her dont you merthin had no intention of going let me speak to caris he said caris would rather have dinner with lucifer he knew i may see you later then merthin made his escape he returned to the parlour caris and gwenda looked expectantly at him as he crossed the room he shook his head i did my best he said im sorry gwenda had expected this she was disappointed but not surprised she had felt she had to try through merthin the other remedy she had at her disposal was so much more drastic she thanked merthin perfunctorily and left the inn heading for the castle on the hill wulfric and davey had gone to a cheap tavern in the suburbs where they could get a filling dinner for a farthing wulfric was no good at this sort of thing anyway his strength and honesty were useless in negotiations with ralph and his kind besides wulfric could not be allowed even to know about how she hoped to persuade ralph as she was walking up the hill she heard horses behind her she stopped and turned it was ralph and his entourage with the judge she stood still and looked hard at ralph making sure he caught her eye as he passed he would guess she was coming to see him a few minutes later she entered the courtyard of the castle but access to the sheriffs house was barred she made her way to the porch of the main building and spoke to the marshal of the hall my name is gwenda from wigleigh she said please tell earl ralph i need to see him in private yes yes said the marshal look around you all these people need to see the earl the judge or the sheriff there were twenty or thirty people standing around the courtyard some clutching rolls of parchment gwenda was prepared to take a terrible risk to save her son from hanging but she would not get the opportunity unless she succeeded in speaking to ralph before dawn how much she said to the marshal he looked at her with a little less disrespect i cant promise hell see you you can give him my name two shillings twentyfour silver pennies it was a lot of money but gwenda had all their savings in her purse however she was not yet ready to hand over the money what is my name she said i dont know i just told you how can you give earl ralph my name if you cant remember it he shrugged tell me again gwenda from wigleigh all right ill mention it to him gwenda slipped her hand into her purse brought out a handful of little silver coins and counted twentyfour it was four weeks wages for a labourer she thought of the backbreaking work she had done to earn the money now this idle supercilious doorkeeper was going to get it for doing next to nothing the marshal held out his hand she said whats my name gwenda gwenda from where wigleigh he added thats where this mornings murderer came from isnt it she gave him the money the earl will want to see me she said as forcefully as she could the marshal pocketed the coins gwenda retreated into the courtyard not knowing whether she had wasted her money a moment later she saw a familiar figure with a small head on wide shoulders alan fernhill that was a piece of luck he was crossing from the stables to the hall the other petitioners did not recognize him gwenda stood in his way hello alan she said its sir alan now congratulations will you tell ralph that i want to see him i dont need to ask you what its about say i want to meet him in private alan raised an eyebrow no offence but you were a girl last time youre twenty years older today do you think perhaps we should let him decide of course he grinned insultingly i know he remembers that afternoon at the bell alan had been there of course he had watched gwenda take off her dress and stared at her naked body he had seen her walk to the bed and kneel on the mattress facing away he had laughed coarsely when ralph said she was better looking from behind she hid her revulsion and shame i was hoping he would remember she said as neutrally as she could the other petitioners realized alan must be someone important they began to crowd around speaking to him begging and pleading he pushed them aside and went into the hall gwenda settled down to wait after an hour it was clear ralph was not going to see her before dinner she found a patch of ground that was not too muddy and sat with her back to a stone wall but she never took her eyes off the entrance to the hall a second hour passed and a third noblemens dinners often went on all afternoon gwenda wondered how they could keep on eating and drinking for such a long time why did they not burst she had eaten nothing all day but she was too tense to feel hungry it was grey april weather and the sky began to darken early gwenda shivered on the cold ground but she stayed where she was this was her only chance servants came out and lit torches around the courtyard lights appeared behind the shutters in some of the windows night fell and gwenda realized there were about twelve hours left until dawn she thought of sam sitting on the floor in one of the underground chambers beneath the castle and wondered if he was cold she fought back tears its not over yet she told herself but her courage was weakening a tall figure blocked the light from the nearest torch she looked up to see alan her heart leaped come with me he said she jumped to her feet and moved towards the hall door not that way she looked inquiringly at him you said privately didnt you alan said hes not going to see you in the chamber he shares with the countess come this way she followed him through a small door near the stables he led her through several rooms and up a staircase he opened a door to a narrow bedchamber she stepped inside alan did not follow her in but closed the door from the outside it was a low room almost completely filled by a bedstead ralph stood by the window in his undershirt his boots and outer clothing were piled on the floor his face was flushed with drink but his speech was clear and steady take off your dress he said with a smile of anticipation gwenda said no he looked startled im not taking my clothes off she said why did you tell alan you wanted to see me in private so that you would think i was willing to have sex with you but if not why are you here to beg you to ask the king for a pardon but youre not offering yourself to me why would i i did that once before and you broke your word you reneged on the deal i gave you my body but you didnt give my husband his land she allowed the contempt she felt to be heard in her tone of voice you would do the same again your honour is nothing you remind me of my father ralph coloured it was an insult to tell an earl that he could not be trusted and even more offensive to compare him with a landless labourer who trapped squirrels in the woods angrily he said do you imagine this is the way to persuade me no but youre going get that pardon why because sam is your son ralph stared at her for a moment hah he said contemptuously as if i would believe that he is your son she repeated you cant prove that no i cant she said but you know that i lay with you at the bell in kingsbridge nine months before sam was born true i lay with wulfric too so which of you is his father look at the boy he has some of wulfrics mannerisms yes he has learned those in twentytwo years but look at his features she saw a thoughtful expression appear on ralphs face and knew that something she had said had hit the mark most of all think about his character she said pressing home you heard the evidence at the trial sam didnt just fight jonno off as wulfric would have done he didnt knock him down then help him up again which would have been wulfrics way wulfric is strong and quick to anger but hes tenderhearted sam is not sam hit jonno with a spade a blow that would have knocked any man senseless then before jonno fell sam hit him again even harder although he was already helpless and then before jonnos limp form reached the ground sam hit him a third time if the oldchurch peasants hadnt jumped on sam and restrained him he would have continued to lash out with that bloody spade until jonnos head was smashed to a pulp he wanted to kill she realized she was crying and wiped the tears away with her sleeve ralph was staring at her with a horrified look where does the killer instinct come from ralph she said look in your own black heart sam is your son and god forgive me hes mine when gwenda had gone ralph sat on the bed in the little chamber staring at the flame of the candle was it possible gwenda would lie if it suited her of course there was no question of trusting her but sam could be ralphs son as easily as wulfrics they had both lain with gwenda at the crucial time the truth might never be known for sure even the possibility that sam might be his child was enough to fill ralphs heart with dread was he about to hang his own son the dreadful punishment he had devised for wulfric might be inflicted on himself it was already night the hanging would take place at dawn ralph did not have long to decide he picked up the candle and left the little room he had intended to satisfy a carnal desire there instead he had been given the shock of his life he went outside and crossed the courtyard to the cell block on the ground floor of the building were offices for the sheriffs deputies he went inside and spoke to the man on guard duty i want to see the murderer sam wigleigh very good my lord the jailer said ill show you the way he led ralph into the next room carrying a lamp there was a grating set in the floor and a bad smell ralph looked down through the grating the cell was nine or ten feet deep with stone walls and a dirt floor there was no furniture sam sat on the floor with his back against the wall beside him was a wooden jug presumably containing water a small hole in the floor appeared to be the toilet sam glanced up then looked away indifferently open up said ralph the jailer unlocked the grating with a key it swung up on a hinge i want to go down the jailer was surprised but did not dare argue with an earl he picked up a ladder that was leaning against the wall and slid it into the cell take care please my lord he said nervously remember the villain has nothing to lose ralph climbed down carrying his candle the smell was disgusting but he hardly cared he reached the foot of the ladder and turned sam looked up at him resentfully and said what do you want ralph stared at him he crouched down and held the candle close to sams face studying his features trying to compare them with the face he saw when he looked into a mirror what is it sam said spooked by ralphs intense stare ralph did not answer was this his own child it could be he thought it could easily be sam was a goodlooking boy and ralph had been called handsome in his youth before his nose got broken in court earlier ralph had thought that something about sams face rang a bell and now he concentrated searching his memory trying to think who sam reminded him of that straight nose the darkeyed gaze the head of thick hair that girls would envy then he got it sam looked like ralphs mother the late lady maud dear god he said and it came out as a whisper what said sam his voice betraying fear what is this ralph had to say something your mother he began then he trailed off his throat was constricted with emotion making it difficult for him to get words out he tried again your mother has pleaded for you most eloquently sam looked wary and said nothing he thought ralph had come here to mock him tell me ralph said when you hit jonno with that spade did you mean to kill him you can be honest you have nothing more to fear of course i meant to kill him sam said he was trying to take me in ralph nodded i would have felt the same he said he paused staring at sam then said it again i would have felt the same he stood up turned to the ladder hesitated then turned back and put the candle on the ground next to sam then he climbed up the jailer replaced the grating and locked it ralph said to him there will be no hanging the prisoner will be pardoned i will speak to the sheriff immediately as he left the room the jailer sneezed when merthin and caris returned from shiring to kingsbridge they found that lolla had gone missing their longstanding house servants arn and em were waiting at the garden gate and looked as if they had been stationed there all day em began to speak but burst into incoherent sobs and arn had to break the news we cant find lolla he said distraught we dont know where she is at first merthin misunderstood shell be here by supper time he said dont upset yourself em but she didnt come home last night nor the night before arn said merthin realized then what they meant she had run away a blast of fear like a winter wind chilled his skin and gripped his heart she was only sixteen for a moment he could not think rationally he just pictured her half way between child and adult with the intense darkbrown eyes and sensual mouth of her mother and an expression of blithe false confidence when rationality returned to him he asked himself what had gone wrong he had been leaving lolla in the care of arn and em for a few days at a time ever since she was five years old and she had never come to any harm had something changed he realized that he had hardly spoken to her since easter sunday two weeks ago when he had taken her by the arm and pulled her away from her disreputable friends outside the white horse she had sulked upstairs while the family ate dinner and had not emerged even when sam was arrested she had still been in a snit a few days later when merthin and caris had kissed her goodbye and set out for shiring guilt stabbed him he had treated her harshly and driven her away was silvias ghost watching and despising him for his failure to care for their daughter the thought of lollas disreputable friends came back to him that fellow jake riley is behind this he said have you spoken to him arn no master id better do that right away do you know where he lives he lodges next to the fishmongers behind st pauls church caris said to merthin ill go with you they crossed the bridge back into the city and headed west the parish of st paul took in the industrial premises along the waterfront abattoirs leather tanners sawmills manufactories and the dyers that had sprung up like september mushrooms since the invention of kingsbridge scarlet merthin headed for the squat tower of st pauls church visible over the low roofs of the houses he found the fish shop by smell and knocked at a large rundown house next door it was opened by sal sawyers poor widow of a jobbing carpenter who had died in the plague jake comes and goes alderman she said i havent seen him for a week he can do as he pleases so long as he pays the rent caris said when he left was lolla with him sal warily looked sideways at merthin i dont like to criticize she said merthin said please just tell me what you know i wont be offended shes usually with him she does anything jake wants ill say no more than that if you look for him youll find her do you know where he might have gone he never says can you think of anyone who might know he doesnt bring his friends here except for her but i believe his pals are usually to be found at the white horse merthin nodded well try there thank you sal shell be all right sal said shes just going through a wild phase i hope youre right merthin and caris retraced their steps until they came to the white horse on the riverside near the bridge merthin recalled the orgy he had witnessed here at the height of the plague when the dying davey whitehorse had given away all his ale the place had stood empty for several years afterwards but now it was once again a busy tavern merthin often wondered why it was popular the rooms were cramped and dirty and there were frequent fights about once a year someone was killed there they went into a smoky parlour it was midafternoon but there were a dozen or so desultory drinkers sitting on benches a small group was clustered around a backgammon board and several small piles of silver pennies on the table indicated that money was being wagered on the outcome a redcheeked prostitute called joy looked up hopefully at the newcomers then saw who they were and relapsed into bored indolence in a corner a man was showing a woman an expensivelooking coat apparently offering it for sale but when he saw merthin he folded the garment quickly and put it out of sight and merthin guessed it was stolen property the landlord evan was eating a late dinner of fried bacon he stood up wiping his hands on his tunic and said nervously good day to you alderman an honour to have you in the house may i draw you a pot of ale im looking for my daughter lolla merthin said briskly i havent seen her for a week said evan sal had said exactly the same about jake merthin recalled he said to evan she may be with jake riley yes ive noticed that theyre friendly evan said tactfully hes been gone about the same length of time do you know where he went hes a closelipped type is jake said evan if you asked him how far it was to shiring hed shake his head and frown and say it was none of his business to know such things the whore joy had been listening to the conversation and now she chipped in hes openhanded though she said fairs fair merthin gave her a hard look and where does his money come from horses she said he goes around the villages buying foals from peasants and sells them in the towns he probably stole horses from unwary travellers too merthin thought sourly is that what hes doing now buying horses evan said very likely the big fair season is coming up he could be acquiring his stockintrade and perhaps lolla went with him not wishing to give offence alderman but its quite likely its not you who has given offence merthin said he nodded a curt farewell and left the tavern with caris following thats what shes done he said angrily shes gone off with jake she probably thinks its a great adventure im afraid i think youre right caris said i hope she doesnt become pregnant i wish that was the worst i feared they headed automatically for home crossing the bridge merthin stopped at the highest point and looked out over the suburban rooftops to the forest beyond his little girl was somewhere out there with a shady horse dealer she was in danger and there was nothing he could do to protect her when merthin went to the cathedral the next morning to check on the new tower he found that all work had stopped priors orders said brother thomas when merthin questioned him thomas was almost sixty years old and showing his age his soldierly physique was bent and he shuffled around the precincts unsteadily theres been a collapse in the south aisle he added merthin glanced at bartelmy french a gnarled old mason from normandy who was sitting outside the lodge sharpening a chisel bartelmy shook his head in silent negation that collapse was twentyfour years ago brother thomas merthin said ah yes youre right said thomas my memorys not as good as it used to be you know merthin patted his shoulder were all getting older bartelmy said the prior is up the tower if you want to see him merthin certainly did he went into the north transept stepped through a small archway and climbed a narrow spiral stair within the wall as he passed from the old crossing into the new tower the colour of the stones changed from the dark grey of storm clouds to the light pearl of the morning sky it was a long climb the tower was already more than three hundred feet high however he was used to it almost every day for eleven years he had climbed a stair that was higher each time it occurred to him that philemon who was quite fat nowadays must have had a compelling reason to drag his bulk up all these steps near the top merthin passed through a chamber that housed the great wheel a wooden winding mechanism twice as high as a man used for hoisting stones mortar and timber up to where they were needed when the spire was finished the wheel would be left here permanently to be used for repair work by future generations of builders until the trumpets sounded on the day of judgement he emerged on top of the tower a stiff cold breeze was blowing though none had been noticeable at ground level a leaded walkway ran around the inside of the towers summit scaffolding stood around an octagonal hole ready for the masons who would build the spire dressed stones were piled nearby and a heap of mortar was drying up wastefully on a wooden board there were no workmen here prior philemon stood on the far side with harold mason they were deep in conversation but stopped guiltily when merthin came into view he had to shout into the wind to make himself heard why have you stopped the building philemon had his answer ready theres a problem with your design merthin looked at harold you mean some people cant understand it experienced people say it cant be built philemon said defiantly experienced people merthin repeated scornfully who in kingsbridge is experienced who has built a bridge who has worked with the great architects of florence who has seen rome avignon paris rouen certainly not harold here no offence harold but youve never even been to london harold said im not the only one who thinks its impossible to build an octagonal tower with no formwork merthin was about to say something sarcastic but stopped himself philemon must have more than this he realized the prior had deliberately chosen to fight this battle therefore he must have weapons more formidable than the mere opinion of harold mason he had presumably won some support among members of the guild but how other builders who were prepared to say that merthins spire was impossible must have been offered some incentive that probably meant construction work for them what is it he said to philemon what are you hoping to build i dont know what you mean philemon blustered youve got an alternative project and youve offered harold and his friends a piece of it whats the building you dont know what youre talking about a bigger palace for yourself a new chapter house it cant be a hospital weve already got three come on you might as well tell me unless youre ashamed of it philemon was stung into a response the monks wish to build a lady chapel ah that made sense the cult of the virgin was increasingly popular the church hierarchy approved because the wave of piety associated with mary counterbalanced the scepticism and heresy that had afflicted congregations since the plague numerous cathedrals and churches were adding a special small chapel at the east end the holiest part of the building dedicated to the mother of god merthin did not like the architecture on most churches a lady chapel looked like an afterthought which of course it was what was philemons motive he was always trying to ingratiate himself with someone that was his modus operandi a lady chapel at kingsbridge would undoubtedly please conservative senior clergy this was the second move philemon had made in that direction on easter sunday from the pulpit of the cathedral he had condemned dissection of corpses he was mounting a campaign merthin realized but what was its purpose merthin decided to do nothing more until he had figured out what philemon was up to without saying anything further he left the roof and started down the series of staircases and ladders to the ground merthin arrived home at the dinner hour and caris came in from the hospital a few minutes later brother thomas is getting worse he said to caris is there anything that can be done for him she shook her head theres no cure for senility he told me the south aisle had collapsed as if it had happened yesterday thats typical he remembers the distant past but doesnt know whats going on today poor thomas hell probably deteriorate quite fast but at least hes in a familiar place monasteries dont change much over the decades his daily routine is probably the same as it has always been that will help as they sat down to mutton stew with leeks and mint merthin explained the mornings developments the two of them had been battling kingsbridge priors for decades first anthony then godwyn and now philemon they had thought that the granting of the borough charter would put an end to the constant jockeying it had certainly improved matters but it seemed philemon had not given up yet im not really worried about the spire merthin said bishop henri will overrule philemon and order the building restarted just as soon as he hears henri wants to be bishop of the tallest cathedral in england philemon must know that caris said thoughtfully perhaps he simply wants to make the gesture towards a lady chapel and get the credit for trying while blaming his failure on someone else perhaps caris said doubtfully in merthins mind there was a more important question but what is he really after everything philemon does is driven by the need to make himself feel important caris said confidently my guess is hes after a promotion what job could he have in mind the archbishop of monmouth seems to be dying but surely philemon cant hope for that position he must know something we dont before they could say any more lolla walked in merthins first reaction was a feeling of relief so powerful that it brought tears to his eyes she was back and she was safe he looked her up and down she had no apparent injuries she walked with a spring in her step and her face showed only the usual expression of moody discontent caris spoke first youre back she said im so glad are you lolla said she often pretended to believe that caris did not like her merthin was not fooled but caris could be thrown into doubt for she was sensitive about not being lollas mother were both glad merthin said you gave us a scare why said lolla she hung her cloak on a hook and sat at the table i was perfectly all right but we didnt know that so we were terribly worried you shouldnt be lolla said i can take care of myself merthin suppressed an angry retort im not sure you can he said as mildly as possible caris stepped in to try to lower the temperature where did you go she asked youve been away for two weeks different places merthin said tightly can you give us one or two examples mudeford crossing casterham outhenby and what have you been doing is this the catechism she said petulantly do i have to answer all these questions caris put a restraining hand on merthins arm and said to lolla we just want to know that you havent been in danger merthin said id also like to know who youve been travelling with nobody special does that mean jake riley she shrugged and looked embarrassed yes she said as if it were a trivial detail merthin had been ready to forgive and embrace her but she was making that difficult trying to keep his voice neutral he said what sleeping arrangements did you and jake have thats my business she cried no its not he shouted back its mine too and your stepmothers if youre pregnant who will care for your baby are you confident that jake is ready to settle down and be a husband and father have you talked to him about that dont speak to me she yelled then she burst into tears and stomped up the stairs merthin said sometimes i wish we lived in one room then she wouldnt be able to pull that trick you werent very gentle with her caris said with mild disapproval what am i supposed to do merthin said she talks as if shes done nothing wrong she knows the truth though thats why shes crying oh hell he said there was a knock and a novice monk put his head around the door pardon me for disturbing you alderman he said sir gregory longfellow is at the priory and would be grateful for a word with you as soon as is convenient damn said merthin tell him ill be there in a few minutes thank you the novice said and left merthin said to caris perhaps its just as well to give her time to cool off you too caris said youre not taking her side are you he said with a touch of irritation she smiled and touched his arm im on your side always she said but i remember what it was like to be a sixteenyearold girl shes as worried as you are about her relationship with jake but shes not admitting it even to herself because that would wound her pride so she resents you for speaking the truth she has constructed a fragile defence around her selfesteem and you just tear it down what should i do help her build a better fence i dont know what that means youll figure it out id better go and see sir gregory merthin stood up caris put her arms around him and kissed him on the lips youre a good man doing your best and i love you with all my heart she said that took the edge off his frustration and he felt himself calm down as he strode across the bridge and up the main street to the priory he did not like gregory the man was sly and unprincipled willing to do anything for his master the king just as philemon had been when he served godwyn as prior merthin wondered uneasily what gregory wanted to discuss with him it was probably taxes always the kings worry merthin went first to the priors palace where philemon looking pleased with himself told him that sir gregory was to be found in the monks cloisters to the south of the cathedral merthin wondered what gregory had done to win himself the privilege of holding audience there the lawyer was getting old his hair was white and his tall figure was stooped deep lines had appeared like brackets either side of that sneering nose and one of the blue eyes was cloudy but the other eye saw sharply enough and he recognized merthin instantly though they had not met for ten years alderman he said the archbishop of monmouth is dead rest his soul merthin said automatically amen the king asked me as i was passing through his borough of kingsbridge to give you his greetings and tell you this important news im grateful the death is not unexpected the archbishop has been ill the king certainly had not asked gregory to meet with merthin purely to give him interesting information he thought suspiciously youre an intriguing man if you dont mind my saying so gregory said expansively i first met your wife more than twenty years ago since then ive seen the two of you slowly but surely take control of this town and youve got everything you set your hearts on the bridge the hospital the borough charter and each other youre determined and youre patient it was condescending but merthin was surprised to detect a grain of respect in gregorys flattery he told himself to remain mistrustful men such as gregory praised only for a purpose im on my way to see the monks of abergavenny who must vote for a new archbishop gregory leaned back in his chair when christianity first came to england hundreds of years ago monks elected their own superiors explaining was an old mans habit merthin reflected the young gregory would not have bothered nowadays of course bishops and archbishops are too important and powerful to be chosen by small groups of pious idealists living detached from the world the king makes his choice and his holiness the pope ratifies the royal decision even i know its not that simple merthin thought theres usually some kind of power struggle but he said nothing gregory continued however the ritual of the monks election still goes on and it is easier to control it than to abolish it hence my journey so youre going to tell the monks whom to elect merthin said to put it bluntly yes and what name will you give them didnt i say its your bishop henri of mons excellent man loyal trustworthy never makes trouble oh dear youre not pleased gregorys relaxed air evaporated and he became keenly attentive merthin realized that this was what gregory had come for to find out how the people of kingsbridge as represented by merthin would feel about what he was planning and whether they would oppose him he collected his thoughts the prospect of a new bishop threatened the spire and the hospital henri is the key to the balance of power in this town he said ten years ago a kind of armistice was agreed between the merchants the monks and the hospital as a result all three have prospered mightily appealing to gregorys interest and the kings he added that prosperity is of course what enables us to pay such high taxes gregory acknowledged this with a dip of his head the departure of henri obviously puts into question the stability of our relationships it depends on who replaces him i should have thought indeed said merthin now we come to the crux he thought he said have you got anyone in mind the obvious candidate is prior philemon no merthin was aghast philemon why hes a sound conservative which is important to the church hierarchy in these times of scepticism and heresy of course now i understand why he preached a sermon against dissection and why he wants to build a lady chapel i should have foreseen this merthin thought and he has let it be known that he has no problem with taxation of the clergy a constant source of friction between the king and some of his bishops philemon has been planning this for some time merthin was angry with himself for letting it sneak up on him since the archbishop fell ill i imagine this is a catastrophe why do you say that philemon is quarrelsome and vengeful if he becomes bishop he will create constant strife in kingsbridge we have to prevent him he looked gregory in the eye why did you come here to forewarn me as soon as he had asked the question the answer came to him you dont want philemon either you didnt need me to tell you what a troublemaker he is you knew already but you cant just veto him because he has already won support among senior clergy gregory just smiled enigmatically which merthin took to mean he was right so what do you want me to do if i were you gregory said id start by finding another candidate to put up as the alternative to philemon so that was it merthin nodded pensively ill have to think about this he said please do gregory stood up and merthin realized the meeting was over and let me know what you decide gregory added merthin left the priory and walked back to leper island musing who could he propose as bishop of kingsbridge the townspeople had always got on well with archdeacon lloyd but he was too old they might succeed in getting him elected only to have to do the whole thing again in a years time he had not thought of anyone by the time he got home he found caris in the parlour and was about to ask her when she preempted him standing up with a pale face and a frightened expression she said lollas gone again the priests said sunday was a day of rest but it had never been so for gwenda today after church in the morning and then dinner she was working with wulfric in the garden behind their house it was a good garden half an acre with a hen house a pear tree and a barn in the vegetable patch at the far end wulfric was digging furrows and gwenda sowing peas the boys had gone to another village for a football game their usual recreation on sundays football was the peasant equivalent of the nobilitys tournaments a mock battle in which the injuries were sometimes real gwenda just prayed her sons would come home intact today sam returned early the ball burst he said grumpily wheres davey gwenda asked he wasnt there i thought he was with you no he quite often goes off on his own i didnt know that gwenda frowned where does he go sam shrugged he doesnt tell me perhaps he was seeing a girl gwenda thought davey was close about all sorts of things if it was a girl who was she there were not many eligible girls in wigleigh the survivors of the plague had remarried quickly as if eager to repopulate the land and those born since were too young perhaps he was meeting someone from the next village at a rendezvous in the forest such assignations were as common as heartache when davey came home a couple of hours later gwenda confronted him he made no attempt to deny that he had been sneaking off ill show you what ive been doing if you like he said i cant keep it secret for ever come with me they all went gwenda wulfric and sam the sabbath was observed to the extent that no one worked in the fields and the hundredacre was deserted as the four of them walked across it in a blustery spring breeze a few strips looked neglected there were still villagers who had more land than they could cope with annet was one such she had only her eighteenyearold daughter amabel to help her unless she could hire labour which was still difficult her strip of oats was getting weedy davey led them half a mile into the forest and stopped at a clearing off the beaten track this is it he said for a moment gwenda did not know what he was talking about she was standing on the edge of a nondescript patch of ground with low bushes growing between the trees then she looked again at the bushes they were a species she had never seen before it had a squarish stem with pointed leaves growing in clusters of four the way it had covered the ground made her think it was a creeping plant a pile of uprooted vegetation at one side showed that davey had been weeding what is it she said its called madder i bought the seeds from a sailor that time we went to melcombe melcombe gwenda said that was three years ago thats how long its taken davey smiled at first i was afraid it wouldnt grow at all he told me it needed sandy soil and would tolerate light shade i dug over the clearing and planted the seeds but the first year i got only three or four feeble plants i thought id wasted my money then the second year the roots spread underground and sent up shoots and this year its all over the place gwenda was astonished that her child could have kept this from her for so long but what use is madder she said does it taste good davey laughed no its not edible you dig up the roots dry them and grind them to a powder that makes a red dye its very costly madge webber in kmgsbridge pays seven shillings for a gallon that was an astonishing price gwenda reflected wheat the most expensive grain sold for about seven shillings a quarter and a quarter was sixtyfour gallons this is sixtyfour times as precious as wheat she said davey smiled thats why i planted it why you planted what said a new voice they all turned to see nathan reeve standing beside a hawthorn tree as bent and twisted as he was he wore a triumphant grin he had caught them redhanded davey was quick with an answer this is a medicinal herb called hagwort he said gwenda could tell he was improvising but nate would not be sure its good for my mothers wheezy chest nate looked at gwenda i didnt know she had a wheezy chest in the winter gwenda said a herb nate said sceptically theres enough here to dose all kingsbridge and youve been weeding it to get more i like to do things properly davey said it was a feeble response and nate ignored it this is an unauthorized crop he said first of all serfs need permission for what they plant they cant go raising anything they like that would lead to total chaos secondly they cant cultivate the lords forest even by planting herbs none of them had any answer to that those were the rules it was frustrating often peasants knew they could make money by growing nonstandard crops that were in demand and fetched high prices hemp for rope flax for expensive underclothing or cherries to delight rich ladies but many lords and their bailiffs refused permission out of instinctive conservatism nates expression was venomous one son a runaway and a murderer he said the other defies his lord what a family he was entitled to feel angry gwenda thought sam had killed jonno and got away with it nate would undoubtedly hate her family to his dying day nate bent down and roughly pulled a plant out of the ground this will come before the manor court he said with satisfaction and he turned and limped away through the trees gwenda and her family followed davey was undaunted nate will impose a fine and ill pay it he said ill still make money what if he orders the crop destroyed gwenda said how it could be burned or trampled wulfric put in nate wouldnt do that the village wouldnt stand for it a fine is the traditional way to deal with this gwenda said i just worry about what earl ralph will say davey made a deprecatory gesture with his hand no reason why the earl should find out about a little thing like this ralph takes a special interest in our family yes he does davey said thoughtfully i still dont understand what made him pardon sam the boy was not stupid gwenda said perhaps lady philippa persuaded him sam said she remembers you mother she told me that when i was at merthins house i must have done something to endear myself to her gwenda said extemporising or it could be that she just felt compassion one mother for another it was not much of a story but gwenda did not have a better one in the days since sam had been released they had had several conversations about what might account for ralphs pardon gwenda just pretended to be as perplexed as everyone else fortunately wulfric had never been the suspicious type they reached their house wulfric looked at the sky said there was another good hour of light left and went into the garden to finish sowing peas sam volunteered to help him gwenda sat down to mend a rip in wulfrics hose davey sat opposite gwenda and said ive got another secret to tell you she smiled she did not mind him having a secret if he told his mother go on i have fallen in love thats wonderful she leaned forward and kissed his cheek im very happy for you whats she like shes beautiful gwenda had been speculating before she found out about the madder that davey might be meeting a girl from another village her intuition had been right i had a feeling about this she said did you he seemed anxious dont worry theres nothing wrong it just occurred to me that you might be meeting someone we go to the clearing where im growing the madder thats sort of where it started and how long has this been going on more than a year its serious then i want to marry her im so pleased she looked fondly at him youre still only twenty but thats old enough if youve found the right person im glad you think so what village is she from this one wigleigh oh gwenda was surprised she had not been able to think of a likely girl here who is she mother its amabel no dont shout not annets daughter youre not to be angry not to be angry gwenda struggled to calm herself she was as shocked as if she had been slapped she took several deep breaths listen to me she said we have been at odds with that family for more than twenty years that cow annet broke your fathers heart and never left him alone afterwards im sorry but thats all in the past its not annet still flirts with your father every chance she gets thats your problem not ours gwenda stood up her sewing falling from her lap how can you do this to me that bitch would be part of our family my grandchildren would be her grandchildren shed be in and out of this house all the time making a fool of your father with her coquettish ways and then laughing at me im not going to marry annet amabel will be just as bad look at her shes just like her mother shes not actually you cant do this i absolutely forbid it you cant forbid it mother oh yes i can youre too young that wont last for ever wulfrics voice came from the doorway whats all the shouting davey says he wants to marry annets daughter but i wont permit it gwendas voice rose to a shriek never never never earl ralph surprised nathan reeve when he said he wanted to look at daveys strange crop nate mentioned the matter in passing on a routine visit to earlscastle a bit of unlicensed cultivation in the forest was a trivial breach of the rules regularly dealt with by a fine nate was a shallow man interested in bribes and commissions and he had little conception of the depth of ralphs obsession with gwendas family his hatred of wulfric his lust for gwenda and now the likelihood that he was sams real father so nate was startled when ralph said he would inspect the crop next time he was in the neighbourhood ralph rode with alan fernhill from earlscastle to wigleigh on a fine day between easter and whitsun when they reached the small timber manor house there was the old housekeeper vira bent and grey now but still hanging on they ordered her to prepare their dinner then found nate and followed him into the forest ralph recognized the plant he was no farmer but he knew the difference between one bush and another and on his travels with the army he had observed many crops that did not grow naturally in england he leaned down from his saddle and pulled up a handful this is called madder he said ive seen it in flanders its grown for the red dye that has the same name nate said he told me it was a herb called hagwort used to cure a wheezy chest i believe it does have medicinal properties but thats not why people cultivate it what will his fine be a shilling would be the usual amount its not enough nate looked nervous so much trouble is caused lord when these customs are flouted i would rather not never mind ralph said he kicked his horse and trotted through the middle of the clearing trampling the bushes come on alan he said alan imitated him and the two of them cantered around in tight circles flattening the growth after a few minutes all the shrubs were destroyed ralph could see that nate was shocked by the waste even though the planting was illegal peasants never liked to see crops despoiled ralph had learned in france that the best way of demoralizing the population was to burn the harvest in the fields that will do he said quickly getting bored he was irritated by daveys insolence in planting this crop but that was not the main reason he had come to wigleigh the truth was that he wanted to see sam again as they rode back to the village he scanned the fields looking for a tall young man with thick dark hair sam would stand out because of his height among these stunted serfs hunched over their spades he saw him at a distance in brookfield he reined in and peered across the windy landscape at the twentytwoyearold son he had never known sam and the man he thought was his father wulfric were ploughing with a horsedrawn light plough something was wrong for they kept stopping and adjusting the harness when they were together it was easy to see the differences between them wulfrics hair was tawny sams dark wulfric was barrelchested oxlike where sam was broadshouldered but lean like a horse wulfrics movements were slow and careful but sam was quick and graceful it was the oddest feeling to look at a stranger and think my son ralph believed himself immune to womanish emotions if he had been subject to feelings of compassion or regret he could not have lived as he had but the discovery of sam threatened to unman him he tore himself away and cantered back to the village then he succumbed again to curiosity and sentiment and sent nate to find sam and bring him to the manor house he was not sure what he intended to do with the boy talk to him tease him invite him to join them for dinner or what he might have foreseen that gwenda would not leave him free to choose she showed up with nate and sam and wulfric and davey followed them in what do you want with my son she demanded speaking to ralph as if he were an equal rather than her overlord ralph spoke without forethought sam was not born to be a serf tilling the fields he said he saw alan fernhill look at him in surprise gwenda looked puzzled only god knows what we are born for she said playing for time when i want to know about god ill ask a priest not you ralph said to her your son has something of the mettle of a fighting man i dont need to pray to see that its obvious to me as it would be to any veteran of the wars weil hes not a fighting man hes a peasant and the son of a peasant and his destiny is to grow crops and raise livestock like his father never mind his father ralph remembered what gwenda had said to him in the sheriffs castle at shiring when she had persuaded him to pardon sam sam has the killer instinct he said its dangerous in a peasant but priceless in a soldier gwenda looked scared as she began to divine ralphs purpose what are you getting at ralph realized where this chain of logic was leading him let sam be useful rather than dangerous let him learn the arts of war ridiculous hes too old hes twentytwo its late but hes fit and strong he can do it i dont see how gwenda was pretending to find practical objections but he could see through her simulation and knew that she hated the idea with all her heart that made him all the more determined with a smile of triumph he said easily enough he can be a squire he can come and live at earlscastle gwenda looked as if she had been stabbed her eyes closed for a moment and her oliveskinned face paled she mouthed the word no but no sound came out hes been with you for twentytwo years ralph said thats long enough now its my turn he thought but instead he said now hes a man because gwenda was temporarily silent wulfric spoke up we wont permit it he said we are his parents and we do not consent to this i didnt ask for your consent ralph said contemptuously im your earl and you are my serfs i dont request i command nate reeve put in besides sam is over the age of twentyone so the decision is his not his fathers suddenly they all turned and looked at sam ralph was not sure what to expect becoming a squire was something many young men of all classes dreamed about but he did not know whether sam was one of them life in the castle was luxurious and exciting by comparison with breaking your back in the fields but on the other hand menatarms died young or worse than that came home crippled to live the rest of their miserable days begging outside taverns however as soon as ralph saw sams face he knew the truth sam was smiling broadly and his eyes gleamed with eagerness he could hardly wait to go gwenda found her voice dont do it sam she said dont be tempted dont let your mother see you blinded by an arrow or mutilated by the swords of french knights or crippled by the hooves of their warhorses wulfric said dont go son stay in wigleigh and live a long life sam began to look doubtful ralph said all right lad youve listened to your mother and to the peasant father who raised you but the decision is yours what will you do live out your life here in wigleigh tilling the fields alongside your brother or escape sam paused only for a moment he looked guiltily at wulfric and gwenda then turned to ralph ill do it he said ill be a squire and thank you my lord good lad ralph said gwenda began to cry wulfric put his arm around her looking up at ralph he said when shall he go today ralph said he can ride back to earlscastle with me and alan after dinner not so soon gwenda cried no one took any notice of her ralph said to sam go home and fetch anything you want to bring with you have dinner with your mother come back and wait for me in the stables meanwhile nate can requisition a mount to carry you to earlscastle he turned away having finished with sam and his family now wheres my dinner wulfric and gwenda went out with sam but davey stayed behind had he already found out that his crop had been trampled or was it something else what do you want ralph said lord i have a boon to ask this was almost too good to be true the insolent peasant who had planted madder in the woods without permission was now a supplicant what a satisfying day this was turning out to be you cant be a squire youve got your mothers build ralph told him and alan laughed i want to marry amabel the daughter of annet said the young man that wont please your mother i will be of age in less than a year ralph knew all about annet of course he had nearly been hanged for her sake his history was entwined with hers almost as much as with gwendas he recalled that all her family had died in the plague annet still has some of the lands her father held yes lord and she is willing for them to be transferred to me when i marry her daughter such a request would not normally have been refused although all lords would charge a tax called an entry fee on the transfer however there was no obligation on a lord to consent the right of lords to refuse such requests on a whim and blight the course of a serfs life was one of the peasants greatest gripes but it provided the ruler with a means of discipline that could be extraordinarily effective no said ralph i will not transfer the land to you he grinned you and your bride can eat madder caris had to prevent philemon becoming bishop this was his boldest move yet but he had made his preparations carefully and he had a chance if he succeeded he would have control of the hospital again giving him the power to destroy her lifes work but he could do worse than that he would revive the blind orthodoxy of the past he would appoint hardhearted priests like himself in the villages close schools for girls and preach sermons against dancing she had no say in the choice of a bishop but there were ways to exert pressure she began with bishop henri she and merthin travelled to shiring to see the bishop in his palace on the way merthin stared at every darkhaired girl that came into view and when there was no one he scanned the woods at the side of the road he was looking for lolla but they reached shiring without seeing any sign of her the bishops palace was on the main square opposite the church and beside the wool exchange it was not a market day so the square was clear but for the scaffold that stood there permanently a stark warning to villains of what the people of the county did to those who broke the law the palace was an unpretentious stone building with a hall and chapel on the ground floor and a series of offices and private apartments upstairs bishop henri had imposed upon the place a style that caris thought was probably french each room looked like a painting the place was not decorated extravagantly like philemons palace in kingsbridge where the profusion of rugs and jewels suggested a robbers cave however there was something pleasantly artful about everything in henris house a silver candlestick placed to catch the light from a window the polished gleam of an ancient oak table spring flowers in the cold fireplace a small tapestry of david and jonathan on the wall bishop henri was not an enemy but he was not quite an ally either caris thought nervously as they waited for him in the hall he would probably say that he tried to rise above kingsbridge quarrels she more cynically thought that whatever decision he had to make he remained unshakeably focused on his own interests he disliked philemon but he might not allow that to affect his judgement henri came in followed as always by canon claude the two of them did not seem to age henri was a little older than caris and claude perhaps ten years younger but they both looked like boys caris had noticed that clergy often aged well better than aristocrats she suspected it was because most priests with some notorious exceptions led lives of moderation their regime of fasting obliged them to eat fish and vegetables on fridays and saints days and all through lent and in theory they were never allowed to get drunk by contrast noblemen and their wives indulged in orgies of meateating and heroic winedrinking that might be why their faces became lined their skin flaky and their bodies bent while clerics stayed fit and spry later into their quiet austere lives merthin congratulated henri on having been nominated archbishop of monmouth then got straight to the point prior philemon has stopped work on the tower henri said with studied neutrality any reason theres a pretext and a reason merthin said the pretext is a fault in the design and what is the alleged fault he says an octagonal spire cant be built without formwork it is generally true but ive found a way around it which is rather simple i will build a round spire which will need no formwork then give its exterior a cladding of thin stones and mortar in the shape of an octagon visually it will be an octagonal spire but structurally it will be a cone have you told philemon this no if i do hell find another pretext what is his real reason he wants to build a lady chapel instead ah its part of a campaign to ingratiate himself with senior clergy he preached a sermon against dissection when archdeacon reginald was there and he has told the kings advisers that he will not campaign against taxation of the clergy what is he up to he wants to be bishop of shiring henri raised his eyebrows philemon always had nerve ill give him that claude spoke for the first time how do you know gregory longfellow told me claude looked at henri and said gregory would know if anyone does caris could tell that henri and claude had not anticipated that philemon would be so ambitious to make sure they did not overlook the significance of the revelation she said if philemon gets his wish you as archbishop of monmouth will have endless work adjudicating disputes between bishop philemon and the townspeople of kingsbridge you know how much friction there has been in the past claude said we certainly do im glad were in agreement merthin said thinking aloud claude said we must put forward an alternative candidate that was what caris had hoped he would say we have someone in mind she said claude said who you there was a silence caris could tell that claude liked the idea she guessed he might be quietly envious of henris promotion and wondering whether it was his destiny always to be a kind of assistant to henri he could easily cope with the post of bishop he knew the diocese well and handled most of the practical administration already however both men were now surely thinking about their personal lives she had no doubt they were all but husband and wife she had seen them kissing but they were decades past the first flush of romance and her intuition told her they could tolerate a parttime separation she said you would still be working together a good deal claude said the archbishop will have many reasons to visit kingsbridge and shiring henri said and the bishop of kingsbridge will need to come to monmouth often claude said it would be a great honour to be bishop with a twinkle in his eye he added especially under you archbishop henri looked away pretending not to notice the double meaning i think its a splendid idea he said merthin said the kingsbridge guild will back claude i can guarantee that but you archbishop henri will have to put the suggestion to the king of course caris said if i may make one suggestion please find another post for philemon propose him as i dont know archdeacon of lincoln something he would like but that would take him many miles from here thats a sound idea henri said if hes up for two posts it weakens his case for either one ill keep my ear to the ground claude stood up this is all very exciting he said will you have dinner with us a servant came in and addressed caris theres someone asking for you mistress the man said its only a boy but he seems distressed henri said let him come in a boy of about thirteen appeared he was dirty but his clothes were not cheap and caris guessed he came from a family that was comfortably off but suffering some kind of crisis will you come to my house mother caris im not a nun any more child but whats the problem the boy spoke fast my father and mother are ill and so is my brother and my mother heard someone say you were at the bishops palace and said to fetch you and she knows you help the poor but she can pay but will you please come please this type of request was not unusual and caris carried a leather case of medical supplies with her wherever she went of course ill come lad she said whats your name giles spicers mother and im to wait and bring you all right caris turned to the bishop go ahead with your dinner please ill join you as soon as i can she picked up her case and followed the boy out shiring owed its existence to the sheriffs castle on the hill just as kingsbridge did to the priory near the market square were the grand houses of the leading citizens the wool merchants and sheriffs deputies and royal officials such as the coroner a little farther out were the homes of moderately prosperous traders and craftsmen goldsmiths and tailors and apothecaries giless father was a dealer in spices as his name indicated and giles led caris to a street in this neighbourhood like most houses of this class it had a stonebuilt ground floor that served as warehouse and shop and flimsier timber living quarters above today the shop was closed and locked giles led caris up the outside staircase she smelled the familiar odour of sickness as soon as she walked in then she hesitated there was something special about the smell something that struck a chord in her memory that for some reason made her feel very frightened rather than ponder it she walked through the living room into the bedroom and there she found the dreadful answer three people lay on mattresses around the room a woman of her own age a slightly older man and an adolescent boy the man was farthest gone in sickness he lay moaning and sweating in a fever the open neck of his shirt showed that he had a rash of purpleblack spots on his chest and throat there was blood on his lips and nostrils he had the plague its come back said caris god help me for a moment fear paralysed her she stood motionless staring at the scene feeling powerless she had always known in theory that the plague might return that was half the reason she had written her book but even so she was not prepared for the shock of once again seeing that rash that fever that nosebleed the woman lifted herself on one elbow she was not so far gone she had the rash and the fever but did not appear to be bleeding give me something to drink for the love of god she said giles picked up a jug of wine and at last cariss mind started to work and her body unfroze dont give her wine it will make her thirstier she said i saw a barrel of ale in the other room draw her a cup of that the woman focused on caris youre the prioress arent you she said caris did not correct her people say youre a saint can you make my family well ill try but im not a saint just a woman who has observed people in sickness and health caris took from her bag a strip of linen and tied it over her mouth and nose she had not seen a case of the plague for ten years but she had got into the habit of taking this precaution whenever she dealt with patients whose illness might be catching she moistened a clean rag with rose water and bathed the womans face as always the action soothed the patient giles came back with a cup of ale and the woman drank caris said to him let them have as much to drink as they want but give them ale or watered wine she moved to the father who did not have long to live he was not speaking coherently and his eyes failed to focus on caris she bathed his face cleaning the dried blood from around his nose and mouth finally she attended to giless elder brother he had only recently succumbed and was still sneezing but he was old enough to realize how seriously ill he was and he looked terrified when she had finished she said to giles try to keep them comfortable and give them drinks theres nothing else you can do do you have any relations uncles or cousins theyre all in wales she made a mental note to warn bishop henri that he might need to make arrangements for an orphan boy mother said to pay you the boy said i havent done much for you caris said you can pay me sixpence there was a leather purse beside his mothers bed he took out six silver pennies the woman raised herself again speaking more calmly now she said whats wrong with us im sorry said caris its the plague the woman nodded fatalistically thats what i was afraid of dont you recognize the symptoms from last time we were living in a small town in wales we escaped it are we all going to die caris did not believe in deceiving people about such important questions a few people survive it she said not many though may god have mercy on us then said the woman caris said amen all the way back to kingsbridge caris brooded on the plague it would spread of course just as fast as last time it would kill thousands the prospect filled her with rage it was like the senseless carnage of war except that war was caused by men and the plague was not what was she going to do she could not sit back and watch as the events of thirteen years ago were cruelly repeated there was no cure for the plague but she had discovered ways to slow its murderous progress as her horse jogged the wellworn road through the forest she thought over what she knew about the illness and how to combat it merthin was quiet recognizing her mood probably guessing accurately what she was thinking about when they got home she explained to him what she wanted to do there will be opposition he warned your plan is drastic those who did not lose family and friends last time may imagine they are invulnerable and say youre overreacting thats where you can help me she said in that case i recommend we divide up the potential objectors and deal with them separately all right you have three groups to win over the guild the monks and the nuns lets start with the guild ill call a meeting and i wont invite philemon nowadays the guild met in the cloth exchange a large new stone building on the main street it enabled traders to do business even in bad weather it had been paid for by profits from kingsbridge scarlet but before the guild convened caris and merthin met individually with the leading members to win their support in advance a technique merthin had developed long ago his motto was never call a meeting until the result is a foregone conclusion caris herself went to see madge webber madge had married again much to everyones amusement she had enchanted a villager as handsome as her first husband and fifteen years her junior his name was anselm and he seemed to adore her though she was as plump as ever and covered her grey hair with a selection of exotic caps even more surprising in her forties she had conceived again and given birth to a healthy baby girl selma now eight years old and attending the nuns school motherhood had never kept madge from doing business and she continued to dominate the market in kingsbridge scarlet with anselm as her lieutenant her home was still the large house on the main street that she and mark had moved into when she first began to profit from weaving and dyeing caris found her and anselm taking delivery of a consignment of red cloth trying to find room for it in the overcrowded storeroom on the ground floor im stocking up for the fleece fair madge explained caris waited while she checked the delivery then they went upstairs leaving anselm in charge of the shop as caris entered the living room she was vividly reminded of the day thirteen years ago when she had been summoned here to see mark the first kingsbridge victim of the plague she suddenly felt depressed madge noticed her expression what is it she said you could not hide things from women the way you could from men i walked in here thirteen years ago because mark was ill caris said madge nodded that was the beginning of the worst time of my life she said in her matteroffact voice that day i had a wonderful husband and four healthy children three months later i was a childless widow with nothing to live for days of grief caris said madge went to the sideboard where there were cups and a jug but instead of offering caris a drink she stood staring at the wall shall i tell you something strange she said after they died i couldnt say amen to the paternoster she swallowed and her voice went quieter i know what the latin means you see my father taught me fiat voluntas tua thy will be done i couldnt say that god had taken my family and that was sufficient torture i would not acquiesce in it tears came to her eyes as she remembered i didnt want gods will to prevail i wanted my children back thy will be done i knew id go to hell but still i couldnt say amen caris said the plague has come back madge staggered and clutched the sideboard for support her solid figure suddenly looked frail and as the confidence went from her face she appeared old no she said caris pulled a bench forward and held madges arm while she sat on it im sorry to shock you she said no madge said again it cant come back i cant lose anselm and selma i cant bear it i cant bear it she looked so white and drawn that caris began to fear she might suffer some kind of attack caris poured wine from the jug into a cup she gave it to madge who drank it automatically a little of her colour came back we understand it better now caris said perhaps we can fight it fight it how can we do that thats what ive come to tell you are you feeling a little better madge met cariss eye at last fight it she said of course thats what we must do tell me how we have to close the city shut the gates man the walls prevent anyone coming in but the city has to eat people will bring supplies to leper island merthin will act as middleman and pay them he contracted the plague last time and survived and no one has ever got it twice traders will leave their goods on the bridge then when they have gone people will come out from the city and get the food could people leave the city yes but they couldnt come back what about the fleece fair that may be the hardest part caris said it must be cancelled but kingsbridge merchants will lose hundreds of pounds its better than dying if we do as you say will we avoid the plague will my family survive caris hesitated resisting the temptation to tell a reassuring lie i cant promise she said the plague may already have reached us there may be someone right now dying alone in a hovel near the waterfront with nobody to get help so i fear we may not escape entirely but i believe my plan gives you the best chance of still having anselm and selma by your side at christmas then well do it madge said decisively your support is crucial caris said frankly you will lose more money than anyone else from the cancellation of the fair for that reason people are more likely to believe you i need you to say how serious it is dont worry said madge ill tell them a very sound idea said prior philemon merthin was surprised he could not remember a time when philemon had agreed readily with a proposal of the guilds then you will support it he said to make sure he had heard aright yes indeed said the prior he was eating a bowl of raisins stuffing handfuls into his mouth as fast as he could chew them he did not offer merthin any of course he said it wouldnt apply to monks merthin sighed he might have known better on the contrary it applies to everyone he said no no said philemon in the tone of one who instructs a child the guild has no power to restrict the movements of monks merthin noticed a cat at philemons feet it was fat like him with a mean face it looked just like godwyns cat archbishop though that creature must be long dead perhaps it was a descendant merthin said the guild has the power to close the city gates but we have the right to come and go as we please were not subject to the authority of the guild that would be ridiculous all the same the guild controls the city and we have decided that no one can enter while the plague is rife you cannot make rules for the priory but i can for the city and the priory happens to be in the city are you telling me that if i leave kingsbridge today you will refuse me admission tomorrow merthin was not sure it would be highly embarrassing at a minimum to have the prior of kingsbridge standing outside the gate demanding admission he had been hoping to persuade philemon to accept the restriction he did not want to put the resolve of the guild to the test quite so dramatically however he tried to make his answer sound confident absolutely i shall complain to the bishop tell him he cant enter kingsbridge the personnel of the nunnery had hardly changed in ten years caris realized nunneries were like that of course you were supposed to stay for ever mother joan was still prioress and sister oonagh ran the hospital under the supervision of brother sime few people came here for medical care now most preferred cariss hospital on the island those patients sime did have devoutly religious for the most part were cared for in the old hospital next to the kitchens while the new building was used for guests caris sat down with joan oonagh and sime in the old pharmacy now used as the prioresss private office and explained her plan people outside the walls of the old city who fall victim to the plague will be admitted to my hospital on the island she said while the plague lasts the nuns and i will stay within the building night and day nobody will leave except those lucky few who recover joan asked what about here in the old city if the plague gets into the city despite our precautions there may be too many victims for the accommodation you have the guild has ruled that plague victims and their families will be confined to their homes the rule applies to anyone who lives in a house struck by plague parents children grandparents servants apprentices anyone caught leaving such a house will be hanged its very harsh joan said but if it prevents the awful slaughter of the last plague its worth while i knew youd see that sime was saying nothing the news of the plague seemed to have deflated his arrogance oonagh said how will the victims eat if theyre imprisoned in their homes neighbours can leave food on the doorstep no one may go in except monkphysicians and nuns they will visit the sick but they must have no contact with the healthy they will go from the priory to the home and from the home back to the priory without entering any other building or even speaking to anyone on the street they should wear masks at all times and wash their hands in vinegar each time they touch a patient sime was looking terrified will that protect us he said to some degree caris said not completely but then it will be highly dangerous for us to attend the sick oonagh answered him we have no fear she said we look forward to death for us it is the longedfor reunion with christ yes of course said sime the next day all the monks left kingsbridge gwenda felt murderously angry when she saw what ralph had done to daveys madder plants wanton destruction of crops was a sin there should be a special place in hell for noblemen who despoiled what peasants had sweated to grow but davey was not dismayed i dont think it matters he said the value is in the roots and he hasnt touched them that would have been too much like work gwenda said sourly but she cheered up in fact the shrubs recovered remarkably quickly ralph probably did not know that madder propagated underground throughout may and june as reports began to reach wigleigh of an outbreak of the plague the roots sent up new shoots and at the beginning of july davey decided it was time to harvest the crop one sunday gwenda wulfric and davey spent the afternoon digging up the roots they would first loosen the soil around the plant then pull it out of the ground then strip its foliage leaving the root attached to a short stem it was backaching work of the kind gwenda had done all her life they left half the plantation untouched in the hope that it would regenerate itself next year they pulled a handcart piled with madder roots back through the woods to wigleigh then unloaded the roots into the barn and spread them in the hayloft to dry davey did not know when he would be able to sell his crop kingsbridge was a closed city the people still bought supplies of course but only through brokers davey was doing something new and he would need to explain the situation to his buyer it would be awkward to do that through an intermediary but perhaps he would have to try he had to dry the roots first then grind them to a powder and that would take time anyway davey had said no more about amabel but gwenda felt sure he was still seeing the girl he pretended to be cheerfully resigned to his fate if he had really given her up he would have moped resentfully all gwenda could do was hope he would get over her before he was old enough to marry without permission she still could hardly bear even to think of her family being joined to annets annet had never ceased to humiliate her by flirting with wulfric who continued to grin foolishly at every stupid coquettish remark now that annet was in her forties with broken veins in her rosy cheeks and grey streaks among her fair ringlets her behaviour was not just embarrassing but grotesque yet wulfric reacted as if she were still a girl and now gwenda thought my son has fallen into the same trap it made her want to spit amabel looked just like annet twentyfive years ago a pretty face with flyaway curls a long neck and narrow white shoulders and small breasts like the eggs that mother and daughter sold at markets she had the same way of tossing her hair the same trick of looking at a man with mock reproach and hitting his chest with the back of her hand in a gesture that pretended to be a smack but was in fact a caress however davey was at least physically safe and well gwenda was more worried about sam living now with earl ralph at the castle learning to be a fighting man in church she prayed he would not be injured hunting or learning to use a sword or fighting in a tournament she had seen him every day for twentytwo years then suddenly he had been taken from her its hard to be a woman she thought you love your baby with all your heart and soul and then one day he just leaves for several weeks she looked for an excuse to travel to earlscastle and check on sam then she heard that the plague had struck there and that decided her she would go before the harvest got under way wulfric would not go with her he had too much to do on the land anyway she had no fear of travelling alone too poor to be robbed too old to be raped she joked the truth was that she was too tough for either and she carried a long knife she walked across the drawbridge at earlscastle on a hot july day on the battlements of the gatehouse a rook stood like a sentry the sun glinting off his glossy black feathers he cawed a warning at her it sounded like go go she had escaped the plague once of course but that might have been luck she was risking her life by coming here the scene in the lower compound was normal if a little quiet a woodcutter was unloading a cart full of firewood outside the bakehouse and a groom was unsaddling a dusty horse in front of the stables but there was no great bustle of activity she noticed a small group of men and women outside the west entrance of the little church and crossed the bakedearth ground to investigate plague victims inside a maidservant said in answer to her inquiry she stepped through the door feeling dread like a cold lump in her heart ten or twelve straw mattresses were lined up on the floor so that the occupants could face the altar just as in a hospital about half the patients seemed to be children there were three grown men gwenda scanned their faces fearfully none of them was sam she knelt down and said a prayer of thanks outside she approached the woman she had spoken to earlier im looking for sam from wigleigh she said hes a new squire the woman pointed to the bridge leading to the inner compound try the keep gwenda took the route indicated a sentry at the bridge ignored her she climbed the steps to the keep the great hall was dark and cool a big dog slept on the cold stones of the fireplace there were benches around the walls and a pair of large armchairs at the far end of the room gwenda noticed that there were no cushions no upholstered seats and no wall hangings she deduced that lady philippa spent little time here and took no interest in the furnishings sam was sitting near a window with three younger men the parts of a suit of armour were laid out on the floor in front of them arranged in order from faceplate to greaves each of the men was cleaning a piece sam was rubbing the breastplate with a smooth pebble trying to remove rust she stood watching him for a moment he wore new clothes in the redandblack livery of the earl of shiring the colours suited his dark good looks he seemed to be at ease talking in a desultory way with the others while they all worked he appeared healthy and well fed it was what gwenda had hoped for but all the same she suffered a perverse pang of disappointment that he was doing so well without her he glanced up and saw her his face registered surprise then pleasure then amusement lads he said i am the oldest among you and you may think im capable of looking after myself but its not so my mother follows me everywhere to make sure im all right they saw her and laughed sam put down his work and came over mother and son sat on a bench in a corner near the staircase that led to the upstairs rooms im having a wonderful time sam said everyone plays games here most days we go hunting and hawking we have wrestling matches and contests of horsemanship and we play football ive learned so much its a bit embarrassing to be grouped with these adolescents all the time but i can put up with that i just have to master the skill of using a sword and shield while riding a horse at the same time he was already speaking differently she noticed he was losing the slow rhythms of village speech and he used french words for hawking and horsemanship he was becoming assimilated into the life of the nobility what about the work she said it cant be all play yes theres plenty of work he gestured at the others cleaning the armour but its easy by comparison with ploughing and harrowing he asked about his brother and she told him all the news from home daveys madder had regenerated they had dug up the roots davey was still involved with amabel no one had fallen sick of the plague yet while they were talking she began to feel that she was being watched and she knew her feeling was not fanciful after a moment she looked over her shoulder earl ralph was standing at the top of the staircase in front of an open door evidently having stepped out of his room she wondered how long he had been looking at her she met his gaze his stare was intense but she could not read it did not understand what it meant she began to feel the look was uncomfortably intimate and she glanced away when she looked back he had gone the next day when she was on the road and half way home a horseman came up behind her riding fast then slowed down and stopped her hand went to the long dagger in her belt the rider was sir alan fernhill the earl wants to see you he said then he had better come himself instead of sending you she replied youve always got a smart answer havent you do you imagine it endears you to your superiors he had a point she was taken aback perhaps because in all the years he had been ralphs sidekick she had never known alan to say anything intelligent if she was really smart she would suck up to people such as alan not poke fun at them all right she said wearily the earl bids me to him must i walk all the way back to the castle no he has a lodge in the forest not far from here where he sometimes stops for refreshment during a hunt hes there now he pointed into the woods beside the road gwenda did not much like this but as a serf she had no right to decline a summons from her earl anyway if she did refuse she felt sure alan would knock her down and tie her up and carry her there very well she said jump up on the saddle in front of me if you like no thanks id rather walk at this time of year the undergrowth was thick gwenda followed the horse into the woods taking advantage of the path it trampled through the nettles and ferns the road behind them swiftly disappeared into the greenery gwenda wondered nervously what whim had caused ralph to arrange this forest meeting it could not be good news for her or her family she felt they walked a quarter of a mile and came to a low building with a thatched roof gwenda would have assumed it to be a verderers cottage alan looped his reins around a sapling and led the way inside the place had about it the same bare utilitarian look gwenda had noted at earlscastle the floor was beaten earth the walls unfinished wattleanddaub the ceiling nothing more than the underside of the thatch the furniture was minimal a table some benches and a plain wooden bedstead with a straw mattress a door at the back stood half open on a small kitchen where presumably ralphs servants prepared food and drink for him and his fellow huntsmen ralph was sitting at the table with a cup of wine gwenda stood in front of him waiting alan leaned against the wall behind her so alan found you ralph said is there no one else here gwenda said nervously just you me and alan gwendas anxiety went up a notch why do you want to see me to talk about sam of course youve taken him from me what else is there to say hes a good boy you know our son dont call him that she looked at alan he showed no surprise clearly he had been let in on the secret she was dismayed wulfric must never find out dont call him our son she said youve never been a father to him wulfric raised him how could i raise him i didnt even know he was mine but im making up for lost time hes doing well did he tell you does he get into fights of course squires are supposed to fight its practice for when they go to war you should have asked whether he wins its not the life i wanted for him its the life he was made for did you bring me here to gloat why dont you sit down reluctantly she sat opposite him at the table he poured wine into a cup and pushed it towards her she ignored it he said now that i know we have a son together i think we should be more intimate no thank you youre such a killjoy dont you talk to me about joy youve been a blight on my life with all my heart i wish i had never set eyes on you i dont want to be intimate with you i want to get away from you if you went to jerusalem it wouldnt be far enough his face darkened with anger and she regretted the extravagance of her words she recalled alans rebuke she wished she could say no simply and calmly without stinging witticisms but ralph aroused her ire like no one else cant you see she said trying to be reasonable you have hated my husband for what a quarter of a century he broke your nose and you slashed his cheek open you disinherited him then you were forced to give him back his familys lands you raped the woman he once loved he ran away and you dragged him back with a rope around his neck after all tnat even having a son together cannot make you and me friends i disagree he said i think we can be not just friends but lovers no it was what she had feared in the back of her mind ever since alan had reined in on the road in front of her ralph smiled why dont you take off your dress she tensed alan leaned over her from behind and slipped the long dagger out of her belt with a smooth motion he had obviously premeditated the move and it happened too quickly for her to react but ralph said no alan that wont be necessary shell do it willingly i will not she said give her back the dagger alan reluctantly alan reversed the knife holding it by the blade and offered it to her she snatched it and leaped to her feet you may kill me but ill take one of you with me by god she said she backed away holding the knife at arms length ready to fight alan stepped towards the door moving to cut her off leave her be ralph said shes not going anywhere she had no idea why ralph was so confident but he was dead wrong she was getting out of this hut and then she was going to run away as fast as she could and she would not stop until she dropped alan stayed where he was gwenda got to the door reached behind her and lifted the simple wooden latch ralph said wulfric doesnt know does he gwenda froze doesnt know what he doesnt know that im sams father gwendas voice fell to a whisper no he doesnt i wonder how he would feel if he found out it would kill him she said thats what i thought please dont tell him she begged i wont so long as you do as i say what could she do she knew ralph was drawn to her sexually she had used that knowledge in desperation to get in to see him at the sheriffs castle their encounter at the bell all those years ago a vile memory to her had lived in his recollection as a golden moment probably much enhanced by the passage of time and she had put into his head the idea of reliving that moment this was her own fault could she somehow disabuse him we arent the same people we were all those years ago she said i will never be an innocent young girl again you should go back to your serving wenches i dont want serving girls i want you no she said please she fought back tears he was implacable take off your dress she sheathed her knife and unbuckled her belt the moment merthin woke up he thought of lolla she had been missing now for three months he had sent messages to the city authorities in gloucester monmouth shaftesbury exeter winchester and salisbury letters from him as alderman of one of the great cities of the land were treated seriously and he had received careful replies to them all only the mayor of london had been unhelpful saying in effect that half the girls in the city had run away from their fathers and it was no business of the mayors to send them home merthin had made personal inquiries in shiring bristol and melcombe he had spoken to the landlord of every tavern giving them a description of lolla they had all seen plenty of darkhaired young women often in the company of handsome rogues called jake or jack or jock but none could say for sure that they had seen merthins daughter or heard the name lolla some of jakes friends had also vanished along with a girlfriend or two the other missing women all some years older than lolla lolla might be dead merthin knew that but he refused to give up hope it was unlikely she had caught the plague the new outbreak was ravaging towns and villages and taking away most of the children under ten but survivors of the first wave such as lolla and himself must have been people who for some reason had the strength to resist the illness or in a very few cases such as his own to recover from it and they were not falling sick this time however the plague was only one of the hazards to a sixteenyearold girl running away from home and merthins fertile imagination tortured him in the small hours of the night with thoughts of what might have happened to her one town not ravaged by the plague was kingsbridge the illness had affected about one house in a hundred in the old town as far as merthin could tell from the conversations he held shouted across the city gate with madge webber who was acting as alderman inside the city walls while merthin managed affairs outside the kingsbridge suburbs and other towns were seeing something like one in five afflicted but had cariss methods overcome the plague or merely delayed it would the illness persist and eventually overcome the barriers she had put up would the devastation be as bad as last time in the end they would not know until the outbreak had run its course which might be months or years he sighed and got up out of his lonely bed he had not seen caris since the city was closed she was living at the hospital a few yards from merthins house but she could not leave the building people could go in but not come out caris had decided she would have no credibility unless she worked side by side with her nuns so she was stuck merthin had spent half his life separated from her it seemed but it did not get any easier in fact he ached for her more now in middle age than he had as a youngster his housekeeper em was up before him and he found her in the kitchen skinning rabbits he ate a piece of bread and drank some weak beer then went outside the main road across the island was already crowded with peasants and their carts bringing supplies merthin and a team of helpers spoke to each of them those bringing standard products with agreed prices were the simplest merthin sent them across the inner bridge to deposit their goods at the locked door of the gatehouse then paid them when they came back empty with those bringing seasonal produce such as fruits and vegetables he negotiated a price before allowing them to deliver for some special consignments a deal had been made days earlier when he placed the order hides for the leather trade stones for the masons who had recommenced building the spire under bishop henris orders silver for the jewellers iron steel hemp and timber for the citys manufacturers who had to continue working even though they were temporarily cut off from most of their customers finally there were the oneoff cargoes for which merthin would need to take instructions from someone in the city today brought a vendor of italian brocade who wanted to sell it to one of the citys tailors a yearold ox for the slaughterhouse and davey from wigleigh merthin listened to daveys story with amazement and pleasure he admired the lad for his enterprise in buying madder seeds and cultivating them to produce the costly dye he was not surprised to learn that ralph had tried to scuttle the project ralph was like most noblemen in his contempt for anything connected with manufacture or trade but davey had nerve as well as brains and he had persisted he had even paid a miller to grind the dried roots into powder when the miller washed the grindstone afterwards his dog drank some of the water that ran off davey told merthin the dog pissed red for a week so we know the dye works now he was here with a handcart loaded with old fourgallon flour sacks full of what he believed to be precious madder dye merthin told him to pick up one of the sacks and bring it to the gate when they got there he called out to the sentry on the other side the man climbed to the battlements and looked down this sack is for madge webber merthin shouted up make sure she gets it personally would you sentry very good alderman said the sentry as always a few plague victims from the villages were brought to the island by their relatives most people now knew there was no cure for the plague and simply let their loved ones die but a few were ignorant or optimistic enough to hope that caris could work a miracle the sick were left outside the hospital doors like supplies at the city gate the nuns came out for them at night when the relatives had gone now and again a lucky survivor emerged in good health but most patients went out through the back door and were buried in a new graveyard on the far side of the hospital building at midday merthin invited davey to dinner over rabbit pie and new peas davey confessed he was in love with the daughter of his mothers old enemy i dont know why ma hates annet but its all so long in the past and its nothing to do with me or amabel he said with the indignation of youth against the irrationality of parents when merthin nodded sympathetically davey asked did your parents stand in your way like this merthin thought for a moment yes he said i wanted to be a squire and spend my life as a knight fighting for the king i was heartbroken when they apprenticed me to a carpenter however in my case it worked out quite well davey was not pleased by this anecdote in the afternoon access to the inner bridge was closed off at the island end and the gates of the city were opened teams of porters came out and picked up everything that had been left and carried the supplies to their destinations in the city there was no message from madge about the dye merthin had a second visitor that day towards the end of the afternoon as trading petered out canon claude arrived claudes friend and patron bishop henri was now installed as archbishop of monmouth however his replacement as bishop of kingsbridge had not been chosen claude wanted the position and had been to london to see sir gregory longfellow he was on his way back to monmouth where he would continue to work as henris righthand man for the moment the king likes philemons line on taxation of the clergy he said over cold rabbit pie and a goblet of merthins best gascon wine and the senior clergy liked the sermon against dissection and the plan to build a lady chapel on the other hand gregory dislikes philemon says he cant be trusted the upshot is the king has postponed a decision by ruling that the monks of kingsbridge cannot hold an election while they are in exile at stjohnintheforest merthin said i assume the king sees little point in selecting a bishop while the plague rages and the city is closed claude nodded agreement i did achieve something albeit small he went on there is a vacancy for an english ambassador to the pope the appointee has to live in avignon i suggested philemon gregory seemed intrigued by the idea at least he didnt rule it out good the thought of philemon being sent so far away lifted merthins spirits he wished there were something he could do to weigh in on claudes side but he had already written to gregory pledging the support of the guild and that was the limit of his influence one more piece of news sad news in fact claude said on my way to london i went to stjohnintheforest henri is still abbot technically and he sent me to reprimand philemon for decamping without permission waste of time really anyway philemon has adopted cariss precautions and would not let me in but we talked through the door so far the monks have escaped the plague but your old friend brother thomas has died of old age im sorry god rest his soul merthin said sadly he was very frail towards the end his mind was going too the move to st john probably didnt help him thomas encouraged me when i was a young builder strange how god sometimes takes the good men from us and leaves the bad claude left early the next morning as merthin was going through his daily routine one of the carters came back from the city gate with a message madge webber was on the battlements and wanted to talk to merthin and davey do you think shell buy my madder davey said as they walked across the inner bridge merthin had no idea i hope so he said they stood side by side in front of the closed gate and looked up madge leaned over the wall and shouted down where did this stuff come from i grew it davey said and who are you davey from wigleigh son of wulfric oh gwendas boy yes the younger one well ive tested your dye it works doesnt it davey said eagerly its very weak did you grind the roots whole yes what else would i have done youre supposed to remove the hulls before grinding i didnt know that davey was crestfallen is the powder no good as i said its weak i cant pay the price of pure dye davey looked so dismayed that merthins heart went out to him madge said how much have you got nine more fourgallon sacks like the one you have davey said despondently ill give you half the usual price three shillings and sixpence a gallon thats fourteen shillings a sack so exactly seven pounds for ten sacks daveys face was a picture of delight merthin wished caris were with him just to share it seven pounds davey repeated thinking he was disappointed madge said i cant do better than that the dye just isnt strong enough but seven pounds was a fortune to davey it was several years wages for a labourer even at todays rates he looked at merthin im rich he said merthin laughed and said dont spend it all at once the next day was sunday merthin went to the morning service at the islands own little church of st elizabeth of hungary patron saint of healers then he went home and got a stout oak spade from his gardeners hut with the spade over his shoulder he walked across the outer bridge through the suburbs and into his past he tried hard to remember the route he had taken through the forest thirtyfour years ago with caris ralph and gwenda it seemed impossible there were no pathways other than deer runs saplings had become mature trees and mighty oaks had been felled by the kings woodcutters nevertheless to his surprise there were still recognizable landmarks a spring gurgling up out of the ground where he remembered the tenyearold caris kneeling to drink a huge rock that she said looked as if it must have fallen from heaven a steepsided little valley with a boggy bottom where she had got mud in her boots as he walked his recollection of that day of childhood became more vivid he remembered how the dog hop had followed them and gwenda had followed her dog he felt again the pleasure of having caris understand his joke his face reddened at the recollection of how incompetent he had been in front of caris with the bow he had made and how easily his younger brother had mastered the weapon most of all he remembered caris as a girl they had been preadolescent but nevertheless he had been bewitched by her quick wits her daring and the effortless way she had assumed command of the little group it was not love but it was a kind of fascination that was not unlike love remembrance distracted him from pathfinding and he lost his bearings he began to feel as if he was in completely unfamiliar territory then suddenly he emerged into a clearing and knew he was in the right place the bushes were more extensive the trunk of the oak tree was even broader and the clearing in between was gay with a scatter of summer flowers as it had not been on that november day in but he was in no doubt it was like a face he had not seen for years changed but unmistakable a shorter and skinnier merthin had crawled under that bush to hide from the big man crashing through the undergrowth he remembered how the exhausted panting thomas had stood with his back to that oak tree and drawn his sword and dagger he saw in his imagination the events of that day played out again two men in yellowandgreen livery had caught up with thomas and asked him for a letter thomas had distracted the men by telling them they were being observed by someone hiding in a bush merthin had felt sure he and the other children would be murdered then ralph just ten years old had killed one of the menatarms showing the quick and deadly reflexes that had served him so well years later in the french wars thomas had despatched the other man though not before receiving the wound that had ended in his losing his left arm despite or perhaps because of the treatment given him in the hospital at kingsbridge priory then merthin had helped thomas bury the letter just here thomas had said right in front of the oak tree there was a secret in the letter merthin knew now a secret so potent that highranking people were frightened of it the secret had given thomas protection though he had nevertheless sought sanctuary in a monastery and spent his life there if you hear that ive died thomas had said to the boy merthin id like you to dig up this letter and give it to a priest merthin the man hefted his spade and began to dig he was not sure whether this was what thomas had intended the buried letter was a precaution against thomass being killed by violence not dying of natural causes at the age of fiftyeight would he still have wanted the letter dug up merthin did not know he would decide what to do when he had read the letter he was irresistibly curious about what was in it his memory of where he had buried the bag was not perfect and with his first try he missed the spot he got down about eighteen inches and realized his mistake the hole had been only about a foot deep he was sure he tried again a few inches to the left this time he got it right a foot down the spade struck something that was not earth it was soft but unyielding he put the spade to one side and scrabbled with his fingers in the hole he felt a piece of ancient rotting leather gently he dislodged the earth and lifted the object it was the wallet thomas had worn on his belt all those years ago he wiped his muddy hands on his tunic and opened it inside was a bag made of oiled wool still intact he loosened the drawstring of the bag and reached in he pulled out a sheet of parchment rolled into a scroll and sealed with wax he handled it gently but all the same the wax crumbled as soon as he touched it with careful fingertips he unrolled the parchment it was intact it had survived thirtyfour years in the earth remarkably well he saw immediately that it was not an official document but a personal letter he could tell by the handwriting which was the painstaking scrawl of an educated nobleman rather than the practised script of a clerk he began to read the salutation ran from edward the second of that name king of england at berkeley castle by the hand of his faithful servant sir thomas langley to his beloved eldest son edward royal greeting and fatherly love merthin felt scared this was a message from the old king to the new the hand holding the document shook and he looked up from it and scanned the greenery around him as if there might be someone peering at him through the bushes my beloved son you will soon hear that i am dead know that it is not true merthin frowned this was not what he had expected your mother the queen the wife of my heart has corrupted and subverted roland earl of shiring and his sons who sent murderers here but i was forewarned by thomas and the murderers were killed so thomas had not been the assassin after all but the saviour of the king your mother having failed to kill me once would surely try again for she and her adulterous consort cannot feel safe while i live so i have changed clothes with one of the slain murderers a man of my height and general appearance and i have bribed several people to swear that the dead body is mine your mother will know the truth when she sees the body but she will go along with the pretence for if i am thought to be dead i will be no threat to her and no rebel or rival to the throne can claim my support merthin was amazed the nation had thought edward ii to be dead all europe had been fooled but what had happened to him afterwards i will not tell you where i plan to go but know that i intend to leave my kingdom of england and never return however i pray that i will again see you my son before i die why had thomas buried this letter instead of delivering it because he had feared for his own life and had seen the letter as a powerful weapon in his defence once queen isabella had committed herself to the pretence of her husbands death she had needed to deal with those few people who knew the truth merthin now recalled that while he was still an adolescent the earl of kent had been convicted of treason and beheaded for maintaining that edward ii was still alive queen isabella had sent men to kill thomas and they had caught up with him just outside kingsbridge but thomas had disposed of them with the help of the tenyearold ralph afterwards thomas must have threatened to expose the whole deception and he had proof in the form of the old kings letter that evening as he lay in the hospital at kingsbridge priory thomas had negotiated with the queen or more likely with earl roland and his sons as her agents he had promised to keep the secret on condition that he was accepted as a monk he would feel safe in the monastery and in case the queen should be tempted to renege he had said that the letter was in a safe place and would be revealed on his death the queen therefore needed to keep him alive old prior anthony had known something of this and as he lay dying had told mother cecilia who on her own deathbed had repeated part of the story to caris people might keep secrets for decades merthin reflected but they felt compelled to tell the truth when death was near caris had also seen the incriminating document that gave lynn grange to the priory on condition thomas was accepted as a monk merthin now understood why cariss disingenuous inquiries about this document had caused such trouble sir gregory longfellow had persuaded ralph to break into the monastery and steal all the nuns charters in the hope of finding the incriminating letter had the destructive power of this sheet of vellum been lessened by the passage of time isabella had lived a long life but she had died three years ago edward ii himself was almost certainly dead if alive he would be seventyseven now would edward iii fear the revelation that his father had remained alive when the world thought him dead he was too strong a king now to be seriously threatened but he would face great embarrassment and humiliation so what was merthin to do he remained where he was on the grassy floor of the forest among the wild flowers for a long time at last he rolled up the scroll replaced it in the bag and put the bag back in the old leather pouch he put the pouch back into the ground and filled up the hole he also filled in his first erroneous hole he smoothed the earth on top of both he stripped some leaves off the bushes and scattered them in front of the oak tree he stood back and looked at his work he was satisfied the excavations were no longer visible to the casual glance then he turned his back on the clearing and went home at the end of august earl ralph made a tour of his landholdings around shiring accompanied by his longterm sidekick sir alan fernhill and his newfound son sam he enjoyed having sam along his child yet a grown man his other sons gerry and roley were too young for this son of thing sam did not know about his paternity but ralph nursed the secret with pleasure they were horrified by what they saw as they went around hundreds of ralphs serfs were dead or dying and the corn was standing unharvested in the fields as they rode from one place to the next ralphs anger and frustration grew his sarcastic remarks cowed his companions and his bad temper turned his horse skittish in each village as well as the serfs landholdings some acres were kept exclusively for the earls personal use they should have been cultivated by his employees and by serfs who were obliged to work for him one day a week these lands were in the worst state of all many of his employees had died so had some of the serfs who owed him labour other serfs had negotiated more favourable tenancies after the last plague so that they no longer had to work for the lord and finally it was impossible to find labourers for hire when ralph came to wigleigh he went around the back of the manor house and looked into the big timber barn which at this time of year should have been filling with grain ready for milling but it was empty and a cat had given birth to a litter of kittens in the hay loft what will we do for bread he roared at nathan reeve with no barley to make ale what will we drink youd better have a plan by god nate looked churlish all we can do is reallocate the strips he said ralph was surprised by his surliness nate was usually sycophantic then nate glared at young sam and ralph realized why the worm had turned nate hated sam for killing jonno his son instead of punishing sam ralph had first pardoned him then made him a squire no wonder nate looked resentful ralph said there must be one or two young men in the village who could farm some extra acres ah yes but they arent willing to pay an entry fee nate said they want land for nothing yes they can see that you have too much land and not enough labour and they know when theyre in a strong bargaining position in the past nate had been quick to abuse uppity peasants but now he seemed to be enjoying ralphs dilemma they act as if england belongs to them not to the nobility ralph said angrily it is disgraceful lord said nate more politely and a sly look came over his face for example wulfrics son davey wants to marry amabel and take over her mothers land it would make sense annet has never been able to manage her holding sam spoke up my parents wont pay the entry fee theyre against the marriage nate said davey could pay it himself though ralph was surprised how he sold that new crop he grew in the forest madder obviously we didnt do a sufficiently thorough job of trampling it how much did he get no one knows but gwenda has bought a young milking cow and wulfric has a new knife and amabel wore a yellow scarf to church on sunday and nate had been offered a fat bribe ralph guessed i hate to reward daveys disobedience he said but im desperate let him have the land you would have to give him special permission to marry against his parents will davey had asked ralph for this and ralph had turned him down but that was before the plague decimated the peasantry he did not like to revisit such decisions however it was a small price to pay i shall give him permission he said very well but lets go and see him id like to make the offer in person nate was startled but of course made no objection the truth was that ralph wanted to see gwenda again there was something about her that made his throat go dry his last encounter with her in the little hunting lodge had not satisfied him for long he had thought about her often in the weeks since then he got little satisfaction nowadays from the kind of women he normally lay with young prostitutes tavern wenches and maidservants they all pretended to be delighted by his advances though he knew they just wanted the present of money that came afterwards gwenda by contrast made no secret of the fact that she loathed him and shuddered at his touch and that pleased him paradoxically because it was honest and therefore real after their meeting in the hunting lodge he had given her a purse of silver pennies and she had thrown it back at him so hard that it had bruised his chest theyre in brookfield today turning their reaped barley nate said ill take you there ralph and his men followed nate out of the village and along the bank of the stream at the edge of the great field wigleigh was always windy but today the summer breeze was soft and warm like gwendas breasts some of the strips of land here had been reaped but in others ralph despaired to see overripe oats barley rank with weeds and one patch of rye that had been reaped but not bundled so that the crop lay scattered on the ground a year ago he had thought that all his financial troubles were over he had come home from the most recent french war with a captive the marquis de neuchatel and had negotiated a ransom of fifty thousand pounds but the marquiss family had not been able to raise the money something similar had happened to the french king jean ii captured by the prince of wales at the battle of poitiers king jean had stayed in london for four years technically a prisoner though living in comfort at the savoy the new palace built by the duke of lancaster the kings ransom had been reduced but still it had not been paid in full ralph had sent alan fernhill to neuchatel to renegotiate his prisoners ransom and alan had reduced the price to twenty thousand but again the family had failed to pay it then the marquis had died of the plague so ralph was insolvent again and had to worry about the harvest it was midday the peasants were having their dinner at the side of the field gwenda wulfric and davey were sitting on the ground under a tree eating cold pork with raw onions they all jumped to their feet when the horses came near ralph went over to gwendas family and waved the rest away gwenda wore a loose green dress that hid her shape her hair was tied back making her face more ratlike her hands were dirty with earth under the nails but when ralph looked at her in his imagination he saw her naked ready waiting for him with an expression of resigned disgust at what he was about to do and he felt aroused he looked away from her to her husband wulfric stared back at him with a level gaze neither defiant nor cowed there was a little grey now in his tawny beard but still it would not grow over the scar of the sword cut ralph had given him wulfric your son wants to marry amabel and take over annets land gwenda responded she had never learned to speak only when spoken to youve stolen one son from me will you take the other now she said bitterly ralph ignored her who will pay the heriot nate put in its thirty shillings wulfric said i havent got thirty shillings davey said calmly i can pay it he must have done very well out of his madder crop ralph thought to be so cool about such a large sum of money good he said in that case davey interrupted him but on what terms are you offering it ralph felt his face redden what do you mean nate intervened again the same terms as those upon which annet holds the land of course davey said then i thank the earl but i will not accept his gracious offer ralph said what the devil are you talking about i would like to take over the land my lord but only as a free tenant paying cash rent without customary dues sir alan said threateningly do you dare to haggle with the earl of shiring you insolent young dog davey was scared but defiant ive no wish to offend lord but i want to be free to grow whatever crop i can sell i dont want to cultivate what nate reeve chooses regardless of market prices davey had inherited that streak of stubborn determination from gwenda ralph thought he said angrily nate expresses my wishes do you think you know better than your earl forgive me lord but you neither till the soil nor go to market alans hand went to the hilt of his sword ralph saw wulfric glance at his scythe lying on the ground its sharp blade gleaming in the sunlight on ralphs other side young sams horse skittered nervously picking up its riders tension if it came to a fight ralph thought would sam fight for his lord or for his family ralph did not want a fight he wanted to get the harvest in and killing his peasants would make that harder he restrained alan with a gesture this is how the plague undermines morality he said disgustedly i will give you what you want davey because i must davey swallowed drily and said in writing lord youre demanding a copyhold too davey nodded too frightened to speak do you doubt the word of your earl no lord then why demand a written lease for the avoidance of doubt in future years they all said that when they asked for a copyhold what they meant was that if the lease was written down the landlord could not easily alter the terms it was yet another encroachment on timehonoured traditions ralph did not want to make a further concession but once again he had no option if he wanted to get the harvest in and then he thought of a way he could use this situation to gain something else he wanted and he cheered up all right he said ill give you a written lease but i dont want men leaving the fields during the harvest your mother can come to earlscastle to collect the document next week gwenda walked to earlscastle on a baking hot day she knew what ralph wanted her for and the prospect made her miserable as she crossed the drawbridge into the castle the rooks seemed to laugh derisively at her plight the sun beat down mercilessly on the compound where the walls blocked the breeze the squires were playing a game outside the stables sam was among them and too absorbed to notice gwenda they had tied a cat to a post at eye level in such a way that it could move its head and legs a squire had to kill the cat with his hands tied behind his back gwenda had seen the game before the only way for the squire to achieve his object was to headbutt the wretched animal but the cat naturally defended itself by scratching and biting the attackers face the challenger a boy of about sixteen was hovering near the post watched by the terrified cat suddenly the boy jerked his head his forehead smashed into the cats chest but the animal lashed out with its clawed paws the squire yelped with pain and jumped back his cheeks streaming blood and all the other squires roared with laughter enraged the challenger rushed at the post and butted the cat again he was scratched worse and he hurt his head which they found even funnier the third time he was more careful getting close he feinted making the cat lash out at thin air then he delivered a carefully aimed strike right at the beasts head blood poured from its mouth and nostrils and it slumped unconscious though still breathing he butted it a final time to kill it and the others cheered and clapped gwenda felt sickened she did not much like cats she preferred dogs but it was unpleasant to see any helpless creature tormented she supposed that boys had to do this sort of thing to prepare them for maiming and killing human beings in war did it have to be that way she moved on without speaking to her son perspiring she crossed the second bridge and climbed the steps to the keep the great hall was mercifully cool she was glad sam had not seen her she was hoping to avoid him as long as possible she did not want him to suspect that anything was wrong he was not notably sensitive but he might detect his mothers distress she told the marshal of the hall why she was here and he promised to let the earl know is lady philippa in residence gwenda asked hopefully perhaps ralph would be inhibited by the presence of his wife but the marshal shook his head shes at monmouth with her daughter gwenda nodded grimly and settled down to wait she could not help thinking about her encounter with ralph at the hunting lodge when she looked at the unadorned grey wall of the great hall she saw him staring at her as she undressed his mouth slightly open in anticipation as much as the intimacy of sex was a joy with the man she loved so much was it loathsome with one she hated the first time ralph had coerced her more than twenty years ago her body had betrayed her and she had felt a physical pleasure even while experiencing a spiritual revulsion the same thing had happened with alwyn the outlaw in the forest but it had not occurred this time with ralph in the hunting lodge she attributed the change to age when she had been a young girl full of desire the physical act had triggered an automatic response something she could not help although it had made her even more ashamed now in her maturity her body was not so vulnerable the reflex not so ready she could at least be grateful for that the stairs at the far end of the hall led to the earls chamber men were going up and down constantly knights servants tenants bailiffs after an hour the marshal told her to go up she was afraid ralph would want sex there and then but she was relieved to find that he was having a business day with him were sir alan and two priestclerks sitting at a table with writing materials one of the clerks handed her a small vellum scroll she did not look at it she could not read there said ralph now your son is a free tenant isnt that what you always wanted she had wanted freedom for herself as ralph knew she had never achieved it but ralph was right davey had that meant that her life had not been completely without purpose her grandchildren would be free and independent growing what crops they chose paying their rent and keeping for themselves everything else they earned they would never know the miserable existence of poverty and hunger that gwenda had been born to was that worth all she had been through she did not know she took the scroll and went to the door alan came after her and spoke in a low voice as she was going out stay here tonight in the hall he said the great hall was where most of the castles residents slept tomorrow be at the hunting lodge two hours after midday she tried to leave without replying alan barred her way with his arm understand he said yes she said in a low voice i will be there in the afternoon he let her go she did not speak to sam until late in the evening the squires spent the whole afternoon at various violent games she was glad to have the time to herself she sat in the cool hall alone with her thoughts she tried to tell herself that it was nothing for her to have sexual congress with ralph she was no virgin after all she had been married for twenty years she had had sex thousands of times it would all be over in a few minutes and it would leave no scars she would do it and forget it until the next time that was the worst of it he could go on coercing her indefinitely his threat to reveal the secret of sams paternity would terrify her as long as wulfric was alive surely ralph would tire of her soon and go back to the firm young bodies of his tavern wenches whats the matter with you sam said when at dusk the squires came in for supper nothing she said quickly daveys bought me a milking cow sam looked a bit envious he was enjoying life but squires were not paid they had little need of money they were provided with food drink accommodation and clothing but all the same a young man liked to have a few pennies in his wallet they talked about daveys forthcoming wedding you and annet are going to be grandmothers together sam said youll have to make your peace with her dont be stupid gwenda snapped you dont know what youre talking about ralph and alan emerged from the chamber when supper was served all the residents and visitors assembled in the hall the kitchen staff brought in three large pike baked with herbs gwenda sat near the foot of the table well away from ralph and he took no notice of her after dinner she lay down to sleep in the straw on the floor beside sam it was a comfort to her to lie next to him as she had when he was little she remembered listening to his childish breathing soft and contented in the silence of the night drifting off she thought about how children grew up to defy their parents expectations her own father had wanted to treat her like a commodity to be traded but she had angrily refused to be used that way now each of her sons was taking his own road through life and in both cases it was not the one she had planned sam would be a knight and davey was going to marry annets daughter if we knew how they would turn out she thought would we be so eager to have them she dreamed that she went to ralphs hunting lodge and found that he was not there but there was a cat on his bed she knew she had to kill the cat but she had her hands tied behind her back so she butted it with her head until it died when she woke up she wondered if she could kill ralph at the lodge she had killed alwyn all those years ago sticking his own knife into his throat and pushing it up into his head until its point had come out through his eye she had killed sim chapman too holding his head under the water while he wriggled and thrashed keeping him there until he breathed the river into his lungs and died if ralph went to the hunting lodge alone she might be able to kill him if she chose her moment well but he would not be on his own earls never went anywhere alone he would have alan with him as he had before it was unusual for him to travel with only one companion it was unlikely he would have none could she kill them both no one else knew she was going to meet them there if she killed them and simply walked on home she would not even be suspected no one knew of her motive it was a secret that was the whole point someone might realize she had been near the lodge at the time but they would only ask her whether she had seen any suspiciouslooking men in the vicinity it would not occur to them that big strong ralph might have been murdered by a small middleaged woman but could she do it she thought about it but she knew in her heart it was hopeless they were experienced men of violence they had been at war off and on for twenty years most recently in the campaign of the winter before last they had quick reflexes and their reactions were deadly many french knights had wanted to kill them and had died trying she might have killed one using guile and surprise but not two she was going to have to submit to ralph grimly she went outside and washed her face and hands when she came back into the great hall the kitchen staff were putting out rye bread and weak ale for breakfast sam was dipping the stale bread into his ale to soften it youve got that look again he said whats the matter nothing she said she drew her knife and cut a slab of the bread ive got a long walk ahead of me is that what youre worried about you shouldnt really go on your own most women dont like to travel alone im tougher than most women she was pleased that he showed concern for her it was something his real father ralph would never have done wulfric had had some influence over the boy after all but she was embarrassed that he had read her expression and divined her state of mind you dont need to worry about me i could come with you he offered im sure the earl would let me he doesnt need any squires today hes going off somewhere with alan fernhill that was the last thing she wanted if she failed to keep her rendezvous ralph would let out the secret she could readily imagine the pleasure ralph would take in that he would not need much provocation no she said firmly stay here you never know when your earl will call for you he wont call for me i should come with you i absolutely forbid it gwenda swallowed a mouthful of her bread and stuffed the rest into her wallet youre a good boy to worry about me but its not necessary she kissed his cheek take care of yourself dont run unnecessary risks if you want to do something for me stay alive she walked away at the door she turned he was watching her thoughtfully she forced herself to give what she hoped was a carefree smile then she went out on the road gwenda began to worry that someone might find out about her liaison with ralph such things had a way of getting out she had met him once she was about to do so a second time and she feared there might be more such occasions how long would it be before someone saw her leaving the road and heading into the woods at a certain point in her journey and wondered why what if someone should stumble by accident into the hunting lodge at the wrong moment how many people would notice that ralph went off with alan whenever gwenda was travelling from earlscastle to wigleigh she stopped at a tavern just before noon and had some ale and cheese travellers generally left such places in a group for safety but she made sure to wait behind so that she would be alone on the road when she came to the point where she had to turn into the woods she looked ahead and behind to make sure there was no one watching she thought she saw a movement in the trees a quarter of a mile back and she peered into the hazy distance trying to make out more clearly what she had seen but no one was there she was just getting jumpy she thought again about killing ralph as she waded through the summer undergrowth if by some lucky chance alan was not here might she find an opportunity but alan was the one person in the world who knew she was meeting ralph here if ralph were killed alan would know who had done it she would have to kill him too and that seemed impossible there were two horses outside the lodge ralph and alan were inside sitting at the little table with the remains of a meal in front of them half a loaf a ham bone the rind of a cheese and a wine flask gwenda closed the door behind her here she is as promised alan said with a satisfied air clearly he had been given the job of getting her to come to the rendezvous and he was relieved she had obeyed orders just perfect for your dessert he said like a raisin wrinkled but sweet gwenda said to ralph why dont you get him out of here alan stood up always the insolent remark he said will you never learn but he left the room going into the kitchen and slamming the door behind him ralph smiled at her come here he said she moved obediently closer to him ill tell alan not to be so rude if you like please dont she said horrified if he starts being nice to me people will wonder why as you please he took her hand and tried to draw her closer sit on my lap couldnt we just fuck and get it over with he laughed thats what i like about you youre honest he stood up held her shoulders and looked into her eyes then he bent his head and kissed her it was the first time he had done this they had had sex twice without ever kissing now gwenda was revolted as his lips pressed against hers she felt more violated than when he had thrust his penis into her he opened his mouth and she tasted his cheesy breath she pulled away disgusted no she said remember what you stand to lose please dont do this he started to become angry i will have you he said loudly get that dress off please let me go she said he started to say something but she raised her voice to speak over him the walls were thin and she knew that alan in the kitchen could hear her pleading but she did not care dont force me i beg you i dont care what you say he shouted get on that bed please dont make me the front door flew open both gwenda and ralph turned and stared sam stood there gwenda said oh god no the three of them were frozen still for a split second and in that moment gwenda guessed all at once what had happened sam had been worried about her and disobeying her orders he had followed her from earlscastle staying out of sight but never far behind he had seen her leave the road and head into the woods she had caught a flash of movement when she looked behind but she had dismissed it he had found the hut arriving a minute or two after her he must have stood outside and heard the shouting it must have been obvious that ralph was in the process of forcing gwenda to submit to unwanted sex although recalling in a flash what they had said gwenda realized they had not mentioned the true reason she had to submit the secret had not been revealed yet sam drew his sword ralph leaped to his feet as sam rushed at him ralph managed to get his own sword out sam swung at ralphs head but ralph raised his sword just in time to parry the stroke gwendas son was trying to kill his father sam was in terrible danger hardly more than a boy he was up against a battlehardened soldier ralph shouted alan then gwenda realized sam was up against not one but two veterans she dashed across the room as the kitchen door came open she stood on the far side of the doorway and flattened herself against the wall she drew the long dagger from her belt the door flew wide and alan stepped into the room he looked at the two fighters and did not see gwenda he paused for an instant taking in the scene in front of him sams sword swept through the air again aimed at ralphs neck and again ralph took the blow on his own sword alan could see instantly that his master was under furious attack his hand went to the hilt of his sword and he took a pace forward then gwenda stabbed him in the back she thrust the long dagger in and upwards as hard as she could pushing with a fieldworkers strength thrusting through the muscles of alans back up through kidneys and stomach and lungs hoping to reach his heart the knife was ten inches long pointed and sharp and it sliced through his organs but it did not kill him immediately he roared with pain then suddenly went silent staggering he turned and grabbed her pulling her to him in a wrestlers embrace she stabbed him again in the stomach this time with the same upward stroke through the vital organs blood came out of his mouth he went limp and his arms fell to his sides he stared for a moment with a look of utter incredulity at the contemptible little woman who had ended his life then his eyes closed and he fell to the floor gwenda looked at the other two sam struck and ralph parried ralph stepped back and sam advanced sam struck again and ralph parried again ralph was defending himself vigorously but not attacking ralph was fearful of killing his son sam not knowing that his opponent was his father had no such scruples and pressed forward slashing with his sword gwenda knew this could not go on for long one of them would hurt the other and then it would become a fight to the death holding her bloody knife ready she looked desperately for a chance to intervene and stab ralph the way she had stabbed alan wait ralph said holding up his left hand but sam was angry and thrust at him regardless ralph parried and spoke again wait he was gasping from exertion but he managed to get a few words out theres something you dont know i know enough sam yelled and gwenda could hear the note of boyish hysteria in his big mans voice he swung again you dont ralph shouted gwenda knew what ralph wanted to tell sam he was going to say i am your father it must not happen listen to me ralph said and at last sam responded he stepped back though he did not lower his sword ralph panted catching his breath in preparation for speaking and as he paused gwenda ran at him he spun around to face her at the same time swinging his sword to the right in a flat arc his blade hit hers knocking the knife out of her hand she was completely defenceless and she knew that if he slashed at her with the return stroke she would be killed but for the first time since sam had drawn his sword ralphs guard was open leaving the front of his body undefended sam stepped forward and thrust his sword into ralphs chest the pointed tip of the blade passed through ralphs light summer tunic and entered his body on the left side of his breastbone it must have slipped between two ribs for the blade sank farther in sam gave a bloodthirsty cry of triumph and pushed harder ralph staggered backwards under the impact his shoulders hit the wall behind him but still sam came forward pushing with all his might the sword seemed to pass all the way through ralphs chest there was a strange thud as the point came out of his back and stuck into the timber of the wall ralphs eyes looked into sams face and gwenda knew what he was thinking ralph understood that he had been wounded fatally and in the last few seconds of his life he knew that he had been killed by his own son sam let go of the sword but it did not fall it was embedded in the wall impaling ralph gruesomely sam stepped back aghast ralph was not yet dead his arms waved feebly in an effort to grab the sword and pull it out of his chest but he was not able to coordinate his movements gwenda realized in a ghastly flash that he looked a bit like the cat the squires had tied to the post she stooped and quickly picked up her dagger from the floor then incredibly ralph spoke sam he said i am then blood spurted from his mouth in a sudden flood cutting off his speech thank god gwenda thought the torrent stopped as quickly as it had started and he spoke again i am this time he was stopped by gwenda she leaped forward and thrust her dagger into his mouth he made a gruesome choking noise the blade sank into his throat she let go of the knife and stepped back she stared in horror at what she had done the man who had tormented her for so long was nailed to the wall as if crucified with a sword through his chest and a knife in his mouth he made no sound but his eyes showed that he was alive as they looked from gwenda to sam and back again in agony and terror and despair they stood still staring at him silent waiting at last his eyes closed the plague faded away in september cariss hospital gradually emptied as patients died without being replaced by new ones the vacant rooms were swept and scrubbed and juniper logs were burned in the fireplaces filling the hospital with a sharp autumn fragrance early in october the last victim was laid to rest in the hospitals graveyard a smokyred sun rose over kingsbridge cathedral as four strong young nuns lowered the shrouded corpse into the hole in the ground the body was that of a crookbacked weaver from outhenby but as caris gazed into the grave she saw her old enemy the plague lying on the cold earth under her breath she said are you really dead or will you come back again when the nuns returned to the hospital after the funeral there was nothing to do caris washed her face brushed her hair and put on the new dress she had been saving for this day it was the bright red of kingsbridge scarlet then she walked out of the hospital for the first time in half a year she went immediately into merthins garden his pear trees cast long shadows in the morning sun the leaves were beginning to redden and crisp while a few late fruits still hung on the boughs roundbellied and brown arn the gardener was chopping firewood with an axe when he saw caris he was at first startled and frightened then he realized what her appearance meant and his face split in a grin he dropped his axe and ran into the house in the kitchen em was boiling porridge over a cheerful fire she looked at caris as at a heavenly apparition she was so moved that she kissed cariss hands caris went up the stairs and into merthins bedroom he was standing at the window in his undershirt looking out at the nver that flowed past the front of the house he turned towards her and her heart faltered to see his familiar irregular face the gaze of alert intelligence and the quick humour in the twist of his lips his goldenbrown eyes looked lovingly at her and his mouth widened in a welcoming smile he showed no surprise he must have noticed that there had been fewer and fewer patients arriving at the hospital and he would have been expecting her to reappear any day he looked like a man whose hopes have been fulfilled she stood beside him at the window he put his arm around her shoulders and she put hers around his waist there was a little more grey in his red beard than six months ago she thought and his halo of hair seemed to have receded a little farther unless it was her imagination for a moment they both looked out at the river in the grey morning light the water was the colour of iron the surface shifted endlessly mirrorbright or deep black in irregular patterns always changing and always the same its over caris said then they kissed merthin announced a special autumn fair to celebrate the reopening of the town it was held during the last week of october the wooldealing season was over but anyway fleeces were no longer the principal commodity traded in kingsbridge and thousands of people came to buy the scarlet cloth for which the town was now famous at the saturdaynight banquet that opened the fair the guild honoured caris although kingsbridge had not totally escaped the plague it had suffered much less than other cities and most people felt they owed their lives to her precautions she was everyones hero the guildsmen insisted on marking her achievement and madge webber devised a new ceremony in which caris was presented with a gold key symbolizing the key to the city gate merthin felt very proud next day sunday merthin and caris went to the cathedral the monks were still at stjohnintheforest so the service was taken by father michael from st peters parish church in the town lady philippa countess of shiring showed up merthin had not seen philippa since ralphs funeral not many tears had been shed for his brother her husband the earl would normally have been buried at kingsbridge cathedral but because the town had been closed ralph had been interred in shiring his death remained a mystery his body had been found in a hunting lodge stabbed through the chest alan fernhill lay on the floor nearby also dead of stab wounds the two men appeared to have had dinner together for the remains of a meal were still on the table obviously there had been a fight but it was not clear whether ralph and alan had inflicted fatal wounds on one another or someone else had been involved nothing had been stolen money was found on both bodies their costly weapons lay beside them and two valuable horses were cropping the grass in the clearing outside because of that the shiring coroner inclined to the theory that the two men had killed one another in another sense there was no mystery ralph had been a man of violence and it was no surprise that he had died a violent death they that live by the sword shall die by the sword jesus said although that verse was not often quoted by the priests of king edward iiis reign if anything was remarkable it was that ralph had survived so many military campaigns so many bloody battles and so many charges by the french cavalry to die in a squabble a few miles from his home merthin had surprised himself by weeping at the funeral he wondered what he was sad about his brother had been a wicked man who caused a great deal of misery and his death was a blessing merthin had not been close to him since he murdered tilly what was there to mourn in the end merthin decided he was grieving for a ralph that might have been a man whose violence was not indulged but controlled whose aggression was directed not by ambition for personal glory but by a sense of justice perhaps it had once been possible for ralph to grow into such a man when the two of them had played together aged five and six floating wooden boats on a muddy puddle ralph had not been cruel and vengeful that was why merthin cried philippas two boys had been at the funeral and they were with her today the elder gerry was ralphs son by poor tilly the younger roley was believed by everyone to be ralphs son by philippa though in fact he was merthins fortunately roley was not a small lively redhead like merthin he was going to be tall and dignified like his mother roley was clutching a small wooden carving which he presented solemnly to merthin it was a horse and he had done it rather well for a tenyearold merthin realized most children would have sculpted the animal standing firmly on all four feet but roley had made it move its legs in different positions and its mane flying in the wind the boy had inherited his real fathers ability to visualize complex objects in three dimensions merthin felt an unexpected lump in his throat he bent down and kissed roleys forehead he gave philippa a grateful smile he guessed she had encouraged roley to give him the horse knowing what it would mean to him he glanced at caris and saw that she too understood its significance though nothing was said the atmosphere in the great church was joyful father michael was not a charismatic preacher and he went through the mass in a mumble but the nuns sang as beautifully as ever and an optimistic sun shone through the rich dark colours of the stainedglass windows afterwards they walked around the fair in the crisp autumn air caris held merthins arm and philippa walked on his other side the two boys ran on ahead while philippas bodyguard and ladyinwaiting followed behind business was good merthin saw kingsbridge craftsmen and traders were already beginning to rebuild their fortunes the town would recover from this epidemic faster than from the last senior members of the guild were going around checking weights and measures there were standards for the weight of a woolsack the width of a piece of cloth the size of a bushel and so on so that people knew what they were buying merthin encouraged guildsmen to perform these checks ostentatiously so that buyers could see how carefully the town monitored its tradesmen of course if they really suspected someone of cheating they would check discreetly and then if he was guilty get rid of him quietly philippas two sons ran excitedly from one stall to the next watching roley merthin said quietly to philippa now that ralph has gone is there any reason why roley should not know the truth she looked thoughtful i wish i could tell him but would it be for his sake or ours for ten years hes believed ralph to be his father two months ago he wept at ralphs graveside it would be a terrible shock to tell him now that he is another mans son they were speaking in low voices but caris could hear and she said i agree with philippa you have to think of the child not of yourself merthin saw the sense of what they were saying it was a small sadness on a happy day there is another reason philippa said gregory longfellow came to see me last week the king wants to make gerry earl of shiring at the age of thirteen merthin said the title of earl is always hereditary once it has been granted although baronies are not anyway i would administer the earldom for the next three years as you did all the time ralph was away fighting the french youll be relieved the king isnt asking you to marry again she made a face im too old so roley will be second in line for the earldom provided we keep our secret if something should happen to gerry merthin thought my son will become earl of shiring fancy that roley would be a good ruler philippa said hes intelligent and quite strongwilled but not cruel like ralph ralphs mean nature had been obvious at an early age he had been ten roleys age now when he shot gwendas dog but roley might prefer to be something else he looked again at the carved wooden horse philippa smiled she did not smile often but when she did it was dazzling she was still beautiful he thought she said give in to it and be proud of him merthin recalled how proud his father had been when ralph became the earl but he knew he would never feel the same way he would be proud of roley whatever he did as long as he did it well perhaps the boy would become a stonemason and carve saints and angels perhaps he would be a wise and merciful nobleman or he might do something else something his parents had never anticipated merthin invited philippa and the boys to dinner and they all left the cathedral precincts they walked over the bridge against the flow of loaded carts coming to the fair they crossed leper island together and went through the orchard into the house in the kitchen they found lolla as soon as she saw her father she burst into tears he put his arms around her and she sobbed on his shoulder wherever she had been she must have got out of the habit of washing for she smelled like a pigsty but he was too happy to care it was a while before they could get any sense out of her when at last she spoke she said they all died then she burst into fresh tears after a whiie she calmed down and spoke more coherently they all died she repeated suppressing her sobs jake and boyo netty and hal joanie and chalkie and ferret one by one and nothing i did made any difference they had been living in the forest merthin gathered a group of youngsters pretending to be nymphs and shepherds the details came out gradually the boys would kill a deer every now and again and sometimes they would go away for a day and come back with a barrel of wine and some bread lolla said they bought their supplies but merthin guessed they had robbed travellers lolla had somehow imagined they could live like that for ever she had not thought about how things might be different in the winter but in the end it was the plague rather than the weather that brought the idyll to an end i was so frightened lolla said i wanted caris gerry and roley listened with mouths agape they idolized their older cousin lolla although she had come home in tears the story of her adventure only enhanced her in their eyes i never want to feel like that again lolla said so powerless with my friends all sick and dying around me i can understand that caris said its how i felt when my mother died will you teach me to heal people lolla said to her i want to really help them as you do not just sing hymns and show them a picture of an angel i want to understand about bones and blood and herbs and things that make people better i want to be able to do something when a person is sick of course ill teach you if thats what you want caris said i would be pleased merthin was astonished lolla had been rebellious and badtempered for some years now and part of her rejection of authority had been a pretence that caris her stepmother was not really her parent and need not be respected he was delighted by the turnaround it was almost worth the agony of worry he had been through a moment later a nun came into the kitchen little annie jones is having a fit and we dont know why she said to caris can you come of course caris said lolla said can i go with you no said caris heres your first lesson you have to be clean go and wash now you can come with me tomorrow as she was leaving madge webber came in have you heard the news she said her face grim philemon is back on that sunday davey and amabel were married at the little church in wigleigh lady philippa gave permission for the manor house to be used for the party wulfric killed a pig and roasted it whole over a fire in the yard davey had bought sweet currants and annet baked them in buns there was no ale much of the barley harvest had rotted in the fields for want of reapers but philippa had sent sam home with a present of a barrel of cider gwenda still thought every day about that scene in the hunting lodge in the middle of the night she stared into the darkness and saw ralph with her knife in his mouth the hilt sticking out between his brown teeth and sams sword nailing him to the wall when she and sam had retrieved their weapons pulling them grimly out of ralph and the corpse had fallen to the floor it had looked as if the two dead men had killed one another gwenda had smeared blood on their unstained weapons and left them where they lay outside she had loosened the horses tethers so that they could survive for a few days if necessary until someone found them then she and sam had walked away the shiring coroner had speculated that outlaws might have been involved in the deaths but in the end had come to the conclusion gwenda expected no suspicion had fallen on her or sam they had got away with murder she had told sam an edited version of what had happened between her and ralph she pretended that this was the first time he had tried to coerce her and she said he had simply threatened to kill her if she refused sam was awestruck to think that he had killed an earl but he had no doubt that his action had been justified he had the right temperament for a soldier gwenda realized he would never suffer agonies of remorse over killing nor did she even though she often recalled the scene with revulsion she had killed alan fernhill and finished ralph off but she had not a twinge of regret the world was a better place without both of them ralph had died in the agony of knowing that his own son had stabbed him through the heart and that was exactly what he deserved in time she felt sure the vision of what she had done would cease to come to her by night she put the memory out of her mind and looked around the hall of the manor house at the carousing villagers the pig was eaten and the men were drinking the last of the cider aaron appletree produced his bagpipes the village had had no drummer since the death of annets father perkin gwenda wondered whether davey would take up drumming now wulfric wanted to dance as he always did when he had had a bellyful of drink gwenda partnered him for the first number laughing as she tried to keep up with his cavorting he lifted her swung her through the air crushed her to his body and put her down again only to circle her with great leaps he had no sense of rhythm but his sheer enthusiasm was infectious afterwards she declared herself exhausted and he danced with his new daughterinlaw amabel then of course he danced with annet his eye fell on her as soon as the tune ended and he let go of amabel annet was sitting on a bench at one side of the hall of the manor house she wore a green dress that was girlishly short and showed her dainty ankles the dress was not new but she had embroidered the bosom with yellow and pink flowers as always a few ringlets had escaped from her headdress and they hung around her face she was twenty years too old to dress that way but she did not know it and nor did wulfric gwenda smiled as they began to dance she wanted to look happy and carefree but she realized her expression might be more like a grimace and she gave up trying she tore her gaze away from them and watched davey and amabel perhaps amabel would not turn out quite like her mother she had some of annets coquettish ways but gwenda had never seen her actually flirting and right now she seemed uninterested in anyone but her husband gwenda scanned the room and located her other son sam he was with the young men telling a story miming it holding the reins of an imaginary horse and almost falling off he had them spellbound they probably envied his luck in becoming a squire sam was still living at earlscastle lady philippa had kept on most of the squires and menatarms for her son gerry would need them to ride and hunt with him and practise with the sword and the lance gwenda hoped that during the period of philippas regency sam would learn a more intelligent and merciful code than he would have got from ralph there was not much else to look at and gwendas gaze returned to her husband and the woman he had once wanted to marry as gwenda had feared annet was making the most of wulfrics exuberance and inebriation she gave him sexy smiles when they danced apart and when they came together she clung to him gwenda thought like a wet shirt the dance seemed to go on for ever aaron appletree repeating the bouncy melody endlessly on his bagpipes gwenda knew her husbands moods and now she saw the glint in his eye that always appeared when he was about to ask her to lie with him annet knew exactly what she was doing gwenda thought furiously she shifted restlessly on her bench willing the music to stop trying not to let her anger show however she was seething with indignation when the tune ended with a flourish she made up her mind to get wulfric to calm down and sit beside her she would keep him close for the rest of the afternoon and there would be no trouble but then annet kissed him while he still had his hands on her waist she stood on tiptoe and tilted her face and kissed him full on the lips briefly but firmly and gwenda boiled over she jumped up from her bench and strode across the hall as she passed the bridal couple her son davey saw the expression on her face and tried to detain her but she ignored him she went up to wulfric and annet who were still gazing at one another and smiling stupidly she poked annets shoulder with her finger and said loudly leave my husband alone wulfric said gwenda please dont you say anything gwenda said just stay away from this whore annets eyes flashed defiance its not dancing that whores are paid for im sure you know all about what whores do how dare you davey and amabel intervened amabel said to annet please dont make a scene ma annet said its not me its gwenda gwenda said im not the one trying to seduce someone elses husband davey said mother youre spoiling the wedding gwenda was too enraged to listen she always does this she jilted him twentythree years ago but shes never let him go annet began to cry gwenda was not surprised annets tears were just another means of getting her way wulfric reached out to pat annets shoulder and gwenda snapped dont touch her he jerked back his hand as if burned you dont understand annet sobbed i understand you all too well gwenda said no you dont annet said she wiped her eyes and gave gwenda a surprisingly direct candid look you dont understand that you have won hes yours you dont know how he adores you respects you admires you you dont see the way he looks at you when youre speaking to someone else gwenda was taken aback well she mumbled but she did not know what else to say annet went on does he eye younger women does he ever sneak away from you how many nights have you slept apart in the last twenty years two three cant you see that he will never love another woman as long as he lives gwenda looked at wulfric and realized that all this was true in fact it was obvious she knew it and so did everyone she tried to remember why she was so angry with annet but somehow the logic of it had slipped her mind the dancing had stopped and aaron had put down his pipes all the villagers now gathered around the two women mothers of the bridal couple annet said i was a foolish and selfish girl and i made a stupid decision and lost the best man ive ever met and you got him sometimes i cant resist the temptation to pretend it happened the other way around and hes mine so i smile at him and i pat his arm and hes kind to me because he knows he broke my heart you broke your own heart gwenda said i did and you were the lucky girl who benefited from my folly gwenda was dumbfounded she had never looked at annet as a sad person to her annet had always been a powerful threatening figure ever scheming to take wulfric back but that was never going to come to pass annet said i know it annoys you when wulfric is nice to me id like to say it wont happen again but i know my own weakness do you have to hate me for it dont let this spoil the joy of the wedding and of the grandchildren we both want instead of regarding me as your lifelong enemy couldnt you think of me as a bad sister who sometimes misbehaves and makes you cross but still has to be treated as one of the family she was right gwenda had always thought of annet as a pretty face with an empty head but on this occasion annet was the wiser of the two and gwenda felt humbled i dont know she said perhaps i could try annet stepped forward and kissed gwendas cheek gwenda felt annets tears on her face thank you annet said gwenda hesitated then put her arms around annets bony shoulders and hugged her all around them the villagers clapped and cheered a moment later the music began again early in november philemon arranged a service of thanksgiving for the end of the plague archbishop henri came with canon claude so did sir gregory longfellow gregory must have come to kingsbridge to announce the kings choice of bishop merthin thought formally he would tell the monks that the king had nominated a certain person and it would be up to the monks to elect that person or someone else but in the end the monks usually voted for whomever the king had chosen merthin could read no message in philemons face and he guessed that gregory had not yet revealed the kings choice the decision meant everything to merthin and caris if claude got the job their troubles were over he was moderate and reasonable but if philemon became bishop they faced more years of squabbling and lawsuits henri took the service but philemon preached the sermon he thanked god for answering the prayers of kingsbridge monks and sparing the town from the worst effects of the plague he did not mention that the monks had fled to stjohnintheforest and left the townspeople to fend for themselves nor that caris and merthin had helped god to answer the monks prayers by closing the town gates for six months he made it sound as if he had saved kingsbridge i makes my blood boil merthin said to caris not troubling to keep his voice down hes completely twisting the facts relax she said god knows the truth and so do the people philemon isnt fooling anyone she was right of course after a battle the soldiers on the winning side always thanked god but all the same they knew the difference between good generals and bad after the service merthin as alderman was invited to dine at the priors palace with the archbishop he was seated next to canon claude as soon as grace had been said a general hubbub of conversation broke out and merthin spoke to claude in a low urgent voice does the archbishop know yet who the king has chosen as bishop claude replied with an almost imperceptible nod is it you claudes head shake was equally minimal philemon then again the tiny nod merthins heart sank how could the king pick a fool and coward such as philemon in preference to someone as competent and sensible as claude but he knew the answer philemon had played his cards well has gregory instructed the monks yet no claude leaned closer he will probably tell philemon informally tonight after supper then speak to the monks in chapter tomorrow morning so weve got until the end of the day for what to change his mind you wont do that im going to try youll never succeed bear in mind that im desperate merthin toyed with his food eating little and fighting to keep his patience until the archbishop rose from the table then he spoke to gregory if you would walk with me in the cathedral i would speak to you about something i feel sure will interest you deeply he said and gregory nodded assent they paced side by side up the nave where merthin could be sure no one was lurking close enough to hear he took a deep breath what he was about to do was dangerous he was going to try to bend the king to his will if he failed he could be charged with treason and executed he said there have long been rumours that a document exists somewhere in kingsbridge that the king would dearly love to destroy gregory was stonefaced but he said go on that was as good as confirmation this letter was in the possession of a knight who has recently died has he said gregory startled you obviously know exactly what im talking about gregory answered like a lawyer let us say for the sake of argument that i do i would like to do the king the service of restoring that document to him whatever it may be he knew perfectly well what it was but he could adopt a cautious pretence of ignorance as well as gregory the king would be grateful said gregory how grateful what did you have in mind a bishop more in sympathy with the people of kingsbridge than philemon gregory looked hard at him are you trying to blackmail the king of england merthin knew this was the point of danger we kingsbridge folk are merchants and craftsmen he said trying to sound reasonable we buy we sell we make deals im just trying to make a bargain with you i want to sell you something and ive told you my price theres no blackmail no coercion i make no threats if you dont want what im selling that will be the end of the matter they reached the altar gregory stared at the crucifix that surmounted it merthin knew exactly what he was thinking should he have merthin arrested taken to london and tortured until he revealed the whereabouts of the document or would it be simpler and more convenient to the king just to nominate a different man as bishop of kingsbridge there was a long silence the cathedral was cold and merthin pulled his cloak closer around him at last gregory said where is the document close by ill take you there very well and our bargain if the document is what you believe it to be i will honour my side of the arrangement and make canon claude bishop yes thank you said merthin well need to walk a little way into the woods they went side by side down the main street and across the bridge their breath making clouds in the air a wintry sun shone with little warmth as they walked into the forest merthin found the way easily this time having followed the same route only a few weeks earlier he recognized the little spring the big rock and the boggy valley they came quickly to the clearing with the broad oak tree and he went straight to the spot where he had dug up the scroll he was dismayed to see that someone else had got here first he had carefully smoothed the loose earth and covered it with leaves but despite that someone had found the hiding place there was a hole a foot deep and a pile of recently excavated earth beside it and the hole was empty he stared at the hole appalled oh hell he said gregory said i hope this isnt some kind of charade let me think merthin snapped gregory shut up only two people knew about this merthin said thinking aloud i havent told anyone so thomas must have he was getting senile before he died i think he spilled the beans but to whom thomas spent the last few months of his life at stjohnintheforest and the monks were keeping everyone else out so it must have been a monk how many are there twenty or so but not many would know enough about the background to understand the significance of an old mans mumblings about a buried letter thats all very well but where is it now i think i know said merthin give me one more chance very well they walked back to the town as they crossed the bridge the sun was setting over leper island they went into the darkening cathedral walked to the southwest tower and climbed the narrow spiral staircase to the little room where the costumes for the mystery play were kept merthin had not been here for eleven years but dusty storerooms did not change much especially in cathedrals and this was the same he found the loose stone in the wall and pulled it out all philemons treasures were behind the stone including the love note carved in wood and there among them was a bag made of oiled wool merthin opened the bag and drew from it a vellum scroll i thought so he said philemon got the secret out of thomas when thomas was losing his mind no doubt philemon was keeping the letter to be used as a bargaining counter if the decision on the bishopric went the wrong way but now merthin could use it instead he handed the scroll to gregory gregory unrolled it a look of awe came over his face as he read dear god he said those rumours were true he rolled it up again he had the look of a man who has found something he has been seeking for many years is it what you expected merthin said oh yes and the king will be grateful profoundly so your part of the bargain will be kept said gregory you shall have claude as your bishop thank god said merthin eight days later early in the morning caris was at the hospital teaching lolla how to tie a bandage when merthin came in i want to show you something he said come to the cathedral it was a bright cold winters day caris wrapped herself in a heavy red cloak as they were crossing the bridge into the city merthin stopped and pointed the spire is finished he said caris looked up she could see its shape through the spider web of flimsy scaffolding that still surrounded it the spire was immensely tall and graceful as her eye followed its upward taper caris had the feeling that it might go on for ever she said and is it the tallest building in england he smiled yes they walked up the main street and into the cathedral merthin led the way up the staircase within the walls of the central tower he was used to the climb but caris was panting by the time they emerged into the open air at the summit of the tower on the walkway that ran round the base of the spire up here the breeze was stiff and cold they looked at the view while caris caught her breath all kingsbridge was laid out to the north and west the main street the industrial district the river and the island with the hospital smoke rose from a thousand chimneys miniature people hurried through the streets walking or riding or driving carts carrying tool bags or baskets of produce or heavy sacks men and women and children fat and thin their clothing poor and worn or rich and heavy mostly brown and green but with flashes of peacock blue and scarlet the sight of them all made caris marvel each individual had a different life every one of them rich and complex with dramas in the past and challenges in the future happy memories and secret sorrows and a crowd of friends and enemies and loved ones ready merthin said caris nodded he led her up the scaffolding it was an insubstantial affair of ropes and branches and it always made her nervous though she did not like to say so if merthin could climb it so could she the wind made the whole structure sway a little and the skirts of cariss robe flapped around her legs like the sails of a ship the spire was as tall again as the tower and the climb up the rope ladders was strenuous they stopped half way for a rest the spire is very plain merthin said not needing to catch his breath just a roll moulding at the angles caris realized that other spires she had seen featured decorative crochets bands of coloured stone or tile and windowlike recesses the simplicity of merthins design was what made it seem to go on for ever merthin pointed down hey look whats happening id rather not look down i think philemon is leaving for avignon she had to see that she was standing on a broad platform of planks but all the same she had to hold on tight with both hands to the upright pole to convince herself that she was not falling she swallowed hard and directed her gaze down the perpendicular side of the tower to the ground below it was worth the effort a charette drawn by two oxen was outside the priors palace an escort consisting of a monk and a manatarms both on horseback waited patiently philemon stood beside the charette while the monks of kingsbridge came forward one by one and kissed his hand when they had all done brother sime handed him a blackandwhite cat and caris recognized the descendant of godwyns cat archbishop philemon climbed into the carriage and the driver whipped the oxen the vehicle lumbered slowly out of the gate and down the main street caris and merthin watched it cross the double bridge and disappear into the suburbs thank god hes gone said caris merthin looked up not much farther to the top he said soon you will be higher off the ground than any woman in england has ever stood he began to climb again the wind grew stronger but despite her anxiety caris felt exhilarated this was merthins dream and he had made it come true every day for hundreds of years people for miles around would look at this spire and think how beautiful it was they reached the top of the scaffolding and stood on the stage that encircled the peak of the spire caris tried to forget that there was no railing around the platform to stop them falling off at the point of the spire was a cross it had looked small from the ground but now caris saw that it was taller than she theres always a cross at the top of a spire merthin said thats conventional aside from that practice varies at chartres the cross bears an image of the sun ive done something different caris saw that at the foot of the cross merthin had placed a lifesize stone angel the kneeling figure was not gazing up at the cross but out to the west over the town looking more closely caris saw that the angels features were not conventional the small round face was clearly female and looked vaguely familiar with neat features and short hair then she realized that the face was her own she was amazed will they let you do that she said merthin nodded half the town thinks youre an angel already im not though she said no he said with the familiar grin that she loved so much but youre the closest theyve seen the wind blustered suddenly caris grabbed merthin he held her tightly standing confidently on spread feet the gust died away as quickly as it had come but merthin and caris remained locked together standing there at the top of the world for a long time afterwards acknowledgements my principal historical consultants were sam cohn geoffrey hindley and marilyn
