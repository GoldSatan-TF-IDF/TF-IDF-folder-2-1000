john lescroart the vig the second book in the dismas hardy series to al giannini chapter one at on a wednesday afternoon in late september dismas hardy sat on the customer side of the bar at the little shamrock and worked the corners of his dart flights with a very fine emery board a pint of guinness pulled a quarter of an hour ago had lost its head and rested untouched in the bars gutter hardy whistled tonelessly as happy as hed been in ten years hed opened the bar at pm sharp and had served a bottle of miller draft to tommy a regular whod retired from schoolteaching some years back and who now spent most afternoons by the large picture window talking to whoever would listen but today tommy told hardy he had an appointment and left after one beer tommy was all right but being left alone didnt break hardys heart hardy finished one flight and raised his head he took the guinness and sipped at it through the window over tommys table light traffic passed on lincoln blvd across the street the evergreens and eucalyptus that bordered golden gate park shimmered in a light breeze there had been no fog that morning and hardy guessed the breeze would still be warm if you want summer in san francisco plan your vacation for the fall a bus pulled up across the street and stopped when it pulled away it left a man standing lost looking at the corner a minute later the double doors swung open hardy scooped up his flights and swung himself around the end of the bar he stood behind the porcelain beer taps and nodded at the customer if it was a customer at first glance the man didnt bring to mind visions of bankrolls and limousines whether he had sufficient money for a beer seemed questionable his shirt was open at the collar and frayed badly his baggy pants needed pressing under a forehead that went all the way back eyes squinted adjusting to the relative darkness of the bar although the shamrock was no cave he needed a shave help you hardy asked then as he looked more closely the pieces began to fall into place rusty the man let loose a lowwatt smile that seemed to require an effort he stepped closer to the bar ten points he stuck his hand over the bar and hardy took it how you doin diz the voice was quiet and assured cultured hardy asked what he was drinking and said it was on him same as always hardy closed his eyes trying to remember then turned and reached up to the top shelf grabbed a bottle of wild turkey and snuck a glance at the man whod shared his office back in the days when theyd both worked for the district attorney rusty ingraham had aged there was of course the hair or lack of it at twentyfive rusty had sported a shock of orangered hair and a handlebar mustache now with no facial hair except the stubble bald on top and gray on the sides he looked oldhandsome still but old hardy poured him a double prodigious rusty ingraham said nodding at his glass hardy shrugged you know somebody at all you know what they drink well you found your calling he lifted the glass hardy raised his pint and they both said skol sohardy put down his glassyou still a lawyer ingrahams lips turned up yet there was a gentleness hardy hadnt seen before before hed left the das ingraham might have had some sensitivity but it didnt ever come out gentle now his halfsmile was that of a man looking back only the good times whatever theyd been would nevercould neverreturn he sipped slowly at his whisky you must have been out of the field a while yourself if you still call them lawyers hardy grinned it was an old joke attorney thenyou still an attorney like a flame trying to catch on a wick the smile flickered back hardy was getting the feeling ingraham hadnt spoken to a soul in a long while i still have that distinction he paused though i rarely stand upon the esquire in correspondence and as you can seehe gestured at his clothingmy practice is in a hiatus he drank again like a drinking man but not hungrily not like an alcoholic there was a difference and hardy was keyed to it you do this fulltime hardys eyes swept the room proprietary nine years now i own a quarter of the place thats great and youre still with jane well we got divorced once but were going at it again he shrugged im confident but cautious yep you always were so what about you i noticed you came by on the bus their eyes met a moment then the flame of rustys smile went out i got my car stolen a month ago its still gone a major hassle so i spend a lot of time waiting for the ngodot hardy liked that the njudah which ran behind the shamrock was a notoriously slow line otherwise you pretty much see it diz i hang out i live in a barge down at china basin chase an ambulance every month or two hit a good nag now and then ive still got one good suit i get my shoes shined and for a day or two i can get by he tipped up his glass and asked hardy if he could buy him one he put a tendollar bill in the gutter hardy refilled them both but didnt grab the bill actually diz i came by here today for a reason you remember louis baker hardy frowned he remembered louis baker eight aggravated to thirteen nine and a half it turns out nine and a half hardy repeated hardly worth the effort not even hardly hardy took a belt of his stout set the glass down and swore i mustve sent down a hundred guys you too he said ingraham nodded all told i put away two hundred and fourteen assholes hardy whistled you were red hot werent you yeah but there was only one louis baker baker had been a cancer in hunters point for the first twenty years of his life he had a huge head a welltrimmed afro and the body of a defensive safety in spite of having a sheet ranging from the pettyvandalism and car theft burglary and muggingswhen he was in his teens to the heinous as he matured he was convinced he would never do hard time and not without reason the da had been forced to drop charges on him twice for murder and four times for rape he was good at not leaving evidence or at making witnesses reluctant to testify the one time baker went to trial for attempted murder and mayhem on a man who had talked too long to his girlfriend in a eleven the man had finally refused to identify him when the crunch came he got all the way to the stand then looked at baker at the defendants table and evidently decided that if he pointed the finger at him he would not live to see his grandchildren so he suddenly couldnt say for sure that baker had been the man whod cut off his ears before stabbing him in the stomach in the middle of the afternoon hardy had been the prosecutor in that case the das officerusty ingraham this timehad finally gotten him for armed robbery of four victims one of whom hed wounded but as it was only bakers first conviction meaning that in the courts eyes he wasnt yet a hardened criminal and hence a candidate for rehabilitation the judge had been inclined to be lenient and had given him eight years when the verdict came down baker had quietly hung his head for a short time then looked over at the prosecution table hardy had wanted to come down for the verdict see this guy finally get put away and he was sitting next to ingraham baker looked in their direction directly at ingraham seemingly memorizing him you motherfucker he said are a dead man the judge slammed his gavel ingraham made a motion to aggravate bakers sentence in view of the threat and the judge slapped on another five right then and there the bailiff got the huge man to his feet got some help from two deputies and started pulling him across the courtroom while he glared at ingraham then hardy did a stupid thing bakers glaring his posing his toughguy bullshit struck hardy as funny for a secondfor just a second but it was enough here was this twentyoneyearold punk going down for a long time who thought his ghetto glare was going to put the fear of god or something into the man whod sent him there so when baker struggling in his chains fixed hardy with the eye hardy pursed his lips and blew him a goodbye kiss at which point baker had really gone birdshit pulling loose from the bailiff and two deputies and nearly getting to the prosecution table before he was quieted down with nightsticks the scene replayed itself in hardys dreams for months it wasnt helped by the letter hardy received during bakers first week in prison hed found out who hardy was from his own lawyer and when he got out the letter said he was going to kill hardy too hardy sent copies of the letter to the warden and the judge whod sentenced baker but the parole board ruled on these matters and since the judge had already bumped his time for threats they didnt feel compelled to do it again the letter hardy received back from the warden explained that although many inmates were bitter just after sentencing most came around to serving good time and concentrating on getting an early parole most maybe baker hardy wasnt so sure so hes out ingraham pulled his cuff back and checked his watch hardy wasnt positive but it looked to be a hell of a rolex if theyre on time in about two hours howd you hear about it i got a friend in paroles he called me and i checked with the warden at the house nobodys meeting him at the gate who would supposedly taking the bus back to town hardy whistled you have checked the guy got my attention so what are you going to do his old office mate sipped at his drink what can you do somethings gonna get us all maybe lock up more carefully did you ever pack ingraham shook his head thats for you cops we gentlemen who believe in the rule of law are supposed to have no need for that hardware hardy had come up to the das office after a tour in vietnam and several years on the police force ingraham had come up through stanford then hastings law school you planning to debate with louis baker im not planning on seeing the man what if he comes to see you i called the warden after i got the word he says louis has been a model inmate has found the lord gets max time off for good behavior ive got nothing to worry about neither of us do evidently hardy leaned across the bar then why are you here ingrahams smile finally caught because it sounds like a heap of bullshit to me he leaned back on the barstool i thought it might not be a bad idea to stay in touch for a couple of weeks you and me hardy waited not getting it i mean call each other every day at the same time something like that what would that do well hell diz were not going to get police protection nobodys gonna put a tail on louis to see if he heads for our neighborhoods this way if one of us doesnt call at least we have some clue one of us bites it maybe but the other one is warned hardy picked up his guinness and downed the last two inches you think he really might do it dont you yep im afraid i do jesus one other thing yeah i thought you might recommend what kind of gun jane was in hong kong buying clothes for i magnin she would be back this weekend they hadnt quite formalized living together again although some of janes clothes hung in the closet in hardys bedroom she still had her housetheir old houseon jackson and would stay there once in a while on nights she worked late downtown but three or four nights a week for the past three months shed slept here out in the avenues with her exhusband padding now from room to room he realized how much he had come to need her again well not need you didnt really need anybody to survive but once you got beyond survival you needed somebody if you wanted to feel whole or alive or whatever it was that made getting up something to look forward to rather than dread after hed finished his shift and moses mcguire had come in to spell him at the shamrock he shot five or six games of to keep his handeye sharp the newly formed flights worked well and he held his place at the line until he was ready to quit leaving unbeaten he drove home in darkness parking his suzuki samurai which he called his seppuku on the street in front of the only white picket fence on the block inside he cooked a steak in a black castiron pan and ate it with a can of peas he fed the tropical fish in the tank in the bedroom read a hundred pages of barbara tuchman and realized anew that the world had probably always been very much like the wonderful place it was today he went into his office to open his safe and look at his guns hed recommended to rusty that he consider buying a regulation police special it was a nofrills firearm that using hollowpoint slugs you nicked a guy on the pinkie and hed spin around like a ballerina and hit the ground hardy lifted his own special from the safe the colt was more of a show gun and heavy and the target pistol might stop a charging tree rat but that was about it the special was the one he pulled a box of bullets from the back of the safe and carefully loaded the weapon immediately he was nervous and walked into his bedroom opened a drawer in his night table and deposited the special there it was he figured he would sit at his desk and wait for rustys call at then watch some la law and turn ina quiet night he picked the three darts out of the board across from his desk and starting throwing easy and loose trying not to think about louis baker or jane or rusty ingraham someone had once told him that the way to turn water into gold is to go to the middle of a jungle and light a fire and put a pot of water on to boil now you ready heres the trick for a half hour dont think of a lion pick up your pot of gold and go home hardy checked the clock on his desk it was maybe hed gotten it mixed up and they werent starting until tomorrow morning at still he took the piece of paper that rusty had given him and dialed the number the phone rang eight times and hardy hung up anyway rusty was supposed to call him at night and hardy call rusty in the morning unless one of them was not going to be home then theyd change the schedule on those days it was only going to be for two weeks at he tried again they must have said theyd start the next morning hardy wasnt tired none of this seemed very real but he did lie down on his bed and take the special out of the drawer next to him he flipped off the light and pulled a comforter over him his clothes still on the gun in his hand he looked at the clock by his bed it was no call chapter two it was dark when the telephone rang in the kitchen hardy gun in hand woke up from another of his fitful dozes flicked on the kitchen light and got to it before the second ring rusty whos rusty a womans voice far away crackled on the wire after a short delay hardys head was clearing god its good to hear your voice were you asleep the clock on the stove read its three oclock in the morning here he said i was just jogging around the neighborhood and happened to hear the phone in the morning i cant get this straight at all its okay i dont even know what day it is there i mean thats all right im right here and i dont know what day it is and whos rusty jane was halfway around the world and there was no need to worry her my old office mate i was just having a dream i guess he held the telephones mouthpiece in one hand and became aware of the gun in the other he almost thought of telling her then look sweetie im standing in my kitchen holding a loaded special and i am considering the possibility that someone whos probably good at it is trying to kill me but dont worry have a good time in hong kong dont think about lions what he did was ask her how her trip was going good except it looks like ive got to stay another week maybe ten days peachy silence dismas im here i was just doing a few cartwheels this happens you know i know im sorry id just like to see you me too she went on to explain about the vagaries of supply in the east ships carrying thousands of bolts of material from the laborcheap factories in the philippines thailand and korea coming in to hong kong to be made into designer clothes by therelativelylaborcheap tailors there but we cant commit really i mean buy unless we see the colors feel the quality of the material i know hardy said feel the quality and two of the ships are running late they could come in earlier but even so itll take a few days to go through the bolts i got it really hardy put the gun on the counter it doesnt thrill me but ill live poor dismas otherwise hows the trip going well people are starting to get nervous about ninetyseven you can feel it already nobody wants to talk longrange like by next year some plans may evolve and the brits will be gone its weird its better hardy said people ought to remember they might be gone by next year jane paused my cheerful exhusband hey not so ex not so cheerful either gone by next year you cant live thinking like that hardy wanted to tell her youd better that even a year was pretty optimistic he was tempted to remind her that their son hadnt even made it that year but he let it pass she didnt need to be reminded of that youre right he said you cant live like that dismas are you all right she asked are you doing anything for fun i am tearing up the town id just rather be doing it with you he realized he was being a pain in the ass look im sorry its three am and you tell me youll be gone another week im a little disoriented is all a little case of vu zjahday vu zjahday yeah its the opposite of déjà vu the sense that youve never been somewhere before jane laughed okay youre all right im all right i love you she said maybe when you get home we talk some longrange huh a beat or it might have been the delay on the line it could happen she said frank batiste wasnt sure anymore that he was happy to have made lieutenant it was more money and that was all right but sitting here in the office all day the conduit for gripes going up and edicts coming down was wearing him down in ancient times they killed the bearer of bad news and he was starting to understand why maybe somehow the news would go away or wouldnt have to be thought about he couldnt just hide in here all day he forced himself up from his chair feeling the beginning of back pain and opened the door the homicide department was commencing to take on the feel of a countryclub locker room several golf bags leaned against desks he walked back through the room nodding at the guys and getting ice for his troubles hell it wasnt his doing he even sided with the men maybe he should step down as looie let someone else deal with this crap but what would that do just put someone else in someone who wouldnt be as sympathetic to the team if only the city that once knew how had a goddamn clue he thought now it didnt know how to wipe its own ass and nowhere was it more clear than here in homicide these fourteen guysit sounded funny but was true anywaywere the shock troops against the worst elements in the city no one got to homicide without nearly a decade of solid police work without a lot of pride and without some special mix of killer instinct stubbornness and brains these guys were the elite and if you cut their morale you had a problem but last week for the first time in seven years the department had brought charges against two men on the squad a month before the two officersclarence raines and mario valentihad gone to arrest a telephonecompany executive named fred treadwell for murdering his lover and his lovers new boyfriend treadwell had resisted arrestkicking out a window of his secondstory apartment cutting his head upon his exit falling to the alley below breaking an ankle smashing his head again as he pitched into some garbage cans and escaping on foot to his attorneys office treadwell and both the other principals in this triangle being gay his attorney immediately called a press conference and trotted poor fred out with his cuts breaks and bruises charging police brutality valenti and raines two of the elite with perfect records had it seemed suddenly not been able to contain their prejudice against gays probably as a result of their own latent homosexuality and had beaten fred to within an inch of his life leaving him for dead in the alley behind his apartment somebody took freds lame storyor the righteous outrage of the gay communityseriously enough to bust raines and valenti and begin a formal investigation as if that werent enough at about the same time as the charges came down the latest budget cuts were announced effective immediately no overtime was to be approved for routine procedural work which meant writing reports and serving subpoenas a significant number of murder cases now were what they called nhi cases it stood for no humans involved and a kind interpretation meant that the victim the suspect and all the witnesses were at best petty criminals these people were not fond of policemen and tended to be hard to find during normal business hours so the service of subpoenas would most often take place in the early morning or late at night and the cops going out after their witnesses would put in the overtime knowing this was their best chance of doing their job now the city had decided it wasnt going to pay for that which led to the golf clubs the guys went out at eight or nine oclock knocked at doors found no one home played a round of golf went back to the same doors and tried again still found no one home came back to the office and wrote reports on their day in the field it sucked and everybody knew it jess mendez nodded at the lieutenant and called over his shoulder hey lanier what time you tee off batiste didnt turn around he heard lanier behind him i got three subpoenas first say ninethirty abe glitskys desk was near the back window with a view of the freeway and beyond it downtown today however at there was no view but gray glitsky did not have a bag of clubs leaning against his desk he was also one of only two men in the squad who worked without a partner he and batiste had come up to homicide the same year and neither of them had given a shit about their minority statusglitsky was half jewish and half black batiste a spanishsurnameso there was a bond of sorts between them batiste pulled up a chair forget your clubs abe glitsky looked up from something he was writing i was just going to come see you complete a foursome abe moved his face into what he might have thought was a smile he had a hawk nose and a scar through his lips top to bottom his smile had induced confessions from some bad people he might be a nice person somewhere in there but he didnt look like one im glad you think its funny he said i dont think its funny abe put his pen down flo and i were thinking we might make a move what are you talking about this was worse than golf clubs las recruiting id have to go back to burglary maybe for a while but thatd be all right batiste leaned forward what are you talking about youve got what nineteen years close but theyll transfer most of em he motioned down at his desk i was just working on the wording here on this application see where it says reason for leaving present employment should i say incredible horseshit or keep it clean with bureaucratic nonsense batiste pulled up to the desk abe wait a minute he wasnt about to say abe couldnt quitof course he could quitbut he had to say something he put his hand on the paper can you just wait a goddamn minute abes stare was flat sure he said i can wait all day you know itll turn around abe shook his head no i dont frank not anymore its the whole city it doesnt need us and i dont need it but it does need us no argument there give me a call when it finds out abe took the paper back and glanced at it again incredible horseshit he said its a stronger statement dont you think hardy parked at the end of the alley and turned up the heater his samurai was not airtight and the wind hissed at the canvas roof on both sides buildings rose to four stories and in front of him fog obscured the canal and the shipyards beyond it was not yet the gunstill loadedwas in his glove compartment it was a registered weapon it was probably one of the few legally concealable firearms in san francisco hardys exfatherinlaw was judge andy fowler and when hardy left the force hed applied for a ccw carry a concealed weapon license which was never in the normal course of san francisco events approved but judge fowler was not without influence and he did not fancy his daughter becoming a widow not that being allowed to pack a weapon would necessarily make any difference but he had talked hardy into it and this was the first time hardy had had occasion to carry the thing around okay he would legally carry it then even concealed if he wanted to he turned off the ignition he slowly spun the cylinder on the making sure again that it was loaded stepping out into the swirling fog he lifted the collar of the windbreaker with his left hand in his right hand the gun felt like it weighed fifty pounds he hesitated stupid he said out loud but he moved forward the alley ended in a walkway that bounded the china basin canal to hardys left an industrial warehouse hugged the walkway seemingfrom hardys perspectiveto lean over the canal further and further before it disappeared into the fog the canal at full tide lapped at the piling somewhere under hardy there was no visible current the water was greenish brown mercurytinged by the oil on its surface behind hardy the third street bridge rumbled as traffic passed somewhere ahead of him was another bridge ingraham had told him that his was the fourth mooring down from third between the bridges hardy walked into the wind his head tucked the gun pointing at the ground the first mooringlittle more than some tires on a pontoon against the canals edge and a box for connecting electricitywas empty a chinese couple approached walking quickly hand in hand they nodded as they came abreast of hardy if they noticed the gun they didnt show it the second mooring perhaps sixty feet along held a tug which looked deserted next was a bluewater cruiser a beauty which hardy guessed was a thirtytwofooter named atlantis he wasnt sure hed want to name a boat after something that had gone down into the ocean ingraham had called his home a barge it was a fair descriptiona large flat covered box that squatted against the pontoons tires its roof at about the height of hardys knees getting there finally seeing that the electrical wires were hooked up suddenly the whole thing seemed crazy again he was just being paranoid he looked at his watch rusty should be up by now anyway hardy leaned down rusty a foghorn bellowed from somewhere hey rusty hardy put the gun in his pocket and vaulted onto the barges deck three weathered directors chairs were arranged in the area in front of the doorway green plants and a tomato bush that needed picking livened up the foredeck a twopound salmon sinker nailed to the center of the door was a knocker hardy picked it up and let it drop and the door swung open there was no movement from inside no sound but the lapping canal and the traffic now invisible back through the fog the wood was splintered at the jamb hardy put his hand in his pocket feeling the gun there taking it back out he ducked his head going through the door descending three wooden steps to the floorlevel inside a line of narrow windows high on the walls probably provided light normally but curtains had been pulled across them on both sides the room was cold colder than it was outside in the dim light from the open doorway nothing seemed out of place there was a telephone on a low table in front of a stylish low couch hardy picked up the receiver heard a dial tone put it back down then he saw the pole lamp lying on the floor on the other side of the room he reached up and pulled back the curtain for a little more light the lamps globe was broken into five or six pieces scattered around the floor at the junction of the rear and side walls a swinging halfdoor led to the galley another door in the center of the rear wall was ajar hardy kicked at it gently it opened halfway then caught on something a wide line of black something ran from under the door to the wall hardy stepped over it pushing his way through his stomach rose as though he were seasick and he leaned against the wall what was blocking the door was a womans arm naked she was stretched out as though reaching for something as though shed been crawlingtrying to get out there was something around her necksomething strange metallicholding her head up at an unnatural angle hardy realized it was a neck brace hardy looked back to the stateroom it was painted in blood there was a sound like something dropping on the front deck and he dropped to one knee steadying the gun with both hands and aiming for the hall doorway this is the police he heard throw out your weapon and come out with your hands up chapter three like the other housing projects in san francisco holly park had at one time been a nice place to live the twostory units were light and airy the paint and trim had been fresh residents who did not keep their yards up to neighborhood standards could in theory be fined although such infractions were rare due to the pride people took in their homes in seedlings had been planted to shade and gentrify the placeeucalyptus cypress magnolia within the square block that bounded holly park there were three communal gardens and a childrens playground with swing sets and monkey bars and slides curtains hung behind shining windows in the four grassy spaces between buildings now each a barren nomansland called a cut and owned by a crack dealer people had hung laundry and fixed bicycles one hundred eightysix people over eighteen claimed residence in holly park there were one hundred seventeen children and juveniles every known resident was black one hundred fiftynine of the adults had police records of the juveniles between twelve and eighteen sixtyeight percent had acquired rap sheets most for vandalism shoplifting possession of dope several for mugging burglary and rape and three for murder there were four nuclear familiesa man his legal wife and their childrenin holly park the rest was a fluid mass of women with children because holly park was provided by the city and county for indigent relief by definition every resident was on welfare but twentytwo women and thirty men held regular jobs the official reported per capita income of all the adults in holly park was far below the poverty level income from the sale of rock cocaine was estimated by the san francisco police department to be between and million per year broken down to about to per hour per cut twentyfour hours a day seven days a week so far this yearand it was septemberninetysix percent of the residents of holly park over the age of seven had been victims perpetrators or eyewitnesses of a violent crime police response time to an emergency in holly park averaged twentyone minutes by contrast in the posh neighborhood of st francis wood it averaged three and a half minutes and police chief rigby was upset about how long it took some people believed that the solution to the drug and crime problems in the projects was to put a wall around them and let the residents kill each other off there are all kinds of walls louis baker was cold he opened his eyes awake now unsure of where he was it was dark in the room but a slice of gray light made its way through where the plywood sagged off the window the box spring he had slept on had a familiar smell he sat up pulling the old army blanket around his massive bare shoulders at least it not be the joint he thought praise god he stood up shivering in his bare feet and put on the suit pants they had given him when they let him out the day before he crossed to the crack at the window and looked down into one of the cuts pretty much the same gray building gray fog the constant wind no trees no grass nowhere to run nowhere to hide martha reeves and the vandellas now it was rap already coming up from three four places that was cool faces changed music changed even people sometimes but it was the same turf his old turf territory turf you controlled it you could be happy the constant he pulled the blanket up closer and put his eye to the crack checking down the cut kids standing around some business maybe going down his mama called out from down below you movin child you up she was not his mother but he called her mama he was not even sure they were related she had just always been around always been mama comin down he said mama dressed exactly the same there was no fashion here in holly park there were no politics nothing external was going to change things here louis knew that it was all inside as it had been for him mama was large she sat sipping instant coffee at her formica table her hair was held by pins and covered mostly with a bandanna she wore a plaid flannel shirt untucked over a pair of faded blue jeans that was tearing at the seams by her generous hips louis kissed her spooned some coffee crystals into a mug poured boiling water over it and sat down across from her its good to be home what you be doing now louis shrugged blowing on his cup get a job something got to work an be careful right he reached over and touched her face dont you worry mama nothin else i learned careful but he wondered then for a second if it was true when they let him out he had not given a thought to careful but seeing ingraham just when he got out had brought it all back back on the streets he best be careful every minute he saw ingraham againtaking care of business before he had even come down here to mamasand his blood ran hot the rage was still there beatin it was the hard thing he gripped at his mug with both hands bringing it to his mouth but that had been old business finished now he hoped he wouldnt have any cause to think about it again it was settled cause out there you know mama motioned to the back door louis followed her glance then scanned the kitchen over the stove the paint was peeling in wide sheets a poster of muhammad ali was taped up next to a religious calendarhe noted the suffering christ mama kept the place pretty clean but she was old what was the point of putting in a window over the sink the plywood wouldnt breakit kept out the wind it made the kitchen dark but dark was safer the whole house was dark i know bout out there mama heres what i do so you dont worry i go see the man he set me up or not come back here and start setting up set up what he stood up leaning over to kiss her the house mama we gonna clean house hardy in chains glitsky said i like it it is a good time hardy agreed he had stood up when glitsky entered the living room and now one of the patrolmen was unlocking the cuffs damn those things work good he opened and closed his fingers rubbing his wrists trying to get the circulation going if this affects my dart game im suing the city glitsky ignoring hardy asked patrolman thomas if he could stand outside and direct the homicidescene team below as it arrived when he went outside the other patrolman ling said the bodys in there glitsky nodded what are you doing here he asked hardy long story with a loaded gun makes it longer he shrugged its registered ive got a permit ling spoke up glitsky realized he was the shortest cop hed ever seen when he had come up thered been a minimum height requirement of but some court had ruled that since many asians were under this height the rule unfairly discriminated against a class of people and therefore had to go ling was about but since he had been the one left below to handle hardy if he got feisty glitsky assumed he could take care of himself can i see the gun he asked ling handed over hardys weapon he checked the cylinder and clucked disapprovingly its loaded he said to hardy it works better when its loaded glitsky flipped open the cylinder and let the bullets fall one by one into the palm of his hand he put them into the pocket of his blue parka and smelled the weapon it hasnt been fired no sir ling said i realize that come on abe hardy said i didnt shoot anybody my friend here has a rich fantasy life glitsky said he handed the gun back to ling you think this is dodge city or what you can pick it up back at the hall abe its a legal weapon and this is a murder scene diz it cant hurt to check the paper on it hardy turned to ling and what brought you guys out here the couple who live on the next boat over were going out for a jog and passed you walking around with a gun in your hand they saw you come in here and they went back to their boat and reported it the only two good citizens in san francisco and i run into them on their morning jog good citizens abound in our fair city glitsky said they are chinese ling said as if that explained it all right lets go see the body i hope youve had your breakfast hardy said from identification found in the purse by the bedside the woman was tentatively identified as maxine weir thirtythree years old her address was bush street from the trail of blood she had been shot the first time as she exited the bathroom after taking a shower that first shot went through the towel that had been wrapped around her there was a splatter of blood on the wall by the door to the bathroom as though she had either been spun around by the shot or had put her hand to the wound and then to the wall to steady herself it was impossible to determine the order of the remaining shots one had entered high on the right breast and did not appear to exit probably hitting the clavicle and ricocheting downward a second had passed through the side of her abdomen and out her back another had hit her in the right thigh she had clearly gone down by the bathroom and lay stillperhaps pretending to be deadfor a few minutes a pool had formed there then she had crawled across the room and into the hallway where she had died and where hardy had found her glitsky came away from the body with a glazed guarded look he had told ling to wait in the living room to send in the techs hardy sat on an upholstered chair in the corner elbows on knees his hands folded what about the bed he asked im getting there a second trail of blood began on the bed which was still made up someone had been lying on top of its covers when theyd been shot the trail crossed the room like a thin strip of syrup to the back door glitsky opened the door there was a walkway about four feet wide that must have been used mostly for storage paint cans cardboard boxes a bicycle other garage stuff filled the space on glitskys left hard by the piling the right side had been astroturfed a large potstyle barbecue squatted by the other back door which led to the galley paraphernalia for outdoor cooking hung on the wall by that door the blood drew a line in the middle of this area swerved over the astroturf paused and pooled at the railing disappearing over the side of the barge glitsky came back inside shivering even in his parka hardy was standing now by the bed the walking dead glitsky said look at this hardy knew enough not to touch anything he had been a good cop once there was a small hole in the center of a splotch of blood on the bed at about shoulder level if the victims head had been on the pillow rusty was first i guess hardy said he was sleeping maybe lying down she was in the shower heard the shot came out and got hers glitsky jammed his hands further into his pockets what the hell are you talking about rusty who you dont know no hardy let out a breath ingraham rusty ingraham he lives lived here louis baker shot him glitsky was looking somewhere over hardys shoulder not focusing putting it together louis baker and im next ill have a cheeseburger with everything to go the young man punched his register would you like onions and pickles glitsky nodded everything please will that be here or to go to go please thatll be one cheeseburger to go he pushed some more buttons waited until the machine stopped whirring then looked up with relief thats two sixtyseven hardy having just endured the same litany over a much more difficult order of two fish sandwiches fries and a diet coke rolled his eyes do you want that here or to go abe he asked when the boy went to retrieve the order glitsky kept his face straight they sat at a tiny yellow table on a stretch of sidewalk midway between the third street bridge and the southern pacific station every few minutes a trains whistle would sound shrill and distant it was early afternoon the fog had burned off completely and it was getting warm they had stayed at rusty ingrahams barge through the morning waiting while the techs photographed and collected and dusted while the deputy me had examined and moved maxine weirs body while they had begun preparations to drag the canal hardy opened his bag after all that i get onion rings did i say fries or what glitsky chomped into his burger twice i think maybe three times rocket scientist hardy said no dumber than walking around with a loaded weapon out in the open you shouldve called me first and you wouldve come right he had already told abe why he was at the barge about his telephone arrangement with rusty abe chewed some more probably not no probably about it glitsky reached over and grabbed hardys drink you mind he sipped through the straw louis baker huh hardy grabbed the cup back louis baker scares me abe no kidding yeah that makes sense i think id be nervous myself baker know where you live you moved since you were a da right so did rusty glitsky chewed and swallowed so howd he find him maybe hes listed hes a workinghe was a working attorney quit talking about him in the past tense would you hes dead abe you know it and i know it i dont know it maxine weir is dead otherwise were dragging the canal checking the blood type on the bed see if we can match it to rusty see if we can find him ill let you know when i think hes dead hes dead hardy said glitsky shrugged suit yourself so what am i gonna do i dont know about what about louis fucking baker is what dont get all excited diz we finish our lunch here and i locate louis and drive down and have a talk with him and what if hes sitting outside my house or even in it with a gun glitsky said straightfaced thatd be in violation of his parole the inspector finished his burger took hardys cup back and had a last loud slurp of hardys drink through the straw just dont you do anything diz we frown on private citizens shooting one another yeah well i frown on being shot at i see him around my house im going to shoot first glitsky leaned across the table do me a favor let him get a shot off make sure hes armed the rules huh glitsky nodded the rules thats right he stood up i dont think louis told maxine about the rules hardy said or rusty either glitsky picked up hardys cup and dumped some ice in his mouth he chewed a minute guess he forgot he said other things on his mind when can i get my gun back hardy said chapter four you have to remember sergeant that everyone we deal with is a convicted felon not some not mostall the supervisor was a plain woman with a nononsense attitude that somehow managed to convey warmth perhaps it was the oliver peoples glassestiny little lenses magnifying robinsegg eyes the name on the little strip by her door said ms hammond and glitsky liked her right away she had the backcorner office in the ferry building with a view over the water to treasure island up to the bay bridge out to alcatraz people paid three grand a month for oneroom apartments with that view it might be one of the perks of the jobhe knew she didnt make that much her office was clean and functional brightened by the view and a small forest scattered in pots twentyone parole officers reported to her well what i meant was no its all right its just helpful to remember where these people are coming from what they face outside well its possible our manlouis bakerwas outside about an hour before he killed somebody ms hammond sighed heavily nodding yes that happens too im afraid she scooted her chair across the floor from her pitted green desk to a battered green file cabinet after a minute looking at something she sighed again you want to see al nolan is that bad news she looked at her watch its twothirty if he took a normal lunch at noon he might be back glitsky wondered if the entire bureaucracy was sinking every department bogged down in bad faith and bullshit but ms hammond faced him shrugging shrugs and sighs she probably didnt know she did it some of them need more supervising than others let me show you the way she led him down a long corridor that reminded him of the hall into a large room that was subdivided into cubicles al nolan a white male in his late twenties was opening a wendys bag and putting the contents on his desk he wore a bowling shirt with the name ralph stitched over the right pocket his long brown hair didnt look too clean and was pulled back into a ponytail al ms hammond said this is inspector sergeant abe glitsky nolan held up a hand hey its my lunch hour you mind glitsky heard ms hammonds intake of breath lunch is supposed to start from twelve to onethirty somewhere in there al well at noon i had to take my car down to the garage and the guy didnt have a clue what was wrong so i had to leave it and take the bus back you know the buses he too shrugged you know al that sounds to me like two and a half hours of your own time yeah but i didnt get to eat yet glitsky butted in they paying you for this turning to ms hammond excuse me hey what im not supposed to eat were entitled to lunch ms hammond getting impatient said and what do you suppose the state of california gets to ask of you in exchange nolan chewed a few fries in exchange for what in exchange for your lunch break hey i do as much work as anybody here more than some glitsky just waited ms hammond smiled the warmth was gone you know al thats just not true she laid a hand on glitskys arm mr nolan is on the states time now sergeant if his eating bothers you hell throw hisshe pausedafternoon snack away she turned and was gone nolan rolled his eyes her time of the month he said and gestured for glitsky to pull up a chair who we talking about now glitsky was tempted to get into it this attitude was making him crazy he wondered if ms hammonds sweet grandmother nature wasnt really to blame and everyone on the top ought to start right now being a hardass of the first order whip things back into shape kick ass and take names fire people like al nolan then he remembered nobody ever got fired from a government job kill your neighbors come to work drunk miss thirty days in a row calling in sick hey it robbed a person of dignity to take their job away glitsky found himself sighing louis baker he said were talking about louis baker yeah i just saw him this morning seemed okay a pretty nice guy well we think maybe he killed somebody last night nolan took a bite of burger no shit well these guys can be very cool about things about killing people you mean whatever you know they dont talk to us they just check in lie about having a job or an offer then split did louis baker say he had a job now you mention it no he seemed to ponder that a moment well hes only been out a day hasnt learned the ropes yet glitsky leaned forward so what did you talk about mostly the giants i guess glitsky could have guessed too the giants were in the thick of the pennant race i think theyll stay in the city who who we talking about man the giants i mean a pennant is what we need no way are they gonna let em go to san jose if we get another pennant the team is happening whod baker kill we dont know if he killed anybody hes a suspect is all he probably did why do you say that you just said he was a nice guy nolan shrugged glitsky wondered if people here all had shoulder and back problems from the shrugging so hes a nice guy that just means hes got manners i mean everybody says ted bundy was the nicest guy youd ever want to meet and how many people did he ace twenty thirty so you figure baker killed somebody why did he say anything to you about last night these guys kill each other the victim wasnt black mr nolan no shit i just assumed caucasian woman well maybe he was just unloading after all that time in nolan looked at glitsky mantoman you know he pointed at his crotch no conjugal visits at the q lot of guys get out and thats the first thing they do glitsky suddenly very weary shook his head no it wasnt that nolan thoughtful chewing well they kill white guys too it was still early afternoon balmy with a light breeze glitsky had the windows down on both sides of the plymouth driving down mission he had intended to get on the freeway and head south to holly park and see if he could get a few words with louis baker but al nolan had gotten inside of himyoung hip ponytailed al nolan with his ralph fiftiesstyle bowling shirt probably seriously thought he did a real job and real clever to boot above it all with that glib shit that all these cons were just passing time before they went back jive about the giants for a minute glitsky thought about bringing al to the hall and booking him for obstructing a homicide investigation see how funny he thought that was he drummed his fingers on the dash then there was marcel lanier and the other cops in homicide with their damn golf clubs what was the use he tried to get his mind kickstarted back on louis baker about why was he going down now to see louis baker sure hardy had his reasons but for him wasnt it the same reason al nolan had for assuming baker was guiltybecause he was a black excon there wasnt any hard evidence making him a suspect there was hardys suspicion and hardys fear but hardy all white points the finger at baker all black and abe glitskyhalf and halfjumps on the white wagon with both feet well shit why is that abe look at the facts okay so hardy is your friend and an excop excops also kill people and hardy was apprehendedlets not forget that apprehendedthere at the scene with a loaded weapon sure he had his stated reasons but why didnt glitsky suspect him well he knew hardy also hardys gun hadnt been fired still he pulled over and glanced at the yellow pad full of notes next to him on the seat start at the beginning abe like youve done a hundred times before look at the victim there arent two victims not yet in spite of what hardy might think or say there is one known victim her name is maxine weir and she lived at bush street louis baker and holly park could wait lets see who the facts point to he put the car back in gear passed the freeway entrance and turned up van ness toward bush street hardy didnt even feel safe at the hall of justice hed been there since before noon trying to get his gun back he had called moses mcguire at home and asked him to trade shifts at the shamrock he had looked in at judge andy fowlersjanes fatherscourtroom but they had been in recess and the judge was not in his chambers they were being pissy about the gun glitsky was not above giving his friend a little object lesson in the letter of the law and he had taken the weapon downtown so that hardy could sign for its proper return so the registration could be validated thank you abe but the gun had not even been logged in yet and no one seemed in a hurry to get it done so hardy could retrieve it finally realizing he probably wasnt going to have much luck he took the elevator upstairs to the third floor where the assistant das had their offices he found himself breathing more easily as he walked the long halls hoping to recognize someone and give himself an excuse to stay inside and off the street up here almost everyone wore a coat and tie or a uniform and most were white hardy did not suppose louis baker would get up in costume to blow him away downstairs every black man hardy saw had been turning before his eyes into louis baker walking around free as a breeze carrying a bullet with hardys name on it if he felt that way in the hall of justice where they had metal detectors at all entrances hardy did not want to think about what he would feel like outside there were about one hundred assistant district attorneys in san francisco almost all of themexcept a few political appointees who worked for the man himself district attorney christopher lockeplied their trade two to a room in tenbytwelve offices equipped with two desks and whatever files bookcases posters plants mementos and bits of evidence might have accumulated in the course of two busy people working on too many cases with not enough time there were no names on doors no indication of rank or personality most of the doors into the hallway were closed and a significant number of rooms with open doors were empty hardy did not remember if it had been like that when he had worked here probably since nothing else seemed to have changed very much he passed the casefile library and leaned across the counter looking in at the banks of colortagged folders what you want hardy it was still touvaa tiny round woman with brillo hair who had already been an institution when hardy started out she forgot nothing and filed with a fanatical precision if nothing else went right in a case you could at least always get your files when you needed them she looked at hardy impatiently by all signs unaware that he had not worked there in almost a decade how you been touva i been busy of course you got a case number hardy i got no time to chat no case okay then later dismissed he kept walking a couple of faces looked familiar to him but he was surprised that he saw no one he actually knew to talk to had it been that long he felt like hed gone back to his old high school finally he stopped near a doorway where a studious young man was sitting in a chair studying blowups of photographs that hardy did not want to look at too carefully he had seen enough of that stuff firsthand this morning he had already decided who he had to talk to im trying to find art drysdales office he said the kid tore himself away probably a good idea anyway he said pardon oh sorry talking to myself probably a good idea to get away from this for a minute drysdale you said they walked back past the file library drysdales office was two doors beyond it on the other side of the hall as hardy knocked the kid into his work was already halfway back to his room its open drysdale was turned away from the door his feet propped up on the windowsill talking on the telephone there was no one at the other desk hardy moved some folders from a chair to the floor and sat to wait no he was saying no we dont know that he listened hardy noticed his knuckles white on the receiver you want my opinion its not even likely i think its a big mistake he said uh huh and right a few times loosening his collar with one hand the knuckles on the other one staying white all right its your decision a beat then loudly course ill do it its what we do isnt it but it sucks chris sir it really sucks he slammed the phone down son of a bitch he swiveled in his chair yeah he began then recognizing hardy hey he stood up extended a hand heres a sight for sore eyes what brings you downtown pushing sixty drysdale still looked like he could put on a uniform and be right at home on the ballfield before turning to law he had been a star for usc and then played three years of pro ball including fortytwo games as a utility infielder in for the san francisco giants a framed newspaper article on the wall of his office was headlined drysdale no relation to dodger don which was an important point to make in a town that hated the bums don drysdale the dodger pitcher had a last name in common with art but no genes art had been with the das office for over thirty years at one time or another hed been in charge of misdemeanors vice white collar and homicide and now served as a kind of minister without portfolio unofficially doing much of the work that the citizens elected christopher locke to do drysdale himself wasnt the district attorney because his pragmatic view of life was out of sync with the political structure in san francisco he did not favor affirmative action in the district attorneys office and he had once been foolish enough to make the point to a group of reporters and editors who had been doing profiles on potential candidates for public office if you were elected da but im not running for da or anything else the early denial being part of every campaign that didnt slow anybody down if you were the da what percentage of new hires would besubstitute onegay black hispanic female drysdales answer now famous in the lore of the city was if they could do the job id hire chimpanzees if they cant theyre worthless to me of course the media played this to mean that drysdale thought women gays and other minorities of all stripes were worthless he had followed his aphorism with the more balanced statement that some jobsairline pilot brain surgeon prosecuting attorneyought to be filled by qualified candidates not by quota but san francisco reporters know news when they hear it and calling chimpanzees smarter than minorities was good copy even if that wasnt what he said much less meant now it was old news either way art drysdale didnt worry about it he coached his innercity baseball team that had finished second the previous year in the citys police athletic league playoffs went home to his wife who had her own design firm and otherwise counseled the young female gay black hispanic caucasian or he sometimes felt simian attorneys who werent succeeding in putting bad people behind bars which was their job he was the most popular man in the office so to what do we owe this surprise diz i think the big surprise is hearing you yell at someone drysdale waved it off aw thats just locke sometimes the old seniority isnt the blessing its cracked up to be whats he doing somebodys got to investigate a couple of cops thats ugly yeah plus its nothing wed ever charge on our own but were showing our continued sensitivity to the plight of harassed gays by the fascist police force subtle stuff like that whyd you draw it drysdale grinned cause its such a lemon locke gives it to a rookie here and bingo end of career or at least end of cooperation for a year or two with the department me im immune i guess seniority ive offended everybody at least once anyway cant do any more harm who are the guys clarence raines and mario valenti homicide you know em no but homicide guys i know drysdale picked up an autographed baseball and tossed it back and forth plus theres my wellknown discretion he flipped the ball across to hardy but you sir coming back to the trade hardy laughed said no and ran down his last twentyfour hours drysdale was thoughtful for a moment ingraham left here after you right he shut his eyes remembering something went wrong what was that gimme the ball hardy tossed it back to him it flashed from hand to hand faster than hardy could follow it drysdale closed his eyes again a juggler in a trance finally he stopped nope its not there hardy lifted his shoulders well hes dead anyway i guess it cant matter too much anymore i know a guy though hates his guts you might want to talk to him tony feeney he shouldve died a long time ago feeney was hardys vintage but a different grape dark hair pressed threepiece suit trim body shined shoes no hint of mellowing out well he did die this morning feeney seemed to gather something inside himself then he astounded hardy by giving himself a thumbs up and saying fuckin a like hed just won a big one then realizing what he had done he came back to hardy if he was your friend im sorry but hardy stopped him before yesterday i hadnt seen him in half a dozen years howd it go down looks like somebody shot him i hope he walks whoever did it well whoever did it shot his girlfriend too you know who it was yeah they think so i think so feeney opened his desk drawer and popped a life saver he offered one to hardy fuckin ingraham always gotta be a woman around girl shouldve known better hardy didnt know what that meant but hed come back to it whatd he do to you feeney had an unlined angular face with a small mole on the same spot of each cheek hardy thought he could be a modelnot so much handsome but a definite look there was a cop named hector medina he began used to be in homicide now he runs security over at the sir francis drake feeney went on to explain that about seven years before over a casual dinner with some da friends rusty ingraham had told the gang that everybody knew hector medina had killed raul guerrero instead of arresting him guerrero had been a lowlife whod been hassling women for years in the lower mission and had come under suspicion for rape and murder when hector had gone out to question him the official story was that guerrero pulled a gun and medina had to shoot him as with any incident of this type there had been an investigation and medina had been cleared now though at this dinner ingraham had gotten into it he was showing off for the woman he was seeing impressing her feeney guessed with his inside knowledge and hed said everybody knew that medina had planted a gun on guerrero and simply blown him away okay people are allowed to bullshit each other but then the story got to the da and ingraham got called in and he didnt retract it it was the truth he said everybody knew it and so theyd started another formal investigation on hector medina and feeney had drawn the assignment you know what its like coming down on a cop hardy nodded drysdale was just talking about it he pulled valenti and raines didnt he poor bastard i hope he doesnt need any investigating done for the next two or three years they lock you out huh what do you think hardy the excop knew nobody closed ranks tighter than policemen so ingraham testified or what feeney shook his head no it never came to that there just wasnt any evidence i couldnt get it to trial but you know how these things are medina was suspended for the second time during my investigation the word got around soon enough everybody believed hed purposely killed guerrero who of course was a scum they reinstated medina gave him his back pay but he only lasted about three months before he quit nobody feels too good about a killer cop even if but he wasnt well there was no evidence but sometimes two accusations are enough to put a man down so what about rusty the only thing ingraham did was screw up my career for the next few years i mean whatever medina was or wasnt i was the guy digging up dirt on this inspector sergeant of homicide so testifying cops get sick on the day i go to trial evidence isnt tagged right or gets lost reports get filed in the wrong folders witnesses dont live where theyre supposed to theyre a real creative bunch homicide cops when they put their minds to it and i had ingraham to thank for it hardy sat back his ankle on his knee and looked at the city behind feeneys back all this was interesting but didnt seem to have much to do with louis baker or rusty being dead so that was it he asked feeney laced his fingers behind his head arching his back hardy heard a few pops no the good part is that old rusty lost his credibility with locke the assignments just dried up he only lasted maybe four months longer than medina he got fired what he got was the message he sought as we say other meaningful work so you havent seen him in feeney straightened up in his chair many years he said and when did you say he was killed last night he nodded good for the record i was playing poker with four other guys from this office all last night i can give you their names if you want it was like a thing man if you ran with dido you did something with your shoes lace was checking it out it was like a sign in the cut that you were part of it lace looked down at his feet at the hightop adidas the shoelaces curling like skinny snakes around his feet he pushed off the building hands in his pockets and looked out through the cut dido doing some business couple of honkies waiting in the shiny black car one guy out talking with his man dido looked bad dido always looked bad but today hot and still you could see him he wore the adidas like always yeah but thats why he had his name with the black tank shirt you could see the powerthe dark skin looking oiled shining in the sun arms like laces legs couple of years ago when lace still a boy he and jumpup used to ride around one each on didos shoulders the only man around bigger than dido was just got back from the big house he was out doing something now with his shack it was in didos cut so it was laces business he kicked his way slowly down the cut his long shoelaces trailing in the dust behind him with a nod of his head he drew in jumpup a year younger than himself but bigger at thirteen jumpup could nearly jam a basketball already lace didnt know if the man planned to be on the street if he had a name dido told themthe mama told him the dude was louis baker but that wouldnt be their name for him if he was going to be here like lace was luther f washington but he was lace jumpup same thing been called jumpup since he could walk lace didnt know his other name those names didnt matter the man was working without a shirt setting out a few cans of white spray paint he wore some baggy pants with a thin black belt and hard shoes without socks there was a long scar from the top of his shoulder swinging across his back and under his arm it was old blacker and shinier than the rest of him his chest reminded lace of a horsemaybe three times as broad as his own covered with curly black hairs that here and there glistened with drops of sweat jumpup said too buffed impressed his arms just moving easy you could see the cords rippling under the skin the man was humming they stood across the cut in the shade of the building opposite him watching as he shook one of the cans and began spraying white paint over the graffiti that covered the side of the mamas place lace checked far down to his right dido still doing that business he nudged jumpup on the arm and together they moved out into the sun and across the cut the man was covering a lot of laces work dido favored a dark blue in his cut course there were older colors too from beforewords symbols dicks some magic stuff red and green mostly before the blue the man was being careful starting at the corner he was already halfway down the side of the building not doing the whole thing just spraying white over the marks so there was new white and old white but no colors no sign it was didos cut it got lace a little worried but there might be nothing in it the man had done his hard timehe got laces respect lace and jumpup were close enough now he turned to face them and nodded how you boys lace felt jumpup go back a step but the man went back to spraying maybe he didnt know you stayin here lace asked the man stopped long enough to nod again thats right spray spray spray nothin to think about you back in from the big house he stopped again straightened up way up you readin my mail he asked you aint be covering didos name jumpup getting right to it the blue lace explained the man stepped back halfway across the cut looked at his work this be my home now with mama i like a nice white place he showed some teeth and stepped back up to the wall lace had to say something jumpup and me we do the color in the cut here he lowered the spray can no i dont spose gotta be just so we been doin it jumpup sounding tougher but lace noticed still standing behind him the man shook his head i only got so much paint takes some skill with the can he stepped to the wall and sprayed covering over a red circle like that he said no waste you learn that at the house the lord dont like it much neither waste i can do that lace said the man squatted down now even with them if you could it would be some help i got some glass i want to put in but i dont know lace and me can do it jumpup said we paint the cut lace repeated the man handed them each a can all right slow though let me see you do a little louis baker positioned them about five feet apart and they started spraying over the graffiti while he took the plywood off the side window whats happening here the boys startled stopped spraying and turned around louis baker about to put the glass into the window where the plywood had been lowered the plate to the ground dido had his arms folded in front of him thats a white wall he said these homeboys helping you out louis baker nodded thats right cleaning up the new house dido stood dead still squinting into the sun without his saying a word lace and jumpup put their cans down and began sauntering back down the cut the two big men one twentyone one midthirties stood about two yards apart louis baker straightened up folded his arms across his bare chest the way didos were lace and jumpup were off a ways looking on a car honked out in the street dido took a last look at the wall shrugged and began trotting back down the cut business was business louis baker humming again opened a can of putty chapter five johnny laguardia couldnt understand why people didnt seem to get it the concept was so simple and these hockey pucksnow it looked like two in the last two dayseither kept getting it wrong or just blew it off altogether heres the dealyou got a situation where you need some money gambling women speculation in municipal bonds it didnt matter to angelo the angel tortoni the banks for one reason or another would not help you out maybe they didnt see the wisdom of your borrowing money to go put it on the nose of betsys delight in the fourth at bay meadows maybe you had defaulted on past loans maybe your collateral was already hocked whatever mr tortonithe angelhed help you out johnny laguardia had seen grown men go down on their knees with tears in their eyes thanking the angel for money that appeared when there wasnt any cash to be found anywhere he knew for a fact that the angels money had paid for college tuitions covered a guys lost weekend helped out some married lady who didnt want a fourth baby this man the angeltook care of his people and most of those mr tortoni helped showed him respect they paid the vig the vigorisha reasonable ten points a weekuntil they could repay the principal then most of them came in not just with the money but often with a gift to show their gratitude that mr tortoni had believed in them when no one else would had fronted them some of his own hardearned money to help them out in their difficult time and most of them understood that the reason mr tortoni could do this important community work was because he remained a good businessman he didnt lose out on his loans the vigorish kept him liquid that was most of em the other ones were why johnny laguardia had a job he stood at the entrance to the lobby at the ghirardelli towers and looked back over his shoulder at the deep purple sky over the golden gate bridge a high cloudcover glowed deep orange the kind of clouds he used to think when he was a boy had been raked by the angels someone was playing congas pretty well on the steps by the maritime museum and the lights above ghirardelli square had just been turned on it was still warm from the day with a light breeze off the baythe smell of crabs cooking down at the wharf this was johnnys favorite time of year of day and of his life so far he was meeting doreen for dinner at little joes in an hour hed have the cacciuco and a bottle of lambrusco and then theyd go back to her place he should feel great but last night was rusty ingraham and now he had a bad feeling about bram smyth who was supposed to have met him at the bar at senor picos at nearly three hours ago he ought to have a talk with mr tortoni he thought about these guys who do the ponies well maybe he wouldnt now he thought about it mr tortoni didnt need two cents from johnny laguardia about how he ran his business but the fact was these guys were unreliable he pushed open the lobby door and crossed the marble to the bank of mailboxes with buttons under them bram and sally smyth lived in number he pushed the button waited ten seconds pushed it again he looked at his watch knowing that his impatience might make him hurry things he counted off thirty seconds okay onetwelve the third button he pushed answered he had a delivery for mrhe looked at the mailbox of one of the other two that hadnt answeredortega in could he leave it with her he stood at the inner door until it buzzed then he quickly pushed it open and was inside taking the stairs up to the third floor he couldnt get over what a joke these security buildings were the thirdfloor hallway was wide carpeted quiet the smyths door was immediately to johnnys right as he came out of the stairwell he put his ear to the door and listened for a moment somebody was in there talking he knocked the talking stopped he could imagine smyth holding a finger up to his lips come on come on dont make it so hard on everybody johnny laguardia had several weapons that he used for various jobs but the silenced uzi was probably his favorite like the secret service guys he carried it in a swivelup holster under his arm the thing was really small for so much firepower easily concealed under a sports jacket he moved the jacket out of the way and swung the uzi up there was some more movement inside the apartment he could just wait he knew that after about five minutes smyth would creep to the door and listen thenwith the chain onhed open the door a crack but johnny had a date with doreen and it was getting late hed given smyth every opportunity to be civil he crossed to the far side of the hallway and aimed at the deadbolt this part was funthe way the gun made a little zipping sound and the door exploded inward as far as the chain he took a few steps shoulder down across the hallway and hit the door with his shoulder the chain gave way like so much tinsel bram smyth and he guessed sally were halfway out of their dinner seats staring at the doorway at him he realized he still had the gun in his hand bram goddammit he said he started unscrewing the silencer smyth looked like what he wasa yuppie stockbroker he still had his tie on his tasseled moccasins did we have an appointment or what bram looked at the woman put on a sick smile hey was that today i thought it was tomorrow im sorry i got the johnny shook his head you didnt hear the doorbell i come up here and knock bram motioned ambiguously johnny were having a romantic dinner here were anotfier smile at his wife everything was under control he was telling her the fucking wimp except somebody just shot my door off sometimes you dont let yourself get interrupted he held his hands up bad timing i guess right johnny glanced at the woman who had sat back down and was sipping white wine with her legs crossed she was doing okay trying to go with it but her hands were shaking elaborately johnny put the gun back in his holster he nodded at sally smiled at bram excuse us would you bram you mind we talk a second in the hallway they were on the rug the shattered door pulled behind them ill have it tomorrow smyth said i thought it was tomorrow johnny swear to god eight hundred tomorrow smyths eyes widened johnny its four johnny shook his head how long you been paying on thursdays now four months five youre into next weeks vig the guy was going to pee on his nice suit in about two minutes look the stock business johnny its up and down i mean one week im golden and the next im flat you know johnny held up a hand you needed money mr tortoni out of the goodness of his heart helped you out and the deal was you pay him back any time you want but until you do you go the vig capisce smyth hung his head yeah tell him im sorry tomorrow okay okay johnny stuck out his hand your doors broken he said you might want to call the maintenance people smyth looked at johnnys extended hand johnny smiled what im gonna break your arm smyth let out a breath and smiled taking johnnys hand johnny gripped tight and brought his left hand down across the arm at the elbow hearing the crack as bram smyth crumpled to the ground he looked up at johnny holding his broken wing tears streaming down his face eight hundred johnny said tomorrow glitsky kept telling himself that he wasnt doing this for the money still the fact that he wasnt going to get any overtime made a difference ray weir the murdered womans husband hadnt been home in the afternoon many working men werent so abe killed the rest of the day at the youth guidance center interviewing a potential witness to another killing the boy a seventeenyearold puerto rican kid improbably named guadalupe watson was not a big talker a friend of guadalupe had put him at the curb in front of rita salcedos house when her husband jose chased her outside and shot her in the back as she ran from him but if guadalupe had been there he didnt remember it the lack of cooperation didnt exactly roll off glitskys back in spite of the fact that it happened all the time some people didnt want to talk to copsever about anything it could only come back and get you so abe had talked and talked and waited and listened to a seemingly endless succession of yes and no guadalupe answering only what was asked volunteering nothing and in all probability lying when he did manage to mumble out a syllable then it was five oclock or close enough to it so hed gone home had dinner with flo and the kids and now was walking up the steps leading to ray weirs house thinking about overtime more or less or none the front door opened on a small lobby to abes left a stairway led to the upper flat of the duplex on the wall by the stairs was a logo of an oldfashioned tripod motionpicture camera with the name weir inside he climbed the stairs and stood at the small landing for a moment waiting again listening again sometimes you heard things this wasnt one of those times he pushed the button by the door didnt hear a bell ring then knocked the door opened on a man who looked like nobody or anybody as glitsky introduced himself and produced his identification he tried to get a physical handle on him ray weir was the guy you opened your checking account with at the bank the midlevel manager in a cheap gray suit who rode in the elevator with you your buddys cousin from say nebraska he had light brown hair regular features neither skinny nor fat short nor tall a quiet niceguy loner type who one day might find himself walking into a tower carrying an automatic weapon is this an official call he asked glitsky wasnt sure what that meant well im officially investigating your wifes murder if thats what you mean you might as well come in he said glitsky checking in after dinner had found out that they had located ray from some information that had been in maxine weirs wallet a couple of blues had caught up with him at work and informed him of maxines death now he seemed resigned lost and immediately asked glitsky if he was a suspect why glitsky crossing the living room thought he might as well go for it did you kill her he sat on a floral couch motioned abe to an easy chair no but i mean you know with being separated did you want to kill her he looked someplace over glitskys shoulder focusing on something so intently that abe turned around the wall behind him was nearly covered with eightbyten glossies of a beautiful woman glitsky stood up and walked over for a better look some of the pictures had the name maxine weir on them and abe tried to reconcile this stunning face with the woman he had found in a neck brace on ingrahams barge that morning he could not do it ray had come up behind him i wanted her to come back i didnt want her dead how about her boyfriend him i wanted dead but you didnt kill him rays eyes went back to the pictures seven years he shook his head you know what its like to be with someone that beautiful when shes in love with you its like nothing else you walk in a room and youre the proudest man there it doesnt really make too much difference what else is going on in your life i mean my scripts so nobody wants them at least ive got maxine im worth something you know glitsky didnt much buy the line his wife flo was a finelooking woman but he sure didnt define himself by what other people thought of her he also noticed that ray didnt deny killing rusty ingraham on the other hand rusty wasnt officially dead yet so he said were you separated a long time five months eleven days today glitsky kept coming back to the pictures there were several nudes tasteful also erotic she hadnt looked the same this morning with bullet holes in her how did she get with ingraham he tried to laugh but it didnt come out right that was pathetic you had to know her im trying to glitsky said they were back sitting down ray was smoking an unfiltered camel glitsky saw another cigarette butt with lipstick on it in the ashtray pathetic how he asked it was the way maxine was there always had to be a dream i guess it comes with being an actress maybe we writers have it too i think its what kept us together so long that shared dream what was the dream oh the usual i guess fame and fortune she becomes a star and i write the great american screenplay he drew on his cigarette and blew out a long stream of smoke he leaned back on the couch then she had the accident and met ingraham and the dream just changed to what all of a sudden it was just the money for some reason ingraham made her feel like she was too old to be a star at thirtythree look at her shes not too old glitsky didnt have to turn around to remember what she looked like but ingraham told her she was ray shook his head not so much told her as made her see that the dreamour dreamjust didnt work it wasnt realistic like a dream has to be realistic jesus so what happened she finally saw she had a chance to make some money right away without the rejection without having to keep herself ready for the break how was that ray looked at glitsky for a moment in surprise as though he didnt understand why this wasnt common knowledge already well the insurance what insurance she got badly rearended and sprained her neck something awful ingraham was literally hanging around the emergency room when she came in what a sleaze the guy is is not was glitsky made a mental note anyway ingraham told her he could get a settlement for like a hundred grand maybe more and she bought that then she started thinking if she got that much money shed just invest it and retire for a couple of years and then i became no fun because i didnt want to do that id still want to write even if i was already rich he stubbed out his cigarette but it wasnt her dream anymore i guess ingraham played makebelieve with her better than me he stared down at the floor well motive is pretty solid abe thought what do you do during the day ray ray looked up the question taking him off guard im a courier downtown bicycle demon you mind telling me where you were last night the eyes looked down and up i was here all night by yourself again a pause im afraid so does that make me a suspect glitsky gave him his best mantoman you were a suspect before i got here im trying to eliminate you because i dont have the feeling you killed somebody you loved that much do you own a gun ray no i mean yes well i did glitsky waited after the accident maxine got he stopped it was after she moved out actually living alone she wanted the protection she said she got really paranoid in fact and finally asked if she could take it and i said yes so she had it he nodded and what kind was it maybe well find it in her apartment it was just a popgun really a twentytwo glitsky knew the kind of wound created by that type of gun hed seen several of them that morning you know ray he said then he stopped himself hed been about to tell him he was starting to look like a pretty good suspect in fact if there was any physical evidence tying him to ingrahams barge last night glitsky would bring him in right now ray waited when was the last time you saw maxine he thought about it three weeks ago maybe she needed some money for rent and came by here she said you know when the insurance came in wed both have a ton anyway you were going to split that he lit another cigarette well it was community property even if we got divorced one of those weird times when california law helps the husband and you helped her out ray looked down at the floor again she softened me up first hows that ray weir lifted his shoulders an embarrassed kid you made love three weeks ago ray was nervous now i know it doesnt look very good but we are were still married and she came up looking so beautiful radiant really glitsky had to ask with a neck brace she looked radiant he shook his head she didnt have the brace she stopped needing that a couple of months ago but glitsky said remembering that maxine had had the brace on when found dead never mind go on well theres nothing more we made love i gave her the money she left he stubbed out the newly lit cigarette i thought anyway thats the last time i saw her glitsky let the silence build for a minute before he stood up ray he said if i were you id get myself a good lawyer but i was here all last night i didnt leave the flat thats what you said you dont believe me id believe you better if youd made some phone calls or ordered out for pizza or something ray started to say something but stopped himself again well i guess thats about it then glitsky stood by the door for an extra beat while weir held it open for him thats about it he said normally hardy worked from around to pm and moses mcguire picked up at until am so for an hour and a half almost every day they shared duties behind the rail who ordered that moses was a purist hardy was squeezing a lime wedge over a manhattan moses whispered whoever ordered that cut him off hardy looked down at the drink seeing it for the first time he swore and dumped it into the sink he tapped the side of his head grabbed a fresh glass and the sweet vermouth and started another one good catch he said cherry moses said is the proper garnish for a manhattan you need your mr boston referring to the bartenders guidebook hardy finished making the drink put it in front of the customer and came back down to the front of the bar where moses was now sitting on his stool talking to his sister frannie hes like a thermos hardy said frannie sipped at her club soda hardy thought she looked fantastichighlights in her red hair green eyes almost laughing again a thermos you know how a thermos keeps hot things hot and cold things cold yeah wellhardy pausedhow does it know frannie smiled impossibly attractivesexy impossible because this was moses little sister about five months pregnant impossible because hardy had known her since she was in high school impossible she had come so far hardy had not seen her since a couple of weeks after eddie died eddie her husband hardys eyes left her went to moses who leaned back on his stool a guy puts a lime in a manhattan i feel it down to my toes hey im a little distracted all right maybe its the gun moses did not like having a loaded weapon in the bar but hardy had come straight from downtown and was not about to leave it outside in his topless samurai what gun frannie said nothing hardy said but moses explained a little this morning frannie asked suddenly worry all over her its no big deal hardy said some guys trying to kill you and its no big deal he puts a lime in a manhattan yes okay its entered my mind all right his eyes went from moses to frannie anyway its not definite anybodys trying to kill me but youre walking around with a gun hardy leaned over the bar he smelled jasmine frannie i took the gun with me this morning i havent gotten around to getting home yet end of story but youre not going home he straightened up ive considered it living there and all like i do but what if this man tries to get you what if he goes to your house tell the truth im more worried about me having to or being tempted to kill him if i see him which my friend abe tells me would be a problem well i dont think you should go home i think its too dangerous hardy patted frannies hand on the bar okay he said closing the subject moses had gotten up and was pulling a bass ale at the spigot how about you think about tending some bar im talking to your sister and she is my date tonight im off work and i am pouring beer something is wrong here surprisingly frannie covered hardys hand and squeezed it i mean it she said a look passed between them hardy had been telling himself he wasnt all that worried naturally hed been a little concerned but the earlier adrenaline fear hed felt in rustys bloodsoaked bedroom had passed now frannie hearing about it fresh she was passing some of it back to him and it was a fact that he had garnished the manhattan with lime he tried to tell himself that it was just the way women were especially frannie whod so recently lost her husband nervous but suddenly he wasnt sure that was all it was two margaritas no salt moses called over and hardy started pouring into the blender moses sidled up next to him no sugar either he said hardy couldnt get the till to balance and he had continued to pour some pretty shabby drinks gin and coke rum and ginger ale thinking about it made him shudder hed started three black and tans backward forgetting that while guinness floats on bass ale the opposite wasnt true it was just after midnight and he had closed down the bar early no sense continuing the charade longer than he had to the clientele would get over it after all this was the little shamrock established in it wasnt going to go out of business over closing early one time moses might bitch a little but hardy would explain it later he found he just couldnt pay attention thinking that someone was going to come in and shoot him just as he was reaching up to the top shelf or wiping down a section of the bar with his rag or ringing up a drink tab after talking to tony feeney hardy had at last been able to get his gun back and now it was stuck in his belt behind him as he counted the money for the sixth time it was no use he had in cash and the register showed hed rung up it wasnt going to balance he went to his tip jar and made up the difference then crossed to the dart boards with a last guinness trying to decide what he was going to do he had talked to glitsky and found out that he hadnt gone down to talk to louis baker that the excon was still on the streets glitsky had started to explain something about other suspects but hardy working the bar was busy and didnt have time for police procedural bullshit suspects be damned louis baker had threatened hardys life and was free as a bird thanks for all your help abe what hardy was not going to do now he was sure was go home rusty ingraham had gone home he kept all his dart paraphernalia in a wellworn leather holder that he carried with him at all times most often in the inside pocket of whatever jacket he happened to be wearing now he took it out and began fitting the pale blue plastic flights into the twentygram tungsten darts there was one tiffany lamp on over the bar and two in the dart area hardy had dimmed them down as low as they would go he looked up at the clock on the mantel across from the bar which hadnt ticked since the great earthquake in and didnt look like it was about to start now standing up preparing to throw a round of darts he first went back and checked for the third time that the front door was locked since he was up anyway he went into the bathrooms both of which had barred back windows but you couldnt be too sure the place seemed secure he stepped up to the dart line and flung his first dart it missed the whole board hardy stared at the dart stuck in the wall next to the board as though it were a vision there was no way he could miss the whole board that was like nicklaus whiffing a tee shot even warming up you didnt miss the board well at least no one else was around to see it he went and retrieved the dart then took the out from under his belt and put it on the table next to his guinness it wasnt only going home he realized he shouldnt even be here at work baker could ask anyone and find out where hardy spent his days and dismas wasnt going to tend bar with his loaded police special on his hip or even on a shelf under the bar he started throwing again more naturally now not really aiming the round all fell within the his first thought was to go to janes but not only didnt he have a key to her place it was where he used to live when he was a da moses everybody here knew moses was his good buddy knew where moses lived abe screw abe pico and angela morales they had kids and little if any extra space he thought about a hotel but since san franciscos main industry had become tourism you couldnt get a room here anymore for under a night and hardy doing okay still did not have that kind of money and who knew how long it would be well it couldnt be too long if glitsky didnt do something then hardy would flush baker make him commit then what blow him away he shied from the thought but there was something there he finished his guinness and pulled the darts from his last round out of the board he picked up his gun took his empty pint glass to the sink and turned off the lights at the switch by the mantel letting himself out the front door hardy stood in the recess off the sidewalk his hand on the guns butt scanning the shadows listening there was a high patchy cloudcover and it was not very cold traffic on lincoln was very light hardy stepped onto the sidewalk turned right and walked quickly back around the corner to tenth where he had parked distracted when hed come to work he had left the top down on his samurai and as he slid onto the damp drivers seat he saw that somebody had opened his glove compartment papers were strewn on the passenger seat on the floor looking around again he saw nothing move behind him beyond the near buildings the sutro tower rose in front of a crescent moon a skeleton clawing at the scudding clouds hardy put the car in gear and turned onto lincoln up toward stanyan and the tower it wasnt a skeleton it was just a bunch of metal and bolts and wirean idol to the great god television maybe seeing it close up would help no sense in getting worked up over imaginings letting the mind play tricks but rusty ingraham was missing dead that wasnt a trick he had been at home forewarned even and louis baker had found a way to get to him hardy was sure louis would also find a way to get to him he kept driving not knowing where he was going chapter six why are you still working the coffee was beyond goodgraffeos best made in an espresso machine hardy still pretty tired after a rough night on frannies couch was dressed in the clothes hed arrived in a little after am he looked over the steaming mug at frannie cochran the last time he had seen her her husbands death was still strangling her four months ago it had been strangling everybody especially because it had looked at first as though eddie cochrantwentyfive idealistic happily married with a justpregnant wife on his way to stanford business school in the fallhad killed himself but neither moses nor hardy had been able to believe it and they wanted to make sure frannie got her quarter million dollars in insurance if eddie had been killed moses had offered hardy twentyfive percent of the shamrock if he could pretend he was a cop again and prove eddie had not killed himself which hardy had done and getting involved with eddies death had done something for hardy too his original life goal had not been to bartend at an irish place in san francisco he like eddie cochran had once burned with idealism with notions of good works but the flame had died down along with his law career and his marriage to jane in the aftermath of his sons death when michael was seven months old hardy had left the sides of his crib halfway down on the first night the child was able to pull himself up the fall to the floor was about four feet michael landed on his head afterward hardy had dropped out damned if he was going to care about things if they were going to hurt that bad moses mcguire whose life hardy had saved in vietnam had taken him on as a bartender at the shamrock and years had passed one after another all pretty much the same until that is eddie died until eddie had been killed and finding out about it having to care had jumpstarted something in hardy even as it had killed something in frannie but now she was looking alive again blooming literally the baby she was carrying barely showed in her belly she wasnt wearing maternity clothes yet though hardy knew she was nearly five months along first pregnancies could be like that jane had been the same way with michael there had been no obvious body change except bigger breasts for almost six months and then whammo the stomach popped out and everything became more real right away hardy took frannie in her red hair washed and gleaming green eyes squinting as she sipped her own decaf she had taken to using light makeup around her eyes some lipstick her cheeks had filled out from the hollow carved by her grief and now she appeared to laugh easily again as she had before she laughed now and what would i do if i didnt work then eat bonbons watch soap operas go shopping be a woman of leisure nice view of womanhood okay how about become an astronaut run for congress conduct mahlers fifth better but youre pregnant you should take it a little easy until after the babys born if i take it too easy ill get fat well youre gonna anyway she pouted at him i will not be fat i will be pregnant there is a difference mr hardy and ill thank you to remember it hardy looked at her nonexistent stomach sorry baby he said to it reaching over and patting she put her hand over his and held it there a second i almost dont believe it still she said if it would kick or something theres no other sign hardy took his hand away and his eyes rested for a second on her breasts yes there is he said she laughed embarrassed sipped at her coffee i dont know i guess i just decided to keep working until its born its nice not to need the money but i want to keep busy if i get too much time to think hardy knew what too much time to think could do frannie had gotten nearly a quarter million dollars from eddies life insurance she was twentyfive years old there would be time not to work if she wanted that hardy reached out and patted her hand again and now a houseguest to boot im sorry about the couch she said the couch is fine and youre really in trouble arent you hardy shook his head not trouble maybe a little danger its why i need a place nobody would think to look for me and its also why you have a gun with you that too frannie put down her mug its still hard for me to believe people just get up in the morning intending to go and shoot somebody hardy nodded and youre sure this man louis baker louis baker youre sure he killed your friend hardy worked it around for the time it took him to swallow his coffee nodded again yep then why didnt abe glitsky go arrest him yesterday hardy had thought about that a lot last night why hadnt abe just gone down and taken him off the streets it worried him but he said only that abe had told him that there were other suspects but couldnt he arrest more than one person and question them all hardy shook his head they dont like to arrest people unless they charge them abe said my suspicions werent evidence well isnt there any evidence i mean i dont know itll turn up and youre sure he did it they were sitting at a teak table in a round breakfast nook off the kitchen hardy looked past frannie down the hill to a schoolbus stop at the corner a dozen or so students were milling aroundmostly black kids for a moment hardy wondered if his certainty about baker might possibly have to do with his color there were other possibilities things that mightve happened there on rustys barge but the probability the overwhelming probability was baker hardy didnt base his suspicions on bakers race hell glitsky was halfblack and abe was one of his best friends he had to smile at thatsome of my best friends dismas she saw the smile lines fade around his eyes he came back to her refocusing sorry went away for a minute you see something yeah i saw a bunch of kids down there and wondered if i was getting to be a racist but then i thought about baker who is nothing like you or me or them frannie had been raised by her brother moses and had known hardy since moses had gotten back from vietnam hardy had saved moses life over there she had sat on his lap when she was twelve and thirteen fantasizing about her brothers friend dismas the hero now a policeman handsome in his pressed blue uniform then hardy had gone on to law school and become an assistant district attorney hed gotten married and had a child with jane fowler then the boy had died and hardy had gotten divorced quit his job and had been around more first drinking at moses place the little shamrock then becoming a bartender there thats when she had gotten to know him again stopping in for a beer at the shamrock to visit moses and had it not been for the keep off sign he had worn like a badge she might have started fantasizing again but instead she turned him into a litmus test she would not date a guy twice unless he was at least as good a man as dismas hardy she told her college girlfriends and shed found oneeddie cochranand she had married him and lost him she stared across the table at the worried face so different than eddies had been hardys face had lines and creases and whole chapters of his life on it she thought now it was more interesting than handsome but he was like eddieor eddie had been like himboth worried so much about doing the right thing about good motives dismas would never put it that way but frannie knew him and thats what it was now someone was trying to kill him and he didnt want to suspect him for the wrong reasons she got up and went around behind him putting her hands on his shoulders you and i both know youre not a racist she said not even close hardy shrugged i dont know i dont think of it as an issue anymore maybe that means i dont care about it all i know is that baker was an animal ten years ago and we put him in a cage and he swore when he got out hed kill me and rusty and rusty is dead and gone the day he gets out what would you think how much more evidence would you need she thought a moment then leaned over and kissed him on the top of the head i dont think much thats the right answer hardy said abe glitsky returning a little late for work parked in a space behind the hall of justice and went in through the back door nodding to the pair of uniformed officers who stood by the metal detectors he turned left by the booking station and went around to the elevators stopping to pick up an early morning candy bar there were six elevators in the bank and he waited by his watch three and a half minutes for the first door to open during this time he spoke to no one and munched his candy bar thinking about hardys problem deciding he probably had one he owed it to his friend to talk to louis bakerat least talk to him see where he had been two nights ago it was dead quiet on the floor for a moment he thought there must have been a sickout or some other protest a little more formal than golf clubs he stuck his head in investigations and found no one around no one he had been around when dan white killed mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk and the hall had the same feel it had this morning he opened the door to homicide passed through the small reception cubicle which was empty and opened the door the wideopen room was jammed with what looked like every investigatorhomicide robbery white collar vice in the department the chief himself dan rigby was talking in front of lieutenant frank batistes office no one even acknowledged glitskys arrival he leaned back against the doorpost he had come through and folded his arms listening rigby was speaking very quietly persons responsible for this will be let go you got a message to give me any of you you come deliver it in person or you want to memo it thats fine too but this this he paused and glitsky saw the vein standing out on the side of his neck these insulting demeaning unprofessional acts not only wont be tolerated they will be investigated with the whole weight of the department and the perps here will be charged with criminal trespass criminal contempthe was hammering the word criminaldestruction of city property vandalism and anything else me and anyone on my staff can think of rigby stopped talking a couple of guys had come in behind abe catching only the last words one of them said whats up which everyone ignored several people were smoking in the room and even through the smoke abe could detect a lockerroom smell beginning to rise people were nervous moving in the few seats shifting from foot to foot rigby looked around the room making eye contact with everyone who had the guts to meet it it took a long time and nobody else said a word so he said finally im giving you perpsand i know youre in this roomone chance this morning to own up you come to me to my office and at this a couple of people snickered you think its funny rigby bellowed even glitsky jumped the snickering stopped rigby went back to his near whisper you come up to see me wherever i am by noon save the department the time and expense of finding out who you are and youll get to keep your pension if were forced to launch a fullscale investigation to find you youre out of the department you lose your pension and if i have any clout at all with the da and i do youll do time the guy behind glitsky whispered again somebody get killed whatd i miss rigby was coming through the massed bodies in the room following one of his aides glitsky moved from the doorway to let him pass others started streaming out behind him frank batiste had been standing next to rigby and now motioned to abe he threaded his way around the outer wall overhearing snatches of peoples remarks guy cant much take a joke can he impersonating rigbys whispered voice criminal trespass criminal criminal at least hell get out of his office for a while maybe see whats going on around here my office by noon right like noon some day next month laughter and some people making noises under their breath as they left the room sounding like cluck cluck cluck jesus what happened frank batiste motioned abe inside his office and closed the door behind them just tell me you didnt do this abe please tell me that do what come on abe swear to god frank i just walked in this morning to this i have no clue whats going on batiste searched glitskys face for some sign that he was lying perhaps satisfied he went around his desk and sat down wearily last night somebody let themselves in rigbys office with about four chickens glitsky had been to rigbys office a couple of times there was a rug on the floor that had been a gift to the city from the shah of iran a heavy stunning mahogany desk several pieces of leather furniture that glitsky guessed cost about what a patrolman made in a year it took a moment for the significance of the chickens to sink in and when it did he smiled pretty clear message he said it isnt funny batiste said the room is floating in chicken shit you dont think its funny abe said then at franks scowl no sir me neither that sure isnt funny rigby doesnt think its funny glitsky bobbed his head i picked that up im a trained investigator abe your ass is in a major sling if you did this i mean it glitsky rolled his eyes and came back to his lieutenant frank what in the world makes you think i had anything to do with this theres a hundredodd people in this department yeah how many of them are applying to la thinking of applying okay but who just happened to use the phrase chicken shit the day before thisthis fiasco i think i used horseshit frank horseshit chicken shit same difference abe was fighting back his laughter now wanting to get into the difference with frank but feeling it wasnt really a good time maybe never would be a good time instead he said if somebodyd trotted a horse in there but batiste had had enough get the fuck out of here back at glitskys desk marcel lanier was waiting so the judge says farmer brown you are charged with the most heinous of crimes the crime of bestiality of having sexual intercourse with animals not now marcel abe said but lanier continued specifically you are charged with carnal knowledge of horses cows sheep dogs cats chickens just then farmer brown holds up his hand and says what kind of pervert do you think i am your honor chickens yuck glitsky found the paper hed been looking for making sure of what he had written under reason for leaving present employment he wondered if it was strong enough hardy had fond feelings for the sir francis drake hotel when his father returned from the pacific theater after world war ii he had spent his first night back in the states in a vip room the hotel had reserved for returning pows later he and hardys mother had the honeymoon suite it was possible that hardy had been conceived there but the great hotel a block north of union square in the heart of downtown had not so much fallen upon hard times as it had been victimized by the boom times the san francisco hardys father had returned to had been the city that knew how it had a vital port a refreshing yearround climate great food neighborhoods a tiny downtown with an accessible feel in fact it had much of what corporate america wanted men who had been in the war and passed through the city on their way home were now running businesses and did not see why they had to slave away freeze in the winter sweat the summers out in cleveland or detroit or omaha when they could have a corner building on russian hill and these men the first generation knew what they had and did not much want to mess with it san franciscos lack of a skyline was part of its charm the city did not need big buildings to make a big statement if you wanted to take a moment to look around at this twinkling clear gem of a city spreading before you you could go to the redwood room high atop the fairmont hotel you could hit the top of the mark or coit tower or downtown you could go to the starlight room of the sir francis drake hotel forty years ago hardy sat there now at the bar it was just after eleven in the morning and he looked through the streaked windows to the other francis across the waythe saint francis hotel which dwarfed the drake a few blocks further north the bankamerica building threw its fiftysix stories worth of shade around the surrounding ten blocks of downtown the transamerica pyramid the embarcadero center towersin their fashion as symbolic hardy thought as the spires of medieval cathedrals just a different god hardy took his coffee and walked across the faded rug of the nearly empty starlight room except for due south which afforded a view of the shipyards and hunters point every direction was blocked by highrises hardy had danced up here with jane had stood with his arm around her at the floortoceiling windows looking down all around them at their city it had been a genteel place a spot to touch base or regroup out of step with the hipness of the rest of the city even then it had been from hardys and janes perspective where old people of forty or fifty drank happy hour doubles and danced to a combo not a rock band now hardy felt like one of the old people himself a voice behind him said they gotta get to these windows hardy spun around jittery for a moment he had almost forgotten he was being hunted it doesnt really matter he said theres not much to see anymore hector medina was a short squat man with a square face and thinning hair he wore a brown business suit and black shoes which were not shined he showed hardy his securitycops badge and they went back to the bar where hardy had his coffee refilled and medina ordered a glass of plain water no ice no lime this must be my week for cops he said memory lane im not on the force anymore hardy said the message i left yeah i got it excop cop im an excop i still feel like a cop youre chief of security here arent you medina coughed yeah some japanese tour lady loses her purse and i get to investigate and find it under her bed a farmer from kansas finds out the hooker he picked up is a guy and has a fit tough cases he sipped at his water shit what am i talking about its a good job but dont mistake it for real police work he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand so how can i help you hardy wasnt sure how medina could help him it wasnt entirely clear to him why hed even come down here but it was better than sitting at frannies with a loaded gun and a head full of questions hed thought he might as well get some of them answered its about rusty ingraham medina picked up his glass again then put it down you know i had a feeling whys that you know clarence raines the name sounded familiar but hardy shook his head the department is fucking him over him and his partner is he one of the guys theyre bringing up yeah yeah those guys so clarence came to see me to ask about because something like this happened to you something exactly like this except they didnt wind up killing their suspect whats his name treadwell they should have at least my guy couldnt talk so whatd you tell clarence my advice i told him him and his partner both to go into business hardy didnt get that business you know sporting goods insurance something out of the line cause their police careers are over right now once youre charged he finished his water thats what happened to you ingraham medina said he brought the charges no no hes too clean for that too hands off he just pointed the finger and sicced the dogs on me but you got off cause the da knew a good cop when he saw one he knew the asshole i killed was a dirtbag scum of the earth whod tried to kill you anyway right medina looked over hardys shoulder silent then there was a gun in his hand it never went to trial hardy fiddled with his coffee cup a man could say a lot saying nothing admitting nothing hardy might never know the story but it was becoming clear to him that maybe ingraham had been onto something with medinathe accusation might not have been all air so you wouldnt say ingraham and you were close medina grunted smiled you could say id like to kill the son of a bitch frankly you wont have to medina blinked his look going over hardys shoulder then back he seemed to settle back on his stool as though some tension he had been holding in a long time was finally releasing its grip my luck keeps holding he said what does that mean it means i havent seen ingraham or talked to him in maybe five years and last week i called him up and this week hes killed somebody will probably check his phone records put it together and want to talk to me about it you called him up medina sighed clarence coming to see me talking about his situation it got me stirred up so what did you say to him again that guttural grunt thats whats funny i didnt say a damn thing i heard his voice and realized i didnt want to prove it thats all it was over if i want to do something ill work with clarences hand mines folded medina lifted the glass to his mouth saw it was empty and still tried to suck the last drops from it i gotta get back to work nice talking to you he got to the elevator button pushed it then walked back to hardy if i wanted to kill ingraham and believe me i thought about it i wouldve done it seven years ago when it wouldve done some good and there wouldnt have been any evidence there either the elevator door opened and medina turned a halfstep toward it nobody says you killed ingraham hardy said somebody will medina said you watch you get accused once youre in the loop medina made it to the elevator as the doors were closing if he was putting on an act it was damn convincing hardy checking in with glitsky from the pay phone by the mens room heard no body yet diz its out in the bay somewhere abe he must have fallen or been thrown overboard and the tide took him out i dont know if its that strong the tide i mean how about if you guys check that hardy heard a crunching in the phone glitsky was chewing ice again you know your teeth are all going to crack and fall out we dragged the canal diz we cant drag the whole bay isnt the blood type enough glitsky had told him that the second blood stain from the bed out the door to the pool by the rail was b negative fairly rare ingrahams old records confirmed that had been his type ice crunched in the phones earpiece means somebody with b negative bled doesnt mean ingraham died crunch crunch necessarily sure abe probably somebody just had a nosebleed the bullet hole in the bed must have been there before hey were going on somebody was shot probably ingraham but we have a real live dead person diz maxine weir and her husbands got means motive and no alibi for opportunity hardy was losing his patience im telling you abe louis baker did this he killed them both why would he kill the girl she was there i dont know you just said it you dont know look to make you happy ill go see baker today thank you but no promises the man is out on parole he checked in with his parole officer he is following the rules i have no reason to think he even saw rusty ingraham much less killed him im sorry if youre paranoid about it this is not paranoia abe dont you think rusty getting it the day baker gets loose is a pretty big coincidence coincidences happen and i hate to keep reminding you but rusty isnt officially dead glitskys voice changed it was starting to get him wound up and dig it diz i do have a murder victim heremaxinewho you dont care about but im supposed to plus i got a full caseload like four other current homicides to say nothing about a file full of oldies but goodies still outstanding im doing you a favora favor you understandto even see louis baker technically its a pure hassle of a guy on parole but im gonna do it cause youre not always as full of it as you are right now hardy figured hed pushed hard enough okay abe okay you want to do something worthwhile with your time find me a body or give me a reason we havent found one something to make me believe rustys dead then youve got me on your side all right ill do that he could hear glitskys breathing slow down all right his friend said you do that chapter seven the dreams had been bad and louis baker hadnt slept until nearly dawn in the dreams there was a bright light beckoning to him but then there was always the yard bell waking him just before he could get to the light sometimes though before the bell there would be some other people close around him pushing up against him not exactly going for the light themselves really unaware of it but getting in his way enough so hed have to break through them smashing faces stomping on their bodies if he had to a couple of times he had woken up on the floor drenched in sweat still flailing at the people in his way the mama wasnt around as he came down the stairs the house looked different and it took him a while to realize it was the windows there were things he still had to do but he was glad hed done the windows up first where you lived had to be right especially now after those cell years now it was mamas place still but he could feel it starting to be his turf he didnt want to sink into it yet there was a lot to get straight but the light through the windows felt like it gave him a start he stood at the kitchen sink barefoot and barechested his prison pants tied with a rope around his waist he let the water run until it got hot his hands rested on the cracked tile of the drain and the porcelain was streaked brown and red with rust he stared out through the window at the warm day it must be late morning already early afternoon no bell to get you up whether you slept or not he arched his back rotating his stiff neck to get the kinks out steam rose and clouded the window in front of him as he filled a juice glass with the hot water and went to sit down at mamas table he dropped two teaspoons of nescafé into the glass and stirred it with the handle of the spoon he had not yet done any inside painting but he had pulled down the wallpaper where it had been peeling loose just came in yesterday after the boys had gone back to working the cut hed been pissed off trying to decide how to handle dido and the hanging strips of dirty paper had pissed him off more and hed ripped them down now the kitchens walls looked unfinished but that was all right unfinished was all right unfinished meant you had started something not let it go on its own a knock at the front door louis baker got up with his juice glass and went to answer it the front room too was lighter with the glass in the windows although mama kept the blinds drawn in here all day anyway the man he come in a lot of styles baker thought this one he be some kind of man of color knows who he is something in baker knew immediately what version of the man he was dealing withturnkeys got you good at that the mean ones who wait til you were turned and sap the back of your legs the others doing their jobs some scared all the time having to keep the upper hand dangerous most on the take one way or the other this one here baker sensed was doing his job street clothes but baker knew who he was he didnt have to look at the badge the man held out man couldve said he was reading the meter baker knew the man when he saw him baker brought him back in the kitchen sat at his chair with his back to the wall motioned the man to sit he waited we got a problem louis he waited a dead man over at china basin baker felt his legs go mushy he was glad he was sitting down how could they have put him there already i dont know nobody in china basin the man smiled not a smile made you like him with the scar running through his lips top to bottom baker thought about his bad dreams the people around him keeping him from the light they some of em smiled like this man you do louis or you did no man i dont i been you know in the joint im just out now two days i dont see nobody i just been livin here cleanin it up cleanin it up louis pointed around the place you know put up windows some paint the man half turned on his chair came back to him you remember your trial louis when you swore youd kill the two guys who were putting you away yeah i did that a mistake it was more a mistake actually to do it digging what you sayin he almost said out of habit i didnt kill ingraham but then the man would say howd you know i was talking about ingraham it could have been hardy better find out what the man knows before you open your mouth tell him something else to the man denying and admitting were two sides to the same coin both told him you knew something did something im saying it looks like rusty ingraham got shot dead two nights ago im sorry to hear that so where were you i just tole you i got off the bus i came home anybody see you louis scratched at his bare chest why dont you ask around the man slammed his hand on the table some coffee spilling over the sides of the glass onto bakers hands the time it took to recover and look up the man had his piece out on the table leveled at his chest you want to play games with me im good at games i aint playing no games lets play who killed rusty ingraham he let his eyes rest on the gun a minute i aint playing no games baker repeated you taking me in or we talking here might as well get to it he thought they either made him there or they didnt if they did thought they did he was going back in he kept staring at the gun people got shot resisting arrest you got another piece on you he asked gonna plant me it surprised him the reaction the man straightened up a little smiled that smile again slowly pulled at the flap of his jacket and holstered the weapon heres the message the man said if i find even one of your hairs at ingrahams place some cloth we cant match in his closet a fingerprint anything youre on the bus you hear me what baker heard was we got nothing on you his legs started firming up again but the man kept talking and the other thing is this the other da hardy you remember hardy baker nodded hardy is a friend of mine if hardy winds up dead for any reason im not going to care about evidence im talking you and me and im hoping you hear me this man was good baker thought scary you hear me a whisper baker nodded i hear you the man stood up did a full circle in the kitchen nice wallpaper he said and walked back through the living room and let himself out the front door leaving it open louis baker gave it a while finishing his coffee the street outside was empty the man gone he stretched in the doorway then walked up the sidewalk to where the cut started the side of the place whitened over yesterday by the time he had gone in was sprayed over in swirls and designs of dark blue he walked up the cut shirtless his nostrils flaring didos name was written in six places along his wall further up the cut he saw the brother talking to two white boys near the sidewalk passing something back and forth the younger bloods lace and the other were not in sight though he knew they must be around probably saw him coming and moved aside glitsky had told him to find a reason to believe rusty was dead but hardy had no ideas at the moment so he thought he would take care of business first he had left his car at the union square garage and after talking to hector medina had thought he would walk around to clear his head he stopped for another cup of coffee this one an espresso in maiden lane and ate two cheese croissants he was due at the shamrock to start his shift in about an hour and had to call moses with the news that he wasnt going to work at the shamrock until his problem with louis baker was settled what do you mean if i bartended another day there the integrity of our bar would be badly compromised hardy told him about his continuing creative drinkmaking the previous night so pay more attention not that easy moses somebodys trying to kill me hardy realized it sounded unreal melodramatic look he said im out of my house wouldnt make much sense to go to my regular job the guy finds out where i work walks in and goodbye diz you know who it is yeah you know where he is generally well hardy paused again working that idea out its a possibility he said but the police have a good opportunity to get him first and that would make it easier i dont know if id give em too much time the cops i mean hardy didnt feel like getting into whether or not he was going to shoot down louis baker on sight well see he said in any case i hate to stick you but im not coming in so how do i reach you something stopped hardy from just saying oh im at frannies he didnt want her brother thinking she was being put in danger he didnt want moses to let it slip at the baroh hardys staying at my sisters place he was also in some way reluctant to acknowledge to moses his closeness to frannie to get into why he had decided to go to her place moses was her older brother he had raised her it would take too much needless explaining so hardy just said you dont reach me ill be in touch and hung up since he was right around the corner anyway he then walked into i magnins where jane worked and left a brief message for her to receive in hong kong he wasnt home hed explain later and all the while the idea had been brewing that if he could prove the genuineness of rustys fear to glitsky then abe would get on it with louis baker the afternoon yawned open before him he couldnt go home wouldnt go to work and didnt want to sit in hiding he figured that the reason abe was having trouble believing him was the way hed come upon himhandcuffedon the barge it was coloring abes view of his explanation of thingsthe undeniable involvement of louis baker so hardy needed some corroborating evidence that his story about rusty was true and the best bet for starters seemed to be to find out if rusty had gone out to buy a gun right from the shamrock as he had said he was going to since there was a mandatory threeday wait between sale and delivery on handguns ingrahams weapon and the papers for it should be sitting in a store someplace on the bus line between the shamrock and the china basin canal officer william ling was off duty but he was in for the long haul in police work so regular hours were not something he concerned himself with he knew and accepted the life of a beat cop and for now it was all right that it was mostly tedium walking and walking some more moving the bums along orienting the tourists directing traffic when called forif he lived and worked in a small town hed probably rescue a lot of kittens stuck up in trees his area in the first precinctmarket street south to the china basin canal the bay west to th streetdid not have a lot of trees he wasnt even in a squad car yet the street beat was the initial weedout every rookie cop had done it for a time how long usually a function like everything else of who you knew and ling didnt know anybody well that wasnt true now he knew inspector sergeant glitsky of homicide whether glitsky knew or remembered him was another question he figured he had already put in somewhere between ten and fourteen miles today and it had been a hot one now going on five oclock it was still warm with no wind or fog there was even a rare trace of smog he came abreast of the atlantis and nodded at the wangs who were sitting having tea on their aft deck the wangs had turned in the call on the armed manthe friend of glitskywho had been on ingrahams barge he stopped walking taking in the sight before him previously his reasons for coming back to the scene of his first murder had been nebulousa mixture of professional interest and private curiosity suddenly now the area itself seemed full of opportunitythe yellow tape still surrounding ingrahams barge the city dredge in the middle of the canal slowly crabbing its way out toward the bay at least a half dozen persons were active in and around the barge people to help get to know connections to make ling let himself under the tape and presented himself to a man in shirtsleeves who looked to be in charge of course he towered over ling everyone was taller than ling but this man was well over six feet he shook lings hand checking something on the clipboard he held in his hand they call you bill he asked just dont call me late for dinner ling said ling was used to it a double take then the realization that damn this little chink is a person under there he smiled the tall man stuck out his hand again jamie bourke im running this drag line you want to just watch or do something doing something would be fine not authorized you understand no overtime ling nodded i understand you wouldnt believe the guys come around offer to help and suddenly youre tagged for like ten hours ot and no budget for it its my first murder scene ling said im interested in the process id pay you to see it yeah well that wont be necessary either bourke checked his clipboard again problem is were just about done you find anything no body which is the main thing we were looking for hard to believe this current would take it out to the bay we did find a gun though small caliber probably the murder weapon ling wanted to do something hell he was here wasnt he you dont get remembered for standing around what about inside he asked what about it dont they run all kinds of tests fingerprints like that bourke smiled i dont know the figures exactly but fingerprints catch about as many people a year as footprints do then noticing lings disappointment he said sure go on down the place has been dusted but you see anything that looks interesting bag it and bring it on up he gave ling a ziploc evidence bag from his jacket pocket the living room of the barge looked about as it had the previous morning but the slanting rays of the sun coming through the door behind him gave the place the look of an old daguerreotype plus it was hot there was a sweet smell coming from somewhere that caught ling unawares and almost made him gag but after a couple of breaths he realized it was not really so strongit might be the bilge something in the canal or blood that had seeped into the floorboards the door to the hallway was open and the chalk figure where maxine had died struck him he could almost see her there again the naked body contorted in that grotesque stretched out reaching pose the metal neck brace like some bad joke but the bedroom itself told him nothing there was a thin film of black dust covering everything he looked at in here in spite of what bourke might say about the usefulness of fingerprints the homicide team had been thorough he realized he shouldnt have been surprised that was after all what the job wascheck out everything in the hopes that something would tell a story still that left him again with no role the heat was really something and he opened the back door stepping out to the deck he saw bourke had moved down the canal opposite the dredge and was talking to a couple of people in yellow slickers who were combing through the goop brought up from the bottom of the canal those people he thought were earning their pay taking a breath he reentered the barge now the sun was lower coming straight in through the front door but he would rather have the light in his eyes than the stifling dead heat the lamp that had been knocked over had not been righted he knelt by it and saw that it too had been dusted for prints the pieces of glass that had been there were goneprobably taken to the lab disappointed he sat in the chair by the lamp and surveyed the rest of the room nothing the galley was left and it at least didnt look like it had received the full treatment unfortunately it was also a very small area that was very clean the only sign that anyone had been there at all was a water glass sitting on the drain next to the sink and that had probably been one of the techs having something to beat this heat the sink itself was emptyno dirty coffee mugs no dishes pots or pans whoever had lived here kept the place neat ling leaned against the galley door well what did he expect this was routine to the guys that did it they wouldnt likely miss much then something struck him he walked back into the galley and ran a finger along the window sill no dusting powder he had noticed it had been all over the windows in the bedroom and again in the living room the metal spigot on the galley sink looked like a new fixture its chrome bright and shiny there was no dust on it they hadnt dusted this room in a way it made some sense the line of action had clearly been from living room through hallway to bedroom and out the back the team had no doubt looked into the galley and seen that nothing to do with the murder had happened in there but it was his only opportunity and he had to take it they might laugh at him when the prints on the glass turned out to be a member of the homicide squad but he didnt care hed been laughed at before and he wasnt going back up to bourke emptyhanded he took a clean handkerchief from his back pocket and carefully picked up the drinking glass dropping it into the ziploc bag moses mcguire was behind the bar at the little shamrock serving drinks to a fivethirty crowd and talking on the telephone i dont know he said a black guy whatd he look like he looked black diz big black and mean hardy from taylors gun shop on eddy st felt his head go light did he say anything yeah he said something what do you think he just stood around he asked for you and i said you wouldnt be in for a while and could i give you a message and he said no ill find him him meaning you yeah i got that so what should i have done howd he know about the shamrock already whos telling him this stuff diz were jamming here he comes again what do you want me to do then i gotta go what could moses do hardy knew the bar at this time on friday nights and if it was normal moses was rightit was jamming two deep the length of the bar hardy couldnt believe glitsky still hadnt arrested baker and now the guy shows up at hardys work diz im thinking mose think faster okay hardy heard moses tell people he was coming just a second be right there go tend bar he said what about i dont know hardy said later it was something louis baker had done in the yard he didnt much think about whether it did any good or what its function was at all but he had done it day in and out for the last six or seven years and the habit wasnt going to get broken it was also probably what had kept him in shape now he took the basketball and began dribbling back and forth at the public court just up the hill from holly park except for the trees surrounding it the court was about like the one in the yard there were no nets on the basketsyou ran on pitted asphalt with no key halfcourt or foul lines mama had come back home sometime midafternoon with a load of clothes and some hightop sneakers that fit maybe shed gone down to the goodwillyou picked the right one they could have better stuff than kmart full dusk now the park lights came on enough to continue louis hoped somebody would come by and try to get him off the court for their own game he felt like kicking a little more ass an hour before he had had it out with dido and his blood was still hot warming up he dribbled down the court pounding the ball into the ground laying it up to the hoop soft as patting a babys butt that was for the control and then slamming the pole coming around getting the ball on the first bounce and doing it again full court what he would do then in the yard was stand at about the freethrow line and forget about the basket there was only the backboard and he would stare at it visualizing faces other guys at the house ingraham hardy and he would slam the balltwohanded shots or overhandup against the backboard hard enough so it would come back to him at the freethrow line on one bounce max sometimes even on the fly smashing the ball up against the faces he saw grunting with the exertion getting it out that way so the hatred and anger didnt overtake himso he was in control dido had been strong but didnt know how to fight and louis had hit him in the throat and put him down then standing over him as he struggled for breath he told him he wanted his house white again by the morning he knew he might have to finish things with dido and he had come out here pumped up but now it wasnt didos face he kept seeing on the backboardit was the other da hardy the one who had blown him the kiss he slammed the ball barely hearing its boom against the backboard or its echo against the project houses down the hill hardys face smiling at him taunting he threw again and again until he was covered with sweat he was in the courtroom struggling to get at hardy fighting against the restraints of the guards then later against the bars until his arms hung down heavy as lead useless he stood in the pool of artificial light unable to lift the ball anymore hardys face still up there smiling down at him chapter eight fred treadwell had his broken ankle propped up on his coffee table he was listening to some old lou reed and feeding poppy next to him on the couch bits of the paté and crackers he was munching with his chardonnay poppy ate almost everything he did a dainty eater hardly spilling any crumbs from the crackers and he waited until fred put the morsel right up to his mouth then slowly took it right from his fingers a poodle was the pet to haveneat welltrained smart fred scratched at poppys head behind the ears and was rewarded with a sweet dry lick at his clipped mustache he kissed the dog back lightly fred treadwell was beginning to realize that he was going to walk on the murder charge and it made him very happy not many people could kill their exlover and his new boyfriend and get away with it but fred knew that he was going to pull it off he had already pretty well pulled it off whoever had said the best defense was a good offense was certainly right these straightsespecially the good cops valenti and rainesjust didnt understand the citys politics the way he did or the way his attorney did his attorney manny gubicza was the best brian had told him he just needed to get some space to think things over he hadnt said he had someone else so when fred had caught them both there together in the act he had just lost his head brian couldnt do that to him brian had been nothing a mailroom clerk where he was division manager he had brought brian up finally made him his assistant and then brian hadnt needed him anymore well no it didnt work that way fred had known where brian kept his mm beretta and had gone to that drawer while they fumbled and fussed and shot them both wham bam but then valenti and raines kept coming around with questions and finally with a warrant there had been that moment of panic especially when he hit the ground after jumping out the window and the ankle had broken but not five minutes after showing up at gubiczas office it had all turned around two weeks before he had been the subject of an investigation for a seconddegree murder he had righteously committed now that investigation had gone south and his accusers were themselves the accused it was beautiful gubicza was a genius the doorbell rang poppy yipped the way he did and treadwell slowly put the stemmed glass down on the table grabbed his crutches and moved to the door yes through the wood mr treadwell please who is it you couldnt be too careful especially lately my name is hector medina a pause i represent clarence raines i represent clarence raines which wasnt strictly true he hadnt been retained or anything but let treadwell think he was an attorney if he wanted attorneys were no threat hed get inside if he was an attorney id like a few words with you if you would open the door he waited heard just a moment then some movement inside a drawer sliding open and closed after a moment the door opened treadwell was tall thin but not skinny he looked like he had spent a lot of time working out when he was younger now hectors age give or take five he had a full head of black hair and a trim and solid physique shown off well in a pair of shorts and a golds gym tank top a goddamn little poodle yipped continually up at hector poppy be quiet hector looked around the apartment white on white animal heads looking like theyd been bought at cost plus on the walls a couple of paintings of pretty obvious phallic imagery some kind of musiche didnt know how to describe itplaying softly in the background leather and chrome white tile high tech the dog stopped barking hector stuck out his hand and treadwell took it his grip firm and dry can i offer you something some wine stags leap chardonnay quite nice the eightythree sure maybe the guy was nervous the way he babbled getting a glass out of the cabinet across the room by the kitchen under the cabinet was a counter some drawers one of which treadwell opened then quickly closed he opened the one next to it searched a moment came out with a coaster nervous would be good hector thought it sounded right i cant understand people who say you shouldnt age your whites or that vintage is irrelevant in california wines especially the cabernets and chardonnays its just reverse snobbery really if you ask me an older chardonnay like this one simply overwhelms its younger siblings definitely nervous hector thought but he took the wine and sat down on one of the white leather chairs the coffee table in front of him the wineglass was tinted smoky gray and was top heavy the stem no thicker than a pipe cleaner hector thought it might snap off between his fingers so he cupped his hand under the bowl and drank a little it tasted like wine all right treadwell made his way around and settled onto the couch the coffee table between them the poodle jumped up on his lap and he petted it while he sipped help yourself to the paté he said actuallymedina leaned forwardim here to talk about clarence raines clarence had not really sent him of course clarence was a good guy who played by the rules and he was going to lose maybe had already lost because of it clarence had a wife and two children he was going to get himself an attorney to defend this bullshit charge and maybe even beat it as hector had done seven years before and lost for winning you beat it and you still lost you became a security cop or worse you no longer hung out with people who cared about what they did everything became gray at least it had for hector until clarence had come by for his advice that had for the first time in years gotten him going again remembering what ingraham had done to him ingraham then that guy this morning hardy poking around funny how things just didnt die sometimes until you put them to sleep yourself made sure so thats why he was here now increase the odds make sure suddenly the gray like some internal fog had lifted he saw that he could do something clarence hadnt hired him but he sure as hell was representing him his best interests treadwell sipped at his balloon glass i dont know if i should say something about mr raines therell be a trial i presume and youre a fucking liar treadwell reacted as though hed been slapped so hector kept up the press you know good and well that nothing you said about these two guys is true treadwell recovered are these insults part of your legal repertoire i cant see them doing much good with a jury im talking to you one on one and calling me a liar a fucking liar actually hector took a second put his glass down pulled himself back together a little look mr treadwell clarence raines has been a good cop for fifteen years hes got a wife and family and pension to consider he should have thought of those things when he attacked me is he asking to settle no im asking i want you to drop the charges treadwell sat back comfortable again you must be joking he leaned forward and spread himself some paté on a cracker perhaps you dont understand these men are gaybashers they were about to have me charged with the murder of two people one of whom i cared about very much very much its the classic isnt it hector said you charge them to get the heat off you i dont think its impossible that they killed brian and his friend hector drank some more of the wine this wasnt working he never really believed talking would do any good but he thought it might be worth an effort okay hed made the effort you know he said you could get hurt a lot worse than you are right now treadwell cocked his head surprised almost amused he glanced behind hector to the cabinets in back that sounds very much like a threat a statement hector said i should warn you that on the advice of my attorney i have a voiceactivated recorder in the apartment here treadwell smiled and hector thought it looked very much like the smile raul guerrero had given him when he thought he had beaten another rap and was going to walk the smile raul guerrero had been wearing as hector shot him through the heart hector hung his head a moment then looked back up now wearing a smile of his own he took another sip of wine spread some paté on a cracker he held it out for the poodle who obediently jumped off treadwells lap and skitted across to hector the dog ate the cracker and hector rubbed around its ears it came a couple of steps closer and yipped cutely begging hector moved his hand back from the ears caught the poodle by the neck and flipped it by the head breaking it over his knee treadwell screamed hector stood up and while treadwell struggled out of the couch in his cast almost falling across the table trying to reach his dead pet he went over to the drawers under the cabinet and lifted the tape from the cassette player youre an animal treadwell looking up tears on his face turning around hector clucked once i asked you nice first he started for the door oh and thanks for the tip on the tape he said ill get you for this ill call the police you do that thatd be good your good friends the police will certainly believe another farout accusation itll do wonders for your credibility treadwell lunged for him but the cast made the effort ludicrous hector moved back a step now at the door theres hardball he said which is a game and then theres the lifeanddeath one think about it then he was out walking down the hallway treadwells sobs echoing through the closed door behind him the lap of the water the moon out over the bay its reflection like a long yellow aisle up the canal early on a balmy evening a salt breeze carrying on it the soothing susurrus of the friday night traffic on the bay bridge on a bed all the lights out with a beautiful woman this is romantic flo glitsky said abe tightened his hand in his wifes i mean this is much better than all the dates our friends have they do boring old things like go out to dinner or a movie get together with friends concerts the opera dancing not me and my man though uh uh the romance has not faded from our lives we go to murder scenes and hang out well be going to dinner soon enough abe said im serious who needs dinner she moved her hand on his leg ive got hors doeuvres here anyway flo i know she said all right im just trying to see it abe said this was about the time maybe a little later didnt you say like ten oclock between eight and midnight is the best guess i figure after it was dark like now the moon she began it wouldnt have mattered fog remember would the fog have muffled the shots well nobody heard any but the people at the next boat up were out til about tenthirty eleven so it was before then glitsky nodded in the dark bedroom likely flo turned sideways and rested her head on the pillow that remained at the head of the bed she wore designerstyle jeans and wrapped her legs around her husbands waist and closed her eyes im just trying to picture it he said i know she leaned forward a little and rubbed his back take your time i was kidding about dinner the high tide was running a little stronger and the barge bumped lightly against the tires on the walk abe let out a long breath you think i take this too seriously dont you not really but sometimes ro turned on her side resting on her elbow her blond hair gleamed in the moons light that came in through the open back door i find a time like this a little difficult to understand yes why is that she thought about it a minute because of the hassles with your work lately i guess applying down to la one side of you pulling away from all this and the other here at the scene with sexy old me on our night out its habit maybe no its not habit i know your habits and this isnt one of them she paused thank god they were both comfortable her legs were still wrapped around him and he rubbed the one across his lap with both his hands so what does being here tell you she asked nothing i didnt know consciously anyway they found the gunthe murder weaponin the canal yeah they found a gun but i had a hunch she wasnt poisoned anyway maybe its dismas oh its partly diz no doubt about it what part huh he nodded thats the thing he extricated himself from her legs ignoring her hey and walked to the door of the bedroom flipping on the light switch diz has got louis baker coming in here and blowing rusty ingraham away diz is not dumb and he is legitimately scared right but the problem is where is rustys body maybe out in the bay abe walked over to the back door and leaned against the sill washed out by this raging torrent huh she had gotten up and stood next to him maybe and the girlexcuse me womanmaxine weir why was she killed because she was here abe that makes sense louis baker killed her too okay but why the neck brace me report says her neck was fine that i dont know glitsky sat down on the bed again why is everybody so quick to believe its louis baker flo came beside him well thats obvious isnt it he threatened ingraham and hardy both he said hed do it abe its pretty convenient or stupid im not sure which more the actual day he gets out of prison flo shrugged crime of passion waited a long time and couldnt wait anymore then he wouldve done diz too wouldnt he or tried maybe he did maybe he couldnt find him if he found rusty she was silent i think what bothers me still is that it might be because hes black and an excon black excons can be bad people abe so can white excons how about whites with no records how about a husband whos jealous as hell and comes out here and kills his wife and her lover with nothing to do with louis baker flo was rubbing his back again you said youre checking that arent you he nodded so check everythingas if you wouldnt anyway and meanwhile what if louis baker kills diz flo stopped rubbing ah she said getting to it right you know me flo i never think of this black white bullshit maybe i shouldve arrested baker already maybe im just dragging my heels cause hes black and im abe youve arrested tons of black people yeah but usually i hope with a little evidence and you dont have any evidence here then thats it not race he shook his head maybe thats why i had to come here i want to get that son of a bitch off the street and i got motive to burn attitude like you wouldnt believe and no hard evidence at all flo was silent a moment then quietly and youre not sure hes a son of a bitch no im pretty sure hes that im just not certain he committed this particular murder but i dont know if i want to risk hardys life on it one way or the other glitskys wife stood up again and came around in front of him pulling his head into her chest is there anybody else who worries about doing the right thing as much as you do glitsky grunted i should just bring him in shouldnt i she kept him hugged close maybe a lot of people would he pulled away and looked up at her i cant flo i know she said stepping back now businesslike so given that what do you see here what i want to see he corrected her is okay the door maybe forced but some sign of cat and mouse ingraham trying to get away i mean look hes sitting here thinking baker is going to come and kill him then lo and behold baker shows what would you do the woman was naked he was on the bed could be they werent paying attention abe shook his head not if he thought someone was going to come and try to kill him nobody pays that little attention she smiled you have but he wasnt playing not in a situation like that i wouldnt how about this flo asked the whole night before hes been up worrying about it he lies down for a nap the woman is in the shower baker knocks open the door but its more a bump than any big noise ingraham rolls over but doesnt wake up the woman goes on with her shower thinking the barge just moved against a piling or something okay abe said okay so baker comes in and shoots ingraham in bed no doubt now the woman hears the shot and comes running out bam bam bam baker runs knocking over the lamp on the way out in the dark ingraham it turns out isnt dead yet he staggers out of bed and goes outside and over the side abe sighed to be washed away by the tide maybe why the neck brace i dont know what about the gun in the canal flo had no answer abe put his hands in his pocket and walked back to the open door the moon was higher its harvest quality gone now it was a bright silver coin above the bridge flos was a theory he at least hadnt independently arrived at and it was as plausible or implausible as any of the ten hed come up with and what really happened might be one of the ten or flos or something else altogether lots of people were good at theories what made a good cop was finding one with evidence to back it up ormorefinding evidence and going from there flo came up behind him putting her arms around him how bout dinner she asked its all bass ackwards he said i dont see anything i hoped to find here flo turned him around and put her hands up to his face closing his eyes with her thumbs just set it in that brain of yours what you see and feel now and itll click in when you need it if you need it he felt her up against him and closed his arms around her like you do when i need you yep she said just like that chapter nine sometimes when johnny laguardia was pounding into her like now doreen biaggi made herself think about the way it had started between them when she had thought he was such a nice sweet man she had been walking out of molinaris with some deli instead of a real dinner because she didnt have much money when some of the young north beach neighborhood boys started following her teasing her as they had always teased the nose doreen keeping her head down trying to walk faster crying to herself she was always nice to people why did they have to pick on her what you got there noseen some nose slaw maybe some nosadella ha ha ha snatching at her clothes making honking noises grabbing at her package of deli food and then there was this big man not too old chasing them away walking her home johnny she looked over her shoulder at him eyes closed now rocking back and forth taking his time embarrassed at her tears at her looks she wanted to just thank him and go upstairs to her studio apartment but he was so caring or seemed so then brushing away the tears with a gentle smudge of his thumb taking her out to little joesnow their placeto cheer her up opening up to him telling him that she hated herself her big schnozzola everything and him saying lying but nice it wasnt so bad but if she hated it why didnt she just get a nose job but where was a clerk at city lights bookstore going to get the money for a nose job it had been nothing but scrape scrape since graduation from high schoolthree years nowand it was enough of a struggle paying rent eating wearing decent clothes and so long as she looked this way shed never be able to get out of where she was going nowhere it was a catch he was speeding up now and she got into it a little leaning back into it maybe hurry him along she reached back between her legs and ran her fingernails along the bottom of his scrotum and he made that sound that meant it wouldnt be too long now he had made it sound so easy his friend mr tortoni could lend her the money for the surgery with her new looks she could get hired someplace that paid better then pay him back when she could until then there was only the vig to worry about and for her it would be nothing maybe a hundred goodfaith money a weekwhich at the time with johnny mr sincere laguardia selling her not only on the idea of the loan but on her natural beauty her chances for coming up in the world and glorious future had seemed like nothing it started seeming like something soon afterward the nose job had been a success and she now looked like a young sophia loren but she couldnt parlay that into a job that paid any better and after six weeks of buying nothing not even going out to a movie she couldnt come up with the vig and johnny who had been her friend and protector when she had been the nose had told her he could cover for her just up the vig on a couple of other clients but it was risky and he had to have some payment some sign of good faith but she didnt have anything hed put his hand on her right therethe first time anybody had touched her thereand said that that was worth more than a hundred a week then she was pulling away scared from that different johnnyand didnt even see the hand come up so hard she thought he had broken her faceand then he was on top of her and she remembered listening to him explaining afterward that she didnt have a choice somebody had to come up with the vig he didnt want her to be hurt and he could protect her he hadnt hit her because he was mad at her he wasnt mad at her but she needed to take a little reality check he was her friend oh oh jesus mary and joseph johnny laguardia said the litany every time he came collapsing he fell against her back his arms wrapped around her she felt his weight on her and she started to cry she would never be able to come up with the vig this was never going to end at franks extra espresso bar on vallejo umberto tozzi was on the jukebox singing ti amo sounding like an italian john lennon ti amo was angelo tortonis favorite song and whenever he was in the place he played it at least once an hour if anybody minded they didnt say but the flip side was that nobody else played the song anymore all the regulars the owner sal calcagno the waitresses everybody they were sick to death of ti amo it was a good song and for a long time it had been johnny laguardias favorite too now though as he came up off the sidewalk behind the grilled fence past the couples drinking their espresso or cappuccino or peroni beer or sirops he wasnt too thrilled to hear it because hearing it meant that the angel was there already and he wouldnt have time to ask one of the boys why hed been summoned down here again not that he should be too worried mr tortoni was his godfather but he was also his employer and certainly he was no one to get on the wrong side of and this thing last nighthaving to explain ingrahams disappearance being six hundred dollars shorthad not made him happy which johnny understood johnny wasnt happy himself he had never been short before but johnny thought he had explained it as always mr tortoni was sitting all alone at the back of the room back to the wall under the poster of the leaning tower at the small white table two of the other boys were playing pool and johnny nodded to them and then presented himself to mr tortoni who took a sip of espresso and then motioned for johnny to sit next to him can i get you something johnny the angel asked in italian it was amazing how quietly the man talked how small and frail he looked you didnt have to talk loud to get heard physical strength was a small part of having power these things mr tortoni had taught him johnny realized his throat was dry and he said he thought a mandarino sirop would be good and mr tortoni whispered up to sal calcagno at the counter and in two seconds johnnys drink was in front of him you wanted to see me mr tortoni put his cup down and fiddled for a moment with a short cigar which johnny lit for him as it got to his mouth youve been busy have you he asked through the smoke okay johnny said trying to so maybeno not maybe im sure its an oversight johnny waited mr tortoni smoked some more johnny took a drink of his sirop billiard balls clicked behind him ti amo was over and love will keep us together came on and mr tortoni made a motion to sal calcagno who walked to the jukebox and pushed the button in the back before toni tenille could finish saying you belong to me now bobby darin came on with volare and mr tortoni nodded smiling at sal then lost the smile and looked at johnny well whatever it is ill fix it johnny said you dont know it could be you forgot the excitement all last night this ingraham problem johnny nodded without a clue ingraham is five hundred dollars i get reminded todaybookkeepers you know they keep track of things johnny still didnt see it he was thinking five hundred mr tortoni put his hand over johnnys soft as a kitten doreen biaggi he said he went back to his coffee its a small thing johnny but then again it isnt ingraham was five doreen biaggi is one last night youre six short i think maybe youre nervous you got mixed up in spite of the sirop johnnys throat was sticking together when he swallowed how could he be so dumb he had tacked doreens vig onto ingrahams making up a bullshit story to rusty about mr tortonis interest rates going up to cover expenseshell johnny knew rusty would be able to come up with another hundred a week so johnny had gotten used to thinking of ingraham as a six so you collect from this doreen sure like always then you got the hundred her hundred johnny reached into his back pocket praying to every saint in heaven that he had an even hundred in his wallet you still nervous johnny is something wrong madonna mia a hundreddollar bill he took it out and put it on the table i dont want to disappoint you mr tortoni angelo tortoni palmed the bill and laid a hand softly against johnnys cheek as i say its not a big thing a hundred dollars but the principle of itam i right absolutely maybe get a book mr tortoni said keep track whos a six and whos a five and whos a one he puffed at his cigar that doreen biaggi shes got to be a pretty girl now with the nose fixed mr tortoni stared now at johnny making sure he got the message that nothing was a secret around here you know johnny he said quietly gently we all got our own businesses to run your line of work the temptations when youre working with cash no records i know what it can be like you figure old man tortonihe smiled noddingyeah im an old man thats okay you figure old man tortoni he just needs his five grand whatever it is every week and so long as you come up with that youre covering your end of the business but johnny that leaves out my side of the business you might thinkim not saying you do im just saying i know the temptations and it might cross your mindyou might think youll strongarm somebody for more than the vig i charge em cut somebody else maybe a girl huh a little slack johnny couldnt say a word mr tortoni was holding the thin cigar in his right hand the one nearest johnny and he put that hand over johnnys the wet butt end of the cigar flattening out against the back of johnnys hand i know you hear what im saying johnny i wouldnt do anything like that he managed to get out i put a man like you in a position of trust he represents my interests to the community a man betrays that trust i got no use for him lean closer to me johnny the hand still covered his gripping tightly i kiss you now and youre a dead man johnny swallowed trying to breathe mr tortonis mouth was inches from his cheek if this is going on he whispered it has to stop the strains of ti amo began again mr tortoni leaned back in his chair he took the flattened tip of the cigar into his mouth like a nipple and drew on it i love this song he said frannie wasnt sure it had been a good idea letting dismas stay here it was stirring things up earlier hed almost gone back to his own house suddenly worried that staying here was putting her in some danger he just wasnt thinking clearly there was no connection that could bring louis baker from hardys place to hers and she had told him that he was safer here and he was staying and that was final now closing in on midnight she lay in the kingsize bed dismas out at the kitchen table probably staring out at the street as hed done in every minute of his spare time since hed been here watching to see if louis baker would show up it wasnt like diz just sitting there brooding with that damn gun out on the table drinking decaffeinated coffee and waiting for abe glitsky to call him which didnt seem like it was going to happen tonight dismas had come in around sixthirty from his day of touring gun shops excited that hed proved something rusty ingraham had indeed put in an order for a gun on wednesday afternoon at a place called taylors in the tenderloin district hed needed the gun as protection against baker also louis baker had evidently come by the shamrock looking for hardy so he had placed a call to his friend glitsky and thought with the new information glitsky would have enough at least to take baker off the streets frannie hadnt really understood so what if ingraham ordered a gun how does that help you well abes problem here seems to be rusty as much as anything else since they havent found his body he is somehow not as real a victim as maxine weir well maybe hes not hardy had shaken his head you had to have seen him the man was terrified but that doesnt mean hes dead does it hed looked out then at the darkening street perhaps trying to phrase it for himself no not necessarily but abe seems to need a reason to want to go after baker his threat to me isnt enough i guess and abe doesnt see any necessary connection between maxine weir and baker maybe she was just there and got in the way right anyway what i have to do is show abe some hard evidence that rustys fear of louis was legitimate that it wasnt say rusty who killed maxine motive unknown excuse me for being dumb but how does the gun show that doesnt it lead you to the conclusion that rusty didnt own a gun or even have access to a gun shed thought a minute i guess it would of course it would if he already had a gun he wouldnt have had to order one but why will that make your friend glitsky do something about louis baker abe is my friend and louis baker is going to kill me unless abe does something firstor i do what im trying to do is get abe to look at this with his cops eyes i think he sees the baker angle now as his friends understandable fear without hard evidence interfering with his real job which is finding the killer of a known victim maxine weir im trying to make it clear that what abe would call my paranoia is at least based on something real which also improves the odds that rusty ingraham is a real victim too but the call from abe hadnt come and frannie and dismas had done the dishes and watched some television and dismas had had a couple of beers before losing his patience altogether and beginning his vigil at the kitchen window now she heard him moving out there then a noise like the rustling of newspaper she turned onto her side of the bed her husband eddie had been dead for four months now there was a hole there she would never fill but she had been getting used to the idea of living alone of having the baby alone of making a new life somehow alone dismas was making her think again about eddie or he reminded her of eddie the way eddie had reminded her of dismas when she first met him she told herself it was one of the hormone storms that had been so difficult in the first trimester but she knew it wasnt just that dismas had inserted himself into her life and she had welcomed it and now even little things like doing the dishes and pouring him coffee made her shudder to think that this too would end and then she would be alone again no it wasnt just that since eddies death she had become acutely aware of mortality she was trying to get over it this feeling that everything was on its way to dying right now and with dismas it wasnt a theoryit was a good possibility he believed that his life was in danger he was no paranoid she believed it too and if dismas were gone like eddie already was all the potentiality that might be over the rest of their lives would be gone too when the telephone rang she rolled over again dismas picked it up on the first ring and she heard him talking too low to make out the words it must be abe glitsky she thought the call didnt last long the receiver was slammed down loudly followed by a little ring of protest she looked at her bedside clock glad she didnt have to get up for work tomorrow more rustling of newspaper leaning up against the doorway to the kitchen barefoot with her flannel robe around her her heart went out to dismas he sat huddled over the table the newspaper spread out under him his head in his hands she crossed the kitchen and put her hands on his shoulders rubbing it was abe he said i guessed that no not just on the phone it was abe at the shamrock today not baker he said he guessed all us black folks look the same thats not fair he should have just told moses who he was why would he he was looking for me he knew i was supposed to be working there it wasnt official business so he asks moses says im not there doing me a favor and abe leaves natural as can be he breathed out heavily so now he really thinks im seeing louis baker in my dreams which i am he didnt even want to hear about the damn gun she pushed in at the muscles on both sides of his backbone dismas leaned back into the pressure whats the paper for she asked tide tables you going fishing in a way then that feels good as he crossed his arms on the table and put his head down on them she continued rubbing his back kneading at his neck knuckling the knots under his shoulder blades the softer muscles lower down his breathing slowed became regular she leaned over him and put her mouth by his ear why dont you get some sleep now slowly he straightened up in the chair lifted the gun checked the safety stood good idea he said then turned toward her you think you could spare a hug she put her arms up around him and they stood there holding one another you be careful dismas she said into his chest im not about to lose two men i love in the same year it had been a warm moonlit night all the students back in town long enough now to know where they could go get some rock and be ready to party money flowing like water early in the year when all the moms and dads send em off to school with their lunches packed upmoney for books for movies for food money didos roll was thick in his pocket his throat still hurt where louis baker had hit him but hed take care of that later now he was doing his business he was mostly selling twenty bagsfour rocks he could do hundreds but most of these kids tonight seemed to be into the quickflash onetime tryitoutandparty thing later in the year there might be fewer buyers but those that bought would do more hundreds so it worked out try the crack for a party and pretty soon you couldnt have a party without it lace or jumpup would be there when the cars stopped asking if there was any stuff they were both good at sniffing the heat but even so you didnt let them hold any product you never knew some plainclothes might get clever and not drive a cityissued pontiac no how you keep control was you held the product yourself and the money walking one end of the cut to the other it wasnt smart to let a line form dido smiled at the image maybe hed open a driveaway stand it was late now the night pretty much over he stood in the shadow by louis bakers place and watched as the collegeboy customer walked back and got into his car he heard the girls giggling in the back seat the car took off spitting out tiny rocks and asphalt behind it lace came up beside him maybe we call it tonight dido said his voice still sounding odd croaking he looked at bakers wall painted over white again that man would have to be dealt with it had been a good night and would have been perfect but for the fight he took the roll of bills from his pocket and peeled off two for lace nodding in the direction of bakers wall man thinks he beat me but whos working the cut he said lace wasnt saying anything what dido asked i dont hear you what you want me to say i asked whos working the cut he didnt wait for lace to respond you dont think i got it you let me know you got it lace said you think that homeboy got me worried dido picked up a stray length of twobyfour and walked over to bakers new side window a black shining rectangle in the white wall heres how much he scares me he swung the board the sound of breaking window echoed down the cut and before the echo had died down dido was walking back to the other end to meet jumpup lace walked alongside looking back over his shoulder toward louis bakers place waiting for the door to open and louis baker to come charging out a few cars passed on the street but they didnt look to be more customers none had stopped by the time they got to jumpup who was sitting on the curb waiting lets take it in dido said and handed jumpup his couple of bills the three of them started walking back where they had been making one more pass at the cut seeing it was secure as they passed the first building someone called out didos name they all stopped staring into the blackness you keep walking dido said to the two boys he took a step or two toward the shadows figuring it might be someone from another cut seeing them going in wanting to buy the last of his stash the first booming shot took dido in the stomach and lace saw him back up a step he grunted and said hey the second shot knocked him over onto his back on the ground he didnt say anything after that mama mama get up there was one light on in the front room maybe sixty watts under a yellow shade on a pitted end table next to the couch but with the blinds pulled it shouldnt draw any attention outside mama was dressed but she wasnt moving a bottle of sherry lay on its side on the floor beside the couch something hurt on louis bakers hand and he realized that in shaking her he had picked up a piece of glass from the shards that had rained down on her and if she hadnt even stirred when the window broke right over where she was passed out it wasnt likely he was going to have much luck getting her up now but he had to get out of here and she had a car with keys first the breaking window then the shots had awakened the whole project now baker could hear people gathering outside a few calling out trying to do something about dido nothing anybody was going to be able to do for dido ever again mama groaned and shifted on the couch he tried shaking her hard one more time but she was out mama pieces of glass fell from the back of the couch onto her louis baker sat back on his heels and his face relaxed he had not even glanced at the end table and there the keys were where they had been dropped outside he took a last look at the crowd that had now formed around where dido lay in the distance he heard a siren he walked up the street looking straight ahead he found mamas tiny old dodge colt and squeezed himself into the seat behind the wheel the radio came on with the motor and he heard james brown singing papas got a brand new bag he left it playing turning up past the park where hed been working out leaving all of this behind for good chapter ten okay youve given me your phone number now how about your address what time is it hardy asked into the phone must be the crack of sixthirty thereabouts frannie came and stood rubbing her eyes like a little kid in the kitchen doorway who is it she asked its glitsky then into the phone no i know its you what i need your address glitsky said i thought id stop by pick you up we go for a drive over to holly park where somebody who had a fight last night with louis baker got himself shot a little later you interested hardy gave him the address glitsky had shamed hardy into leaving his gun back at frannies saying that between him and marcel lanier and whatever other police personnel were on the scene they would probably have enough firepower to stop louis baker if he jumped out from behind some tree or crawled from under some rock and tried to blow hardy away they pulled in and parked behind an ambulance the cut was populated by a few men in uniform and a small knot of officiallooking people who seemed to be just getting around to moving the body glitsky and hardy walked up and glitsky nodded to the men pushing the gurney and lifted the covering a man in jeans and a giants jacket appeared beside them hey abe glitsky nodded introducing hardy to marcel lanier something hang up the techs he looked at his watch six hours and the bodys still here lanier shrugged lightning response this part of town howd you get the call youre days lanier hunched his shoulders guilt got to me all that golf last week i just got so far behind on stuff i thought id hang in and pull some paper this came in and i remembered youd been coming out here yesterday hey did you hear about this rooster huge fucking rooster with not now marcel what went down here bad long night lanier said talking to these people is like pulling teeth glitsky nodded at the gurney looks like this guys night was worse marcel took in hardy so why are we having visiting day glitsky explained the connection see thats why i called him lanier said to hardy i knew hed been out here figured it might be connected i didnt think youd talked to baker hardy said to glitsky i can be a surprising guy following up thats all you should have brought him in baker i mean lanier said glitsky pulled at where the scar ran through his bottom lip i would have except there was the technicality of charging him with something the word murder comes to mind hardy said glitsky just looked at hardy then spoke to lanier how do you know baker killed this guy whats his name anyway lanier consulted a little white pad with a spiral on the top jackson jefferson grant street name of dido wonder why his mother left out lincoln he furrowed his brow probably his brother he said lincoln washington roosevelt grant glitsky sighed with feeling can we get back to why you think baker did grant lanier put his hands in his pockets and said to hardy that glitsky wasnt much fun lately then he went into it baker comes back to the project two days ago right away gets in a beef over painting his placehe pointedover there the beef continues over the next day and last night baker and dido duke it out right here in the cut witnessed by about fifty citizens three of whom volunteered the information then last night maybe five minutes before he gets it dido breaks bakers side window i figure what happened is it woke up baker he said thats enough came out blew him away then ran for it did anybody see him when during the shooting did anybody see baker shoot this guy lanier looked at the sky the shots came from off the cut in the dark people saw him a minute or two later thats close enough for me i guess that is close enough glitsky said sarcastic this is one bad dude abe hes out of prison three days and hes already killed two folks three hardy said this guy maxine and rusty glitsky felt his patience going again we dont know about rusty we dont even know if rustys dead or not and we dont know he killed maxine either and we dont know for sure whether he killed grant here and we still dont know hes trying to kill you diz he killed dido lanier said you can take that to the bank hardy shook his head its funny abe how i know all that stuff and you dont abes in a bad mood lately lanier said it colors his judgment they were walking down the cut toward bakers place you find the gun glitsky asked nope whats the problem there just that its traditional to try and find something tying a murderer to the crime lanier and hardy exchanged glances look abe if you want to take this thing in another direction ill give you the case but for no overtime and no support they get what they pay for this guy baker is a righteous badass he stole his own mamas car after killing dido and ive got plenty to bring him in on am i right or not glitsky stopped walking and stared around at the scarred buildings the boarded windows the grassless bottlestrewn cut he couldnt confuse what might have happened on rusty ingrahams barge with the shit that had obviously gone down here between louis baker and the late dido grant youre right he said fuckina i am lanier said since they were here glitsky thought he might as well try and find out what time louis baker had gotten in on wednesday night cover all the bases maybe they were right maybe he was forgetting to think like a cop foreign turf it made louis baker nervous there hadnt been much sleeping he had known where he was going when he got into the car up to the fillmore aint nobody going to notice a black man in the mo least any particular one one youd attach a name to hed pulled up behind the baptist tabernacle church and let the car keep running for the heat until the sun started to come up it wouldnt do to leave the car out on the street the man didnt really check plates as a matter of course but the way his luck had been running he didnt want to put out any invitations just sitting in the car in the big lot was enough so as soon as it was light he had to leave it hed been hungry but the first thing was to get some protectiona knife a gun something a gun would be best he wasnt going to have the man after him again taking him down without some kind of fight hed waited too long to get out and he wasnt going back hed take somebody with him or do himself first cause back in the house wasnt living it wasnt even surviving it was just time there was something clean about knowing now for sure that the man was on his ass again it restored things to how theyd always been when that one yesterdaythe colored manhad come out to the project to his place and talked to him it was just warming up hed heard about that in the house how they would do that come at you the first day or so keep you off balance get you back in for something as soon as they could think of it well there wasnt any doubt now with dido dead they got everything they wanted handed to them on a platter it was just as well what he and the warden had talked about maybe going straight had gone bad right at the bus station ingraham the sun was up enough now better get out and moving ingrahams image up in his mind before him that honky igotityouneverwill smile he closed the car door quietly and made his way along the cyclone fence up toward the brick church allowing himself a smile now who was dead not him laugh that one away counselor but then hardy wasnt dead was he and he louis baker was on the run again this time for killing dido ingraham whoever else they wanted to think of no doubt about that he was set up real good and hardys face came up and pushed ingrahams aside hardy still alive walking around enjoying his freedom was that right was that justice he knew it was all the justice he was ever going to see he turned out of the lot onto fillmore street hands in his pockets he knew a store here around the corner sold guns a gun would be the thing he couldnt buy it of course but getting into places had never been a problem for louis baker they were in the car driving back to frannies glitsky had asked hardy over to his house for a barbecue the next afternoon their first social engagement since the old days at holly park glitsky had said a badly hungover mama hadnt seemed to understand a great deal of what glitsky had asked her about louis baker but she did say enough to leave him wide open as a suspect on wednesday night he had arrived at the project sometime after dark she couldnt be sure of the time but after dark meant at least eight hed been released from san quentin at two pm and it was less than an hours bus ride from there to san francisco hed told her he had stayed downtown to take care of some business what business could he have had downtown maam abe had asked if hed been locked up for about nine years she hadnt known the answer to that hardy sitting in the room listening while lanier and glitsky talked believed he damn well knew the answer and said so to abe as they were driving to frannies yeah well you know glitsky said squinting against the morning sun as he swung east on up toward its not as if i cant believe baker killed these people but its my job to get the evidence to prove he did theres a difference well its my job to stay alive and we both know the guys a killer you can agree he killed at least one of these people maybe come on abe you dont see that glitsky tightened his hands on the steering wheel diz what i see is the famous usual suspect face it the guys a black excon and we all know the recidivism rate is like a hundred and two percent hes got no family and no oh spare me glitsky held up a hand im not saying i feel sorry for him im looking at facts hes a shithook okay no job no chance of getting one so hes going to go wrong again if only because thats what he does its how he knows to get by if anything if he gets accused of any other murders where he happens to be in the neighborhood ill be tempted to think hes less likely just hardcore unlucky yeah well if the murder happens to be me do me a favor check him out the car swung west again and they exited the freeway at felllaguna you know diz if i didnt have such a good suspect in maxines husband id think about baker more i dont even have baker at the barge was her husband there weir no not yet pretty compelling next thing youll be questioning hector medina whos hector medina hardy ran down medinas connection to ingraham the recent contact glitsky thought about it turning down divisadero heading over to frannies he shook his head you want to get back to basics i got the same problem with him that i have with baker hardy knew what was coming rusty ingrahams body where is it its only been two days three he might have just run away hes not even a missing person yet i think weir may have killed her and shot ingraham maybe left him for dead and now lying low so why hasnt he called me we had this deal remember its what started the whole thing have you checked your messages ive called in five or six times most recently after you got me up this morning well ill give you thati think he would have called you thank you but then why dont we have a body we dragged the canal it must have floated out did you check for that i wouldnt even know how to our resources especially lately are a little limited you saw how quick they got dido off to the morgue anyway the tide at china basin doesnt seem strong enough and i was there last night paying attention what if i show you it is strong enough then your case for rusty being dead gets better it gets closer to something i can look into more officially anyway laniers got an allpointsout for baker they pulled up in front of frannies i still worry about one thing though hardy said whats that old louis is still out walking around and i believe hes killed everybody hes wanted to in the past couple of days except for one special dude he slammed the door and stuck his head back through the window me chapter eleven hardy lay on a blanket looking at the clear blue sky his head on frannies lap a friend of hers cindy something was finished singing an old jackson browne song about just packing up your sorrows leaving them on the curb and the trashman hed just haul them away i wish hardy said oh stop frannie cuffed him on the side of the head how many days like this do we get and you just wont let yourself enjoy it that was great cindy in spite of old sour face here hey i loved the song hardy sat up the holster felt plain silly under his arm but he was not about to go out to a public place like golden gate park and risk running into so in spite of the warmth of the day over his shirt he wore an old blueandwhite yosemite windbreaker that had belonged to frannies late husband eddie thats all you can do with troubles cindy said just let them go whats gonna be is gonna be about as comforting as it was original it shouldnt be so bad frannie said look where we are right now which was in the shakespeare garden in the park the three of them sitting on a blanket littered now with the remains of the lunch cindy had brought over for frannie she had friends who kept doing nice things for her she was that kind of person hardy knew he and cindy had split a couple of sips of chianti out of a straw bottle but frannie was sticking to her noalcohol pregnancy regime a light breeze blew high in the trees over them cindy strummed some other chords on her guitar hardy thought cindy was cute nice but no frannie not close most of the other people frannies age struck him as way younger than he was which of course was true but in frannies case he never thought about it cindy with her turnedup little nose and her guitar playing seemed more a contemporary of the teenagers who were playing frisbee out across the lawn than a twentyfiveyearold woman hardy leaned back down on frannies lap youre right he said look where we are cindy played another song and hardy drowsy closed his eyes he felt frannie put her hand on his chest where the yosemite logo was probably thinking about eddie he pushed that out of his mind he was here and cindy was right never mind originality que sera sera hardy thought but it meant something different for him no doubt cindy maybe frannie too thought jackson browne was an oldiehow about patience and prudence doing que sera sera on the hit parade hardy had only been four or so but he remembered that when he opened his eyes cindy had gone the frisbee game had stopped the breeze had died down hi frannie said did i sleep about an hour whered cindy go back home she says goodbye she put both her hands under his head and lifted you want to get up im a little stiff you couldve woken me you know frannie stood and stretched her back i dont think youve been getting very good sleep these past few nights couldnt hurt to catch up a little i cant believe it i never do that frannie shrugged gathering up the blanket well you did i hope i didnt hurt cindys feelings she liked you a lot why what did i do fall asleep kvetch about her songs frannie stopped her picking up and faced him dismas you are yourself no games you do what you do not trying to make any impression its just who you are and i think youre great you should know that okay and now youre embarrassed hardy leaned back against a tree frannies eyes were bright green under her shining red hair although looking at her no one would have concluded that she was pregnant she had filled out so that hardy could hardly see the frail girl hed caught when she fainted at eddies graveside youre the one he said im very proud of you she knew what he was talking about her eyes seemed to shine with the threat of tears but she held them back scrunching her nose up and forcing a smile she walked up to him put her arms around him and hugged him hard you go and pack your sorrows she said trashman comes tomorrow he felt something turn over inside of him he looked out through the trees trying to decide what it was a body well something very close to a body thats dead yeah pico morales shook his head pico was the curator of the steinhart aquarium also located in golden gate park and hardy had dropped frannie off at the japanese tea gardens and gone over to see his friend who worked every day but sunday they stood now in the glow behind the tanks in the tropical fish section in the tanks fluorescent reds and blues and yellows and greens floated against the glass or darted from rock to rock on the other side a steady stream of people filed by hypnotized i dont have any ideas pico said come on peek seawater is your life but bodies arent they moved down a couple of tanks what i need is just something that would act like a human body in seawater that would float the way a body would a rubber mat something like that i dont know wouldnt something like that on the surface catch some wind and that would affect it pico made a note on a clipboard attached to one of the tanks what do you see hardy asked both of the men were squinting into the tank that angel fish see under its eye that little spot it bears watching is all weve been getting these cancers lately maybe fungus i dont know what it is were analyzing our tropical water you have different water pico straightened up youre the one who said it seawater is my life it might be anything secondgeneration problems if we got a goddamn cyanide batch who knows cyanide pico was moving to the next tanks the tropical hunters diz he said a lot of them use cyanide over the reefs but doesnt cyanide kill the fish it does breaks my heart another hundred years we might not even have any reefs left im not kidding the cyanide kills the coral too buthe held up a fingerbut a few of the hardier little devils make it and they fetch a small fortune which is why it keeps getting done and you buy your fish from these guys pico looked at him you think wed support that shit we are very picky about our suppliers but some fish get through the cracks at least maybe they do we see some pinkeye in an angel fish it makes me wonder they came out to the room hardy was most familiar with just off picos office a huge circular concrete tank sat four feet off the floor threequarters filled with seawater in that tank hardy pico and a small group of other volunteers had spent many hours walking around with great white sharks a great white shark cant breathe if it isnt moving through water and these giants had almost always been hauled in traumatized near to death from being caught and taken on fishing boats every one had eventually died but it remained picos dream to have the first great white shark in captivity in his aquarium the two men pulled themselves up and sat on the concrete lip of the pool pico took a cigarette from his shirt pocket and lit up but bodies he said you know what a human body is essentially its a big bag of seawater i think its your poetic side i love the best hardy said its true chemically its like ninetyseven percent the same thing okay so a body floating in seawater would be like part of the water fresh water depending on air in the lungs and how much the tissue had become waterlogged or whatever the body would move up or down but in salt water the specific densities are so close it would always float you could spray dye on the water and watch where it goes and thatd tell you the same thing hardy kicked his feet against the concrete nope same thing as a rubber raft where the wind or a passing boat might change the course its got to float but not on the surface pico said aha and jumped down onto the floor what hardy followed him into his office pico reached behind the door and pulled down one of the wetsuits that hung there they were always therethe volunteers used them when they walked the sharks the closest thing to a body is a body put this on go and hang in the water and see where it takes you how did things get so complicated glitsky was thinking he was driving south on past candlestick park on his way out of the city and out of his jurisdiction to interview an excop with only the slightest connection to any active case he shook his head flo was righthe cared too much he had to turn over every rock to make as sure as he could he at least didnt get the wrong man one of his first cases haroun palavi in the country about seven months importing rugs from iran had killed his wife and the inlaws living with them neighbors had heard them all screaming at one another for weeks when glitsky questioned haroun he had no alibihed been in his warehouse working alone there were no other plausible suspects harouns fingerprints were all over the murder weapon which hed tried to explain by saying that hed come in and just picked up the gun hed found near his wifes parents he was scared he thought the killer might still be around so glitsky had arrested haroun hed investigated and found that one of the neighbors another iranian woman had talked a lot to harouns wife and found out that she was miserable in this country and wanted to go home haroun was ruining her life and her parents lives at the time glitsky had thought that shed probably just nagged haroun until she pushed him over the edge he didnt understand these iranians anyway but he did know or thought he knew that they had this eyeforaneye mentality and seemed in general to hold life pretty cheap haroun hadnt done a very good job of learning english either so haroun had gone to trial and was found guilty and sentenced to fifteentolife seconddegree murder plus two for the gun of which he served three days before they found him with a crushed skull and a broken neck on the floor of his cell it was an effective way to kill yourself glitsky thought diving headfirst from your upper bunk onto cement although most people lacked either the nerve or the imagination for it and that would have been the end of the case except that about two months later the iranian neighbor woman turned up dead too and it finally transpired that harouns business partner revi mahnis couldnt take a womans no for an answer under questioning he revealed that harouns wife had threatened to tell haroun that hed been propositioning her so hed had to kill her or be humiliated and out of business both and because her parents were there he had to kill them too it had been glitskys darkest moment on the force knowing that his preconceptions and prejudices had killed an innocent man he wasnt about to let it happen again he took the san bruno turnoff and doubled back on the frontage road looking for a street name it was a lightindustry and duplex neighborhood wedged between the freeway and el camino real he didnt want to be hasty in jumping to a conclusion about who had murdered maxine but it still bothered him coming down here because the lab was backed up and hardy had said that hector medina had a possible connection to rusty ingraham it was a reach here hed got a righteous murder victim and if you looked at the statistics the best suspectan estranged husband if he was writing a book on murders hed start with the chapter on families after that the book would get thin pretty quick but the lab still didnt have squat on the results of picking apart ingrahams barge so he still couldnt place ray weir at the scene he was pretty sure theyd find something that did that and when they did hed go down and bring ray in not exactly openandshut but just about as close as they came as for rusty ingraham abe wanted to believe that he was hiding out from the jealous husband ray weir but he had to admit hardys point that he would have at least gotten in touch made some sense of course until there was either a body or some compelling reason why there wasnt one rusty remained officially alive and more to the point not a homicide victim and if he wasnt a homicide victim he wasnt glitskys business life was complicated enough hed gotten medinas number from the telephone book and called down for an appointment so the faggot told huh glitsky hadnt known what he was talking about i wanted to see you about rusty ingraham a laugh that too all the roosters home to roost well come on down i got nothing to hide there were cars parked on lawns all down the street oil smears on driveways bottle caps beer cans and broken glass in the curbs it was a hot still gassmelling afternoon the four trees on the street had lost their leaves an abandoned yellow schoolbus with broken windows sat on its rims at the corner the sky seemed to hang low a hazy bluewhite medina was wearing a dirty white tanktop tshirt over baggy khakis washing his car in his front yard with a teenage girl the onestory frame house had once been painted lime green with yellow trim colors from a decade before once perhaps brightly gay now faded to garish as glitsky got out of his car medina began drying his hands on a chamois the girl didnt even look upjust kept wiping at the front windshield with a soapy sponge medina crossed the small yard and met glitsky near his car by the curb id rather we didnt say anything in front of melanie he said he didnt offer to shake hands glitsky leaned against his cars hood you got me stumped he said medina squat and flatfooted turned the chamois over in his hands you dont have to play games with me i used to be a cop sure i remember you i understand you got a raw deal what kind of games might i be playing good guy bad guy glitsky spun around from his waist exaggerating somebody else here i dont see the girl called daddy i need more soap he turned to her in the bucket sweets just go to the bucket he came back to glitsky my daughter shes not all here glitsky watched her go to the bucket and squeeze out her sponge then come back to the car he took a breath and let it out why im here is because you talked to a friend of mine dismas hardy and said youd had something to do with rusty ingraham in the last couple of weeks ingrahams missing and i wondered if you might have a lead on it if he said anything to you about where he might go medina shook his head as if clearing it hardy said ingraham was dead hardy jumps to conclusions something went down where he lives we found some blood matches his type but no body he could be alive anywhere shit medina said shit what shit hes not dead thats what well he might be we just dont know but either way if you talked to him i didnt i told your friend i didnt he said youd called him medina shifted on his feet stared out over glitskys shoulder abe waited him out medina turned around and said his daughters name melanie she stopped cleaning the windshield obedient you wanna get us a couple beers he motioned with his head and went to sit in the shade of the cement steps by the front door glitsky followed glad to get out of the heat when melanie came out medina patted next to him and she sat down he popped the tab on a can of lucky lager and handed it to glitsky did one for himself giving melanie a little sip first i never talked to him you can believe me or not i dont care glitsky drank beer i did call him but i just hung up what was the point what was i gonna say that would make any difference after all this time okay glitsky didnt know where he was going i mean ingraham was the wrong target if i wanted to do something not feel so goddamnhe stopped searching for the right wordimpotent theres better fish to fry at abes lack of response he said im talking about treadwell whos treadwell treadwell the faggot whos trying to set up valenti and raines treadwell glitsky repeated is there a connection here im missing medina wiped some sweat off his forehead with the chamois the thing with ingraham what he did to me thats done now i do my job take care of melanie best i can i mean since joan left after the the trouble its been all me and this this anger is in me all the time the aluminum can made a cracking sound in his hand so for a minute there i had a notion to go settle things with ingraham thats all it was the call so what about treadwell medinas eyes narrowed to a squint as he brought the beer can up to his mouth stalling nothing he said treadwell was nothing too hector abe said you brought up treadwell i didnt medina squeezed the can again studied it i figured if i talked to treadwell it might do some good for those cops valenti and raines ingraham it was long past the time it could mean anything so you talked to treadwell yeah about raines and valenti he nodded tried to talk him out of it of his charges of police brutality gaybashing and and nothing medina said nothing he listened to me about what its like being accused of something crazy how you never get out from under it then he said fuck you goodbye glitsky looked at melanie watched a kid ride by on a skateboard tried to figure what he was missing here so why were you afraid treadwell had talked when i called you you said so the faggot told remember what did that mean i dont know i guess i been afraid hed accuse me of something againtrespass i dont know something its his style and im the right guy to do it to people are lined up to believe bad shit about me glitsky gave it a moment finishing his beer but nothing about ingraham i never said a word to him and thats gods truth glitsky stood up stretched out his back you know hector he said youve been in this business so you know theres a feeling you get when people arent telling you everything they may not be lying exactly but theres something else happening i never talked to him melanie jumped next to her father he patted her leg and she leaned into him staring now at glitsky thats what you said for the record though do you remember where you were wednesday night three days ago medina didnt even have to think knew right off i worked a double shift that day eight to four four to midnight its in the log glitsky nodded im sure it is medina patted his daughter again this time on the head lets do the tires next honey he said she jumped up and ran over to the bucket look i got this kid to raise thats what i do i lead a quiet life keep out of trouble but you went to treadwells medina looked up at the white sky and drained his beer hey sometimes you gotta do something for your soul he gestured around the hopeless plot you think this is enough abe took it in nodded and thanked hector for his time back on the freeway glitsky opened his car windows and let the wind blow over him hector medina talking about the good of his soul rang as true as exinterior secretary watt claiming a deep and abiding concern for the environment and if talking to treadwell was good for his soul worth threatening the quiet life he had with his daughter how much more satisfying would it be to have aced rusty ingraham now that would have been real good for the soul of course the log said he had worked a double shift on wednesday so he had an alibi but alibis were made to be broken his name might be in the log but glitsky wondered if anybody had actually seen him and even if they had it wasnt a far stretch to imagine that a guy like medina knew people who did bad thingseither returning favors or for cash up front so now he had two out of three suspects with a reason to dust ingraham if only he could count on the fact of rustys death and maybe hardy would find something he guessed it all came down to the lab if there were prints or hairs or fibers on the barge that belonged to ray weir hed have probable cause and go get the guy on the other hand what if they found evidence that baker or medina had been there then even without a body glitsky had to admit that things started to look bad for rusty ingraham and maybe for hardy too when he had been released from prison louis baker was given his two hundred dollars gate money buying the paint for mamas place the windows some food had run him all told and hed given the mama a ten for the tennis shoes the bus ride home this and that had come to another ten give or take some change and breakfast this morning had been three and a half so he was down to fifteen bucks and no place to stay and still no gun it was different than it had been before he was sent down every pawnshop had bars on the windows now he could see the thin tape around all the doors and windows with the alarm tripwires and although hed always been able to pick a lock he had never really been much of a b and e man the technology made him cautious but the fact was he needed money and he needed a weapon he was not about to be brought back in even for questioning if they tried to take him back down hed take some of them with him he was thinking about the wardens about ingraham about hardy about all the people whod done it to him there might even be something fun about shooting it out going out in a blaze quick and easy and it sure wasnt shaping up that he was going to have much of a life on the outside it was a small liquor store hed been watching the traffic for about two hours a small steady trickle of people in and out there had been bars up across the windows before it opened but now they were tucked back accordionstyle on both sides of the front door louis walked in out of the afternoon sunshine he was pretty sure when hed been outside but once he was inside he was positive the location was right a white guy running a liquor store in this neighborhood ought to have a gun under the counter but you couldnt always bet on it but when you saw the national rifle association calendar over the cold cabinets you could start putting your money down he came in the door saw the counter ran along the wall to his right about fifteen feet the man was in his midfifties he sat on a stool behind the register and louis nodded at him friendly as you please as he came in hed made sure the place was empty but he hadnt gotten five feet inside the door when a police car pulled up out front and a guy in blue got out shit louis walked casually to the back left corner of the store what he wanted was something long and relatively heavy the cop went to the back opened one of the cold shelves and stood looking at soft drinks you didnt want to start with the cop especially with his partner out in the car a lone guy you could maybe get him from behind put him down but if he did that here the proprietor would probably shoot him and if he didnt the partner would louis kept scanning the shelves as though he were looking for something thinking cmon cmon cmon finally the cop found his up or whatever cops drank and was at the counter he had to stall a minute or two but he couldnt take very much longer without getting somebody suspicious he reached into his pocket and made a pretense of counting his money showing he already had money that was a good idea counting to see if he had enough to buy that special bottle of something he heard the register ring okay it was time he reached up to the top shelf and took down a bottle of galliano it was made for this kind of work but the cops were still there parked right at the curb louis looked right at them bright out there he said the man turned his head and squinted a little the cop in the passenger seat was lifting the can to his mouth louis saw a display of sunglasses at the other end of the counter come on he kept thinking drive the man behind the counter had taken the bottle and was ringing it up louis put on a pair of shades looking at himself in the mirror above the display the cop was saying something to his partner laughing goddamn move that all the proprietor said louis left the pair of glasses on reaching into his pocket for his money the car outside made a clunk noise dropping into gear and louis smiled i think the shades too the man had put the bottle into a paper bag and louis threw some bills on the counter picking up the bottle the man leaned forward to pick up the money i dont think this is was as far as he got before louis swung hitting him over the left ear before the man hit the ground louis had vaulted over the counter a snubnose revolver hung by its trigger guard from a nail under the counter there was a box of cartridges next to it on the shelf louis put the gun and the cartridges into his pants pocket jabbed at the register until it opened and took out all the bills he lifted the tray and found two hundreds and five fifties he put a foot against the mans head on the floor and gave it a nudge he was out cold and would not be waking up in the next thirty seconds which was all louis needed he jumped back over the counter and stood at the door looking both ways there was no one within fifty yards so he walked outside hands in his pockets and turned right at the corner he turned again heading back up toward fillmore and mamas car if they were going to nail him for a couple of murders a little candyass liquorstore boost wasnt going to have much effect on his sentencing either way and it evened out the odds which was what you needed to survivea little edge that and knowing who to take out next are you kidding me abe glitsky was saying are you kidding me the tech a young filipino maybe twentysix seemed to shrivel back into himself these were my orders sir abe put his hand to his head and pulled at his hairline he took a step backward spun around in a full circle trying to get a grip and came back to the counter look son im sorry i dont mean to take it out on you but i have a murder investigation im running my ass all over town trying to complete and i need your reports yes but were told to we have an inventory of nearly eighty objects from the chiefs office that we are to give first priority over a murder scene the chief wants the chickenshitters apprehended over a murderer i dont believe it yes sir the boy said does rigby think whoever did this was dumb enough to leave prints around you think cops might think of that yes sir abe put both hands on the counter and pressed down on the wall behind the boy was a poster of a laughing man saying you want it when another one next to the first said what part of no dont you understand ha ha suddenly he let up his pressure on his hands untensed his shoulders and without another word turned and walked through the door slapping the wall on his way out it was clear what he had to do he had to stop fighting the system here it was what it was and you were either a part of it or you werent for a long time hed been a part of it now hed just spent a saturday trying to do things right because he cared about doing his job he could accept not getting paid for his time could accept laniers easyout attitude with louis baker might have even accepted a lab refusing to work overtime and having him wait until monday but what he couldnt handle was that the chief of police was using the crime lab on a priority basis to catch a couple of pranksters whod put some chickens in his office downstairs at his desk glitsky opened his top drawer and took out the application hed filled out for the lapd he sat down read it over signed it and addressed an envelope on his way out he dropped it in the mailbox by the back door of the hall hanging in the water motionless the tide pushing him where it would hardy thought hed give it a couple of tankfuls worth of airmaybe fortyfive minutesand see where he was when he came up still reluctant to go back to his house and not wanting to overstay his welcome at frannieswas that really ithe had borrowed one of picos wetsuits rented the tanks bought a mask and dropped into the water off ingrahams barge at a little after six oclock when the tide was already running out it was a feeble current at this point but it was moving him and hardy thought it would be strong enough if rusty had been in bed when he was shot it was reasonable to think he hadnt been wearing much that would weigh him down so he would simply float out just under the surface as hardy was doing now he started immediately moving out toward the bay which was good for his theory about what had happened to rusty he had thought there was some chance hard by the barge that the tide would create an eddy and he would go around in circles but he had swum to the point he thought rusty had gone over and then let himself hang in the water and after a couple of false starts when he was nudged back into the barge he found himself out in the channel even with the face mask visibility was very poor perhaps two feet under the water there was only the sound of his breathing he wore gloves and foot pockets without fins the same material as his wetsuit the china basin canal was a rarely used waterway but he kept half an ear out for the sound of an enginehe didnt favor the idea of being rammed by a boat coming in to tie up otherwise he hung in the water warm insulated invisibleand safe in some ways it was comparable to a night drop in a parachute an experience hardy had had more times than he cared to remember for the first time in four days louis baker left his consciousness but he also felt frannies arms around him as hed held her in the park he saw her eyes boring into his her smile working its way under his fears and defenses there was her body pressed against him full breasts and belly not any kind of little girl not anybodys little sister a grown woman in full flower waiting for her babys birth hardy remembered was forced to remember the time with jane when she was carrying michael the beginning of nesting the changes in the house painting the babys room buying the things that had seemed so impossible tiny sets of clothes rattles stuff he shook himself out of that when michael died it had nearly killed him jane too even now he wasnt sure how far over it he had gotten he tried never to let himself think of him of that time with jane and he thought there was no way hed allow that to happen to him again some things you learned your lessonhe wasnt meant to be a father it got into him too deep that sense of hope where there was meaning to things that even his wellpracticed cynicism couldnt deny and the baby frannie was carrying wasnt even his and what about jane jane had been through it with him all of it finally getting back to him reaching through whatever dark tunnel hed constructed to let him see some light to realize that life wasnt all black there were good times there was love sex whatever it was it was more than sex hed gotten along well without that for enough years to know so call it love diz you tell jane you love her you feel like its love but admit it not like it used to be not the bells ringing and heart pounding and choked up with happiness unabletotalk kind of love so what do you want be real diz thats puppy love and sure you dont have that with jane how could you after you lost your baby together after the divorce after another intervening marriage for her and come on be fair there are good things with jane but she just has much more of her own life doesnt need you as much as frannie seems to no commitment though right he once in a while trying to talk about the long term and jane not ready always not ready yet he yanked himself away from such thoughts the water had by degrees become clearer he could easily see his hand at the end of his extended arm a shadowperhaps a striped bassflashed in his peripheral vision after surfacing he saw he was within fifty yards of the mouth of the canal he looked at his watch it had only taken twentytwo minutes and the tide wasnt even running at full ebb yet the last rays of the sun still lit the top of the skyline and the towers on the bay bridge but the canal and its banks were in shade he struck out for the shore feeling hed accomplished something chapter twelve manny gubicza had his manicurist in the office he had set up a small table to the right of gubiczas desk with a couple of bowls of lotion a little cushion on a towel to rest his hand some emery boards and files manny didnt look at the manicurist at all he sat back eyes closed his massive desk between himself and fred treadwell out the window behind gubiczas head the sky was still light although it was a saturday manny gubicza was in full lawyer regalia the coat of his threepiece suit was hung onto a wooden valet just behind and to the left of his chair there were the purple suspenders and matching purple tie the light lavender silk handmade shirt with the monogram mag stitched in slightly darker color over the breast pocket the shirt was frenchcuffed of course and now with the cuffs pulled back for the manicure the ruby cufflinks sat a couple of inches apart on the desk staring at treadwell like the eyes of a drunk bulldog all in all i think its worth the risk gubicza was saying we cant just do nothing treadwell was still in shock and mourning after hector medina had left the night before he had cried himself out then finally called manny and made this appointment to discuss their strategy this morning he had made the arrangements to bury poppy and left him off at the vets it had been the longest saddest day of his life is there any way we can kill him treadwell asked id rather kill him than anything else gubicza shook his head fred were trying to get you off on a double murder i dont think strategically itd be wise to kill someone else right now i dont care gubicza glanced at the manicurist who didnt look up i know youre hurting its natural he started playing with one of the cufflinks but its my job to keep you out of jail i am the first to admit i find this behavior atrocious unbelievable really ive never heard of anything like it i cant believe the police would be so stupid he wasnt the police i dont believe he was the police gubicza flicked his right hand dismissively of course he is officially or not he represented them and it seems to me this is a death threat against you but he killed poppy yes i know thats horrible it is fred but i think what we must concern ourselves with is how to respond to this threat against you treadwell was leaning forward in the brocaded loveseat i want to punish him of course you do and thats the right approach i suggest we just continue with our original strategy in a sense our case is stronger since this medina fellow really was there and did damage whereas in the other charge well you know the evidence with them is rather slim my ankle is really broken thats real gubicza smiled warm as a toad yes and we know how that really happened dont we im not sure we want to get into that treadwell sat back and pulled his cast up to rest on the loveseat outside it had darkened it seemed all at once the manicurist finished gubiczas right hand and was moving the other side of his chair bringing his table with him the lawyer pushed a panel on his desk and the lights in the room became brighter he reached out and pulled the chain on a small tiffanystyle lamp on his desk holding his palm under it admiring the manicurists completed handiwork very nice he said but what about what medina said about no one believing me this time why would you lie about it why would you kill your own beloved pet he laid his left hand on the table now and the manicurist began no dont forget that the community is our strength they will believe you you are being harassed by the bigotry of the straight cops and incidentally he said if we dont present a pretty convincing case you get charged with a couple of killings you did he covered the manicurists hand with his own and squeezed you didnt hear that david the lawyer came back to treadwell honestly fred this could be a very good thing for our case he almost said i wish id thought of doing it myself when he got back to the parking lot louis baker stood on the side of the court and watched six boys playing basketball the court was between his carmamas carand where he now stood and after nearly an hour he decided no one was watching it he could be wrong but he had a hand on the gun in his pocket as he crossed the nomansland in case it came to something he looked different with his stolen money he had gone into the st vincent de paul store and bought himself some clothes that fit traded in the tennis shoes for hiking boots picked up a fortyniners jacket some sunglasses and a mock leather driving cap he shaved in the bathroom of a gas station on geary before walking back to his car he knew the addresshe had burned it into his mind nine years ago turning left out of the lot on fillmore he headed up to jackson street where hardy had lived might still liveyou never knew either way hed find him soon enough it was funny with rusty ingraham dead now and dido and how the unexpected sometimes just put things in your hands you left the joint you maybe got intentions to go a certain way but things happened around you and pretty soon youre sailing along like you never gave a thought to direction the wind blew youd be a fool to fight it and now they wanted him for murder again like theyd always done theres trouble first they looked to him this time he hadnt even gotten the smell of the prison soap off him before the hassling began okay just so he knew it wasnt like they said it would be but then he hadnt really believed them anyway but he wondered why they spent so much time trying to convince the cons with the lie in the house see they kept telling you that things would be different on the outside therere all kinds of agencies and people set up to get you going straight which you know the first year you just roll your eyes and figure they got to tell you somethingmight as well be a fairytale youre in the joint a while though and it starts sounding possible like maybe there really are jobs out there but none of the guys whod been out and came back seemed to get those jobs which was natural who was going to hire an excon when he can get somebody he might need to trust in the end you believed what you wanted to believe and the proof was here louis baker out about three days doesnt need no good intentions no more hard to live up to anyway now since hes going down for it anyway hes going to do something to make himself feel good he pulled into the curb under a streetlamp across from the old victorian there was one light in the front window the kind people left on when they werent home louis got out of the car put his hands in his jacket pocket where the gun was and walked over up the steps rang the doorbell he took a couple of deep breaths and squeezed the grip on the gun after no one answered he tried the door but a glance had already told him that would be a tough way in there was a new heavylooking deadbolt set into the door just above the knob but going in the front door wasnt his style anyway he descended the stoop and walked along the side of the house where a cement strip drained the area between this victorian and the building nearly flush up against it there were three windows in that wall all of them locked coming around the back corner he kicked the metal lid of a garbage can and it skidded for what seemed like ten seconds sounding like a small army passing through several dogs started barking and louis pressed himself deep into the shadows up against the house the dogs were good he thought dogs were always knocking over garbage cans cats too even raccoons hed wait prison had made him good at waiting it would get quiet again he craned his neck up around him it was maybe fifteen feet to what looked in the darkness to be a tall back fence on the other side of which an apartment building rose five or six stories each story had about six windows facing him some lit but he saw no silhouette that came to look down at the noise on either side there wasnt even a fencethe buildings started at the property line this would be a bad place to get trapped there was no way out except back up the shoulderwidth alley he had just come down he made out the wooden porch a couple of steps off a back doorway stepping away from the house avoiding the garbage can lid he saw some stairs going down under the porch there were two windows sidebyside down there in a little well under the porch and one of them was open an inch at the top louis wasnt going to throw the house he was going to find out if hardy still lived there then if so wait until he came home he let himself into a laundry room and felt his way in the dark to the doorway then up a couple of steps to what felt like a kitchen his eyes were adjusting there was also a little light seeping down the hallway from the living room on the floor by the front door he saw a pile of mail that had been dropped through the mail slot it appeared whoever lived here now was someone named jane fowler and shed been gone for at least a week already he dropped the envelopes back on the floor and returned to the kitchen he opened the refrigerator but the pickings were slim a couple of bottles of white wine one of them half empty a loaf of bread some plastic containers wouldnt hold enough food for a child four bottles of dark beer he took out one of the beers the bread and a jar of peanut butter and went over to rummage through some drawers near the sink for a knife the light from the refrigerator cut an arc through the darkness of the kitchen falling on the wall by the door to the hallway chewing on his sandwich he took a hit of the beer and nearly gagged the stuff was dark and thick and tasted like liquid sensen he looked at the bottlehe had thought it was beer but it was called stout and the only thing it had in common with beer was its bottle he poured it out into the sink he took one of the halfbottles of wine from the refrigerator and washed out his mouth with the light he could now make out things in the kitchen he walked over to where the light fell near the door and looked at the calendarand stopped everything the name dismasnot very commonappeared about five places in september he smiled swallowed his sandwich in a gulp and went back to work the telephone was in an alcove in the hallway and he risked now turning on the hall light he would only be here a few more minutes the phone sat on an answering unit on a builtin shelf under which were a couple of phone books next to the phone was a rolodex louis baker flipped to h and there it was out in the avenues maybe two miles west take him fifteen minutes flo was doing the dishes glitsky sat at the table playing monopoly with the three kids the boys were named isaac jacob and ojflo had drawn the line at esau oj was only eight but he already had a hotel on the boardwalk and glitsky was hanging out in jail waiting for doubles the boys always got a kick out of their father the cop being in jail but abe didnt want to get out and land on anything and this way the other boys could eliminate each other and he might have a chance to buy some cheap property and get back in the game the telephone rang and abe was in the middle of yelling let it go when flo picked it up on the first ring he heard her say just a minute hes right here then appear in the doorway its work she said it always is but its your turn oj whined let jake roll for me he shook a finger at his oldest son dont get doubles he walked into the kitchen glitsky he said into the receiver sergeant the voice said this is paul ghattas there was a pause from the lab he pictured the filipino boy he had chewed out earlier in the day there was a scream from the other room as one of his sons landed on a bad property flo disappeared and he heard her telling them to keep it down ghattas was saying something but glitsky couldnt get his mind on it he had told himself he was leaving the force as soon as he could and relocating to los angeles and these cases that no one else seemed to care about could take care of themselves im sorry he said what did you say he grabbed the pencil and pad of paper from their spot stuck to the side of his refrigerator and started taking notes ghattas had evidently cajoled someone he knew at ballistics into doing some work and they had definitely identified ray weirs gun as the murder weapon of course in the barge itself they had found prints from the female victim and from rusty ingraham but on the lamp they had picked up prints from a smalltime local enforcer named johnny laguardia there was a last print that kind of confused ghattas there was a drinking glass tagged galley with as clear a print as youd want of a guy named louis baker glitsky felt a chill in his back problem is we ran baker and hes in san quentin the computer hasnt caught up abe said baker got out on wednesday looks like he went right back to work yes it does flo had come back into the kitchen and saw abe staring at what he had written down she heard him thank the man on the phone saying he appreciated someone who still cared about getting his job done when he hung up he didnt move for a minute and flo came over behind him and rubbed her hand up and down his back hardys in big trouble he said baker was on the barge hardy felt frannies hand in his back pocket he felt the gun in its holster in the small of his back the fog had descended once again on the city they were walking in zero visibility three blocks straight uphill from where they had had dinner on noe three blocks to go before they got to frannies place hardy had his arm around hershe walked leaning into him he looked up the hill he knew there were streetlights all along but he could only see the next one perhaps twenty feet ahead of them sometime during dinner after the euphoria of proving that rusty ingraham could indeed have floated out into the bay had passed he had come up against what that might mean in his here and now but he had already had most of a bottle of wine by that time and now he was explaining to frannie that he felt unprepared if louis baker took this moment to attack but he doesnt even know where you are frannie said he found rusty rusty happened to be where he lived youre here hardy kept walking baker had had four days to locate him and it was getting to the time where it was reasonable to think hed have made some progress it couldnt be that hard to find someone you wanted to kill real bad they were coming into frannies block now the buildings tight up against each other blue light from frontroom television sets showing through a few windows the wind blew straight downhill at them and they leaned into it and each other up ahead of them hardy heard a car door open and close he tried to make out a shape in the dark fog but there was nothing then faintly he heard footsteps echoing on the asphalt he tightened his arm around frannie hold it a second he said he stopped them both pulled them back into a building entrance a few doors down from frannies he took off his jacket and helped put it on frannie you start walking back and wait around the corner he said if you hear anything sounds like shooting get into a building somehow you hear me taking his gun from the holster behind him he squinted into the fog up the hill dismas what are you he put a finger to his lips go he watched her for a few steps then he ran across the sidewalk the curb was lined with cars hardy stepped between a couple out into the street then turned uphill okay he said to himself the guys big enough to be baker the man wore a heavy coat and a cap pulled low on his forehead hardy crouching behind the wall of cars did not take his eyes off him it wasnt just somebody taking a walk he came down the street slowly taking his time looking into doorways perhaps looking for a street address he kept his hands in his coat pocket hardy worked his way uphill frannie had disappeared around the corner he was maybe five cars down from frannies doorway when the guy turned into it hardy caught a glimpse of a face in the light from frannies foyer enough to see it was a black man hardy gripped the gun moving uphill the man stood in the doorway waiting for hardy to open the door so he could blow him away hardy leveled his gun at his back resting his arm on the hood of one of the cars the man knocked on the door hardy cocked the hammer he wondered if this would classify as selfdefense or if he should call out and have baker turn with a weapon in his hand hardy had seen some action in vietnam but he had never even considered killing anyone since at least before this baker madness started he should just pull the trigger and the problem would be over baker was wanted for murder he had killed ingraham and threatened to kill dismas hardy now he was here and no jury in the world would believe he was here for an amway meeting shoot first diz and live he took in a deep breath and began tightening his finger on the trigger as abe glitsky turned around in the doorway and peered into the gloom down the street jesus christ hardy said to himself not again he uncocked his weapon and put it in the holster then stood up and came onto the sidewalk hey abe he said fancy meeting you here the three of them sat drinking hot chocolate at the table in the kitchen nook thats janes house hardy said is it glitsky asked it used to be ours together back when baker went down frannie still wore hardys jacket and she pulled herself down into it so he was looking for you hardy nodded even glitsky seemed to buy it finally if that used to be janes house hardy repeated the address and glitsky said that was it hardy sipped some chocolate calling it coincidence gets a little thin about now dont you think abe so is he dead frannie asked louis baker glitsky shook his head not yet he turned to hardy he took two slugs they got him in the county general howd they get him he made some noise turned some lights oni guess he was out of practice on burglaries or just overconfident anyway one of the neighbors knew the house was supposed to be empty and called in our guys caught him strolling out when he got cornered he opened up hardy leaned back in his chair so its over he said he told abe about his experiment with the tide well not to be picky abe said but that still doesnt make rusty dead hardy sighed all right but like you said it sure strengthens the argument glitsky held up a hand if you had somebody wants to argue me im happy enough now it was baker he was on the barge with a motive and a handy weaponought to be good enough so you came around to tell me that glitsky shook his head i got the details on the way over on the squawk box the reason i started over here was i found louis had been at rustys and i wanted to advise you to keep an eye out ive been doing that i know abe said im not blind glitsky wasnt comfortable with private citizens walking around armed even if it was his best friend even if he had a permit so how close did you come to doing me miles hardy said frannie refilled glitskys mug hes just been worried abe you would be too there see hardy tried to smile but still felt like someone had kicked him in the stomach he hadnt made up his mind whether or not he was going to pull the trigger but hed come close enough it didnt need it but glitsky blew on his chocolate before i found out about baker tonight i thought id bring you my file ease your mind some with some light reading hardy fingered the manila folder whats to read this was before we had placed baker on the barge remember to let you know that there were people involved here good suspects who didnt know you from ezechiel i thought it might relax you a little get louis baker off your brain but dont you need your files frannie asked abe stood up i dont think so not anymore whats the matter abe glitskys face hung like a bloodhounds his eyes were shot with red i figure im finished with it diz nobody cares anymore you know what i mean so it sure looks like baker probably is baker why dont we just gas him now and be done with it it reminds me of the movie casablanca rounding up the usual suspects well thats not police work its not what i do so fuck it he nodded to frannie excuse the french he said outside the wind came up and whistled against the windows glitsky pushed his chair forward and said he had to be going home hardy and frannie walked him to the door so what now hardy asked like i said im going home well see you guys tomorrow right they watched him walk hunched over into his coat until he disappeared into the fog and then frannie closed the door she turned to hardy ezechiel she said hardy sat on the couch the manila folder with glitskys notes lay open on the coffee table in front of him somewhere back behind him he was vaguely aware of the shower frannie was taking his shirt was off and he had pulled the comforter up over his shoulders and leaned forward his elbows on his knees reading and maybe starting to see something for the first time he hated to admit it but with louis baker no longer threatening him the facts of the matter didnt point all that more strongly to him than to say ray weir the jealous husband or even to hector medina who had had a hardon for rusty for years also abe had written johnny laguardia with three exclamation points after his name with a notation about his prints being on the fallen lamp hardy had never heard the name johnny laguardia even from abe and he wondered what he had to do with anything three exclamation points worth but then he reminded himself that louis bakers prints were also found on the barge in the galley and if baker was there then he did it didnt he he stood up wrapping the comforter around him and paced from the window to the hallway door and back the fog seemed to glow in the streetlights eddying gently now before him as it drifted down the hill it came back to him then the feeling of seeing abe loom out of that same fog of almost shooting him in the back or not almost already his memory was getting selective about it he hadnt really been going to shoot if it had turned out to be bakerhad he abe kept getting mistaken for baker didnt he maybe on some level even for hardy they all did look alike well he wasnt going to lose any sleep worrying over the fate of louis baker whod been at rustys had broken into janes house who for sure was the same badass hed always been what are you thinking frannie was wrapped in a white terrycloth robe she had dried her hair and it gleamed like a red halo around her face hardy walked back to the couch avoiding her eyes just pondering what abe would call the moral ambiguities of what he motioned to the table this stuff but that wasnt all and he knew it he sat down frannie leaned arms crossed against the doorjamb dismas she said he knew if he looked up he was in trouble so he reached out and started arranging papers in the folder frannie came and stood next to him he raised his head and she put her hands in his hair and pulled him into her she opened the robe and his face was against her belly the smell of powder and woman her skin warm and tight her heart pounding under it come on she said and he followed her into the bedroom chapter thirteen lace was at the mamas putting up some plywood over the hole where dido had broken the window the fog which had come in late the night before was already lifting a light breeze fluffed at laces flannel shirt as far as lace knew no one in the cut had seen or heard anything about louis baker since two nights before and lace was figuring louis ought to show up soon if he had any notion at all of claiming the cut because it was slipping away fast last night dido not yet in the ground and samson who ran the next cut over was seeing that no one worked out of this one lace and jumpup theyd laid low letting things shake out he felt bad about dido dido had been like his big brother his protector lace wasnt sure how he was going to handle louis baker when he came back but the first thing was to get his confidence make him think hed change allegiances like the wind blew he didnt want louis baker feeling like he had to kill him the way louis had had to kill dido to secure the cut so hed make up to mama keep close and informed fix the window and bide his time then when louis came back and wasnt looking something bad would happen to him the mama stuck herself out around the back of the building a mountain of a woman in a multicolored caftan she had cooked up a pan of cornbread inside and had butter and honey to go on it lace drove in another nail and let himself into the kitchen the mama sat at the table cutting into the pan the cornbread smell filled the room sit down child she said eat up lace obeyed her savoring the flavors the butter melted into the bread a little honey over the top mama poured him a glass of milk police brought back my car the mama finally said louis didnt do it no harm they find him he got shot she said everybody always wants to be shooting lace just nodded probably now he go back to the house police say it might be better if he dont live now what they might fix to do to him she cut another square of cornbread and put it on laces plate theyre saying he killed dido you hear that he did kill dido lace said the mama nearly exploded why you say that then more quietly what make you think that trash boy lace had to chew a minute before he could swallow his mouth was dry and he took a gulp of milk didos shot and he runs he mumbled out you thinking like the police now she said running dont make you guilty running keep you out of the way thats all first thing the man do is look for somebody like louis maybe done some bad things before easy to lay it off on louis then maybe okay why louis want to kill dido it was so obvious he had trouble saying it he want the cut mama you think louis that dumb he shoot dido and run away from the cut he wants he didnt do it he shouldnt have run the mama shook her head child child child where you comin from he gotta run he got no choice lace went back to his cornbread thinking that the mama maybe made some sense louis had fought with dido and the war was still going on with dido breaking the window but it would have been plain stupid to kill dido especially to get at the cut be like putting up a flag saying you did it be more like it if somebody used the fighting between dido and louis to get rid of one and set up the other free up the cut too lace needed to think on that hardy ran his hand along frannies side before he slipped out of bed she stirred made a noise in her throat and settled back into sleep hardy pulled the blanket up over her moving her hair away from her face they had been awake most of the night talking and loving one another like old friends in one way but in the otherhardy was amazed at what had gone on now showering the images of frannie over him under him things theyd done the second and then third time he found himself getting excited again and turned up the cold water so he could get on with the day with his real life his real life he put on a pot of coffee wondering what his real life had become lately ever since rusty ingraham had walked into the shamrock until then hed been doing okayin some ways he thought better than okay certainly better than the sleepwalk hed been in before he got back with jane and things with jane were at least steady he worked bartending with easy hours doing something he mostly enjoyed and thenit was like the question you sometimes heard at partieswhat if somebody told you that you were going to die in three days or six months what would you do differently and of course the right answer was id just keep doing what im doing well somebody had made hardy believe that he might die in the very near future and he hadnt done anything like what hed been doing what did that mean that he hadnt been happy with what he was doing and how did he feel about what he was doing now if he had one day left would he choose to spend it with frannie or jane or alone well if he was lucky he had more than one day left and didnt have to make that decision the sun was high the fog was mostly burned off hardy thought that when he moved back into his housewhenever that happenedhed start going down to graffeos for coffee it really was better than his canned espresso he went to the front door and found the sunday paper on the stoop he looked out at the line of cars parked along the curb trying to imagine himself last night huddled behind one a gun trained on abe glitskys back it looked so different in the sunlight had he really done that had he and frannie really done all that too and what would that look like in the daytime he opened the paper in the nook and a frontpage story got his attention right away hector medina was back in the news fred treadwell it seemed had now accused medina of killing his dog and threatening his own life there were two sidebars on hector one outlined the sevenyearold accusation that he had been a killer cop case closed hardy was still an excop and exda and that sort of reporting bothered him never mind that he had been suspicious of medinas selfserving protests of innocence to him the other sidebar was an interview with medinaevidently some reporter had called him at home the night before the paper went to press all hardy read there was a refrain of medinas complaint to himonce youd been accused you might as well have done it since everyone treated you like you had anyway of course he hadnt killed any dog but everyone would believe he had although he said it was the dumbest accusation hed ever heard why would he kill the mans dog and so forth for a second it crossed hardys mind that maybe hed done the same thing with louis baker he was a bad man therefore he was guilty of bad things that happened and it followedonce you got accused of doing bad things you might as well go ahead and do them in for a penny in for a dollar no not in bakers case hed been at rustys hed gotten shot after breaking into janes for gods sake looking for him hardy put the paper down and was staring out the windows he felt hands on his shoulders massaging coming around to rest on his chest frannie kissed the top of his head and he leaned back into her hi he said she patted his chest and straightened up i love you she said sliding into the chair next to him looking in his eyes and youre confused hardy smiled not so confused good not that i have any idea what im doing what were doing what any of this means thats okay i dont either hardy took her hand its not casual though you know i know im just trying to figure out whats my socalled real life me or jane he shook his head not just that thats part of it im not staking any claim you know but i do want you to know that i love you hardy looked down at the hand he held eddies wedding ring was still on her finger he wanted to say a lot of thingsthat saying you loved somebody was staking a claim that he didnt know where to put his own infatuation that he didnt trust what he called love the feelinghe trusted love the attitude the problem was that he had the feeling with frannie with jane he was starting to think he had the attitude and was trying to manufacture the feeling often with decent success but it wasnt the same as the racing he felt in his veins now he did however know that he wasnt going to just say i love you right now that was too open to misinterpretation instead he lifted her hand and kissed it you know when i said i wasnt so confused he said she nodded i lied frannie laughed her wonderful laugh fixing him with dancing eyes oh dismas lets just enjoy this eddies gone and i miss him horribly and janes not in the picture right now and were two grownups whove known and cared about each other forever and now are attracted to each other she squeezed his hand okay very attracted weve got a little window in time we can have just for ourselves so lets take it im not trying to find a father for the baby and you dont have to decide between me and jane at least until what you call your real life starts again ive never thought of the love as a window in time theory how about if there isnt any theory then something can happen youre not ready for frannie laughed again shaking her head you ever think that life is something that happens and that youre not ever completely prepared for yeah and it makes me uncomfortable i know so you want to control everything but things cant be controlled eddie being killed michael dying louis baker putting you and me together like this its just out of our control how about last night now a slow smile last night was a freight train without brakes going downhill and you know it but something had to get it started it started when you rang my bell here it started before i married eddie it started when i met you and in our as you say real lives we had it under control then this funny thing happened with your life being threatened just like funny things happen all the time well your window of time is closing jane is coming back i should move back home louis bakers in custody why dont i feel like things are over settled frannie leaned over and shut him up with a kiss because some things are just starting hardy got up and went out to the living room where last nights comforter lay heaped on the couch glitskys file was still open on the coffee table frannie came up behind him and put her arms around his waist her face against his back okay heres the thing he said everything seems connected somehowyou me this baker situation and my instincts are telling me its not over theres too much unresolved you mean with baker i mean with rusty ingraham but im also wondering if that instinct is really me just wanting to prolong things here with you put off my return to real life she rubbed her hands up and down the front of his shirt whats unresolved he crossed over to the table picked up the file this stuff here also in the paper this morning another guy involved in all this shows up around another violent crime but didnt they get baker at janes and doesnt that mean he was after you absolutely she folded her arms across her chest well it doesnt mean he killed rusty or maxine or the guy in the projects it only means he was after me okay but you can infer sure you can its what ive been doing all along he sat down on the couch and frannie came over last night i almost shot abe no listen i was onehundredpercent certain it was louis baker on your porch here to kill me but i couldnt take him out without making sure thank god something stopped me from pulling the trigger frannie sat back not knowing where he was going if i couldnt kill baker last night how can i do it now how would you be doing that multiple murder rap hell get the gas chamber but abe even said sure but abes instincts arent always wrong often in fact theyre right i mean i was so scared the last few days i wasnt interested in anything but saving my ass and that meant pointing to baker and now now i think i can see for the first time that abe might have had a point back there when this whole thing started in his shoes knowing what he knew and didnt know im not sure i would have arrested baker right away either but abe knowing what he did finally did arrest baker didnt he not exactly baker got shot outside janes house where we suppose he was looking for me to kill me but didnt abe say he was going to charge him no it sounded like he said he was going to quit maybe let the ingraham case slide and be happy to have baker go down for the womans murder or the burglary or even breaking his parole hes fed up is all but baker was coming to kill you dont get me wrong frannie i dont care too much about what happens to one louis baker but he ought to go down for what hes actually done so let a jury decide that or abe juries can be wrong and abes not interested in his current mood hardy flipped some pages in abes file leaning over the coffee table theres another thing he said she sat forward a hand on his back whats that one way or the other im deeply involved in all this right so lets for argument lets say baker didnt kill rusty lets even just for fun say rusty isnt dead if either or both of those are true then why am i dismas hardy part of this at all unless im being set up but set up for what hardy closed the file and leaned back against the couch exactly hardy was thinking that maybe frannies infatuation had ended since she was already pissed off at him for going to see louis baker in the hospital he should just leave it alone she said but he still felt some danger if he was being set up or maybe he wanted to stay at frannies a little longer and needed an excuse or maybe he felt less than a paragon and wanted to soothe his conscience now that his life wasnt so far as he knew directly threatened it was all jumbled but also somehow connected he and frannie had had their first fight she said that compulsive need to find out to do the right thing had killed her husband she wasnt about to have it happen to hardy too but hardy knew that idealism hadnt killed eddie cochran four months ago a bullet in the brain had killed him and eddie had had no more control over who had put it there than he did over the wind eddie had been going along living his life trying to make it a good one and someone had ended itabruptly senselessly if something in frannie needed to believe that eddies idealism had gotten him involved in things that had led to that lonely parking lot in the middle of the night hardy could accept that he knew it had been someone elses agenda not eddies that had ended his life he put it out of his mind as the guard let him into the hospital room he had called abe from frannies and abe had cleared an interview with baker even if he didnt approve of it he had made hardy promise not to take his gun even with tubes in his arms and a hose running into his nose baker looked intimidating hardy backed away from the bed and glanced at the door to the room making sure the guard was still just outside he couldnt place him hardy had no distinctive memory of what baker had looked like nine years before a big black man hed sent away a lot of them yo louis he said baker opened his eyes he was still heavylidded perhaps sedated but there was recognition there bakers eyes had a yellowish tint both the white and the brown iris well if the mountain aint come after the one phrase he closed his eyes again hardy pulled up a chair so he could be close to bakers face i hope you got a better lawyer than last time he said he watched baker for a reaction but there wasnt any he might have gone back to sleep cause when you get better from this tragic accident thats put you in the hospital then youre going to go sit in a small green room and breathe some real bad air but you know the good part is you wont breathe it for too long baker opened his eyes talk about bad air they say the gas is painless but you hear stories guys who get the first whiff and their heads jerk back and eyes bug out like theyre gagging on fire its gotta be agony dont you think but again i guess it doesnt last too long i aint going to no gas chamber on a b and e fuck the b and e im talking the murders i didnt do no murders you didnt do rusty ingraham you better have a good lawyer i didnt even see no rusty ingraham i tole the cop that and you know he wanted to believe you but finding your prints over at rustys place made him skeptical you know that word louis skeptical it means he thinks youre full of shit baker closed his eyes again you sleepy louis you want me to go away cause we got you on rustys barge we got you in the cut we got three dead people with your name all over em hardy saw movement under bakers eyelidshe was thinking about things hardy hadnt formally interrogated anyone since hed left the das office but you didnt lose the knack it was kind of fun in fact realizing that louis probably thought he was still a prosecutor three baker opened his eyes pulled himself up what three you trying to tag me for every murder in the county last week whats a matter you got nobody else on parole the effort of talking cost louis and he had to lie back down breathing out through his mouth i aint do a thing you all decide im going back down howd you get a gun louis shooting at cops breaking and entering you call that not doing a thing louis picked up his hand waving all of that off it aint killing hardy sat back in his chair it was not rare for a killer to deny killing anybody but he had louis arguing talking you had to use what you had and keep em talking no killing was rusty ingraham killing was the woman at his place killing was the homeboy in the cut what woman at ingrahams her name was maxine weir there wasnt no woman louis stopped abruptly retreating again behind his closed eyes lying back hardy leaned forward smiling now oops he said i want my lawyer here hardy leaned over closer and whispered in bakers ear fuck you louis fuck your lawyer this is me and you ill get a mistrial ill deny it and whos going to believe you louis tried to lift himself on the bed which brought on a coughing fit the oxygen hose came out of his nose hardy stood and pulled his chair back while the guard came over and pushed a button by the bed in another minute a nurse was there the coughing fit had passed and louis lay still looking dead the nurse replaced the oxygen tubes and checked the bandages on bakers chest and thigh hardy could see the blood through the gauzea line of blood and drool had run from bakers mouth there was a low gurgling sound and hardy realized it was bakers breathing the nurse turned he shouldnt really talk hardy decided to keep pretending to be official until someone called him on it ill only be another five minutes this is a murder suspect do you want him alive to go to trial hardy glanced at baker then back at the nurse not particularly but ill keep it short anyway hardy pulled his chair back up and noticed the nurse saying something to the guard at the door now where were we hardy said oh yeah you were on ingrahams barge baker was still struggling with his breath as though hed been running there wasnt no woman there he said you told sergeant glitsky you werent there he puts me there he thinks i did the man correct the man brung me there who did ingraham ingraham brought you where he lives you want me to believe that you believe what you want anyway im telling you what happen okay what happened i get off the bus an the man is there waitin he goes come take a ride with me and i pass on it but hes packing youre telling me rusty ingraham pulled a gun on you baker nodded i told you he shows me his piece and we go to his car i figure hes going to shoot me but we drive about two miles and next i know were on his boat he says he hears im tryin to be a citizen now good behavior up the house like that we sit drinking water on his couch and he say he hope all thats true but in case it isnt he wants me to know where he lives so by mistake i dont ever come near the place which if i do hes gonna shoot first selfdefense do i get the message the gurgling sound came again deep in his throat and baker swallowed a couple of times making a face then what hardy asked then i up and leave i walk around getting away from there im a free man the guard came walking up the nurse said two minutes hardy stood looking down at baker he was still swallowing a light sheen of sweat across his brow he opened his eyes i didnt kill nobody he said the guard rolled his eyes at hardy they never do do they he said chapter fourteen a cane in one hand angelo tortoni walked out of saints peter and paul church at washington square his wife carmen held him in the crook of her elbow on the other side and their two sons matteo and franco walked in front of and behind him as he turned left off the steps he walked slowly enjoying the beautiful morning enjoying his wifes chatter carmen was nearly twice the size of angelo but was not at all fat he liked to think of her as sturdygood solid legs a hard round culo a wide waist and melon breasts she was twenty years younger than he was originally from italy and because of that welltrained but with a passionate nature and a seemingly innate knowledge of what kept your husband happy even after a couple of decades several times the angel had thought his wife would kill him with her energy but he was beginning now to realize that her enthusiasm was probably keeping him young she could be tireless in the pursuit of his pleasure as she had been last night and then demanding that she got hers too tortoni thought that was fairhe didnt think there were many women who could bring him to life so often as carmen did even when he thought he didnt want it the little procession crossed the square then turned up powell at the fior ditalia sunday was gods day carmen was happy angelo wouldnt leave the house after luncha few neighbors would stop by to pay their respects perhaps ask a favor or two today they would find angelo tortoni a soft touch he turned his head and nodded smiling at something his wife said she looked down almost shyly squeezing his arm they slowed even more turning uphill off grant angelos legs were as good as any mans but he enjoyed putting out the message that he was somehow getting frail it might keep his enemies off guard should he ever need that but he had found it also served to slow down all his rhythmsto give his words a weight his judgments a finality that they had lacked when he was young and fast a quiet voice whispering helped too when you didnt raise your voice people had to come to you to concentrate on every syllable it was power franco ran ahead and opened the gate in the white wall in front of his house they turned into the small front yard waiting on the walk for franco to bound up the nine steps and open the front door it pleased angelo that his boys took care of this security without any supervision to the steady hum of carmens voice she was not a gossip a scold or a shrew but she liked to take her aftermass sunday walk and feel she was catching up on all the news with her husband who didnt respond much except to nod or pat her hand yet it made her feel they were sharing things in their daily life although tortoni knew that nothing could be further from the truth carmen knew almost nothing about his daily life other than that he was a counselor to troubled people a philanthropist to those in need an elder in the knights of columbus the foyer basked in sunlight colored by the stained glass above the doorway angelo breathed in the smell of lamb roasting in the kitchen garlic and rosemary he helped carmen with her coat kissing the back of her neck before he handed the coat to one of the men only then did he notice pia the maid standing by the entrance to the living room wringing her hands carmen patted angelos arm and crossed over to talk to her quietly in italian it was probably something about lunch something theyd burned or forgotten to buy well it was all right whatever it was there is a woman to see you carmen said in the study tortoni made a face now he turned a hard glance on pia he didnt know any women certainly none who would dare come to his own house on a sunday before noon do we know her carmen spoke in italian pia could not send her away dont be angry with her the woman looks as though shes been beaten she begged for your help tortoni told pia she had done the right thing he would see the woman find out what this was about he nodded to matteo he would go into the study and see that the woman was not carrying a gun or a knife in her purse or anywhere else tortoni asked pia if she would bring him two glasses and his bottle of lachryma christi the sweet yellow wine he drank after mass every sunday he took off his coat placed his cane in the umbrella stand by the door turned around and gave carmen a kiss on both cheeks ti amo he said then back to english i wont be long the study was dark but even in the dimness he could tell at a glance that this was a stunning woman makeup had tried to cover the welt on her cheek but an eye was swollen and her full red lips looked bruised they made you want to kiss them and make them better she wore a light tan skirt that now as she was sitting came to just over her knees her hair was pulled back held to one side with a motherofpearl comb she reminded angelo tortoni of his wife on the day he married her he dismissed matteo and the door closed on the two of them he walked in his regular gait to the couch he had planned to sit behind his desk but after seeing her he did not want any artificial separation between himself and this woman the room was kept dark by slatted wooden shades over all the windows he reached up and opened one column of slats and horizontal shafts of light painted the rug on the floor like some luminous ladder motes of dust twinkled through the rays he raised his hand and motioned for the woman to approach she got up and knelt on one knee before him picking up his hand and kissing the back of it she had clearly been well brought up they spoke in italian what is your name doreen biaggi he patted the couch next to him and she sat and arranged herself halfturned to him the light missed her slicing the air between them tortoni reached up a hand and ran a finger along her face from her chin to her eyebrow who did this to you there was a knock on the study door angelo sat back vieni pia entered with a bottle and two glasses he let her set the bottle onto a silverridged coaster on his desk she correctly poured only one glass offering it to him but he gestured with his left hand and she handed the glass to doreen after pouring his she was gone closing the door quietly behind her angelo held his glass out between them and she raised hers to touch his prisms from the cut crystal danced around the room they each took a small sip he noticed the way she held the glass on her lap one hand on the stem the other on the bowl she did not look down at it i ask you to forgive me for bothering you on the lords day angelo waved that away how can i help you i owe you money and i owe you my gratitude he nodded it was a good start she wasnt just coming here to whine about her vig i am also very afraid angelo sipped his wine he saw her lower lip begin to tremble but she got control of herself quickly taking a deep breath there is nothing to be afraid of here he said she looked down at her lap as though surprised to find the wineglass there she raised it to her lips i want to pay youshe hesitatedbut i must ask for for arrangements to be different angelo was confused after he had spoken to johnny he had been confident things would get straightened out the vig is too much she shook her head sitting now in silence a tear formed in her swollen eye it is not the vig i could pay a hundred a week for a few weeks after thatshe paused collecting herselfi havent paid any vig johnny laguardiashe looked up her large brown eyes now liquidjohnny she broke crying aloud angelo took a spotless white cotton handkerchief from his shirt pocket and touched it to her face as he watched her try to collect herself he was putting it together feeling his rage johnny had been scamming other clients to cover doreens short when she couldnt make the hundred he upped somebody else on his ownmaybe the mysteriously disappeared rusty ingrahamand started taking doreens vig out of her ass doreen was sniffling now wiping away the tears mi scusa don tortoni worst of all johnny had been keeping doreen biaggi a secret a woman like this in her situation she could be priceless to angelo not directly perhaps she might be too classy for that but certainly a woman of her grace and breeding her looks and substance could be used somewhereto bind an allegiance to weaken an enemy to blind a competitor in legitimate business perhaps even to marry a son angelo moved closer to her on the couch he knew the sunlight was now falling across his face doreen embarrassed looked down into her lap his handkerchief clutched around the stem of the wineglass closer he inspected the face which now even bruised could he thought make the angels sing the loyalty and love of a woman such as this was a gift from god and he knew he could get it for nothing johnny had already paid enough of her vig to cover her principalhe would hardly even lose any money he lifted her chin and drew her face to his he kissed both sides of her bruised lips then both cheeks gently with his thumb he rubbed a trace of a tear away from under her eye look at me he said she raised her eyes johnny had nearly broken her angelo smiled will you eat with my family today he moved his hand down over her neck her shoulder coming to rest under her arm feeling the full curve of the side of her breast as he moved her back away from him as though trying to get her into focus as of this moment he said you owe me nothing except a smile from your beautiful face he touched the corner of her mouth with a finger lifting it as he would do to a baby a little smile he repeated she tried and he pushed again at her lip playfully the smile when it came nearly broke his heart he would have to deal with johnny laguardia flo glitsky and frannie cochran were doing dishes together they watched dismas and abe walking in the small playground that bordered the backyard the glitskys shared with their neighbors downstairs they had moved into the duplex when oj was born unable then as they still were to afford their own house on abes salary in san francisco now of course there was no chance at all but the duplex was rentcontrolled and they paid less than most everybody else they knew her own house was one of the dreams flo wasnt going to get but she had her three healthy boys and her man who loved her and if that was the trade shed take it any day are you really leaving frannie asked her it was all that had been on flos mind for the last two days she had never seen abe this down he had actually applied to the los angeles police department and was talking about moving there as if it were settled all flo knew about la was that if abe thought housing was high here they wouldnt stand a chance there and shed heard the public schools there were in bad shapethe teachers mere truant officers whose jobs were to keep kids off drugs and off the street until three oclock and not only didnt flo believe in private schools she knew they wouldnt be able to afford one anyway and her boys were all smart flo shook her head ill let abe work out what he has to and then i guess well make some decision thats how you do it isnt it frannie said that was always it with me and eddie what he wanted and what i wanted back and forth until we got somewhere together she wiped at a soapy plate ive gotten out of that habit i miss it i think flo took the plate from her starting to dry it how long has it been now four and a half months flo like the other cops wives frannie knew didnt let herself think too often about losing her husband it was a possibility that came with the territory and you accepted it and went on if you wanted to stay together youre holding up better than i would flo said abe kicked at the tanbark under the swing he and hardy were on his arms were looped around the chains and as he kicked he rotated from side to side facing hardy then turning away how are you gonna be a good cop anywhere if you dont care how many guys care hardy waited on the rotation until abe was faced back toward him i think about four but you were always one of them glitsky spinning now on the swing shook his head now im a professional policeperson i go where they pay me to enforce the law and the brass decide correcto hardy did a pullup on the aframe of the swing he did another one the two big guys playing on the monkey bars besides abe said lanier is handling it theyll pass off my cases to mcfadden cause hes the other solo and baker will go down like he should order will be restored to the cosmos hardy was hanging fulllength from the frame you reading shakespeare again glitsky stood out of the swing criticism the tragic fallacy by krutch you ought to check it out says there cant be any tragedy unless theres a zeitgeist of ultimate order that can be destroyed and then restored zeitgeist hardy said kraut word means the general intellectual moral and cultural climate of an era such as our very own for example i know what the fuck it means abe im a college graduate so thats why we dont have any modern tragedy we dont believe in the importance of any one individual anymore since nobody screwing up can destroy the order of the cosmos then nobody getting enlightened can restore it see i was just thinking about this yesterday glitsky cast a sideways glance at his friend so howd we get on this anyway you said louis baker going down will restore order to the cosmos glitsky nodded yeah right lets go get another couple of beers they headed back to the house but hardy still couldnt let it go but my problem is the blindside thingit was like what girl maybe he was concentrating on rusty so hard he didnt even notice maxine you dont notice a naked woman you have to shoot three times glitsky stopped again by the back door they stood on a square of porch hands in their pockets the boys were playing somewhere within earshot maybe around the front of the house hardy blew out surprised to see a vapor trail the chill had come in fasta highpressure cold that had wiped the sky almost purple okay so he noticed her but abe thats my point baker said he had no idea what i was talking about when i said a woman had been killed at rustys and he sounded convincing even to these ears glitsky shrugged he was lying i dont think so well thats your problem and if he wasnt it means he wasnt there when rusty got shot diz listen up now his prints were there jesus abe my prints were there too aha abe raised a forefinger another hot lead in the case you can laugh i do laugh diz dig it yesterday you were the personification of outraged public crying for the head of louis baker i modestly represented the restraining force of law in our society you got a pair of boots what it gets any deeper im gonna need boots glitsky put an arm around his friends shoulder i am making a point and the point is that we we the police arent supposed to go flipflopping according to the whims of the public were supposed to protect that old buddy includes you yesterday you thought louis baker was guilty of everything you could think of today what youre trying to have me check out these other suspects just after i find outand for the first timethat louis is finally in fact a righteous suspect prints at rustys puts him there now hes got a motive hes got opportunity now hes a suspect and now you want me to drop him there is some irony here i dont want you to drop him i just thought in your thirst for justice you might want to be completely thorough glitsky blew out through tight lips im the one who has been thorough here all along i continue to be but several things have changed since just yesterday one louis got himself a gun and did some b and e this makes his rehabilitation in prison somewhat suspectat least to me second he was in fact at rustys we knew neither of these things yesterday and knowing them now moves old louis up several rungs on the maybehesguilty ladder i really would like a beer but hardy didnt move when abe pushed at the door glitsky sighed okay what youve looked at medina already who is johnny laguardia where does ray weir fit into all this theres just things you as a cop can do that i cant thousands well shit abe do a few of them abe shook his head no why not because i am out of here diz gone los angeles may need me and that is another jurisdiction these arent going to be my cases and i dont need the aggravation plus i think theres a good chance that our louis baker in fact did all this and theres enough to bring him in on it and after that its up to the da and twelve of louiss peers if they can find them he pushed at the door again its no longer police business and certainly not mine now you want a beer or what but he stopped again besides why do you care baker is off the street go back to work let the wheels of justice grind fine why the hell dont you hardy looked at the sky stuffing his hands further into his pockets cause if he didnt do itim not saying he didnt but if he doesnt deserve to die for it and id be killing him if i let it go you bleeding your heart for louis baker id love to ace him in a fair fight and thats a fact you know your odds of getting a fair fight out of him slim i would guess and none well at least it would be just me and him mano a mano hardy shrugged i cant back in to what would amount to me killing him ive just developed a case of reasonable doubt is all you dont think he was coming after you hardy nodded yeah i guess i do think that well were gonna hang the bastard because hes mad at me glitsky shook his head pushed again at the door hardy followed him up the stairs at the top of the steps they stopped one last time ive got no great hots to save baker you know hardy said but something else has got to be going on here its just too convenient you think somebody paid him to bust into janes house no i think he did that on his own so what else so me is what else ive been part of this since the beginning and now suddenly bakers on ice and somehow its over but im still involved especially if im being used to patsy up baker when maybe he didnt do it anything capital anyway glitsky his hand on the kitchen door ran a finger across the scar that went through his lips so you want me to help a little look around is all let me think about it abe said he turned the knob okay ive thought about it no he opened the door and said hi to flo and frannie chapter fifteen it didnt feel like hed thought it wouldseeing your own images up there on the screen your words being spoken by people who pretended to care about them in his imaginings the scene always had him sitting next to maxine both of them puffed with accomplishment she up there filling the screen with her beauty and talent he for the idea the words the artistic vision behind it all but now the reality was so different as it always seemed to be lately he was slumped in his easy chair smoke curling from a cigarette in his left hand courtenay and warren sat on the couch the room rearranged for the screening and maxine the only place maxine livedon the screen didnt seem real anymore and yet that was all that was real it was his first movie this was the final cut with sound before the music was added there was beer and champagne in the kitchen sink for afterward other acquaintances friends reclined or sat indianstyle on the floor watching maxine say his words do his bidding live the part hed created for her the doorbell sounded and he half turned to see someone he didnt recognize a man enter and sit on the floor ray weir put him out of his mind this film unreal though it might be was all that was now left of maxine he should pay attention he wanted to stop the reel and just look at her god she was had been beautiful he supposed he still loved her no he knew he still loved her always would she had been his friend and his muse she had been what had separated him from the other drones cranking out words and scenes and treatments okay so the movie wasnt exactly an a feature you made compromises when you started out when you needed a credit or two for credibility everybody in the business understood that those earlier scenes nearly doing it with bryantheir friend who played the stepfatherthey were pretty tasteful ray thought although warren had done a good job of making it seem they were really screwing but maxine had told him about it after theyd shot that day about the angles theyd had to use to look real and still avoidshed said you know penetration but this was to be only the first step in a long career they were going to do it againan entire work an oeuvre of films by ray weir starring maxine they werent too old in spite of maxines giving up on it that was all rusty ingrahams doing that negative stuff the change in her he squirmed in his chair in the rooms flickering light he saw the film had everyones attention bryan was there no girlfriend with him of course warren had his arm around courtenay who had done a fine editing job the print was good and clean this was a professional effort screenplay by ray weir they couldnt take their eyes off maxine but it was his story that was holding them dont forget that he turned a little more the guy whod come in halfway through was walking along the back wall hands in pockets checking out the glossies of maxine on the back wall maybe he was another cop come back to talk to him man ray he thought what are you going to do about wednesday night he glanced across at courtenay again saw she was leaning into warren whispering something the frame on the wall froze on maxines perfect body midair in a dive into the water without any music it was eerie gradually he became aware of the sound of the projector then someone flicked the room lights on and suddenly there was applause courtenay was next to him hugging him pulling him over next to warren bryan took a bow ray found himself applauding courtenay moran was nearly six feet tall she wore her blonde hair cropped to within an inch of her scalp all over except at the nape of her neck where a longer strand was held in a ponytail by a hot pink ribbon it just seems pretty soon to be partying after his wifes death is what i mean hardy was saying he watched her blow some smoke toward the ceiling they stood on the landing at the top of the stairway outside the open front door to rays duplex hardy held a can of beer and leaned against the doorpost in the living room where theyd watched the movie people were still mingling binding into little groups then quickly splitting off he didnt know what this kind of schmoozing was called or what its purpose was where the longest you talked to anybody was forty seconds but it wasnt getting him anywhere so hed walked up to courtenay in the kitchen because she was beautiful and because hed seen her talking to ray she wore a leather flight jacket that made her broad shoulders seem broader her eyes were surrounded with a very dark blueblack makeup that seemed to set them more deeply into her milkwhite face hardy thought that in a photograph courtenays face might appear jutting bony but here now the bones were in the right places whos partying she asked you call this partying hardy looked back into the living room a record was playing a heavy latin beat and some dancing had started its not exactly a wake he said several of the dancers appeared to him to be trying to copulate with their clothes on thats just the lambada courtenay said its harmless hardy tipped up his beer sometimes hunches could be a waste of time and it was beginning to look as though this whole trip to ray weirs would turn out to be one of them he stared at the dancers another minute looks like foreplay he said depends on how good you are she smiled looking right in his eyes he pulled the door closed leaving them alone on the landing the music thumping low and insistent courtenay stepped up to hardy and kissed him her hand behind his neck she was just his height and the angle felt strange but it was a good kiss that he didnt fight as much as he might have thought he should if hed thought about it she stepped back i just wanted to do that she said okay worse things have happened to me want to try it again she wasnt really coming on to him well maybe a little but he flashed on frannie from there to jane and then to the lambada going on through the door and he realized that it simply wasnt him i think it would be better if we didnt he said all right she said she took a final drag on her cigarette dropped and stepped on it i always guess wrong she said it was the pro forma san francisco womans first reaction to rejection hardy knewthe assumption that the man was gay for the record he said my sexual preference is more or less as it appears she looked straight across at him her height still a little disconcerting her face softened youre married involved and youre faithful that stung a little but hardy let it go as long as they dont find out she said whats the problem i dont tell warren hed leave me and there goes not only him but my career and i do love him but love and sexdont confuse em or youll screw them both up a few days before hardy could have said he didnt confuse them they went together maybe they still did with him but he had some figuring out to do im here about maxine and ray are you with the police no were you involved with maxine this time hardy laughed not how you might interpret it but it was with rusty ingraham was he a friend of yours why do you ask it like that is it so unlikely courtenay looked hardy up and down uh huh very hardy thought on that a minute hes dead what clearly shocked hardy told her about it he let some silence hang then the wrong guy might be getting blamed and i could be mixed up in that a friend of yours not exactly the police have this guy in custody hed threatened to kill me too hardy told her why but also said he no longer had anything to do with the police or the law so whats the problem if hes in jail hardy lifted his beer can to his lips found it empty and sat down on the steps courtenay sat next to him i guess i want to be sure i believe it i saw the guy today and got the feeling he didnt know what i was talking about he paused he didnt know maxine was there so why are you here because if the guy they got didnt do it somebody killed a friend of mine and nobodys looking for him or her hardy picked up his empty can again shook it found it empty he looked far up at her you want to tell me about ray she dug out another cigarette and lit it up whats to tell if hes the jealous type for example she blew smoke at the ceiling it broke his heart ill say that maxine and rusty she nodded he couldnt put it anywhere like its gotta be over or not right i mean maxines practically living with this new guy shes moved out what does ray think but he couldnt accept it you see that shrine to her in there all those picturesi think every damn composite she ever had doneand even after shes dead she huddled into herself its kind of freaky isnt it hardy didnt know if that was freaky or not what he wanted to know was whether ray had ever said he was going to do anything about it go get her back like that courtenay shook her head he had to acknowledge it first and he wouldnt do that she blew out smoke remembering every day hed come by while warren and i were editing always started out in control hows the film going blah blah and then hed see some shots of maxine and get stupid stupid like talk to her as if she were there argue with her try to talk her into coming back ask her on dates weird so finally it just got too much i mean were trying to get a film cut here and its pretty intense and ray comes ini dont know last week sometimeand warren just cuts loose on him tells him to get the fuck out until he gets it settled go see her figure out whats happening and deal with it she stubbed out the butt on the landing so then so he left and next thing you know maxine is dead killed with rays gun she turned her eyes on him is that true he says hed given it to her when she moved outfor protection she seemed to be wrestling with something well i dont know about that and the police havent arrested him they think they have a better suspect i told you she took that in wow he must be a good one a black guy on parole whod threatened to kill rusty and whose fingerprints were at rustys place she digested that yeah thats pretty good all right i didnt think rusty could kill maxine warren thinks he did but i just i dont know lets go see if we can find out hardy said it reminded hardy of college sitting on the floor after midnight van morrison was playing softly on the stereo the lambada people had gone home now it was just courtenay and warren him and ray the other three were smoking marijuana which hardy hadnt seen much of in recent years he told them he had a lung condition they were all in a corner in candlelight warren and courtenay nestled together into a beanbag chair ray and hardy on the floor hardy had switched to water after his fourth beer filling up the silver bullet can about half a dozen times the talk was about the movie business minor league warren had gotten four or five investors together and raised close to which by hollywood standards warren said wouldnt make a decent short but got the forty minutes of soft porn featuring maxine theyd watched earlier rays script was at least a credit and could help him get pitchmeetings with real studios down in la warren gave courtenay and himself a salary for directing and editing and warren got producer points which probably explained his new clothes the movado watch and hardy surmised his arm around courtenay it was hardy saw the entire world for these people everything was about could it work or not in a film hardy stretched out on the floor courtenay put her foot on his careful to make it seem casual whys it always a film what ever happened to the good old movies hardy asked i thought film was the stuff inside the camera warren looked wounded no film is videotape television jesus sorry its an important distinction ray said sure hardy agreed i get it film is for videotape but tape is the film used to make a film a real film like a movie courtenay pressed his foot in the camera i mean hardy figured he might be getting a little contacthigh he wiggled his toes by jove i think hes got it courtenay said playing henry higgins in my fair lady there was silence between songs then a low soulful saxophone began wailing sounds like somebody crying ray said can you blame her ray sat up who warren snorted who else hey come on you killed her ray warren said you come on shes not here ray was pretty stoned what the hell are you talking about look around warren said shes more here than we are the saxophone crescendoed hardy found himself like the others staring at the many faces bodies and poses of maxine weir it was eerie in the candlelight occasionally a flicker would make an eye appear to blink a cheek seem to twitch i didnt ray said courtenay rearranged herself he didnt she said to warren warren shifted to stoke up another joint come on the brace was so obvious i wouldnt never let that go in a film whats obvious ray asked you might as well have told everybody it was you hardy was now carefully watching them both ray just shook his head warren passed him the joint continuing everybody knew she didnt need the brace anymore putting it on her he spoke now to hardy explaining the whole thing started with the other guy rusty because of the insurance the accident you know then back to weir its too obvious ray you need to be more subtle hardy wondered if warren thought maxines death was some kind of joke some rehearsal for a scene hed seen her dead and naked neck brace and all and there hadnt been anything sexy or funny about it but he kept quiet he didnt do it courtenay insisted leave him alone warren i was here all night ray said you were not i know because i was here all night sitting on the steps drinking a sixpack waiting for you to come home even in the dimness hardy could almost feel weirs eyes shift maybe i was asleep i dont remember how many people you think dont remember what they were doing the night their wife died leave him alone warren well im one of them ray said i just know i was here i didnt go out i told the police that the police have got somebody else courtenay told warren theyre dreaming then warren said all this almost friendly casual in tone lowkey the joint going back and forth hardy listening watching the three of them toss it around as though it were hypothetical what got to hardy though was the fact that rays wife whom he supposedly loved even unto death was hardly cold was being cremated the next day and ray wasnt sad not at all he finally spoke up i know the guy they got and theyre not exactly dreaming warren exhaled into his theory now yeah well maxine dies ray isnt where he says he is he puts a neck brace on her to tell his friends thats just bullshit warren warren waved it right off to tell his friends what hes done what a mensch he is for gods sake so the message is out you dont fuck around with ray weir especially if youre his property ray stood up a little wobbly everybodys going home he said the casual tone was gone warren ignored him and to top things off ray now gets eightyfive grand insurance money all to himself to start financing his next film which he already talked to me about what are you trying to do warren get ray arrested what genuinely startled whos going to arrest him hardy on his feet found himself suddenly the center of attention not me gang im a private citizen scouts honor shit ray said ive had enough of this im tired but youre getting eightyfive thousand dollars hardy asked ray shrugged its no secret maxines insurance warren and courtenay were also up now hardy backed up a step and took in the trio if youre so sure he said to warren why dont you turn him in warren crossed over to ray and draped an arm over his shoulders he smiled one doesnt turn in ones friends and ray and i are friends now were doing business too you just like to have your partners be straight with you thats all i am being straight it came out like a whine warren looked at ray i love you man but you are not being straight with me ray cast a pleading glance at courtenay who put her hands deep into her pockets and tossed her head come on warren she said whatever it is its not maxine hes allowed to have some secrets yes cant i have a little private life a little love life sure if thats it why dont you just tell me he looked at his shoes im not exactly proud of this warren but okay maybe you ought to know we are partners i heard you knocking out there i uh i had someone with me a woman warren backed up a step so whats the problem you couldnt tell me about having a woman over here i know her ray shook his head she was like he stopped i paid for it courtenay stepped in ray felt guilty about it warren cant you understand that but he told you he got it off his chest warren draped an arm over ray whats to feel guilty about man were friends you can tell me ray shrugged you know with maxine and all warren was matter of fact hey she left you remember you didnt know she was going to get killed that night i know but id been such a pain in the ass with you and court about my broken heart and all i just needed somebody hey we all do right its better than me thinking you killed somebody i couldnt believe the police hadnt already picked you up well i told the police and court i just didnt want it spread around now ive really got to get some sleep okay tomorrows going to be a long day hardy still couldnt detect any warm air coming from the cars heater and he only had another five blocks until he got to frannies he wondered if luxury cars had heaters that came on hot then he supposed most people who bought convertible canvasroofed fourwheeldrive vehicles as he had done didnt have heat on the top of their priority list ray weir was lying he hadnt told the police he had an alibi to the contrary in fact so much so that if louis baker should somehow get himself clear ray weir would pop up next on the who killed rusty ingraham hit parade especially with this new money angle he had jealousy going for him as well as some significant monetary gain to say nothing of his gun being the murder weapon warren had been right about his friend absent the alibi ray was a good call for the trigger and every bone in hardys body felt that the alibi was bogus so courtenay seemed to believe him people tended to believe things that were confided to them especially when on the surface at least those things didnt speak too well for the confider but for just that reason clever people and ray weir was starting to look solid for that category had been known to confide intimate lies an effective techniqueand in this case it had gotten courtenay to back up ray she was also predisposed which helped hardy wondered if shed pressed ray at all about who hed been with where they had gone he figured not the fact that he had opened up to her about it would have been enough for her the details wouldnt have been important ray was feeling guilty about sleeping with someone else betraying the object of his adoration and on the very night of maxines death as it turned out he just had to bare his soul to someone to his close friend courtenay it was haunting him tearing him up oh yes hardy parked across the street from frannies door and turned his front wheels into the hill to prevent runaway he sat shivering hands tucked under his armpits wondering if glitsky might start to care again if he found out about the insurance money it sure couldnt hurt to bring it to his attention but why why not be happy about louis baker being off the streets again wasnt that the goal shouldnt he just move back home and go back to bartending at the shamrock on tuesday and pick up his life where hed left off and be grateful hed survived except what was he going to pick up frannie might have called this a window in time and maybe for her things could go back to being the samehe didnt really believe that frannie was in his life now in a far different way than shed been before and of course that had changed the space where jane had been so carefully placed and what about old diz himself hed always thought of himself as a pretty good citizen a man of some principle if not part of the solution then at least not part of the problem either but now a little shake of the cart and diz the white knight is ready to give up louis cause hes done some bad shit sometime maybe not what theyre getting him for but something he wondered not for the first time how hed feel if baker hadnt been black but shivering in his suzuki seppuku since he was being honest with himself he knew absolutely how hed feelhed feel outraged that louis baker was being denied due process that louis baker was being railroaded because of his background not that he might not have done it but whether or not he did they werent checking it out the way they should so why wasnt he outraged is it diz because maybe this blackwhite thing here in the liberated s was really only a matter of degree turn the fear up a notch and take a look at your true stripes hardy perceives his life threatened by bakerwhether or not thats realityand to protect himself hardy is delighted to lock baker away forever or sit him in the gas chamber but wasnt that always the reason you perceive that your way of life your neighborhood whatever is threatened and your instinct is to protect yourself you dont worry about justice the right thing you just want the damn threat to go away the fear to go away and you dont really care finally if the fear is baseless you just dont want to be confronted by it you dont want to live with it or even see it so you dont let them on your bus or in your neighborhood or date your daughter hardy rubbed his eyes feeling defenses rise against this vision of himself that wasnt him some of his best friends etc etc look at abe glitsky for christs sake and remember that just last night louis baker had in fact shot at the police while breaking and entering janes house this wasnt some poor lamb he was dealing with here fine grant that but is he a murderer more particularly did he kill rusty and maxine what happened out at holly park doesnt have shit all to do with dismas hardy does it diz yeah but heres what it does have to do with if baker hadnt killed rustyand okay maybe that was still a big ifthen the guy or woman thank you courtenay that did it ray weir for instance was sure getting helped out by dismas hardy pointing at louis baker and saying trust me im an excop and thats your man which hardy had in fact done if any of this was so and if baker admittedly no saint had not killed rusty then hardy found himself in a position that pissed him off because somebody had put him in this thing maybe even helped him set up baker for a fall he thought hed like to find out who and kick some ass hardy opened his car door and stepped out into the street he had no desire to go back to his house or to start bartending in two days he owed it to himself to find out what was really going on here he looked up at the stars louis baker could personally rot for all he cared he knew that but the situation surrounding him was tying hardy in knots and until he could get some of them untied he wouldnt be free to get on with his life chapter sixteen its a fantastic opportunity manny gubicza was afraid of this reaction treadwell was excited and didnt seem to understand his lawyers reluctance manny should have asked him to come down at lunchtime to discuss this in person but he had another appointment at lunch and with his powers of persuasion all he would have to do to treadwell was pass along the das offer and explain how stupid it wasthat is if treadwell listened to him its a trap gubicza said how can it be a trap i didnt make this up remember the bastard did kill my poppy i know well fred was really hot for this the lawyer spoke in a measured voice i think we can assume fred that the da isnt suggesting a polygraph because they want to help your case but it doesnt matter once i please let me finish the offer is that you come down and go over the statement youve already made and if the polygraph checks theyll proceed on the medina angle right thats what i want no its not what you want manny fred listen theyre going to have to come up with at least a hearing anyway and eventually an indictment theyve already got your statement medina did it and hell be punished for it but they said they werent going to i know they didnt believe me they were going to interview medina and hell deny everything and they wont have any evidence and theyll drop it they might try but havent we been using the media to tell this story as much as anything else hasnt that been working he heard the change in his ear treadwell had switched him from the speakerphone look manny this whole thing hinges on my credibility treadwell was whispering insistently you think ill let them get me on raines and valenti no way if you know its a trap you use it for your own ends i know you think only a lawyer can be any good under questioning thats not true fred manny lied but all i do is tell them what happened again and theyll see its the truth think what the media could do with that its perfect for us manny punched up his own speakerphone putting treadwell on it and stood up he paced behind his desk fred heres a hard truth in the legal world to the extent that something is not completely controlled by you its the enemy this is not a friendly little parlor game lives are at stake yours for example valenti raines medina people cheat in these situations manny didnt think he had to point out that he and fred were cheating from the gitgo that wasnt the point the point was to build your case from what you decide are the facts youre going to use they were doing that very well he didnt want fred anywhere near a polygraph though the results of a liedetector test were not admissible at trial it could be a damaging tool especially at the prehearing stage he stopped at his window looked down the street across at the pyramid he walked over to his desk again i cant let you do it fred so were just going to pack it in admit that we lied its not that it even seems like its that to me think what the da will do with it the da will just continue plodding along and drop medina gubicza hung his head putting his weight on the back of his chair they will probably not pursue it with much vigor he admitted but medina has to be punished fred compare that goodmedina being punished with the much greater good of you not going to jail for murder he hated to raise his voice but it was happening if they trip you up on raines and valenti not only do those two guys walk its likely you go down and once theyve got you seated and hooked up to a polygraph they might just ask you anything and it might not be about hector medina and poppy so just make them promise they wont gubicza cleared his throat make them promise they wont he repeated sure make that a condition dont you think that request might be showing our hand just a little bit how warming to it now treadwell was making his case look they want to talk about hector medina we say okay but thats all theyll understand that i mean we dont want to muck around with the murder investigation this is a separate issue tied in maybe but separate we build my credibility we get hector its perfect quit saying that fred nothings perfect he sat back down in his leather chair god i hate this kind of monday he said fifteen blocks downtown art drysdale hung up his telephone and walked down to his bosss office he nodded to dorothy lockes secretary and just kept going christopher locke the elected district attorney of the city and county of san francisco was on the telephone himself seated at his desk and waved his old friend to sit down instead drysdale went back outside and helped himself to a cup of coffee hows business he asked dorothy planting himself on a corner of her desk before she could answer locke called from the other room art drysdale shrugged weve got to do this more often he said to dorothy then whispered do me a favor love and keep the phone quiet for about two minutes he went back through the doors closing them behind him what locke said he was studying a file on his desk and didnt look up thats why they keep electing you drysdale said the warm charming exterior the man behind the office locke sighed shaking his head keeping it down what he repeated you owe me a buck drysdale said it took a second but then locke stopped reading and brought his eyes up to meet drysdales get out of here he said swear to god gubicza agreed to it with conditions what that we dont ask any questions nothing about raines and valenti so whatd you do i agreed of course so what are you gonna do i said and i quote on my mothers grave i will never mention those names or anything about those cases so how are you going to bring them up drysdale sipped at his coffee well i thought id have the polygraph set up downtown here that way ill avoid the temptation to go stand on my mothers grave may she rest in peace which is where i said i wouldnt bring up the murder raps samson wasnt really in didos class or louis bakers he had this sloppy way heavy not tight with long dreadlocks none too clean and didnt put out the kind of vibe dido had done where when it wasnt business he was okay dido could laugh and shoot a hoop or two he bought lace his shoes like that and even baker you could talk to him stuff about the cut this an that the paint the mama if dido had to go lace could have maybe gone in with louisat least until louis killed dido then maybe not but if dido had just died or moved on stead of louis having done it yeah but that hadnt gone down at all now they was both of em clear of the cut and samson was a whole different breed of badness moving in like here monday not yet noon cold as the landlord lace and jumpup only sitting at the curb and he come by just to show em and kick em into the street now whats that shit this my cut now he say and they watch him walk one end to the other couple of his troops tagging where they he and jumpup spose to go now nat glitsky was seventytwo years old and spent most of his time now since emma had died in the synagogue at fulton and arguello which was where his son abe had picked him up they drove north up park presidio through the city and took lombard over to van ness then to broadway through the tunnel and into north beach nat had a fondness for big italian lunches and if his son was paying you couldnt do better than caps which had been serving the same meals since he was dating emma it had been one of the few good restaurants he could take her to that didnt mind having a black woman eating with the whites hard to remember those times especially now when there was every kind of humanity seated at the tables nat kept his yarmulke on but hung his jacket on the back of his chair the waiter came and he said hed have a negronicampari bitters and gin how can you drink that medicine abe asked after hed ordered his iced tea nat patted the hand of his only child there certainly was a lot of emma in himshe hadnt much cared for negronis either he wondered if maybe it was something about being part or all black negroni would he try to develop a taste for a drink called a hymonie or a kiker but his son was thrashing in deeper waters all during the ride over here theyd been talking about abes projected move to los angeles nat wasnt for it what was he going to do without his family around but he didnt bring that up yet no sense in getting all riled up about a maybe and abe was still just talkinghe hadnt made up his mind at least nat didnt think so not yet and if nat knew abe it wasnt so much even the move to la that he needed to talk about that was just a decision and abe had never had a problem with decisions at least not to talk to his father about what abe had trouble with sometimes was lining up the crosshairs so he could get his bead on the real issue well everybody had that problem nat thought decisions tended to make themselves once you had everything else lined up most people just didnt take the time acted impulsively made the wrong moves not abe though not usually anyway which was why they were sitting here now their drinks arrived and they clinked their glasses lchaim nat sipped put the glass down and made a kissing sound two or three times savoring the taste in his mouth at least abe looked well rested and why not he had flo the great kids the important stuff worked out but he listened while abe kept repeating himself about his job this the job that nobody cared some friend of hishardywith a problem finally he held his hand up so what are you saying here he asked then shrugged the job isnt good so change the job you dont have to do the same job somewhere else but im a cop dad its what i do you do something else youre a man first am i right yes but of course i am now you listen to me how old are you not a child okay so you know a job a job is the same i dont care where you are you telling me a cop in new york or tel aviv is different than a cop in san francisco or los angeles no i dont believe it more i know it look at me i ambefore i retireby the grace of god i have a trade i can fix things first im a kid in delawaredelaware i know you know this but listen im fixing bicycles and sewing machines in delaware i go to school i can do things with engines and now they start calling me an engineer and i get a job in california in a little shop so the shop gets bigger and they sell it to somebody else i dont like how they do business i move on another shop two three all the while im raising you and trying to keep your mother happy which you and i know is some kind of fulltime endeavor and you know what i find the job is a job i dont care if its old mr levines shop on dupont street or lockheed down in san carlos you do your job and you get paid so you can live your life but your job is not your life nat lifted his glass again puckered shook his finger at his son you should know this abraham this is not nuclear physics were discussing here abe grinned tightening the scar through his lips okay what else am i gonna do what do you wanna do i want to be a cop you cant be a cop here in san francisco what have i been telling you tell the truth i dont know some people are making gold bricks some others taking the easy way so what what does that have to do with you it affects how i do my job why is that you tell me why that is come on dad theres all kinds of cooperation needed to finish a case any case baloney excuse me abraham but kosher baloney abe shook his head you dont know i dont know you telling me i dont know he reached over the small table and rested his hand over his sons look twenty years ago youre in school your mothers starting to get sick they hire a new supervisor they call a vicepresident at the ford plant over to fremont you remember the place so the new man tells mei am quality control manager at this timehe tells me we have to cut costs dont spend so much time checking everything i tell him cut costs doesnt mean cut corners he looks at me like im from mars we got to cut costs he says bottom line so its my job i cant quit i mean i can but is it worth it for the trouble to you and your mother no its not and the moral is the moral is this man makes it hard to do my job he cuts staff hours ups production schedules damn near impossible we having the special the waiter was standing over them taking their orders the special started with soup and bread and proceeded through pasta salad a main course roast pork today ice cream spumoni and coffee so what happened abe asked so eventually they shut down the plant abe chewed bread for a minute did i miss something the point is while there was a job to do i kept doing it right but theres always something everywhere you go he buttered some bread of his own all im saying is this you want to be a cop dont kid yourself itll be different in la youre either supported or youre not but what does it matter youre raising your family youre doing something worthwhile but but what you dont do nat interrupted is you dont do it halfassed he looked up at the waiter who had brought the soup and a carafe of red wine bring a glass for my son here would you he said hes taking a day off now see abe said his spoonful of spumoni halfway to his mouth the very case ive been talking about he indicated a young burly man who was nodding his way across the room nat always said it could be a very small world sometimes you eat your ice cream have another cup of coffee i think ill just go have a word with him nat shrugged how could it hurt the man was talking to the waiter as abe pulled out a chair and sat himself backward on it dont mind me he said then to the waiter id like an herb tea please his tab that right johnny sure sergeant glitsky put on a smile and asked johnny laguardia how he was doing he was doing fine he tucked his napkin in over his tie and rearranged the silverware a little in front of him he kept his sports coat on probably for the same reason abe hadnt taken his off it was awkward showing your piece in a public place hed been a very sweetfaced teenager abe supposed but now in his late twenties there was starting to be a fleshiness under his cheeks and just a hint a premonition of jowls his eyebrows were starting to meet over his fighters nose and his thin forehead under the still thick black hair was shiny with oil hed shaved very close and abe could see the tiny capillaries through the stretched skin on his face could smell the overstrong cologne johnny fiddled with his water glass now he wore three heavy rings on his right hand im here with my father abe said motioning over to where nat was thats nice johnny said he looked over creased his brow came back to abe he must of left halfturning abe saw that he hadnt old guy with the skull cap on thats my dad he enjoyed watching johnny having trouble doing the math yeah well its good to get out with the old man he said the waiter brought johnny a beer and abe his herb tea they both took small sips abe waiting it out finally johnny put the glass down so whats going on he asked your name came up the other day then im in here eating lunch and here you are and i think what a coincidence i think maybe we can talk and it saves me two or three days of running around howd my name come up abe pulled the chair right up against the table lowering his voice thats the thing johnny your name came up talking about prints we found at the scene of a murder johnny shook his head goddamn what rusty ingraham right johnny drank off half his beer put it on the table belched politely and said shit i knew it knew what johnny you lose your temper you get in trouble yeah that happens a lot you lose your temper with rusty hey i didnt kill him nobody said you killed him you think i killed him youre wrong the girl neither read my lips johnny we dont think you killed them we got another suspect in custody at county hospital we think he killed them which is why hes under arrest but what i was curious about was your fingerprints and you knew the girl was there she was already dead and rusty was he already dead johnny shook his head i never saw no rusty the girl was in the hall blocking the back of the place i took a look at her and didnt do like the inventory you just took off hey sergeant what am i gonna do call the cops what do you think they do they find me with a couple stiffs what am i doing now this is different you got a guy on ice already if itd been me called the cops you wouldnt even be looking for him cause id be your suspect glitsky hated to admit it but johnny wasnt too far off on that one especially lately he sipped some tea yeah but the fingerprints johnny i could take you in on those but you got a suspect so now lets say im just curious an inquisitive guy like myself i hate when i dont know how everything fits together maybe i should get a lawyer or something abe cupped his hands around his tea still close in still whispering johnny youre not under arrest we are talking thats all loan sharks arent my beat if its not homicide im not busting anybody johnny finished his beer the waiter came with minestrone johnny ordered another beer then tore off a bite of bread swirling it around in the soup okay he said okay heres the deal ingrahams vig was six glitskys eyebrows went up a week johnny nodded thats how we do the vig capisce six hundred dollars a week johnny popped some bread into his mouth guys pay more so anyway wait a minute what was ingraham doing business with you for he owed what six grand why didnt he get it from other sources like where how bout a bank for example he was a lawyer he mustve had credit johnny shook his head banks generally dont lend money to put on the ponies ingraham played the ponies a slug of beer the ponies owned the sucker the guy was a mess he put his spoon down one of these guys that say he hits the daily double he stays around for the exacta and puts the extra money down on it was he any good guys like that are never good theres something else pushing em its like a sickness i been collecting vig from him on and off since i started working for mr tortoni just keeps getting bigger and bigger and hes never paid it off the principal no way he gets that kind of money he plunks it on some nags nose abe had finished his tea the waiter came by and put down a steaming plate of ravioli taking away the soup bowl hows a guy get into it that deep johnny lifted his shoulders i told you he cant help it he gets a hunch hes gotta play it you know thats how it all started a couple hundred he didnt have twenty a week vig who cant make that then the vigs a hundred one week he cant make the hundred so he rolls it borrows more to pay the vig between you and me this is suicide but he keeps paying the vig keeps growing so what happened at rustys johnny studied a piece of ravioli on his fork for a minute i been in some heat with mr tortoni lately couple guys stiffing me coming in short he shrugged trying to make light of it but abe could see his worry its business you know and mr tortoni is someone who takes his business very serious so so i gotta explain to mr tortoni about how theres a body at ingrahams plus theres no money so im short six hundred there on top of shorthe pausedother places he put his fork down without eating abe had the impression he was about to tell him something more personal but the moment passed he shrugged again went back to his food so i got mad i was in trouble here you understand and whatd you do first you broke in the face closed up johnny b and e is not murder either i dont give a shit if you broke the door down we had an appointment he was supposed to be there okay so im inside theres this body i know mr tortonis getting no money here it really pissed me off i wanted to throw something knock something down so you grabbed the lamp yeah threw it down it didnt help much you ever get it worked out the anger johnny seemed to be remembering something he let out a breath i guess thats why they invented pussy he said chapter seventeen hardy remembered the days when he had been so into his work at the das office the hours passed unheeded trying to piece together something that didnt fit deciding on an interrogation strategy formulating an opening or closing statement thinking hard caring so damn much he stood at the door to tony feeneys officethe dressforsuccess assistant da who had hated rusty ingraham was lost in his own musings he was halfturned back to the window feet up on his desk far away from anything that was happening in his here and now reluctant to pull him from the reverie hardy knocked the feet came down a hand came out over the desk shaking it hardy said dismas hardy from the other day sure how you doin hardy said he was starting to feel like a cop again doing legwork you ever get over to see hector medina hardy kept standing he shook his head hes not a happy man feeney settled back a little into his chair no no i dont suppose he is did you read about his latest yeah its interesting anything to do with him seeing you i dont know i doubt it he called ingraham last week then this dog thing something seemed to get him going feeney sat up he called ingraham no shit no shit hardy pulled over a metal chair and sat down but i wanted to ask you about something else you said the other day i was playing poker feeney held up his hands smiling making a joke then what did i say you were telling me about how rusty got hector medina into all this there was some woman you said somebody he was trying to prove something with feeney didnt even have to think about it he nodded karen moore he said but she cant fit into all this she and rusty were years ago everybody in this got connected years ago hardy brought him up to date on the baker investigation or lack of it hey nobody else is looking this old stuff could be related thats all feeney nodded popping a life saver thats not an entirely unreasonable theory but its still a hell of a long shot you still going on the assumption ingraham is dead ingraham is dead thats what you said last time hardy sat back how come nobody seems to want to believe this guy is dead oh i want to believe it it would enhance my inner peace to believe it i would very much like him to be dead but we like bodies missing bodies arent neat hardy knew what he was saying the case against baker rested on his motive for killing ingraham not maxine and the das job without an official finding that rusty was at least dead would be to try maxines murder before a jury that might have a hard time believing baker killed maxine when he had no motive didnt even know her the alleged death of ingraham would be irrelevant and inadmissible if he killed her because she was around and in the way when he killed ingraham well okay but without ingraham an official homicide it would be a hard sell im convinced rustys dead hardy said his blood was all over his barge he fell overboard got washed out in the bay now he was going after louis he realized never mind his other doubts he had to play this straight maybe hes scared maybe hes hiding and maybe hes fish food feeney smiled ill grant that its possible maybe even likely and you dont think its baker hardy gave it a second thats whats funny if id gotten this case when i was working herei mean just the file on baker leaving out the other suspects id do a number on it as glitsky tells me when hes being real professional all the elements are there except the body of course not exactly a detail except that a good expert witness someone exactly like myself should be able to convince a jury that rusty collapsed overboard and the tide took him out which is what you believe hardy chewed his cheek that one im going with well if you buy that baker was there which i guess youve got to whats the problem i just cant seem to convince myself absolutely that hes all of it problem is i seem to be one of the players and i dont know what game it is it makes me nervous feeney nodded so i thought id start over at the beginning youd said there was a woman involvedwith ingraham there always was right and there was maxine weir dead on his barge from what youve told me id start with her her husband you mean feeney nodded the stats dont lie look to the spouse especially this case money jealousy the works why didnt glitsky take him in well he may have had an alibiim not sure if he mentioned it to abebut they also had baker ah yes the convenient baker why do you say that because baker solves two outstanding homicides three if you include ingraham and thats good for the departments numbers he ran a finger through his thick hair it might not be laziness on paper bakers a righteous suspect but you dont think hes guilty feeney held up a hand im just playing devils advocate you cant have it both ways if ingrahams deadand im not saying hes notthen bakers a good bet so is maxines husband but if ingrahams not dead it opens a few other cans of worms im sure hes dead maybe baker did him maybe weir you said weir had an alibi maybe an alibi so find out why waste your time with karen moore maybe it goes all the way back to medina why is he part of the action again just at this time hardy saw the skeptical look but pushed on look whatevers going on here began with ingraham hes the reason im in it medina baker ingraham me something started nine years ago if it leads me back to maxine weir ill get back to rays alibi and you think karen moore may know something hardy shook his head i dont know she might not know what she knows karen moore was an investigator for the district attorneys office a jurisdiction separate from the regular police department one of her colleagues told hardy that she was down at hunters point trying to bring in a juvenile witness she would be back sometime that afternoon but he couldnt say when he was back in the corridor now just after lunch and people were reentering courtrooms after the recess the halls were crowded hardy walked to a phone booth and called frannie at work are you still mad at me she asked i wasnt i just had to go out eddie said that before he went out he got killed im not eddie frannie and i didnt get killed and youre still out i am she was silent are you going back to your house eventually i suppose tonight hardy thought about it i dont know what would you like i dont want to fight you about every time i walk out the door id like you to come back tonight you know ive got to keep doing this until its figured out okay i know that dont get hurt will you hardy smiled hurts not in the game plan he got the logon from lanier who had been writing up a report in the otherwise deserted homicide room where he had gone to see if abe had had a change of heart and come to work no in fact abe had called in sick hardy saying he was referred by tony feeney left a message where hed be for karen moore when she got back got himself a diet coke and found the rooma regular office with a solitary terminal on a pitted desk this was san franciscos incident reportsuspect computer one terminal no fulltime operators random unsupervised logons they had not had anything when hardy worked here so he supposed this was an improvement but it was still far from the state of the art he did not feel he was looking for anything just killing time but sometimes killing a few minutes could be productive he typed in louis bakers name it was an interesting screen according to the computer louis bakeralias lou brock louis clark lou rawls the guy had a sense of humor all right street name puffer whatever that meantwas still doing his time in san quentin hardy wondered how far behind the computers records were he punched in hector medina whose name did not appear at all well that made some sensehed been cleared twice ray weir was in the database though nine years ago there it was again he had been arrested for brawling at a fortyniners game the arresting officer was not medina there was no record if ingraham had been involved he had pleaded nolo contendere and gotten off with a twohundreddollar fine in he got busted for misdemeanor marijuana possessionanother hundreddollar fine he had an outstanding warrant on an unpaid parking ticket hardy drank some coke so ray was a brawler too or had been and as hardy already knew a heavy user of marijuana maybe other drugs emotional enough to cry in front of other people over his lost love how emotionally unstable was he what if he was on dope strung out violence prone and had gone out as warren had at first suggested to settle things with maxine rays alibi hardy was thinking had better be verifiable he took down a few particulars from the screen on his yellow pad rusty ingrahams cara blue volkswagen jettahad indeed been reported stolen on august but that was all the computer had on rusty so the database wasnt more than about three weeks behind which hardy figured wasnt so bad he was starting to take down the information on the car when there was a knock mr hardy hardy stood up sergeant moore she laughed perfect white teeth in a models face karen please tony feeney beckons i jump how can i help you she boosted herself up like a schoolgirl on the edge of the desk she was dressed in what looked like some kind of uniform though it wasnt a set of patrolmans blues the pants were baggy and a leather jacket with her sergeants stripes covered her blouse she looked bulky which hardy guessed was a good cover any kind of close look revealed a toned body on a short frame if she wore any makeup shed stop traffic but she didnt and with nothing to set off the high cheekbones the deepset black eyes the wide sensuous mouth she was only pretty very i dont know if you can im looking into something that happened a long time ago for tony is this an active case no not strictly for tony he gave me your name she waited its a little personal hardy said rusty ingraham warily rusty ingraham theres a blast from the past how is rusty actually rustys dead or appears to be he explained the ambiguity well im sorry to hear that she said when he had finished are you rusty and i were old news we split up amicably enough tony feeney acted like hed just won the lottery when he heard she nodded id believe that tony hated rusty a lot of people hated rusty i didnt i felt sorry for him finally finally well at first i was attracted to him you knew him hardy nodded then you know he was pretty charismatic very charismatic never lost a case star of the show that was rusty and i was this black single mother of a tenyearold daughter and excuse me when was this were talking i guess nine or ten years ago and you had a tenyearold then hardy had been figuring her for her late twenties karen laughed acknowledging the compliment im thirtysix mr hardy and im also a grandmother but thank you you dont look like a grandmother no i know i work at it too i like to think on a good day i can give my daughter a run id bet on you so back when she was ten you had this thing with rusty i was flattered it was also the first white man id gone out withhardy noted the firstand at the time i saw it as a bit of a coup you know i didnt realize rusty saw me foxy young black chickthe same way a conquest another victory he searched her eyes for some sign of pain or loss and saw none ingraham might have been an old schoolteacher sometimes remembered sometimes fondly so how long did you two go out she looked up at the ceiling id guess close to a year maybe ten months that was about his limit a year then whoever he was seeing would suddenly be last years model you know and there was nothing to show off there and you didnt resent that actually i saw it coming and beat him to the punch by that time i had him pretty well figured out and was starting to feel sorry for him and you cant love somebody you feel sorry for whyd you feel sorry for him i thought he was this super success well thats why it was a sickness i really believe that that he was a sick man he couldnt lose at anything or even have the appearance of losing he didnt care about what was realit was all the appearance so what happened with hector medina well i think thats mostly why i broke it off he just had to prove to me that he was right about medina hed said it in front of a group of us and he wasnt going to back down we fought about it i wanted him to just let it go i mean what did it matter medina might not have been a great cop but he wasnt worse than a lot of others he had a family all that why stir it up the original investigation had cleared him but rusty got on his high horse and there was no getting him off but why thats the question isnt it at first no doubt about it he thought it impressed me or would impress me solo prosecutor takes on the police department and district attorneys office and brings in a righteous conviction he thought it would make him more romantic the serpico of san francisco and that passed the part about impressing you i mean well it never really worked but after he committed himself she shrugged but that was just rusty his ego and to hell with medina right oh medina didnt even exist to rusty he was just another trophy like i was i guess he eventually got off again anyway but lost his job i know no one believed him after the second investigation but there wasnt enough evidence to bring him to trial so he walked but to everybody he was a killer cop do you think he was he had a reputation for being mean little things lots of guys domaybe an extra thwack with the sap cuffs tight enough to cutnothing heavy but they came out in the investigation you know about now the accusation against him killing that dog he might have done that and how about rusty killing him after all this time hardy explained about the connection through the valenti and raines situation putting medina back into the action i dont know she said i guess it couldve powered him up but if he didnt do it when it was fresh would he now except back then he was married had a good job a future now hes divorced raising a daughter alone his job is nothing maybe it brought back all hes lost all that rusty made him lose he snapped over it karen slipped off the desk and walked over to the window she put her hands on her hips and did a couple of waist rolls keeping loose stretched like a cat turned around stranger things have happened but youve got to believe time heals at least a little if rusty did something else something new i could see it better you get any sign of that nope in fact medina told me he hadnt seen rusty in years although hed called him recently to say what nothing he said he changed his mind hung up there was another question in her eyes but she didnt ask it instead she said it might be worth checking his alibi hardy sitting ran his fingers over the keyboard in front of the terminal ill do that he said she came up behind him looking over his shoulder at the screen which still held the information about rustys car back to basics huh he was driving an old volkswagen hardy squinted at the glaring green terminal does that mean something it means he must have had a bad streak at the track he used to say hed never drive less than a lincoln hed rather walk so whats the track have to do with it i thought you said you knew him to hardy rusty had been another redhot young attorney much like himself trying cases and winning them putting bad guys away they got along fine in the office once in a while had drinks and discussed work that was it i guess not he said if you didnt know his gambling you didnt know him at all karen came around and sat on the desk again the track is what broke us up much more than hector medina if you want to know the truth although it was all part of the same thing i suppose the winning thing he said the ponies were the ultimate challenge he really believed or wanted to believe that you could learn enough follow the jockeys and horses closely enough so youd never have to lose he used to say it wasnt even gambling you could make it a sure thing not every race you understand but when you were sure you jumped and he was successful he did pretty well she glanced over at the screen again except when he lost which was often no but which tended to be big when he did she shook her head an old volkswagen who wouldve thought it he mustve been losing big hardys fingers drummed some more on the desk and thats what broke you up well it just showed me who he was its why i eventually came to feel sorry for him nobody wins all the time i dont care how good you are what you know but it was like a personal affront to him every time he lost hed go crazy the universe was against him nutso she was lost in the memory now a couple of times he hit on me for my check after blowing his losing on what he thought was a sure thing and not believing he could go out and lose my check the same way on the next race she met hardys eyes it was very sad really the addiction it was like he won at everything else so he purposely picked something he couldnt win at so it could verify that he was really at the bottom a loser or thats how he saw himself abruptly she brushed at her hair with her hand as if something of rusty had stuck in it and she wanted it out thats just my twobit psychology but it makes sense to me so you think he was a loser deep down all the way down there was just what hed won and what hed lost he just wasnt thereno person holding it all together giving any kind of focus and i think his biggest fear was that people would find out he wasnt the fantastic winner he tried to appear to be so he couldnt lose anything ever and yet he constantly tested that at the track i said it was a sickness he couldnt help himself the track was his litmus test when he beat it he could beat anybody if it started to beat him hed nosedive all over his life we finally broke up in one of the down cycles hardy thought of the rusty whod come into the shamrock the week beforea little down and out clothes not pressed riding public transport because his car had been stolen he still had the gab the line the presence but he wouldnt have impressed anybody as a man who could take on the universe hardly a winner karen pushed herself off the desk but the horses didnt kill him did they no hardy said it was somebody with opposable thumbs chapter eighteen okay ray weir was thinking ive waited long enough he had gone to the service that morning waited with courtenay and warren until they brought out the urn with what was left of maxine then theyd all ridden out under the golden gate with one of warrens money friends who owned a yachtchampagne toasting maxines memory dumping the ashes into the sea freezing their butts off now he was back home and hed waited long enough it was a legitimate question and he had all the paperwork here in front of him he had to wade through four receptionist types before he got someone who could talk to him he gave the number of the policy on maxines life then the dates of both the accident and the settlement agreement im just checking the status of the payment he said the woman asked him to wait and returned after most of i write the songs had finished playing in rays ear across the miles her voice was tiny you havent received it thats why im calling it must be in the mail she said rays hands tightened on the mouthpiece the checks in the mail when did you mail it she cleared her throat but didnt come back any louder just another minute please some connecticut radio station was playing soft hits all the time soft hits for the soft brained ray thought as they rocked into a muzak version of i am i said sir im still here there must be some mistake we sent the check for the full amount eightyfive thousand dollars ten days ago by registered mail return receipt requested overnight delivery and it was signed for byshe pausedby maxine weir ray suddenly felt lightheaded and had to sit down what do you mean he said sir i mean when was this after a short silence figuring it out we sent it out on friday so it probably yes here it is it was delivered on monday last week a week ago today to maxine weir yes sir the signature is very clear would you like me to send you a copy of the receipt ray almost had to laugh he hung up well it was possible the check was still at her apartment the policy was in both of their nameseither of them could sign it maybe the police had found it and hadnt notified him yet or she could have taken it down to the bank and deposited it they still had a joint account not that there was ever much in it he would call customer service he lit up a joint and punched buttons on his telephone no there had been no deposit made to the account would he like to talk to a manager he didnt know what hed like to do the world was spinning though he was back in the hall glitsky did not check into homicide if he ran into batiste or one of the guys he would say he was feeling better and had decided to come in otherwise hed keep it casual he might do a little work he was still thinking la but there were items to tie up here and his father was right if youre going to do it dont do it halfassed the filipino boy in the lab ghattas had been a help on saturday and he had no trouble locating the gun again ray weirs gun and bringing out the report on it he had stood on the other side of the counter while abe did a quick scan of the results you understand sir it was found in mud under about sixteen feet of water so you wouldnt expect any prints prints are funny you know oilbased its not so much you wouldnt expect them it wouldnt be a shock either way abe looked up from the report the boy had something else to say but well in fact we didnt find any abe tried to hide his disappointment but i got to thinking abe was starting to like this guy he grinned his scarslashed grin whatd you get to thinking well as i said the gun didnt have any prints but it didnt even have any smudges it was like it had never been held but it had been fired oh yeah no question about that but still even with the mud and salt water youd expect something some oil residue so but there wasnt anything which is maybe i dont know a little suggestive so i did a trace test for armor all armor all you know the car stuff hells angels got wise to this first you wipe a weapon down then spray it with armor all and you wont leave a print and there was armor all on this gun right and so and so that means that whoever shot the weapon knew about armor all uh huh he leaned over the counter eyes shining in his excitement it means the perp was a pro anybody else would have just wiped it down afterward dont you think glitsky acknowledged that okay so your shooter is in the business this isnt high tech but i wouldnt say its general knowledge either so if you got two suspects and one is say a civilian then maybe that one isnt so likely to be your guy ray weir abe said the husband a live one up to now its something to think about is all im saying drysdale was going over the ground rules again outside the window cars were starting to back up on the freeway heading toward the bay bridge gubicza leaned backward and could make out the clock on the union sign the day had been shot to hell on this idiocy and it wasnt over yet fred still enthusiastic and confident was in the process of getting hooked up by the polygraph technician a woman in uniform who with drysdale would be the only people present when fred was questioned this was mannys great concern polygraphs didnt work with distractionswith a trained subject they didnt work at alland manny would not be in the actual room when the procedure took place there would be no court reporter no other attorneys no one except fred drysdale and this woman who would probably sit behind fred out of his line of vision this wasnt as bad as it could be because drysdale had already presented manny and fred with a complete list of the questions he would be asking all either yes or no and lawyer and client had gone over them for the past hour making sure there was nothing fred might slip on so manny listened with half an ear figuring that if drysdale was planning on a blindside attack there was almost no possibility he would do it now so as i say drysdale droned on this isnt any formal proceeding but the nature of your allegationshere he smiled at treadwell at gubiczaare so so unusual that i believe youll get moreagain searching for the right wordmore enthusiastic cooperation from this office in general drysdale spread his hands out smiling everybodys friend this isnt me gentlemen im selling the whole package both to my boss and my staff and there is some concernpossibly justified at this stage im afraid well lets just say your cooperation here manny will enhance your and your clients credibility you dont believe me do you treadwell said fred please gubicza wasnt about to have his client get into an offtherecord discussion with art drysdale who beneath his benign exterior was one of the craftiest attorneys gubicza had ever opposed me drysdale acted shocked i totally believe you thats why im doing this were doing this he hiked a leg up on the table where the polygraph sat there was no guile on his face he wasnt trying to sell anything just convey information manny of course is right to treat this as though were adversarial here but without mentioning names im not giving anything away when i say that certain members of the staff here are skeptical but this today this is just ammo to use against those people so in a real sense for today at least were on the same side you tell me what happened with hector medina the polygraph corroborates itokay so its not formally admissibleitll get the team behind this case and thats what we both want it makes my job easier he spread his arms again his wide and sincere smile the technician was finished now and manny walked up behind fred and whispered that he should remember to stick to the questions asked and above all to try to keep calm then he left the room you can sit back if youd like drysdale said he himself pulled up an old office chair covered with yellow leather and crossed one leg over the other as you know we ask only yes and no questions so well start with the easy stuff to calibrate this thing your name is fred treadwell fred nodded please say yes or no im sorry yes your name is fred treadwell yes they ran through the usual opening questionsname address day of the weekgetting used to the slight scratch of the pencil on the lined paper the hum of the machine this isnt so bad is it drysdale said no fred said and drysdale noted the skip in the pencil so it was getting to him actually the subject didnt have to say anything to get a reading the body reacted even when the words werent said drysdale knew this was counting on it and on treadwell not understanding it okay lets tell a couple of lies but if i know im not trying to deceive by giving a false answer the machine will register true wont it drysdale gave him a broad grin you get this stuff dont you youre right so try and deceive me a little on this next set okay he leaned forward in his chair were still in the test phase here all right fred nodded licking his lips he looked to the door behind drysdale as though seeking assurance that manny was out there to help him if he needed it you have worked at your current job eight years is that correct yes true and youve lived two years in your apartment yes false two years build on the falsehood and see what he does and you have painted it during that time the time i lived there or the last two years very good fred drysdale thought he said im sorry have you painted the apartment in the past two years no true and your apartment is on the second floor no false so its on the third floor pause yes false but if you fell from the third story wouldnt you do more than sprain your ankle that wasnt one of the questions a light sweat had broken on freds forehead all innocence drysdale held up his hands it seemed to spring naturally from the previous answers not pushing it he looked over at the polygraph look in any event the machine seems to be working properly he came back to fred youve not lived in your apartment two years and the apartment is not on the third floor are both of these statements correct yes drysdale glanced at the machine again took in a breath and held it a minute letting it out in a rush he said all right the test is over lets begin drysdale had the typed questions in front of him he also had freds statement of facts on medinas attack which hed used to draw up the questions he started at the beginning and asked the questions in order lulling fred into a space where his confidence was growing with the polygraphs support to the point that he seemed almost unaware that he was wired it was just a conversation between drysdale and himself even if one side of it was only yes and no drysdale paused in the questioning all right he said now were where the talk with mr medina has turned to the alleged valentiraines assault on you is that correct it wasnt a question on the typed list but it was so natural that fred didnt seem to notice yes true and mr medina said he represented mr raines fred didnt answer mr treadwell thats not one of the questions drysdale settled back in his seat not pushing it yet fred were corroborating the events of last friday night right you want to look at your own statement of facts you mention valenti and raines he was all reason im not getting back to that caseim verifying the facts in this statement but it wasnt one of the questions drysdale smiled come on fred so i missed one i made a mistake but if you want we can stop now if you dont answer this question i dont see where we can go from here the sweat had come back to treadwells forehead all right he said finally what was the question again medina said he represented raines yes or no yes true but he told you he had no formal connection to that case drysdale went from the questions to the statement of facts he said he wanted you to know about the damage that just accusing somebody can do to their life yes true and he wanted you to know that because he thought you were falsely accusing valenti and raines of beating you up good they were way off the question list now yes and then he grabbed your dog poppy was it treadwell swallowed off the list himself now remembering yes he was just petting it and he broke its neck yes yes he just he hung his head suffering through it again he broke your dogs neck because he thought you were falsely accusing valenti and raines no i mean yes yes he thought it or yes you had falsely accused them treadwell was looking around panic setting in he did it to threaten me he said to threaten my life if you didnt retract your story yes true your story your true story about valenti and raines yes he just your story about valenti and raines is true then is that correct yes yes its true that part is true false false false they did beat you yes false he killed poppy and they beat me false why dont you believe me he killed my poppy fred was slumped on his arms over the table he raised his head he killed my poppy drysdale reached over and patted his hand i believe you fred he killed your poppy fred put his head back down on the table drysdale kept patting his hand feeling dirty and sad i think were done here he said to the technician you can unhook him a rust sky presaged an uneasy dusk lace was wearing an armysurplus allweather jacket and collar up against the cold walked the periphery of holly park alone from time to time hed nod at one or another of the small groups of younger men hanging on stoops or by their wheels but no one asked him to join them or offered much more than a cock of the head jumpup was over to lorethras house inside with her and her mama and the little ones lace hed looked in at bakers mama but she had come back from the hospital with a bottle and it was way down already he passed didos old cuthis old cutcrossing the street away from it making clear he understood the new territory he stopped hands in his pockets and was startled by a hand on his shoulder he turned around easy my man samson had backed three steps away his dreadlocks hung like thick cobwebs around the obsidian smalleyed expressionless face laces heart was pumping pretty good as though theyd been having a conversation all this time samson said three ways it can go lace shook his shoulders loose the casual attitude he knew how samson was like an animal you show any fear around him and he attacks what is lace said the man be lookin askin around maybe sometimes the wrong stories get out i got no stories no see thats one way it can go you got no story maybe you hang in the cut run with me samsons teeth showed yellow same ol back to it right he stepped closer there was a brightness in the tiny eyes as though hed been using his product dido didnt go in for that when he was working well samson wasnt dido and lace had better get used to that other story samson said is the conbe talkin about taking over the cut how dido best be movin on like that come down to blood lace was thinking that if louis baker had wanted the cut and killed dido wouldnt he have stayed to hold the claim but he said whats three a cold wind from behind lace blew some leaves and papers up the street samson squinted into it at lace his eyes even smaller glinting be no three he said only two stories be no one tellin any third stories is what im saying lace wondered if the gun that had been used on dido the one lace had originally assumed had been louis bakers whether the gunsamsonswas still in the cut if he could find it and get his hands on it he clenched his fists inside the pockets of the jacket released them fighting the shivering that was threatening to take over i hear you he said hey i hear you its casual chapter nineteen the picture of eddie was still on frannies dresser she got home from work and changing into a sweatshirt and some jeans noticed for the first time that things werent fitting the same she reached for a dab of perfume and saw the photograph of eddie she stopped her hand still outstretched something curled up inside her eddie had been caught climbing up into a friends pickup down by dune beach one leg was up on the tailgate and hed just been turning around to answer as frannie had yelled something at him he was smiling his twohundredwatt smile and his hair was blown every which way his jacket collar turned up shed enlarged the picture to eight by ten and it hadnt been perfectly focused so there was a graininess to it that for some reason added to its immediacy forgetting the perfume she watched her hand go to the frame and she brought the picture back to the bed where she sat holding it on her lap eddie looked about eighteen in the picture impossibly young she closed her eyes it was hard to imagine that theyd been the same age eddie now stopped forever only eight months older than the photograph frannie felt shed aged a lifetime but the pregnancy kept things in real time the baby eddies baby growing inside her so slowly that it had hardly changed her yet there he washer manwaving back to her daring to claim back a little space charming her so shed let him back in the grief over eddies death had affected her differently than shed have thought the only way she found she could cope without crying all the time was to put him put their life together out of her mind actively not to remember how it had been how theyd been together move on look ahead or the few times shed let down allowed his memory back into her mind the anger would overtake her why did he have to go meddle in things that werent his business she thought shed loved his idealism but thats what had gotten him killed and she tried to convince herself that she even hated him for being that way because it was what took him away from her why did she have to have met him in the first place it wasnt fair eddies smile didnt fade didnt change it was grainy like an old photograph getting older every day smiling charming kidding her im still here frannie cant deny it forever ill bet the kid winds up looking like me a tear fell on the glass that covered the picture the kid one hand held the frame the other pressed itselfflat against her belly somehow had worked its way under the sweatshirt god eddie she thought come on this isnt fair what isnt fair he said that im in you that all this moving ahead and looking forward and getting together with diz thats okay i realize im gone is just setting yourself up for the fall later youve got to find a real place to put me i was your husband im the father of that little person in there dont hide me dont shut me out i dont deserve that if its painful im sorry but i miss you too dont you think i wish i could be there yes i do well then hardy came and sat next to her where she lay on the top of the bed the picture of eddie cochran face down on her stomach her hair was spread out behind her on the pillow the face slightly puffed what he said its just too soon i know it is ive been thinking the same thing she moved the picture of eddie to the floor put her hand on his thigh curled onto her side against him he rubbed her back inside the sweatshirt you are the only male friend i have dismas i am that i dont know what to do i dont know what ive done with eddie hardy patted her stomach eddies here thats what i mean im not just lonely she revised that im not even lonely im trying to find eddie and thats not fair to you move over hardy said she lay one leg over him her head in the hollow of his arm a hand between the buttons of his shirt because something in me loves you she said a lot but theres the other stuff there is he blew a breath out at the ceiling its pretty natural youre nesting you want a man around you trust me and i show up needing a place to stay its a neat little dream its more than that too hardy turned onto his side and undid the button on her jeans the zipper they finally feel a little tight she bit at his lower lip flicked her tongue against the tip of his his hand down inside her pants pressed against her see this is real too she said this part the kiss frannie undoing his pants freeing him another kiss deep and slow then more getting out of clothes and he was entering her breathing her in mouths together bodies close and hard pressed pushing but not moving her legs wrapping him holding him as far in as he could get the house was cold walking down the long hallway he checked the thermostat and saw it was at degrees by the time he got to the kitchen six steps later he heard the creaks in the responding furnace in his bedroom he realized he hadnt fed the fish in several days bad he shook some food over the surface and they didnt wait for him to tap the glass sorry guys he raised the blackout curtain in front of the one window in his office and looked back toward downtown out at the twinkling lights he could see the very tip of what the previous week had seemed the evil pyramid presiding like the triangular cyclops eye on the dollar bill over the shadowy line of jackson heights leaning out off to his right the once spectral sutro tower now vaguely benign thrust its fingers toward some high clouds the moon was up nearly full he wondered at the change in his perception of things he listened to his house creaking as the warmth spread in the pipes the sound wasnt ominous after the coal fire was going well after the heat had really kicked in after hed gone through all his mail except for one postcard sitting in the pool of light cast by the greenshaded brass lamp on his desk he switched on the rooms main lights and grabbed his darts from the board next to the fireplace these were his office darts the same type of custom gram tungsten beauties he carried with him at almost all times he hadnt thrown since hed left the house but in his first round shooting for the bull he hit two and the last one thokked low in the he picked up the postcard hong kong by night his exwife carrying the card with him he went back out through his bedroom to the kitchen he kept no hard liquor in the house but there were four bottles of anchor steam in the rack on the refrigerator door he found some frozen chicken breasts and in the cupboard a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of green beans he put the breasts in his heavy black allpurpose castiron pan poured the green beans and soup over them added a little beer covered the whole thing and turned the heat on low jane was appalled at his home cooking frannie had made him every meal at her house at the kitchen table bottle of beer in hand he read the back of the postcard where was he would he be home to get this well she guessed shed find out next week it wasnt exactly a game but neither was it very serious that was jane maybe it was serious but she just wouldnt acknowledge that anymore maybe with her marriage to him and then the second onethe reboundthat had lasted less than two months she could only let things get so serious and then pull back when their son michael had died he had to remember shed gone through it too sometimes it felt like it had only been him but that hadnt been because jane wasnt there it was because he was blind to anything else give her a break diz he was starting to smell the food he got up and made sure it wasnt burning sticking on the bottom and turned down the heat a little he opened another beer well what was there to be so serious about anyway she was good at her job and liked it she liked him too at least that she knew who she was he thought with a pang and though it had never come up that she was still faithful to him it wasnt just that hed slept with frannie frannie had told him tonight before and after theyd made love that she needed she felt they both needed more time he ought to go home and hed wanted to go home not to get away from frannie not to figure anything out just to be home what the hell did that mean that he didnt love frannie or jane the difference with frannie was that she let him see she needed him maybe not for everything maybe now only for some physical comfort some familiar warmth but the door was open jane might love him but he didnt feel like she needed anybody anymore so what was it with the hardy monster did he just need to be needed well if there wasnt some need how real could it be okay but how badly would frannie just need a father for her baby not necessarily dismas hardy it would be bad luck to get that part confused and when he and jane had first gotten back together there had been some serious voltage okay there had always been the attractionthat was still therebut maybe janes need at that time was to lay to rest the ghosts of their failed marriage to prove that it really had been their son michaels death that had destroyed her man dismas and not some failing in her now that done the point made it was time to coast the problem was that until a few months ago until hed gotten back with jane hardy had coasted for the better part of a decade he was coasted out now he was in gear ready to roll he thought about having a third beer decided what the hell and filled a plate with the chicken mchardy it tasted great frank batiste had the only real office with a door in homicide now he sat at his desk the door open a crack and for the first time in what seemed months felt some measure of satisfaction in his position in the department in the way things were shaking down for once he thought the good guys might be getting a break the word on the dropped charges in the valenti and raines investigation had spread through the ranksguys calling each other at home frank had personally called both men to tell them they were reinstated with back pay effective immediately at clarence rainess suggestion he did something else that was as much the source of his satisfaction as anything else hed gone down to judge lyons and explained the mutual exclusivity of the rainesvalenti and treadwell investigations and requested a warrant right now on treadwell which he got and served as treadwell sat flushfaced and shaken in art drysdales office treadwells lawyer had had a shitfit which did batistes soul some good and the bare fact was that now at pm fred treadwell was in the can on his doublemurder rap at least until the morning when bail would probably be set batistes prompt move on treadwell had also gotten out to his squad and they had been returning to the office in dribs and drabs catching up on things getting the further notice that batiste was personally okaying the overtime they needed to serve subpoenas write their reports do their work if he lost his job over that so be it you couldnt run this bunch of guys like a kindergarten without the risk of losing them and if he lost these handpicked pros then his own numbers and eventually his job would also go to hell so he sat enjoying the hum of men workingday guys in at night bullshitting getting coffee picking up mail and paperwork he was soaring on adrenalinegetting the warrant and arresting treadwell making some real management decisionsand was taking the opportunity to write it up for chief rigby sometime in the next week he was confident the city and county would find some way to clear the money for the overtime or they wouldnt find it in the budget and theyd have to borrow from another pot batiste thought even the most fuzzyheaded bleeding hearts among the supervisors might realize that taking killers off the street should be a priority item for a police department still homicide inspector wasnt a punchin job and it was plain stupid to act like it could be of course the powers that be in this loonytune city might still kick his ass over it fuck it he said fuck what abe glitsky was back standing in the doorway not looking very sick batiste had no intention of mentioning it oh i dont know take your pick the supervisors rigby and his chicken patrol he put the tip of his pen in his mouth come to think of it i ought to mention that they got money for that they can pay some overtime right on abe said pulling a chair out from the wall listen frank i want you to know ive sent in that application to la the lieutenant put his pen down dont do that glitsky shifted in the chair its already done well i mean dont go whatre you gonna do there in la what am i doing here you know what youre doing here we need you here glitsky smiled the scar a tight white line through his lips batiste held up a hand thats not bs abe i dont spout the line you know that and i need you here thanks frank thats nice to hear but if you get a call for a reference give them some kind words would you he nodded of course ill do that but look why dont you take a few days off think about it maybe youre just having a little burnout take a vacation i took today off and thought about it frank im not burned out i still want to be a cop worse i suppose i am a cop like it or not i just want to be able to do my job batiste ran down the days improvements yeah i heard thats great but its like a bandaid come on its not all that bad here its just bureaucracy and thats everywhere you think la will be better its so much bigger its got to be worse i cant see the chief in la pulling lab time over homicides cause some guys do a bullshit prank chicken shit frank corrected him and abe had to smile theres rot from the top frank and im not sure its just bureaucracy what it is is over batiste got up from behind his desk went and opened the door forget the past week and look out there business as usual abe half turned to look its like your wife has an affair thats ended and youre supposed to pretend it didnt happen sometimes maybe yeah he closed the door all the way but you didnt come in here to ask for a reference i mean you were already in on something else you ought to be an investigator frank figuring out shit like that batiste was back in his seat behind the desk he unwrapped a hard candy from his top drawer and popped it into his mouth so you were working said with satisfaction rusty ingraham glitsky grimaced im sounding like hardy but maxine weir yeah we got the perp on that dont we an arrest has been made right but tying things up different angles keep popping out he told batiste about his talk with johnny laguardia the fact that it looked like a professional had done the hit on maxine which could include medina or laguardia himself but seemed to rule out the husband wait a minute wait a minute batiste raised a hand this is all very interesting but what about the alleged perp whats his name baker baker what about baker hed pick up the armor all trick in the joint dont you think glitsky thought on it maybe so but the problem is also in my guts the problem is rusty ingrahams missing body the husbands lousy alibi except why would he know about armor all and todayam i wrongwe find our own hector medina going proactive on another violent crime whats going on batiste moved the candy around making a sucking noise you want my take it really sounds to me like you got the right guy shit abe theres always some loose ends this is not just loose ends frank abe said this is a hair ball louis baker wasnt going back in they had him now hed thought he could pull it off but then with the shooting there was no way that alone forget the other the stuff ingraham and hardy were talking about would put him back he wasnt going he wasnt putting up with the game of another trial everything stacked against him anyway from day one and this time what hardy had said going for the gas chamber no way the hospital room was dark there was dim light out through the open door into the hallway where he knew the guard sat he was quietly working the sheet back and forth over a jutting bit of metal that protruded from the bars at the side of the bed a nurse walked by exchanged a few words with the guard he saw her silhouette in the doorway and lay still then she was gone he waited a minute listening the chair in the hall creaked the guard probably settling back he got a tear in the top of the sheet and trying not to move anything but his hands began ripping a strip down to the bottom he only needed three strips he wanted to get each one started at the topthat was the hardest part the first tear so he went back to the little bit of metal working the old hospital sheet over it again and again until again he got it to tear he pulled the new strip down a ways using only the strength of his hands showing no movement outside the covers got maybe ten inches then started over again at the top you only needed three strips to braid you braided the three eightfoot strips of sheet into a rope maybe seven feet long you made a noose in that rope and tied one end to the same metal bar you were using to make the tear you put the noose around your neck and rolled off the other side of the bed he wasnt going back in chapter twenty kevin driscoll was fortytwo years old his marriage to may was going through the readjustment of having two children ages one and two he hadnt been laid in three weeks resented it strongly and this morning had been awakened at by jasons apparently random screaming kevin driscoll had a sore throat perpetually but this morning particularly as branch manager he was out on the floor at wells fargo bank and wondered taking in the customers and tellers and various assistant vicepresidents everybody above a teller was an avp if the world had always been like this or whether he was only seeing it clearly for the first time the conventional wisdom was that hardship showed you your true colorsmaybe it was true of everything else when you were having a hard time you saw everything else in its true colors and what he saw depressed him further there were seven people waiting in the service line he would never have thought of it before but now he wondered how many of them were parents at least three maybe four had any of them slept in months no wonder people were crabby at the windows all the time and at the windowsonly two open four more tellers congregated conspicuously at chief teller mariannes desk catching up on the gossip another man came in eight people in the service line now tuesdaymorning rush and not one teller even considering heading to a window let em wait right the teller mentality kevin coughed and cleared his throat hoping marianne or someone would catch the hint he hated to have to step into this most basic operations procedure but getting these people to move sometimes took direct action the problem was in his mood hed likely appear as angry as he was and that was to be avoided bank managers didnt have personalities they were unflappable but he stood up hed caught the looks of the customersrolled eyes or helpless gestures shuffling back and forth cattle in the pen hey somebody want to open another window what are you people doing back there kevin swore to himself he held a restraining hand up to the security guard who was moving in he didnt blame the customer who yelled he felt like yelling himself he walked to the bullpen marianne he said quietly she looked up forever sedentary endlessly serene a chief teller for seven years a hundred and eighty pounds of essence of bovine but sweet so fucking sweet he wanted to kill her she smiled yes kevin he gestured to the line forcing a patient smile that he thought threatened to cramp every muscle in his face sighing marianne dispatched one of her minions one and the girl didnt hurry she was carefully counting her drawer when the customer whod yelled said fuck this and turned out of the line another satisfied customer marianne he repeated she gave him a little wave and mouthed theyll wait then sent another soldier moseying off to the front are you the manager it was only kevin turned steeling himself no matter what he told himself dont swing at the customer yes definitely the smile muscles were cramping up how can i help you the man had not bothered waiting in the line maybe he wanted to open an account and kevin could deal him off to one of his employees currently having coffee around the avp gossip desk he did not feel like he could trust himself talking to anyone perhaps he should say he was sick check into a motel and sleep about sixteen hours the customer was clearly trying to cut a certain type of figure but kevin wasnt sure he pulled it off was he trying to look like a businessman or a pastiche of one with perhaps some artistic statementmismatched pants and coat a green tie that was too wide over a pale blue shirt hiking boots his longish hair was either heavily moussed or simply greasy in any event he was upset saying something about eightyfive thousand dollars the number drove off a little of kevins fatigue he stopped the man in midsentence yes sir would you like to sit down please come in where we can talk quietly perhaps some coffee the floor had already seen enough vocal disturbance for one day the thing to do was to get him into one of the conference rooms kevin was walking and the customer had no other option if he wanted to keep talking with him it also gave kevin another minute to get himself under control again to put his own thoughts together of course he remembered maxine weir who wouldnt remember her ignoring even the eightyfive thousand dollars which of course he wasnt likely to do a man who had not been laid in three weeks did not forget those black tights and high heels if youd gotten it in the last five minutes youd still perk up at the sight of those nipples peeking out through the holes of the loosely knit skincolored sweater kevin held the door for the man it shushed closed behind them he showed no inclination to sit now how can i help you he asked the privacy of the conference room worked some on the man he was still upset but the raving tone was gone my name is ray weir and my wife and i havehadan account here you used to have an account here no we still do i mean i do my wifehe pausedmy wife uh died last week was killed kevin let out a breath im very sorry mr weir and youre settling im not settling anything im here to find out what happened to a check for eightyfive thousand dollars an insurance check the insurance company said my wife signed for it last week but i called your customer service and theres no record it was deposited i called the police and asked if theyd found it among her stuff but so far it hasnt turned up no kevin said im afraid it wont she cashed it what do you mean she cashed it kevin coughed again stalling for time his throat was killing him it was probably turning into strep again she your wife came in last week with the check she brought her attorney with her and you cashed it just like that kevin backed away a step or two not exactly just like that i suggested she deposit the money and we put a hold on your account until the money cleared but her attorney made me call the carrier and verify the funds which wasnt really necessary since it was a cashiers check after which i couldnt very well refuse could i so you cashed it there was no denying it yes we cashed it right there right here she took a third of it then and gave it to her attorney he had evidently negotiated the settlement and those are typical fees i believe onethird of the recovered amount but in cash ray weir had to sit down all the fight was out of him i recommended to her privately that this aspect was very unusual i had to report the transaction to the police anything over ten thousand dollars in cash drugs you know but shed made up her mind she wanted the money that day it was hers the funds were there to cover it she was a customer what could i do but it was half mine that money it was half mine im sorry but the check was made out to her not to both of you i mean we were married separated but married married when she got into the accident what could he say the man kept talking it was amicable the separation we agreed to split everything and we hadnt even filed for divorce yet maybe we wouldve worked it out kevin remembered the way this mans wife had clung to her attorney had almost gleefully handed over nearly in cash to her attorney except for the moment during which kevin had spoken with her privately shed never lost physical contact with her attorney ray weir and his wife werent ever going to have worked anything out she had a new man her attorney and she was clinging on kevin felt a wave of nausea and then the fatigue kicked in again he sat down two chairs away from where ray weir slumped the customer looked at him so what can i do now he asked the sun morning bright reflected into kevins eyes off the shiny mahogany conference table he closed his eyes against the glare then forced them open to answer ray weir i cant help you on that he said hardy had been out jogging and missed glitskys call which first chided him for moving around so much and being so difficult to get hold of then telling him about bakers attempted suicide he stood in his office still sweating in his shorts and sweatshirt the weather had warmed up again why had baker tried to kill himself hardys first take was that it was an admission of guilt another nail in his coffin like abe he kept having these ambivalent feelings about old louis since hed talked to baker the other day and gotten to know ray weir now that hector medina was killing dogs hardy had pretty much convinced himself that whatever else louis baker had done and no doubt it was plenty he hadnt killed maxine weir and it wasnt so much that baker had denied anything that would have been easy enough to discount no what had been compelling was bakers seemingly genuine ignorance of maxines presence on the barge even if you were pretty inured to killing people the least youd do is notice of course the fact that he hadnt killed maxine didnt absolutely necessarily mean he hadnt killed rusty but that stretch in the real world was too long for hardys reach and that left the question of why baker had been at rustys in the first place it was pretty thin hardy tried to picture rusty taking baker back to the barge gun in hand not very likely but why not after all how well had he known rusty rusty had seemed much like himself an exda a guy from hardys own clubsomeone whod been through some shit and now just wanted to be left alone thats why hed come to see hardy in the first place wasnt it hed been afraid or hed sure seemed afraid enough to convince hardy who had no reason to be skeptical about it matter of fact hed infected hardy with the fear bug so but had rusty really been so much like him okay there were the externals which were similar but there was also the description hed gotten from karen moore of a pretty twisted driven guythe compulsive gambler the user of women so it came down to who he believedlouis baker or rusty not easy not anymore he didnt believe that rusty had had a gunelse why would he have stopped at the gun shop and ordered another one that he couldnt pick up for three days except louiss story about the days events had some kind of ring to it in a way it was too farfetched to have been made up at least completely rusty meeting baker at the bus station to drive him whoa what did he drive him in rusty had taken the bus to the shamrock his own car had been stolen remember hardy sat on the corner of his desk the car was a question the car was maybe key how about if hardy asked louis and got told that theyd driven in an old model blue volkswagen jetta well that would be interesting somehow his darts had found their way into his hands and he was throwing them into the board one two three walk in and pull them go back to the tape line on the floor and do it again not aiming not working on form zen and darts what if he only knew the color or the make okay hardy would ask baker what kind of car theyd driven in color anything hed see where that led he picked up the phone got the number to county hospital and started to push buttons then stopped himself last time hed needed glitsky to get to baker but abe wasnt in at the hall hadnt been in no sign he would be in hardy wondered where hed called him from and what he might be doing then talked to flo and found that he was not working but avoiding the shop they were at least still talking about los angeles and abe wanted to keep some distancemore than usualbetween himself and the rest of homicide flo said if she heard from him shed ask him to call he couldnt get the car out of his mind after a shower and a can of sardines he was back in his office going over the notes hed taken at the computer terminal it wasnt very fertile ground for either analysis or imagination he picked up a pen and started writing down everything he could remember about last wednesday when rusty had come into the shamrock hed gotten off the bus hardy had remembered his drinkwild turkey hed told hardy about louis baker getting out that hed called the warden at san quentin to find out the time of release then hed made his proposal that he and hardy call each other finally bringing it around to maybe looking into buying a gun and what type would be suitable was that it hardy got up walked around his desk and opened the window in his office it was after one oclock and a light warm breeze freshened the room he stuck his head out to smell the roses only there werent any roses around sitting again he studied what hed written okay then impressions rusty down and out using public transport saying hed called the warden and was told that louis baker had cleaned up his act and not buying that saying that guns were for cop types like hardy then saying he wanted to buy a gun had the idea just occurred to him the switch in attitude from guns being for cop types to wanting one for himself it slowed hardy down rusty had taken a bus out from downtown hardy could imagine him devising his phonecall protection idea finding where hardy worked from any number of old mutual acquaintances but none of that was acting scaredit was more like caution rusty hadnt really been frightened he had been planning to go home hell he had gone home but calling san quentin to find out exactly when baker was getting released that to hardy was more than caution that appeared to be fear didnt it he stared out the window back down to his notes there were two mentions of things hed found out from the warden at san quentinthe circumstances surrounding louiss release and the fact that louis had been a model prisoner if rusty had called out of fear to find out exactly when he had to start worrying harder would he have gotten into a discussion at the same time about what kind of guy louis had become if youre tied to the tracks and a train is on the way do you think about whether its a passenger or a freight he must have or probably might have called san quentin two times so what hardy looked at his silent phone he wasnt doing anything else he spoke to four functionaries perhaps prisoners before he got to the warden jack hazenkamp hardy had met hazenkamp a couple of times in his prosecutor days seen him speak on prison conditions recidivism rates the usual he was a guy who seemed to have spent a lot of time in the military but during his talks hardy had found him surprisinglywell not exactly a liberal but fairly sympathetic the cons were his charges he didnt mollycoddle them but they were by and large people not statistics hardy had gotten through to him by telling the various intermediaries that he was an attorney true enough and it was about louis baker he sat at his desk his yellow notepad pulled in front of him the warden came on brusquely hurried hazenkamp warden id like to ask you a question or two about louis baker already whats he done hardy was planning on explaining it all briefly up to the suicide attempt but the warden stopped him as soon as he heard rusty ingrahams name ingraham is dead hardy went over it a little my god the warden said talk about a mistake hows that ingraham called a couple of times in the past month or so a couple of times hardy repeated yes twice i think he seemed very frightened it now appears he was justified i told him he didnt need to worry baker wasnt a threat hazenkamp swore softly i have to tell you that this surprises me and i dont entertain many illusions in these matters whats that well you know most of them come back or get killed trying hardy waited but louis bakerwell you put your hopes on a few of them i guess have to or go crazy and baker was one of those well you either believe in rehabilitation or you dont and you do not too much but you get an occasional good feeling we dont let guys out on minimum time unless we have some confidence theyre gonna try to go straight so you knew baker personally i know most of them personally its not like you dont have time to meet them i sort of make it a point and baker hardy could hear the man breathing on the other end of the line baker was tough very tough had most of the wrong tapes playing in his brain when he got here but as i said you like to think you get a feeling for these things when youve been in it as long as i have and he was one case where i really believed the man had changed he wasnt a psycho in his case and i dont say this too often i think he grew up tough and mean because he had to survive i knew him back then warden he was a very serious felon hardy knew a lot of the things louis baker had done he didnt exactly buy the environmental theory oh im not denying that hell never be lets say a republican but his voice went up in pitch hope resurfacing he wasnt a drug user his brain wasnt fried out he got along with other guys was on the basketball squad gave boxing lessonsmaybe a loner but the kind who could affect other people not a killer at least i didnt think so maybe not but i thought you said hardy went on with the storymaxine weir the man in holly park the shootout with the cops the attempted suicide so my question he finished is does it make any sense to you didnt the parole board give him tests interviews that kind of thing of course and recommended on informed opinion that he get out thats why he did how often are you wrong as soon as he asked hardy regretted it all the slack weary or otherwiseleft the voice and he was talking to a drill sergeant again and a defensive one at that recidivism is im sure you realize a major problem but if youre going to let these people out if youre going to believe anybody can be rehabilitated then you do it when the evidence i understand all that it just seemed in bakers case you might have felt something more personally there was a longish pause hardy looked out his window maybe he thought hazenkamp was doing the same thing up in marin you know mr hardy i knew a hell of a lot of guys like baker in the corps they come in tough mean and young and all they want in life is to kick ass be on top never show theyve got a weakness in them because where they come from weakness is what you get stomped on for black or white it doesnt matter poor seems to be the big thing no options so for a while weboth in prison and in the corpswe authority figures get their attention bust them all the way down so we can build them up i was a marine myself sir hardy said another pause shorter then you remember the junkyard dogs then something happens at least once in a while they get on a team somebody saves their ass or maybe they save somebodys hardy remembered how he had been after his parents death joining the marines getting his bad self reamed a few times then getting to nam and pulling moses mcguire still his closest friend out from under enemy fire at chi leng hazenkamp was rightit could change you and that happened to baker i think so thought so you know mr hardy there are model prisoners as they call em and then there are the guys that youd swear to god the attitude just seems to go away theyre not just model prisonersyou forget theyre prisoners period that was baker not that he wasnt still toughyou didnt push himbut he didnt need to be anymore you get what im saying anyway its the same thing i told ingraham just leave it alone and you wont have any trouble yeah but ingraham didnt leave it alone well i still feel that louis baker could have taken quite a lot of abuse before he felt his options were gone but if there were that much abuse i mean pressure well then hed revert you get cornered you go back to what you know hardy could understand that being tagged for three murders you didnt commit in the first couple of days after a long term in san quentin would make anyone feel cornered so then you decide to break out go after somebody someone who represents the people who are doing this to youin bakers case hardy and then because youre out of practice you fuck up and all the good done in nine years is wiped out all the hope of ever having a life is over and you try to kill yourself it could have gone that way hardy glanced at his notepad while he still had hazenkamp on the line at the top of the page hed written the number with an exclamation point and circled it one more thing if youve got a second sir the two times ingraham called were they about the same thing yeah the first time was more generalif he ought to be worried how baker was doing hed heard about him getting paroled like that and the other time well that was the one last week where he wanted to know the specificswhat time he got released where he was going i figured it couldnt hurt he seemed pretty strung out i tried to calm him down told him again really i didnt think baker was going to bother him he sighed but he did warden by any chance do you keep a phone log do you have the date of ingrahams first call why over the line hardy heard paper turning just filling in the blanks okay here it is august twentysixth does that fill one in hardy moved things around on his desk blowfish paperweight legal pad slips of paper with other notes from other days a couple of blue jays squawked on a wire outside his window he looked at the page hed been studying earlier and put it next to the one he was now writing on ingrahams car had been reported stolen three days after his first call to san quentin its a possibility he said he thanked hazenkamp and hung up so rusty hears from a paroleofficer friend that louis baker is getting out of prison about the same time he knows hes getting a third of an settlement from maxine weir three days later his car is stolen he doesnt rent a car against the settlement from the insurance baker said rusty picked him up and drove him to his barge the same day rusty had so clearly for all to see taken a bus out to the shamrock hardy wondered how many cars got reported stolen that werent really stolenthat were ditched hidden trashed for any number of reasons the most obvious of which but certainly not the only one being insurance the other reasons provided some foodhell a whole sunday dinner for thought the telephone that mute uncooperative toy that had stared silently at hardy the whole time hed been home now jangled shrilly demanding attention hardy a slave to it picked it up chapter twentyone abe glitsky chewed on ice as he sat at the window at davids on geary a banner on the curran theater across the street was advertising season tickets for the american conservatory theater abe was remembering the early years with flo when theyd gone to the act all the time taking advantage of the city now they raised their kids and occasionally went out to dinner theyd been to maybe three movies in the past year was it them or was the theater really dead the thought brought a smile had the city changed would la be any different he lifted a hand hardy was standing in the entrance to the dining room then pulling out the chair across from him glitsky had reached hardy on his second call he had been working on his own agenda not interested in going back to the hall and giving batiste the satisfaction hardy had wanted to know about bakerwas he still alive he had found out some stuff about ingraham this and that none of it seemingly related finally mentioning the gambling which was what laguardia had been trying to tell him yesterday and glitsky hearing that decided he and hardy ought to get together and shake a tree or two maybe some of these people knew somebody something else hardy jumped at the suggestion and here they were abraham que tal como va hardy in high spirits abe chewed his ice i dont know why were doing this he now said seeing his friend in his own bleak mood the idea for the gettogether suddenly seemed amateurish bullshit hardy reached over and took half of abes bagel and cream cheese and took a bite you done with this yeah now the situation sucks hardy said between bites baker didnt do it he held up his hand stopping any rebuttal hey dont forget i wanted it to be him but i just cant see it you really dont think baker did it neither do you or we wouldnt be sitting here this fine afternoon glitsky got his iced tea filled hardy ordered a cup of coffee okay you first abe said he was there right abaloolie abe grinned one of ojs words but hardy was rolling if he went to rustys to kill him he would have brought a gun right right he couldnt possibly have left it to chance that rusty would have a gun on board that he would somehow conveniently give to him so he could get shot ive still got a problem with rusty being shot abe said well hold that cause ive got a problem with the fact that old louis had no clue there was a woman on board much less a naked one he blasted three times at point blank yeah abe said that doesnt exactly fly so hardy asked so what so what are we left with like who else was there good abe laguardia was there why was he there to collect rustys vig but he says the girl at least was already dead when he got there and diz look there is no way johnny laguardia shoots anybody with a twentytwo ray weirs gun right so was ray there would ray know about armor all glitsky explained the connection but was he there we dont know where he was do we we just know he wasnt at home where he says he was how do we know that abe asked hardy described warrens night waiting on the steps with a sixpack waiting for his friend ray to get home so they could have a few and get this maxine melancholia out of the way abe tipped his glass up flicking at it with his finger until the last of the ice fell into his mouth is that what we call the break in the case he asked ray weirs eyes in the bathroom mirror were a new shade of red it was probably the combination of the crying and the dope but how could he face anybody this way especially the cops out on the steps waiting hed told them hed be a minute visine in the eyes listerine he opened the shade to bright afternoon sun already afternoon threw the window up some of the smoke wafted out another knock come on ray open up suddenly just sitting on the floor half the pictures of maxine torn from the wall lying scattered around him i cant he said i cant what through the door i just cant some mumbling another pound now or well break it down leave me alone he yelled collapsing onto his face the bright sun going out arms over his head please please leave me alone whats he doing hardy asked glitsky shrugged the landing where warren had allegedly sat with his beer where courtenay had hit on hardy was windowless the downstairs entranceway provided some reflected light and there was a slit under the door like a ribbon of brightness carpeted steps led to the hardwood landing all of it heavy with mustiness and the smell of marijuana ray open the door glitsky often surprised hardy but never more than with his patience were just here to talk he put a light hand on hardys arm and nodded reassuring in twenty seconds they heard another rustling inside and then a chain being released the door opened and ray was walking away from them across the smokefilled room to his couch hardy and glitsky followed stepping over pictures fallen leaves of maxine ray huddled sideways at one end of the couch legs hugged to his chest glitsky motioned for hardy to sit in one of the directors chairs and sat himself on the couch two feet from ray hands folded in front of him feet flat on the ground one of the lamps was knocked over on the floor this wasnt vu zjahday but the other one the scattered pictures the broken lamps did somebody break lamps for a living around here she took it all ray had finally raised his head hardy had seen more life in storewindow mannequins his eyes jesus took what ray abe unfazed gentle ray put his head back down into his knees hardy saw the hands tighten around the legs he held close to him trying to get collected back up over to hardy there was no look of surprisehe recognized him but couldnt say from where took what ray glitsky prompted everything he said she took it all the insurance money hardy asked ray shook his head all inside himself i mean we were splitting that that was always understood that was our deal wed still be friends hardy and glitsky exchanged glances abe leaned back into the couch what happened to the money ray she cashed it his eyes went to the wall of pictures half torn down she split it with ingraham they just took it which brings us hardy began but glitsky held up his palm again where did they take it ray the repetitious first name like a mantra keeping them close it must have been to ingrahams ray met abes eyes you guys didnt find it at her apartment at the barge you mean ray nodded so was it there ray no answer how bout it ray were you there no i didnt i dont even know where it is maybe they put it in the bank ray turned to hardy no i went to the bank they took it in cash glitskys eyes told hardy to shut up you didnt go to ingrahams last week at all the night maxine was killed no i told you no ive never been there but your gun was there your gun killed maxine i told you that too i gave it to her before i told you glitsky leaned over patted rays knee i know ray i know what you told me the problem is you also told me you were here by yourself that night and weve run across somebody who says you werent your friend warren hardy said recognition dawned and ray glared at hardy you werent a cop last time you were with court the other night glitsky came back in that doesnt matter ray what matters is what you were doing that night if you werent here i was here maybe we should all go visit warren huh no we cant do that why not ray is he lying i dont know i cant think he put his head back down on his knees you have to think ray glitsky closing in is warren lying well get everybody in one room under oath if you want his eyes were wild now skitting from hardy to glitsky across the room as though he were giving some thought to running come on ray just tell us you were here or warren was here which one was it you cant tell him tell who what ray warren he shook his head no i promised i wouldnt tell we cant suddenly the light went on for hardy you were both here he said you were in bed with courtenay you couldnt answer the door for warren because then hed find that out ray nodded he might not have finished the movie he would have thought wed both betrayed him which you did hardy said no it wasnt like that court came by to see how i was doing she was worried about me being so bummed out about maxine then we had a glass of wine and got a little stoned and you know he looked from glitsky to hardy youre not going to tell warren are you lets go diz glitsky was on his feet mr nice guy gone with the warm breeze he was already halfway to the door hardy was up behind him i promised courtenay ray whined you wont tell warren will you glitsky turned at the door not unless it comes up he said if hed done it forget all the warrencourtenay bullshit hed have tossed the barge for the money and there wasnt any sign of that i believe ray doesnt have the money so do i glitsky didnt take his eyes off the road they were heading back downtown on geary so where do you suppose it is the money that question has crossed my mind abe said the money is a new angle people get killed for money all the time dont they glitsky stopped at a light so ive heard they sat the light changed green means go hardy said the car moved forward hardy told abe he thought they ought to go talk to louis in the hospital something about a car but glitskys mind was still on the money baker doesnt have the money he said he never had any money but he might be able to tell us what kind of car rusty ingraham was driving abe didnt reply but he might be able to tell us what kind of car i heard you abe said he hit another light heres the thing diz im following the thread of who was there baker okay but hes on the shelf for the time being anyway for a while there we thought it might have been ray but i believe ray rusty was schtupping maxine you believe that hardy nodded okay so now weve got hector medina and johnny laguardia hector was on the barge hes says not he worked a double but hey since it seems to be our day to be thorough and were going right by there anyway the sir francis drake hadnt changed much in the week since hardy had last been there a plaque read security on a door on the third floor at the end of a long hall of doors hector was sitting at his desk reading a newspaper he didnt have any outer office much less a secretary glitsky and hardy pulled up a couple of wooden chairs i dont know if youd heard abe said treadwells in the can or was as of this morning hectors hands were crossed over the newspaper yeah clarence called with the good news he looked at hardy i thought you werent on the force just spending the day with my buddy abe the funny thing is abe said ignoring the exchange in the course of clearing clarence and mario youll never guess what came up hector looked at his hands hes not guessing hardy said youre not here for that the dog thing he turned his hands up cmon you guys i put a little fear of god in him and it worked right whats the deal i guess the deal abe said is that my friend hardy here and i were talking about rusty ingraham and it came up how you treat people you dont like you didnt like rusty much am i right what are you saying im saying it doesnt seem to go with your personality with how you do things that you would call up rusty and just get cold feet and hang up it seems more like if you had a message for him youd go see him medina pushed back a ways from his desk i never really had a message for him not like i did with treadwell i realized that when i called him you still say you never saw him not in a lot of years not to say if i wouldve i wouldnt have kicked his ass he got further out from his desk and put his feet up crossed it was a good casual posture maybe even rehearsed his hands were crossed on his stomach if this is about rusty getting it i told you i worked a double that night you can look at the log no thanks im sure it says that in the log so give me a break what do you want you know johnny laguardia hector sure everybody knows johnny whats he got to do with this hardy leaned forward abe stood up cracked his back and asked hector if he could have a cup of coffee from the pot going by the window pouring he turned to hardy hows this sound diz hector calls rusty to set up some meeting so he can kick his ass rustys on a roll having just collected some big money on insurance he rubs that in hectors face what are you talking about what big money hectors feet were on the floor now abe kept it up so hector calls his good friend johnny laguardia i didnt say he was my good friend i just know the guy and tells him theres a wad of cash in it for him if he goes over and does rusty hows that sound i like it hardy said my girlfriend can dance to it i give it a nine glitsky turned to medina how bout you hector that about how it went down medina had pulled back up to his desk his hands again crossed over the newspaper you got a warrant sergeant abe looked at hardy you got a warrant i dont have a warrant tell you what medina said you come back when you got a warrant ill show you the log that says i worked here the whole night i havent seen or talked to johnny laguardia in like six months and i didnt send him nowhere he nodded go find yourselves another patsy nice talking to you both i dont think he was sincere hardy said about what about how it was nice talking to us glitsky slammed his car door and put the key in the ignition some guys dont have a sense of humor so where to the lateafternoon traffic was not moving well they waited windows rolled down for a break when the light changed up at the corner behind them you know johnny laguardia abe asked nope well he works for angelo tortoni i dont know angelo either abe pulled out tires squealing laguardia might be the man even if he wouldnt have shot anybody with a twentytwo under normal conditions could be ray weirs gun was there he figured what the hell it would throw somebody like me off the track somebody like you you know a trained investigator with years of experience oh that you glitsky drove so where are we going laguardia have an office he works out of no but tortoni does though hes probably gone home by now i think ill see him tomorrow no point in going by his home not without a warrant everybody wants a warrant we live in a picky world they were crossing market now going south hardy caught a whiff of chinese food a glimpse of some rappers putting it out to passersby the sun was low but still hot casting long shadows you realize abe said were back to the vig hardy squinted at the sun came back to glitsky seems like you think rusty got caught in the squeeze a nod hows this rusty had been light on his vig for a while and maybe johnny covered for him a few weeks floated him on his own knowing this big insurance payment was coming maybe setting up his own client base but johnny gets there and something goes wrongmaxine doesnt go along rustys already blown it at the track whatever or hardy said johnny sees the money and an easy way to walk with all of it abes scar tightened across his mouth okay and this is better johnny goes collects his regular vig and rustys bragging about how hes able to pay hes fat city now from what you heard about him thats the way he was right yeah when he was flying he flaunted it and he was flying so he tells johnny all about it pays him with cash of course and maybe johnny sees the roll or figures theres more on board he goes outside waits around figuring hell toss the place next time rusty goes out but instead maxine shows up he gives them a half hour sees the bedroom lights go on and off and on maybe looks in and sees them counting money breaks in the door blam blam grabs the stash adios and the brace hardy hadnt bought the explanation from the night at weirs maybe they were celebrating maybe she puts it on one last time while they count the money it brought them he looked at hardy i said maybe lots of times hardy said granted and hector glitsky shook his head that was fishing hectors right johnny gets around everybody does know him and louis they were pulling into the parking lot at county general louis probably doesnt know what he knows but another big maybe seems to be he did it abe pulled the parking brake turned toward hardy he was there he had a motive and there was a weapon the trained detective tries to remember these things motive means opportunity detecting onea in the parking lot there was a strong smell of hot tar so whats all this other bullshit weve been doing all day abe stopped this isnt bullshit this is covering the bases which is what we do we nail it down we find out where everybody was and what they were doing we eliminate reasonable doubt so you think baker did it i think hes a real suspect would you let him go right now no well there you go but thats because he was coming after me it doesnt mean he killed rusty guess what what you want to get technical rusty being dead is still an open question louis baker wondered for a minute if he were dead if he was then this certainly be hell halfopen eyes seeing the man and hardy standing by the end of the bed arms crossed studying a phlegmy cough rumbled up from somewhere inside him half smothered and seemed like to rip his lungthe one already got a bullet through itseem to rip that lung further apart his throat burned inside and the slight movement of the cough made him feel the abrasion on his neck he went to reach his hand up and found this time that he was strapped to the bed hands to his sides the man say louis you hear me he tried to open his eyes further there was a crust over them that made it seem too much effort i think hes out louis the man repeat same quiet voice what they gonna do to him now aint been done he tried his eyes again they seemed to have moved closer hardy hanging back maybe a step the manmean scar through his mean lips top to bottom hovering over the devil himself you want some water the man held a glass to his lips and tipped it up slow now shit burned everything burned down there then another hit getting a little better he held the water in his mouth letting it drip back down his throat swallowing was where the pain came in can you talk some kind of laugh started but it hurt before it got too far he tried to shake his head but you hear me he opened and closed his eyes man want to talk all the time and louis dont got nothin to say just want to get out get back to home turf another sound he look out again woman in white saying hes under heavy sedation now perhaps theyd like to come back tomorrow maybe she been here all along other side the bed he felt something cold on his forehead good white woman in white she got good hands some kind of towel the man stepping back what are his chances barring complications he ought to be okay in a few weeks able to talkmuch better than nowin a couple of days i guess itll keep another voice then hardy can he talk at all seeing him over the womans shoulder hovering i just need a word or two now close up like before louis he saying you dont like me and i dont much like you either but i dont think you killed rusty ingraham you hear me yeah he hear that where that shit come from now why he in here they think that how long they been thinking it he opened his eyes as far as he could and looked at the man least he dont look like the devil like the other one do wha he started to say croaking he wants water the nurse watching out for him but no man what he saying is asking what but he takes the water hardy back at him you told me about rusty driving you to his place you remember that the eyes half close call it a nod the car you guys drove inyou remember what color it was it come down to this shit what kind of games these honkies playing he opened his eyes again everything foggy his lung hurting his throat sore hardy though focused right in his face louis took in a labored breath what the hell nothing to lose blue he said and it brought on a cough again the man saying come on lets go then they gone it might have been a lucky guess you could throw darts and reach this zenlike stage of pure contemplation or you could sit with a bunch of regulars at the bar of the shamrock and drink four irish whiskeys poured by lynne and then moses call it the equivalent of six when hardy had come in at sixthirty things hadnt yet picked up lynne leish was still tending working overtime because of hardys vacation and hed taken what he hoped was some goodnatured abuse about his lifestyle time off pursuit of his other interests then moses mcguire coming on seven to two taking ten with hardy in a different vein the two guys best friends coowners of the bar shared a postagestamp table back over by the dart boards hardy was working on his first irish moses as always went with his single malt the macallan so do i have to ask hardy again remembered pulling moses his legs shot up out from enemy fire picking up some lead in his own shoulder in the process moses hiring him when hed changed careers after the death of his son im not playing any games with her if thats what you mean if i thought that your face would already be broken moses had no fear of a fist in the face you run an irish bar even if youre a phd in philosophy as moses was it comes with the territory his own nose he said liked to get rearranged once a year whether it needed it or not i dont know somethings happening i dont think she knows exactly either she call you no i called her goes four or five days i dont hear from her and i start to worry the mose had raised his sister from the time she was ten hardy knew moses only cared deeply about ten things in the universe and eight of them were frannie so whatd she say that you were hiding out there a while moses leaned forward elbows on the tiny table but i dont know something about the tone hardy finished his drink deciding the night wouldnt be one of pure reason and signaled lynne to bring over another round he put his index finger in the new drink stirring anyway moses said it came out what do you want me to say i dont know diz shes my baby i still have a hard time thinking of her as all grown up which i also know she is the lines deepened around his already sunken eyes with his black beard shot now with gray moses was hardys vision of god before he got real old he shrugged it just worries me i dont want to see her hurt anymore im not gonna hurt her mose whatever comes down thats not happening i mean i think she probably wants what she had with eddieplans and family stuff a man comes home every night maybe she wants that i dont think shes very sure what she wants she wants the baby i think she wants a father for the baby eddie was the father mose nothing is changing that you know what i mean hardy knew he sipped some whiskey shell likely let me know when she figures it out and then what then i figure it out and then it moves ahead or it doesnt right nothing got planned here mose it just happened its real good but frannie doesnt know where she wants to take it and im not sure either i dont know where jane fits in im a mess what can i tell you moses tipped his glass up it was getting on to seven and he knew lynne wanted to go home you can tell me when youre coming back to work he said then standing starting for the bar i liked you better when you werent dating now three hours later well into a pretty serious rightbrain workout hardy tapped the bar gently with another empty glass he sat at the front now near the window and moses would come down and sit on his stool behind the bar whenever there was a lull it probably was just a lucky guess yeah i guess there arent that many colors to choose from moses hit him again lots of ice half a shot nurse em hardy he said leaning over talking quietly you and i know for a fact that theres only three colors anybody ever mentions watch this moses walked the length of the bar maybe a dozen customers on stools drinking talking making the moves he put a fresh napkin and a pencil in front of each one kind patrons he said loud the gregarious bartender listen up a second freedrink contest as always it got their attention quick dont think write down the first color comes to your mind quick he was already picking up the first napkins who wins the drink hold on hold on he was back down by hardy okay you be the impartial judge mcguire whats the contest who gets the drink anything we want seven blues four greens two reds hardy said moses held his hands up sorry he announced nobody wins but thanks for playing thats not a fair contest one of the women complained what were we going for anything but blue red or green would have gotten the drink moses said as the mumbling died down a couple of people saying they were going to pick yellow moses told hardy you occasionally did get a yellow well that was sure a good time hardy said but the point the point is your man baker had a good chance of saying blue even if hed never seen your friends car but it was blue and if it was then rusty was lying to me about it being stolen someone called for a drink and moses went down to pour why would someone you hadnt seen in years appear out of thepardon the wordblue and tell you a lie hardy was getting muscle fatigue of the right brain he pushed his glass to the back edge of the bar wait a minute he told himself what if he somehow got his car that afternoon he got on the bus across the street from here then went downtown stopping to order a handgun hed have to wait three days for the computer said the car was still missing but then the computer lagged several days behind if it still had louis baker in san quentin it wouldnt have the car returned either maybe hed check again tomorrow moses was on the stool in front of him again hardy raised his eyes ive got an idea he said treat it carefully its in a strange place hardy pulled his glass up cradling it between his hands rustys got a monster vig payment right moses nodded okay he comes into a lot of this insurance money he knows louis baker is getting out of jail and has threatened to kill him maybe he even starts fantasizing maybe it wouldnt be so bad if louis did kill himthat would at least get him out from under the vig so he sets himself up to get killed get serious hardy shook his head he sets himself up to look like hes been killed the whole things a scam he just wants to look dead get the loan sharks off him why doesnt he move disappear because you dont move away from mob money they find you i dont care where its an honor thing but if youre dead if youre dead they dont look right give me some coffee would you and get rid of this hardy watched moses move filling a few other drink orders at the bar as he passed pouring his coffee hardy got his darts out from his jacket pocket and opened the leather case on the bar he rubbed his fingers over the worn velvet inside one other thing the shamrock did right was make great coffee ninety percent of it was served in what they called irish coffee which made hardy puke three good liquids combined to make one bad drink but when you wanted a cup of coffee the straight stuff couldnt be beat i dont know diz theres lots of holes whyd he come see you because i tie baker to him if im not in it who finds out about baker werent his prints at rustys place that ties him to it i dont know mose its not as good as me an exda making sure everybody knows baker had a motive was fresh out of jail you name it plus because im running now too i try like hell to get baker put away and did it too didnt i he was coming after you im not saying he wasnt look if rustys going to get out from under his vig hes got to be dead not mia im his corroboration without the threat hed just be a missing person wouldnt he now with me helping him hes presumed dead his blood was on the bed diz and why did he buy a gun he was never going to use hardy leaned over the bar his elbows almost in the trough rusty was the great american lawyer never lost a case you can bet hes a very thorough guy who wanted his scam to work and you know what genius is mose its endless attention to detail moses went to pour a drink hardy fingered his darts sipped his coffee tried to picture rusty ingraham at the bottom of the ocean couldnt do it not anymore chapter twentytwo lace removed a board from the side of the stoop at the place samson mostly stayed the sun wasnt quite up yet but he hadnt been getting any sleep to speak of anyway and he wanted some darkness jumpup hed gone til things chilled out over to his cousins at hunters point but lace lived here and he wasnt leaving this be his home turf and he starting to think woe betide the man who fucks with it fighting his fear of rats and whatever else might live in there lace reached his hand far into the dark hole under the steps he patted the ground inside his teeth chattering he hoping nobody hears it inside nothing he sat arms now tucked into his pits huddled in the jacket letting the fear subside it wasnt possible he couldnt be wrong the shaking still there he forced his hand again into the cold and silent space retraced what hed just done making himself feel the stones the chunks of rotting wood a piece of moldy cloth that felt like a dead animal reaching back up to the front seeing the yellow rat eyes about to snap at him take a finger give him the rabies he closed his eyes feeling way in up in the front wrapped in the freezing oily animal cloth he felt the package the gun felt heavy in his hands the strip of light in the east hadnt widened by a hair and he was walking now the board back over the hole in place his pocket heavy shoelaces trailing around by his feet over to the mamas around to the front door by the street away from the view of the cuts no one around nothing moving after some knocks he heard somebody moving inside then enormous in a white housecoat mama opened the door a crack seeing it was lace she let him in what time it child you all right lace closed the door behind him and waited for mama to sit on the couch next to the dim light before he came over and sat at the other end he noticed that the window over the couch had been covered over again with cardboard she pulled a knitted cover up over her body tucking her feet under her giant thighs now she said what you doing lace took the gun still wrapped in an old shirt sleeve out of his pocket he started pulling it out from the cloth we gotta tell somebody he said the mama wasnt taking her eyes from the gun this the piece killed dido mama lace said aint no louis baker kill him this samsons piece the mama nodded who we fixin to tell about it you want to put it down lace had it unwrapped its loaded still he said he turned the barrel toward himself dont he froze what just put it down put it down thing go off by itself then what put that thing down on the floor he leaned over and laid it down the mama let out a breath another one theyre dangerous guns where you get that one its samsons it was samsons you said that and that means louis he didnt kill dido child i knew that louis never hurt nobody anymore he just want to set up house til they dont leave him alone but he run you run too child they come after you lace put his back up against the cushions his redrimmed eyes suddenly burnedup all night waiting for his chance light enough to see where hes going dark enough to get away he was safe here with mama now and samson didnt have the gun he had it seemed that ought to change the way things felt you know mama runnin dont that make them think you did it too bundled in her blanket her big head bobbed thats right so louis run and he saying he did it but he dont run and they take him down for it but now he run and they got him anyway that often the way child she made a clucking noise shifting her bulk impatient this aint be the news you go bad with the law he keep you bad dont matter what you do you the first body they come at but they got louis for dido and he dont kill dido this gun prove that all right the mama said what so we let it on to the man she labored to pull herself up heres what happens then you listen up now the man come here and you talk about louis and that gun there then he say interesting and how come it be you now holding this piece and next you know you down there next to louis you like that it wont be she leaned forward and rested a meaty hand on his thin leg there aint nobody with louis more than me he dont kill dido and maybe it come out but it dont come out with you going to the man he just resent you interferin you got a problem you best take care of it yourself and louis louis take care of hisself too seem like i ought to talk to someone get some help help louis out she gently tightened her grip on his thigh i know it seem like that she said but that aint be how it works it wasnt that abe didnt believe coincidences occurred you could be humming a song and have it turn up on the radio somebodys on the phone when you were just about to call them that kind of thing but when you mentioned say a johnny laguardia to a potential suspect in a murder investigation like say hector medina one day and the next day you find yourself at a dumpster behind the wax museum in fishermans wharf looking at the holes in johnnys head it made you wonder two holes one in the back and one at the temple either one wouldve done the job fine by itself abe wondered if medinas logbook showed that hed worked a double shift all last night he wondered if he had some extra money lying around if he were at work today maneuvering through the techs abe cleared the morning shade in the alley and stood on the sidewalk in the bright sun knowing that glitsky had interviewed johnny recently batiste had called abe at home as soon as the call with the tentative id came in abe had called hardy out of courtesy hardy had been groggy perhaps hungover but he said hed be here now he was walking up wearing corduroys hiking boots a members only jacket over a turtleneck abe cocked his head back toward the alley and started walking hardy fell in beside him they lifted the yellow tape johnny laguardia hardy said the late great they both studied the body still uncovered now laid out on a stretcher one tasseled brown loafer was still on his sport coat hung open revealing a salmoncolored shirt halftucked into some stylish pleated italian trousers his shoulder holster was empty the gun was on him when we got here abe said in case you were wondering so he knew whoever it was abe nodded safe bet johnnys face surprisingly to hardy showed no sign of exit wounds small caliber huh must have been abe said looks like twentytwo or twentyfive again hardy said i noticed and it didnt go down here either abe said he was dumped he motioned to the dumpster symbolism yet hardy looked another minute you had coffee yet a black chrysler lebaron pulled into the mouth of the alley a chauffeur stepped out and walked around the front of the car abe waited watching whos that hardy asked the angel sat in the back seat holding hands with doreen biaggi she had been staying in his upstairs room since sunday taking meals with the family now she wore sunglasses to cover her black eye the swelling on her cheek was still visible tortoni squeezed her hand va bene she nodded matteo had come to the door and opened it he took doreens hand and helped her out of the seat tortoni got out his own side and glanced down at the area surrounded by the police tape he took a thin cigar from his inside pocket and rubbed it between his fingers breathing in the energizing odors of garbage and crabsmell he lit the cigar flushed in the pleasure this perfect morning was giving him but he kept his face expressionless he was supposed to be in pain here he motioned with his head to matteo who took doreens elbow and began guiding her forward the three came together at the front of the car here were two men police the black one leading as though he were in charge tortoni had seen him before most blacks looked the same to him but this onewith the scar running through his lips the hatchet nose the blue eyeswas distinctive but he couldnt remember the name the other one he didnt know the black one kept his hands in his pockets angelo he said low key how you doing tortoni saw matteo tighten his mouth his son liked for people to call his father mr tortoni or don angelo but tortoni only lifted his palmas he might restrain a welltrained dogand matteo settled back i am not so well tortoni barely heard himself he raised the cigar to his lips and inhaled not so well if what i hear may be true if you mean johnny he made a show of looking around the officer his hands went to his sides and he hung his head do we know who did this he whispered doreen was standing next to him taking his arm helping him with his grief he raised his eyes johnny was a son to me we dont know anything yet angelo in fact it crossed my mind i might want to talk to you sometime soon he is here now doreen said talk to him now good angelo thought protective already he patted her arm and said in italian ignore this buffoon whatd you tell her the cop said he smiled through his pain i told her you were only doing your job he patted her arm again shes upset too she and johnny were very close you have no ideas yet i have ideas i dont think he killed himself he wasnt hit by a truck like that the copglitsky that was it clucked no my idea is somebody did him your way he put his index finger to his temple and cocked his thumb tortoni the soul of patience shook his head i am a businessman officer but i am not in the business of violence your man johnny carried a gun tortoni gestured a forgiving father you knew johnny a baby he imagines he protects me a smile wheres the harm do you mind can we see him they moved back into the alley tortoni went to one knee and crossed himself over the body he remained that way for thirty seconds a good clean job he leaned over and kissed johnnys clean jaw doreen had her forehead against matteos shoulder when he stood up it was all right if she didnt have the strength to look but it was important he thought that she see firsthand what he could do but that was enough with a tiny move of his head he directed matteo to take doreen back to the car watching them walk off he took another puff on his cigar che bello giorno do you have any ideas angelo the sun had cleared the lower buildings so that he had to squint into glitskys face he shrugged his palms out johnny was young maybe hottempered but a good boy you dont know any enemies he had recently maybe protecting you there has been no trouble he said this i dont understand how about personally money troubles girls tortoni shook his head do you have any dealings with a hector medina who is hector medina i have never heard the name glitsky shrugged he knew johnny thats all i wondered how well you think he this hector medina he did this the white cop who had been silent all the while spoke up i know who didnt do it whos that glitsky asked looking at the other man louis baker tortoni stared at both of them hed have to check out who these two people werehector medina and louis baker glitsky took it up again to tortoni he said the thing is i was talking to johnny just the other day and he said you were having some problemsyou and him tortoni saw no point responding to that this problemit seemed to involve rusty ingraham something about his vig being short and medinas also been mixed up with ingraham sort of a coincidence wouldnt you say tortoni nodded i was you id look into that but johnny told me ingraham was dead the two cops exchanged glances the white guy spoke again johnny told you that he see him dead i mean tortoni said that when johnny told him somebody was dead it usually was the truth what you guys didnt see him technically hes a missing person glitsky said you lose a lot of money on him some in business you take some risks did you know last week he came into like thirty thousand dollars tortoni made a note to have somebody check out johnnys apartment his mothers flat his friends the son of a bitch but he only said good for him the white cop said you wouldnt have seen any of that would you tortoni glanced down the alley his son had put doreen back into the car and waited arms crossed leaning against the hood he took a step in that direction i got an accountant takes care of things like that you want to know make an appointment i claim every penny i make he stopped and pointed to the body on the ground im talking to you both so nice cause i want to help you find the sumbitch did in my boy here you need help time goes by i got connections might do some good everybody cooperates this guy medina you talking to him glitsky nodded he works at the drake ill be going over this afternoon you find anything id consider it a personal favor you let me know tortoni wondered if going back over to the body would be laying it on too thick and decided it would be he straightened himself bearing up under the loss nodding at the two cops he started back to his car hardy was reflecting on the difference between abes professional attitude and his own why abe was probably on his way to seeing hector medina again and hardy was here eating ice cream at the gelato just off stanyan waiting for courtenay moran to show glitsky had another murder committed by someone probably in his jurisdiction and the killer was walking the streets so abes job was to follow the threads from that and bring that new person in if it tied into maxines death all to the good but the fact that it hadnt been louis baker didnt seem to make all that much difference to abe somebody after all had killed johnny and abes job was to find that person hardy had to remember that louis was in as much for the killing at holly park as he was for maxine and abe just left it like that in fact the more he thought about it the theory hed laid on moses last night was starting to make more and more sense he hardy was involved in this whole thing only because rusty had come to him period and why had he done that he had done that and made it as convincing as possible because he needed someone with impeccable credentials with no ax of his own to grindsomebody exactly like dismas hardyto preach the gospel of the dead not the missing rusty ingraham because the mob didnt look for a dead man and setting up louis baker no problem guy deserved life in prison anyway him getting out after nine years was a mockery of the justice system wasnt it serve him right after all the crimes hed gotten away with to get him for something he didnt do and use hardy to do it putting it together the call to san quentin making sure baker was getting out three days later after you work out the plan you ditch your car and report it stolen you go through some inconvenience for a month taking buses to establish some credibility then you see your friend hardy and tell him bakers getting out and is planning to kill both of you you do your best to scare the shit out of him then you order a gunthe picture of a man terrified for his life you pick up louis baker in the bus station making your only mistake which is driving your car risks proving you a liar especially if they ever get to questioning baker about it you want him to leave someanyphysical evidence that he was on your barge a thumbprint would be plenty to police who were already predisposedbecause of hardys testimonyto believe the excon did it then what you shoot maxine administer yourself a flesh wound leave a bloody trail to the edge of the barge drop the gun overboard dress the wound get in your carwhich no one thinks you have anymoreand head out but where to and the world comes to believe youre dead youve got a lot of money in cash youre washed up in san francisco your vig is eating you up all your old friends have written you off go someplace else start over a man in deep thought courtenay in black and hotpink spandex was six feet of impressive woman when she had told hardy she would run on down to meet him she had meant it literally her face was flushed with a light sheen of sweat set off by a pink band around her forehead the closecropped blond hair was nearly white in the daylight she pulled up a stool across from him at the window youve already had some hardy looked down at his empty dish ill have another one with you what do you want he went to the counter and orderedtwo chocolate chocolates when he got back to her she said i was mad at you you didnt have to come down here yes i did you never told me you were a cop hardy popped a spoonful of ice cream im not she was still breathing heavily from her run after a minute she said i came down to ask you please not to tell warren ray said you he held up a hand lets leave ray rays not important hes important if warren ever finds out i thought you had an open relationship you and warren lets put it this way we dont ask each other maybe one or the other assumes and its safer to assume your partner is not faithful because its probably true but thats not the same as wanting to be confronted with it especially if its one of your best friends and especially if you and your regular partner work together okay especially then she put her spoon down look im not making excuses ray and i did what we did maybe it helped him a little made him feel better im sorry about the timing of it being the night maxine got killed but remember we didnt know that at the time so youre not really having an affair with him a slow smile spread into a wide grin why you interested i thought you were just being a cop the other night and now hardy shrugged i told you im not really a cop at all i used to be now some things have happened around this whole thing with maxine and rusty ingraham like what hardy took a bite of ice cream knowing it was going to sound melodramatic but it was the truth people are dying getting killed im not too happy thinking i might be on the list if im right about some things it could make me a threat how hardy ran down most of the events of the past week but tried to stick to facts only she put her hand over his on the counter as he finished since we knew themrusty and maxdo you think were in trouble too i dont know the loop seems to head in a different direction rusty was evidently into the mob for a lot of money but why you youre not in with those people are you thats the big question i got into it the day everything started im part of it she waited and he decided to open up some well if rustys still alive for example and lets just say he killed maxine and set up louis to take the fall then do you think hes going to let me walk around im the only guy can put this together which means im the only guy whos a threat to him he may or may not realize it yet but its sure to occur to him and id prefer not to wait around for that glorious moment to arrive but rustys not alive you said hardy held up a hand from the beginning rustys body has been missing i went to a lot of trouble to prove how it could have disappeared because i kept assuming he was dead it was possible plausible even reasonable but mostly it was what i wanted to believe because of some other preconceptions courtesy of rusty so i believed it slowly she licked ice cream off her spoon so why did you want to see me she asked because maybe you know something and dont know you know it about what maxine rusty both of them she licked the spoon again a bit of ice cream remained on her lower lip hardy itched to reach over and wipe it off well i didnt know rusty that well it was a little tense with ray around so much you know i mean who are you friends with but maxine came around with rusty oh yeah of course she was in the movie she wanted to see how it came out and she came with rusty a lot at first then it kind of got old i think max just lost the dream she smiled making a joke the vision thing you know i dont really know she pushed out her beautiful lower lip you know before the dream had always been making it in films hardy smiled as opposed to movies stop she pointed a threatening finger anyway after she and rusty got together it was like they both decided what they were doing wasnt working i mean maxine was like thirtythree or something like that which is really pretty old for making it as an actress i mean the kind of actress she wasthe looks thing you know and rusty he just said he wanted to stop being a lawyer go someplace else live another life get away from all the stress as he called it i think they fed each other that way did they say what they wanted to do oh you know take the money and run live on the beach do nothing get a tan hardy shook his head that doesnt sound like rusty he was a pretty driven guy wasnt he type a to the max well i guess thats why they picked acapulco she scraped the last of the ice cream from the bottom of the bowl giving it her full attention i mean rusty could be as type a as he wanted around his gambling which he said relaxed him but it really didnt seem to and maxine could lie around on the beach and drink margaritas are there casinos in acapulco yeah i think so but thats not it that kind of gambling they talked about jai alai its like horse racing except with people rusty was going to make their living betting on jai alai this was really their plan they talked about this why didnt you mention this before what was to mention as far as i knew they were both dead which pretty much means they werent living in acapulco doesnt it and it wasnt really both of them with that plan anyway at least not at first then it was mostly maxine another big dream of hers that didnt come true chapter twentythree hardy felt like a horses ass what was he really doing here in acapulco at a cliffside restaurant waiting for the sun to set and the boys holding torches to dive off the cliffs into the oncoming surf a mariachi band was serenading an american couple at the next table hardy poured his tecate into a glass and squeezed a lime into the beer he didnt particularly like tecate but he liked corona less and those were the options sometimes hed told himself youve just got to do something and he thought hed been sure certain enough in any case to risk crossing the border with his special taped under the fender of his samurai he didnt want to think about what would have happened if they had stopped him in tijuana and searched the car but hed driven into mexico perhaps twenty times before in his life and had never been hassled going in coming back of course theyd inspected his car three or four times hardy had come to the conclusion that if people wanted to bring somethinganythinginto mexico the official word was bienvenidos it was a poor country theyd take anything you wanted to provide for the two and a half nonstop days that it had taken him to get here sleeping only an hour or two at a time in the car his hunch had grown more and more into a conviction rusty ingraham was aliveand he was in acapulco rusty ingraham he had been sure had come to him for no other reason than to have him point the finger at louis baker and let nature take its course and that course ought to lead with the other clever little games such as buying a gun presumably for protection against baker that he never picked up to the conclusion that rusty was dead killed by louis baker and that in turn gets rusty off the hook for his crushing vig and puts louis where he belongs back in the slammer or the gas chamber either way louis baker was a pawn dismas hardy was a tool rusty ingraham would be free to live out poor maxines dream the sun kissed the pacific flaming red bougainvillea covered the trellis that bounded the patio where he sat a warm offshore breeze lulled he sipped his tecate across the chasm that divided him from the divers one of them still torchless fell forward hardy watched the slow arc as the body cleared the outcropping and fell the long long way down it was the fourth boy hed seen go off since arriving here and he found he couldnt work up a casual touristy feeling about it he leaned out over the trellis making sure the wave below would be there for the boys arrival this was not to him a relaxing way to unwind he left his beer with a tip and went out to the road leading back into town half a dozen taxis were lined at the entrance to the place but he put his hands in his pockets and started walking down the hill palm fronds still littered the roadway hurricane carmine had hit two days before it hadnt done much damage but cleanup here did not proceed at the same pace as back home especially if you couldnt pay for it the phone in his hotel still wasnt working for example but then again he wasnt staying at the princess he had arrived the day before and slept through the late afternoon and through the nightseventeen hours this morning hed walked down from his hotel the el sol eighteen dollars per nightdefinitely not the princess near the base of the mountains through the awakening town to the esplanade he took an outside table at a place facing the beach and had pineapple juice some poor coffee and a plate of huevos rancheros taking it slow letting the sun get hot the parasailors floating up around the bay like colored balloons sunday morning church bells on his way out to the jai alai stadium still walking getting the feel of the place he had stopped at a church and stood in the back listening to the mass in spanish the ritual appealed to him but he wished they still said the mass in latin there was nothing universal about this mass nothing he thought catholic it made him feel like the foreigner he was here at communion he snuck back out the sun pounded hot on his head he bought a hat for a dollar and continued walking hardy loved mexico he went every year to fish or dive or soak up sun and either dry himself out or tank upthe place was good for either he and jane had taken their honeymoon at cabo san lucas long before it was anything but a sleepy fishing village with a thatchedroof airport long walks on empty beaches huge nearly free margaritas at the finis terra throwing the glasses down over the cliffs to the water below nights and afternoons and mornings of lovemaking jane driving down he had had time to think about her about frannie part of him recognized that he might have decided to come down here ostensibly seeking rusty ingraham because jane was due home from hong kong it would give him a few more days not that it was the whole reason and not that he was proud of it but it was there he and jane had both been supposing in a casual kind of way that eventually they would drift back into marriage there would be no future talk of trying for another child that had already come up and janes age career and the tragedy with michael had sealed her opinion on that far past the reaches of any discussion she wantedand hardy did not blame hercomfort respect lack of hassle a civilized life he didnt blame her but he didnt want the same thing she had already hinted more than once that hardy would probably eventually go back to practising law buy a few suits become a professional she would not force him to do any of that of course but itprobablywould come to pass naturally the problem was when it came to it as it seemed to have done now he knew he was going somewhere moving toward some definite place after his years of laying low behind the bar of the shamrock something was guiding him and it wasnt some urge toward passivity and comfort toward threepiece suits and a better wedge of brie maybe four five months ago looking into the death of frannies husband hed come to believe after years of denying the possibility that one personhe dismas hardycould make a difference and that it even mattered else why was he down here back to old abes tragic fallacy did he think he was down here to restore order to the cosmos he had to laugh at that but if rusty ingraham was here he was going to bust his ass in a bad way and he was going to get the charges dropped against bakerthe ones hed influenced that was his mission it was something frannie might yell at him about she might even hate him from time to time for being made up like that but at least frannie would know where he was coming from he was she said like eddie that way to jane the concept would be greek come on diz was that fair jane would understand it on a theoretical level she would admit that the world might be better if everybody always did the right thing of course but there were issues everywhere you looked and you had to decide which ones were yours and that decision had to be based on some kind of a costbenefit analysis adults understood that you didnt just go off and crusade your whole life if you did you were a professional dogooder and everybody knew they didnt get much done did they but he wasnt crusading his whole life he just wanted to get this one thing straightened out it had been pushed in his faceit was his issue and he could hear janes answer to that why take the risk if you did nothing what would it matter so what louis baker is in jailhe deserves to be didnt he break into my house wasnt he trying to kill you and if rusty ingraham is gone let him go who cares hes gone its over but jane he killed maxine weir im sorry police business not yours let it go he had come up to the stadium deserted and empty and looked at his watch the first game wouldnt be for a couple of hours he shook his headbad timingand backtracked toward town he had sat outside under an awning at a place he had passed coming out the tecate had been warm impossible to swallow even with lime he had read a los angeles times two days old cover to cover he had still felt hopeful he was here he would find rusty ingraham he would go home and explain things to jane he would tell frannie he was in love with her and what did she want to do about it but all that had been before he had gone to the stadium now the afternoon behind him he kicked palm fronds and tried to remember why he had thought he would be able to locate one person here the jai alai stadium was nowhere near as big as candlestick park but hardy guessed it still held maybe fifteen thousand people it was certainly a goodtime place hardy was surprised no one he knew had ever tried to put together a jai alai field trip beer and tequila were everywhere outside the gate fiftygallon oil drums had been cut in half and set up for grilling covered with everything from what looked like braided coat hangers to corrugated iron piled high with shrimp snapper chorizo mounds of green onions peppers mystery meats slap it in a tortilla and pour on salsa who knew or cared it was a fantastic reeking bonanza of smells and smoke and hardy chewing a shrimp burrito walked through it mingling taking it in inside the place was packed the first disappointment and it was major was that there werent any windows for betting hardy cursed himself for not doing his homework he had just assumed well there was no help for it now the way it worked in jai alai was that each section had two runners or bookies or whatever they were calledone in a red hat and one in a green hat they moved up and down the stands almost like peanut vendors in the states calling out the constantly changing odds throwing some kind of ball to prospective bettors who put their money in a slot in the ball and took out the chit with the current line so hardys original idea of waiting by a window for rusty to show up looked bleak he took in the stadium all through the stands the red and green hats bobbed and zagged following any one of them would be a job hardy watched a game or two hoping against hope that being lucky might make up for not being smart that rusty would just pop out of the crowd maybe bump into him he found that he liked the game a lot real mano a mano stuff handball with no rules about interference or much else couple of gladiators playing to the death up at seguridad he had thought of having rusty paged when he realized it was a stupid idea if rusty was here and heard his name he would also know someone didnt think he was dead he would relocate and it would be all over two more hours five bottles of orange pop and thirtyfive dollars that he bet on the last couple of games went down the drain the stadium emptied and hardy stood by one of the dozen or so gates a lot of people walked by him two of them resembled moses mcguire none of them looked like rusty ingraham okay hed watch the famous acapulco cliff divers all right now hed done that now what he found himself back at the esplanade a tiny strip of coral sky still clung to the horizon and already there were a million stars welldressed americansmostly couples or maybe that was only hardys vision of itsat with aperitifs at outside tables the breeze had changed blowing out across the town toward the water the night smelled faintly of oil and urine hardy sat on the beach facing away from the lights he could hear the lap of water across the sand behind him there was always guitar music male voices singing softly far away they had jai alai in las vegas nevada there was a stadium in tijuana about a thousand miles closer to home and still across the border puerto vallarta maybe oaxaca ixtapa who knew how many places if rusty was here and he was starting to think that was a pretty big if and if he was going regularly to bet on jai alai then hardy would still need to have at least one person at every gate if he wanted some reasonable chance to get him there was no way he didnt have that kind of money and he didnt know anybody maybe abe could get the local police involved send down a picture of rusty right diz count on that one he lay back into the sand crossing his hands under his head staring up at the man in the moon the el sol wasnt anywhere near the beach beyond the streetfront lobby each groundfloor unit on both wings of the hotel had sliding glass doors that opened onto a redtiled terrace that looked out on the pool more bougainvillea climbed the filigreed wroughtiron to the secondfloor walkway palms and banana trees spared by location from most of the wrath of the hurricane dotted the inner courtyard hardy sat outside on his terrace with a rare cigar and a bottle of el presidente brandy he wasnt really drinking hed poured an inch into the juice glass from the bathroom about forty minutes before and half of it was still there hed been in mexico enough to know that all clichés notwithstanding you really didnt drink the water and he was sick of orange pop since one of the advertised features of the el solin neon over the door of the lobbywas a telephone in every room hardy had a telephone he also had a television set the fact that neither worked didnt surprise him very much he thought it might be fun someday to settle down here in mexico and open a luxury hotelice machines pinball cable tv magic fingers and of course telephone none of them would have to work the fact that you had them made you special he had some luck calling san francisco earlier from the pay phones near the post office he got janes answering machine and told her where he was that he might get back in a week the cryptic and enigmatic hardy isaac glitsky abes son said that abe and flo had been down in la since friday interviewing for a new job hardy figured and making a weekend of it really doing it when hardy decided to head south he didnt mention it to abe he hadnt felt like explaining his somewhat farfetched reasons trying to justify taping his up under the fender of his samurai abe would have gone nuts but now isaac was supposed to ask where he was and hardy told him and said hed call back the next day frannie hadnt been home there was some quiet laughter across the way on another shadowed terrace someone had slipped into the pool he heard a telephone ring faintly up in the lobby he drew on his cigar and sipped the brandy the telephone hed taken it outside to the terrace and periodically lifted the receiver to silence now suddenly there was a dial tone he dialed frannies number waited waited some more hello i dont believe it dismas cest moi no wait wrong country soy yo are you all right abe called here he didnt know i know but you did im here im okay the pleasantries getting used to the distance the separation the drive down the hurricane the phones being out which is why its taken so long to get through how are you feeling okay not too committal there okay the longdistance wires hummed in the silence im okay i went to the doctors friday and heard the heartbeat the babys she took a breath its really there and alive he could hear her eyes brimming i missed eddie i missed you i had a bad night i think im pretty confused about things right now hardy sipped some brandy do you want me back up there i dont think i dont know what id do with you right now but i know i want you to be careful im always careful im using blockout wearing a hat not drinking the water the whole shebang do you know what you want to do when you get back as though she were sitting in front of him hardy shook his head no what im trying to do now is figure out what lunacy made me decide i could find rusty ingraham down here if hes alive if hes here maybe abe could somehow get the police down there to help you whos going to help a civilian with no hard evidence look for a guy whos considered dead abe wont i dont know when he calledshe pausedhes your friend diz he really sounded worried wanted to know where youd gone why didnt you tell him all that its just not the kind of thing he would understand thats why he gets paid for what he does well he also told me to tell you to come home the case is closed some parrots screeched in the top of one of the palms hardys stomach tightened they found rustys body no not that just a second he had me write this all down his cigar had gone out the swimmers wake lapped the pools edge hardy found he was sweating gripping the receiver whiteknuckled okay she said are you still there she told him that glitsky said he had questioned a man named hector medina as hed been planning to the next day the day hardy left for mexico hector evidently jumped from the top of the sir francis drake to one of its lower roofs they found between two and three thousand dollars in cash on him so abe thinks he killed this man johnny laguardia and he says it follows that he paid johnny to kill rusty ingraham what about the girl that was with him maybe he says it was just bad luck she was there anyway thats what abe seems to think that hector medina realized he was going to get caught for it and couldnt face it was there a note didnt he have a daughter or something i dont know i guess no note abe would have said wouldnt he i mean in a message for you and abe said he really thought thats how it went down well he said it tied everything up pretty well lap of water screech of parrot the hum of the longdistance connection diz hes in la now interviewing for a job down there i wonder if maybe he just wanted to feel like his cases were settled doesnt it make sense to you i guess no not really abe told me youd made a pretty good case that rusty was dead i know i did but now you dont believe it well four days and fifteen hundred miles ago i wasnt sure i believed it now im here i might as well give it a day or two more but i have to say that after today even if hes alive finding him doesnt look very promising and whatll you do if you do find him i dont know i guess it depends have a party get drunk tie him up and ride him back to san francisco maybe go to the police here and try to have him extradited would you please try to remember he might be dangerous okay i already thought of that i mean it dismas i mean it too frannie what more do you want me to say she waited a beat i want you to say youre coming home that well see each other again okay ill say that another beat you will god willin and the creek dont rise he said chapter twentyfour the eyes opened to darkness over by the opening for the window where the light would eventually start there was nothing gradually as he looked the one darkness became several different shades of black and graythe shapes of the desk a poster the window one of the chairs stars flickered dimly in the black sky rusty ingraham sat up on the hard bed the girl next to him was asleep her long hair splaying over her pillow he wearily tapped his good right arm on the mattress as though asking it to quit being so unfriendly he got up and went into the bathroom feeling his way through the still unfamiliar house closing the door behind him he turned on the light and watched the cockroaches scatter outside were no living sounds not even the birds that herald the coming day hours before the sky began to lighten so it was very early perhaps even very late the night before how long had he slept abruptly he flipped the light off again standing still and listening carefully now always listening carefully keeping his eyes open it was already getting old he could just make out the sounds of water in the bay the slush slap against boat and piling the gentler wash against sand the house was north of the city on the beach somethinga lizard a tree ratskittered across the roof far off a motora car or a fishing boatstarted up coughed once then faded he turned the light back on the porcelain toilet didnt have a seat the mirror over the sink had rust spots through the glass there was no curtain in the shower area well what did he expect on the notice hed given there would be time and already money for something better his arm was throbbing slightly and he tried to remember if hed taken his antibiotics before going to bed with whatever her name was well whoever she was she had been just what he liked pretty enthusiastic game for a good time and going home to atlanta today and another one would arrive or had arrived and was waiting for him these vacation girls were the way to go no promises no pretense none of the hassles a steady woman could bring you he touched the bandage gingerly trying to see if the throbbing was the onset of infection which could be trouble or just the pain of rebuilding tissue he tried to flex his left arm but thought he was still quite a ways from that no it was a good solid dull pain he mugged at the mirror his ladykiller grin his eyes were clear no fever therefore no infection he went back to the bed and stretched out next to the girl the window remained a black hole in deeper blackness a creaking sound like a twig breaking made him jump and the girl stirred beside him then silence it was just the house settling he drifted back off into sleep it was only a hunch but hardy thought it was better than trying to cover twelve exits at one time he thought he would give it two more days and then start the long haul back home this morning still pretty fatigued from the drive down he had slept in but tomorrow he planned to get in one run at deepsea fishing maybe get a nice picture of himself and a sailfish to brag about back at the shamrock he got to the stadium well after the games had started he heard the loudspeaker and the applause from the edges of the parking lot thered been no blue volkswagen jettas parked in the street he had taken leading up to the stadium tomorrow if nothing worked today he would hire a lucky cab driver and put on some miles covering the streets all around the neighborhood but today he would start with the parking lot there was no concrete it was a dusty grassless potholed couple of square blocks surrounding the stadium into which people had driven and parked in pretty much random order if you were near the stadium hardy figured it would take at least an hour to let the lot clear enough to make your way out there wasnt anything resembling a lane where traffic should go no white lines for parking areas if your car fit jam it in there twentyfive minutes of walking in the bright hot sun got pretty depressing the volkswagen was a popular car in mexico the old beetle was as common as it had been in the united states in the sixties but there were also rabbits and unfortunately jettas and two of them light blue in his first pass at the outside border of the lot wonderful he thought a dozen exits to the stadium probably a dozen blue jettas in the parking lot he needed twenty guys a week and a ton of luck and even then he sat on somebodys fender near the entrance to the lot sucking down an icecold fanta trying to come up with some plan that might work the landscape of automobiles shimmered and glared in the heat california plates acapulco was a long way from california and almost no one except for the lunatic fringe among whom hardy was beginning to count himself drove there wouldnt be more than twenty cars in the lot with california plates and he guessed the odds of finding more than one blue jetta with them were significantly on his side whistling he started walking through the lot woo im dizzy she pressed her body up against his good side she was fantastic long leggy a face for the movies hair a deep chestnut green eyes she was a secretary from washington dc and wore a white tshirt from the hard times café that said i like mine all the way wet the tshirt was a little smallher breasts held the front up high enough to show her navel in the slim waist maybe she was twentytwo and with a couple of margaritas already in her look out watch out for the potholes rusty said just lean against me could you believe those bodies she said pretty amazing i mean ive seen jocks before but these guys he let her go on fantasize all you want he was thinking and hed been studying the guys too getting to know them a little now what to watch for and getting lucky hitting two then three four in a row clearing over a thousand us today more than making up for last weeks disaster he was glad the hurricane had enforced the time off he had been starting to press just down here and thinking he had to make his mark right away wrong he had time he kept telling himself he had time all the time in the world so he took a few days off met atlanta stayed indoors it had been good for him now starting a new week fresh hitting it right away this was it most of the cars were out of the lot he and dc were laughing watching out for potholes they were going to go down to the esplanade and have turtle soup and a lobster dinner and blow a wad of this money then maybe hit a cock fight or anyway something with a cock he smiled whatever they did it didnt matter he was loaded after being down here ten days he had more than he had come with and thats the way it would keep rolling no more getting behind the eight ball study the game bet cautiously until you hit your roll then like today run it and he thought he was seeing it already some pattern some way to make a steady income it wasnt exactly like the ponies where there were all these variables horses were dumb animals jai alai was people momentum things you could understand predict it was late afternoon the green hill had a sepia tone through the dust of the lot they got to his car and heard footsteps coming up behind them hey rusty rusty hardy closed the distance between them he took off his sunglasses its you isnt it rusty was good hardy gave him that barely a flicker of panic diz he reached out his good arm and pulled hardy into an embrace god its great to see you me its great to see you i thought you were dead dead the girl said oh hey excuse me this is dc dc an old friend dismas hardy she nodded what do you mean dead rusty laughed im not dead thank god me neither i can see that what are you doing down here maybe great minds think alike im waiting for your first call and watching the news and i see some girl has been killed on a barge in china basin and what who was killed hardy shrugged i dont know but i knew thats where you lived so i went down to check it out and it was the slip youd given me i didnt want to wait around so louis baker could find me i just went back home threw some things together and lit out it was maxine rusty leaned up against the fender of his car he put his hand up shading his eyes whos maxine dc asked she was a friend just a friend his eyes were actually glazing near tears god diz she must have come over to visit and was there when baker got there thats what i figured i just split especially since you didnt call me i figured i know i just spooked same as you when i got home from seeing you i sat around for an hour and realized i just couldnt do it couldnt just wait there for baker to come and kill me what was the point but i should have called you im sorry what are you guys talking about rusty was making a point of recovering from the shock of maxines death he told a good story while hardy and dc listened it sounded romantic frightening kind of cool so what happened to this guy baker dc asked hardy looked at rusty and shrugged i dont know i hope hes back in jail by now he probably left some prints dont you think rusty something anyway he turned to the girl they usually do i figured i had some vacation id take it and give the cops a month or so to figure it out if not time i get back i can tell them what i think and theyll go get him but i thought it would be safer to get away first so ive been bumming in mexico a couple of weeks its only my second day she said hey you eaten yet diz we were going to go down and blow some of my winnings you want to join us you win at this game rusty grinned now he opened the passenger door big time they were leaving the lot bouncing over the dirt so what happened to your arm hardy asked after he had located the car hardy had a good long time to work on the plan though it had still been early enough to get back to the el sol and return with his gun what good would that have done he wasnt planning on kidnapping rusty it was a long way back home and theyd have to drivethere was no way hardy could board a plane with the gun hardy couldnt go to the local police either rusty wasnt wanted for anything here or in the states and even if he was hardy wasnt a lawman the only way to do it hardy realized was to get abe involved and somehow make things official but first he had wanted to make sure rusty wouldnt suddenly cop to the whole thing and want say to fly home to work it out hardy didnt want to have abe fly down just to have rusty say sure guys ill go home with you figuring he could beat it he wanted to make sure the guy was denying it that abe would be needed any risk he ran in showing himself would be minimized by his own charade he figured he and rusty would hang out hardy sticking close for a day or two until abe could make it down then theyd nail him rusty had a charming smile ill tell you my life isnt dull he was saying i got this arm the third day i was here i was out fishing sweating like a pig dove in to cool off so im climbing back onto the boat and grab the gaff to come aboard i slip and the damned thing goes through my arm both sides in and out yep ouch dc said hardy had enjoyed it watching the show he tried to see it the way rusty was telling it and every little piece fit in just right if he didnt know the truth hardy would have been convinced himselfthe flight from vengeful louis baker an insurance settlement that provided some ready cash the accident with the gaff once in the middle of dinner another flirtation with tears over maxines death there was also the mental challenge of holding back of biting his tongue he had to remember he hadnt been to the barge hadnt seen rustys blood on the bed maxines body blocking the hallway he hadnt visited louis baker in the hospital and hed never heard of johnny laguardia ray weir any of them the girl was gone now dropped off dead drunk at her hotel after dinner rusty had driven himself and hardy back up to the cliffside restaurant for a few nightcapsshots of tequila and wedges of lime hardy thought he would get rusty drunk drive him home maybe misplace his keys then hed call abe and talk him into getting down here they walked around to where the boys jumped the ocean roared far down below them there was a grotto to the virgin mary for the obligatory prayer before going off the cliff a smell of kerosenefor the torchesoverlaid the sea air the divers had all gone home this is something hardy said the crescent moon hung over the sea to his right i was over at one of the restaurants the other day and couldnt watch it hardy said its mexico lifes cheap rusty was standing next to him hed brought a bottle with him still its not done with mirrors rusty lifted the bottle shrugging you lose a few beaners whos going to notice not exactly the words of the burning idealist who used to work for the da rusty sounded like he was feeling the drinks diz let me tell you something i just wanted to win cases same as everybody else i dont know i like to think i cared about justice a little that why you quit that passion for justice hardy looked sidelong at rusty deciding he wasnt going to have to try to get him drunk rusty staggered a few steps further toward the edge of the cliff and hardy walked behind him rustys good hand held the bottle down at his side he turned around his back to the cliff he drank again tipping the bottle up he staggered back a few steps i guess in a way baker did me a favor giving me this opportunity to drop out hardy moved up beside him watch out here he said thats a long way down it was time to start herding him back to the car so youre not going back all innocence rusty turned again he seemed to be looking at the moon you know how they always tell us dont burn your bridges well thats what ive done im dead diz nobody in the whole world knows im alive except you and you like that its freedom you never realize how much youre held back by what youve done before your habits other peoples expectations i dont know which is worse but now theres neither of them its like being given a second chance born again a lot of people go look up jesus say the same thing rusty laughed this isnt forgiveness diz this is a clean slate he nipped at his bottle how about you anybody know youre here hardy decided to keep running with his own game he shook his head not a soul he lied but i still feel like me same baggage only if you think of it that way rusty walked to the edge of the cliff bottle in hand hardy kept his distance four or five steps behind him still close enough to the cliff edge to see a phosphorous wave break far below the sound carrying up like distant thunder maybe you dont have so many things tying you up hardy said rusty chuckled you can bet on that one he turned to look at hardy you think things have got to tie you up i tell you diz i tried that for about i dont know ten years it sucks i gave it up for about ten years and that sucks too rusty swigged from the bottle well there you go he said he walked to the lip of the cliff and leaned over looking down straightening up he half turned i guess i just dont want to think so much anymore or try to do anything anymore my ambition done gone south especially since coming down here i do some betting keep on top of my game score a few chicks you want to know what living is take my advice and dont go back to san francisco hang out i dont think so rusty shrugged brought the bottle again to his lips then abruptly he sat down hanging his legs over the edge of the precipice he patted the ground next to him sit down diz have a hit he held the bottle out im good hardy said what do you say we head back the temptation was getting to hardy rusty had killed maxine weir and stolen her money he had helped undo nine years of louis bakers prison rehab hardy knew that as long as rusty was free he himself would never be safe rusty couldnt really let him go back the word might eventually get back that rusty was down herejust the might was enough rusty had already killed for the life he wanted and hardy didnt doubt hed do it again and now the guy was sitting on the cliffs edge dangling his feet half in the bag a little nudge and abes order of the cosmos would be restored hardy looked around the deserted plateau there was no sign of life except for him and rusty he took a breath and did a deep knee bend scratching the dirt come on he said im ready for the sack hed get back to the el sol call abe put things in gear for tomorrow or the next day figure how they would get rusty back to the states but rusty did not move to get up instead he pulled at the bottle again barely tipping his head enough to splash some tequila into his mouth hardy wondered how he could function with as much alcohol as he must have had in him then he wondered if he was functioning he moved up a step rusty suddenly shaking his head like a wet dog rusty put the bottle down on the dirt he seemed to try to balance himself with his good arm to push up but the effort was too great and he settled back heavily swearing hardy waited rusty lay down flat on his back staring at the stars his legs hanging over the cliff i am fubard he said the words coming out very slurred fucked up beyond all repair hardy moving no closer nodded so ill drive he said without looking back he wheeled and started walking it was when he got to the car at sitting on the hood with his feet on the fender he had to decide if he was going to walk home or what he still didnt know where rusty lived and he didnt want to lose track of him of course he could leave him passed out on the cliff hoping he would walk in his sleep and settle the issue but that really didnt seem too promising a plan no he had to keep rusty in his sights keep playing this game as rustys friend get abe down here then blindside him he crossed the open plateau again rusty hadnt moved an inch the bottle glinted in the moonlight next to him his good arm was outstretched behind it he was breathing heavily noisily his mouth open goddammit rusty hardy came up behind his head and nudged it with his foot come on lets shake it he didnt stir for an instant hardy thought that maybe he was dead then reminded himself that dead men almost never breathed so loud he shook his head thinking it out rusty had one bad arm in a sling and was pretty obviously drunk as a skunk there wasnt much real threat there was there diz he could grab the good arm pull him back away from the cliff like a sack of bricks get him up and moving somehow unless he wanted to sit here all night or walk home and maybe lose him he leaned over and took hold of the good arm around the wrist with both his hands it was dead there was no resistance he got a better footing and started to pull rusty finally made a noise halfturning hardy moved back letting go come on get up rusty rolled again onto his back this was getting old in a hurry hardy said fuck it and grabbed him under both armpits leaning over off balance for one second to pull which was when rusty moved both arms came up grabbed hardy at the shoulders and pulled him forward over covering rustys body in a somersault legs out on no purchase reaching out trying to grab onto rustysomething anythingbut there was only the night air the cold far moon then there was something under his feet some small ledge and one of rustys feet still dangling where it had been over the cliffs edge right there grabbable but it moved kicking out hitting him in the shoulder pushing him out into the darkness chapter twentyfive rusty liked the idea of bringing the bottle along because it was much easier to fake that you were drinking a lot you could just lift the thing to your lips every couple of minutes start rambling a little in your talking in any event it had worked he wasnt sure driving back home whether dismas hardy had been a turn in his luck for the good or the bad his idea of having him stay in san francisco implicate baker and get the word out that rusty was in fact dead hadnt it seemed worked too well he didnt realize hardy had been such a cowardhe thought he remembered a guy a lot more tenacious he could have sworn hardy would have gone to the cops given his two cents but no hed run well you couldnt plan for everything in this world if gambling had taught him anything it had taught him that but then hardys showing up here he decided was pure good fortune a sign that like today at the games he was on a roll sure hed had to give up on dc but he knew her hotel and he could pick things up there again if he wanted except since shed been with him and hardy maybe that wouldnt be too smart the less they could be put together the better he got out to the road running along the bay and turned north it was too bad dc really was his kind of woman young enthusiastic beautiful not too deep here for a party and intended to have one couldnt hold her liquor worth a damn though he pulled up off the road looking at his watch nearly one am he and hardy had half carried dc back to her room at the las brisas around he was pumped up things were going perfectly and thats when you took your flyers the losers were the guys who didnt run with it when they felt the roll kick in and he wasnt a loser not anymore he was invincible now he took a real shot out of the bottle uturning back toward town toward dc and what he felt like doing right now tomorrow hed find out about the body at the base of the cliffs hed go to the restaurant where theyd started tonight ask if anyone had seen his friend of course the first divers would find himif the tide didnt take him out he thought about hardy at first he hadnt really planned on doing anything about him but as the night had worn on it became inevitable hardy would eventually go back to san francisco he would tell someone hed seen rustyhell the guy was a bartender and it was a great story next thing you know the word somehow gets back to tortoni or evenwhich might be worse nowto the police he kept forgetting he had killed maxine imagine forgetting something like that it was interesting he thought and like with hardy tonight it had been a spurofthemoment thing going with the vibe maxine showing up after hed already scared the pee out of louis baker baker gone he rusty screwing up his courage with the gun even with brassjacketeds he knew it was going to hurt like hell he had his own cash in his briefcasetwentysome thousand would have been enough had the other sixty not just jumped up in his face no maxine had been getting too serious anyway hed been planning that he would just dieto her as to everyone else but then the fool woman comes over the day before they had planned to go with all her money in her duffel bag he parked at the las brisasindividual spots for each guestin front of dcs cabin he took another hit of tequila thinking back it was strange he hadnt gone over it so carefully before he thought well on his feet he had to give it to himself on that thats why he had been such a pistol of a trial lawyer that wednesday night maxine had come in unexpected unaware happy finally getting out of san francisco and those dead dreams wasnt it wonderful rusty sure wonderful but goddammit johnny laguardia would be coming over in about two hours for his vig and rusty had to be dead by then blood tracking to the rail body floating out to the bay shed been excited sexed up geared for her new life shed started giving him her patented head and okay doing it wouldnt hurt easing up some of his tension either didnt take long then her shower him waiting now on the bed the water turning off and then maxine coming out dancing posing with the neck brace onthe thing that had made them all their money that had made it all possible shed looked at him questioningly what was he doing with rays gun why he opened the car door if dc was still drunk itd be easy he and hardy had left her on the bed closing the door behind them it might still be unlocked and hed just let himself in or even if shed gotten up and put the chain on which was unlikely he bet he could sweettalk her back between the sheets in two minutes he was good on his feet later hardy would say the fall lasted twentysix minutes by his best count he had had parachute training in the marines though it had been a long time what saved him was that as he lost his balance thinking he was dead he still had pushed out jumping in some control he had noticed the boys divinghow the first part of the dive cleared the outcropping of rock it was not far out the length of the fall after that was what made it so impressive so he hadnt spun or flipped but dropped in black panic but with an eye on the phosphorus field forming under him moving toward shore under him hitting feeling the impact through his shoes up to his shoulders immediately ground into the bottom sand by the incoming wave he struggled for what he hoped was the surface there was no telling up from down and he hadnt timed anything like when to take a breath seawater lungs filling up slamming against rock under again and then he was on the sand throwing up the stuff dripping down his right arm felt warm and looked black in the dim moonlight the same moon was up there he couldnt see the top of the cliffs from the beach the arm was starring to throb hed lost his right shoe he reached down and there was more blood he tried to stand and another wave came knocking him down again he struggled to his feet still gagging he pulled off the other sandfilled shoe his arm was killing him now he was afraid to look at it he sat into another wave and rubbed the blood away with the salt water his eyes gradually adjusted enough to make out depressions in the rocky face of the cliff footsteps only about five hundred of them he thought he put one foot in the first depression another in the next the right foot was at least sprained but he put weight on it and it held though the pain made him catch his breath his teeth were starting to chatter he tried another step okay rusty he said you want to play dirty it was am by his watch when hardy got to the el sol the office was a small room with rattan furniture and a bamboo desk with a glass top under which were featured brochures of all acapulco had to offer hardy leaned up against the bamboo and rang the bell he was looking at a man standing next to a sevenfoot sailfish he moved the bell to reveal a platter of seafood he rang it again he closed his eyes suddenly dizzy the cuts on his arm were more painful and bloody than deep and they had clotted pretty well still a few drops of blood had splattered to the floor he figured his foot was beyond pain that he would walk with a limp for the rest of his whole life he banged on the bell again gave up and got around behind the back of the desk there was an old green metal box with a red cross on it and he picked it up and limped out on his bare and bloody feet through the bananas and bougainvillea back to his room who was that flo glitsky sat up in bed what time is it abe was pulling on his pants where are you going normally flo didnt ask didnt stir in the middle of the night when abe got up to say question a suspect but they had only gotten back from los angeles that day and her husband had seemed maybe interested in the job they were offeringa gang task force of some kind community interaction counseling he said he felt that his live cases here had been wrapped up so where was he going in the middle of the night hardy he said what about hardy where is he hes in acapulco rusty ingraham just tried to kill him as he threw things in a bag he filled her in she draped an afghan over her and sat straight up crosslegged so what does he want you to do he wants me to come down there and do what abe sat on the bed started tying a shoe pick rusty up pick rusty up flo repeated in acapulco how are you going to do that then as though remembering something is dismas all right he seemed fine he turned to his wife you want to call the airport and see when the next plane leaves he went into the bathroom to shave halfway through flo came to the doorway mexican seventwenty well ive got some time how about a little breakfast you still havent told me how you intend to pick rusty up abe had to be careful shaving around the scar that ran through his lips he made funny faces into the mirror scraping away thats perceptive he said finally he threw some water in his face reaching blindly for a towel flo picked it from the rack and put it into his hands and the reason is i dont know it will take some finesse though he was back in the bedroom taking a longsleeved purple tshirt from a dresser drawer hardy knows me pretty well he said rustys my collar but you dont have jurisdiction down there why dont you just get a warrant have him extradited on what how about murder murders good abe agreed except hes not wanted for murder we could say wed like to question him about a murder but they wouldnt extradite for that to say nothing of the fact that extradition takes a year on a good day we have any chub cream cheese and chub on a bagel sounds good i might even have some caffeinated tea abe he patted the bed next to him when flo sat down he put an arm around her hes my collar hes alive and tried to kill dizit points strongly to him killing maxine weir you just said as much yourself if he hadnt tried to kill diz id say it wasnt definite but since he did he shrugged at least for my own peace of mind ive got to talk to him are you going to take your gun hardys already got one in mexico howd he abe patted her shoulder hes a resourceful guy our diz and his having one saves me the trouble of hassling with the airlines going through the locals for permissions all that except that if you use it how do you explain it abe stood up were full of good questions today well well well have to think of something it was still dark but hardy heard a rooster crowing far off he was trying to pull a sock onto his right foot and it was a tight squeeze over the bandage the cut on the side of that foot from ankle to little toe was deeper longer and uglier than anything on his arm from the walk the soles of both feet were raw he felt a little bad about his omission to abe that he didnt have a real idea of where rusty might be at dinner rusty had bragged about his beachfront place five miles north of the city so hardy thought hed drive on up the road looking for that telltale volkswagen of course he knew it could be in a carport a garage off the road whatever well then he would go back to the jai alai stadium if rusty thought he was dead hed probably just go back to his habits if one sock on he stopped he considered calling abe back never mind ill go to the mexican police and report my attempted murder file charges let them look fuck it but he realized if he thought things had been personal before rusty had upped the ante by about a thousand he wanted to take him wanted to get him for what had started this whole thing not just for the legalities abe deserved his chance too what with running around after ray weir and johnny laguardia and hector medina and louis baker lets get the posse together saddle up and kick some ass he had told abe to come to the el sol when he got in if he had left abe with the impression that hed have rusty here trussed up and ready to roast he figured his friend would forgive him he was wearing dry jeans a pair of suddenly too small tennis shoes an armani longsleeved shirt jane had given him probably ruined forever now with the blood seeping through the bandage hed wrapped around his arm well too bad he smiled at himself in the cracked brownish mirrorthe miami vice look very nice he grabbed a light tan windbreaker on the way out his samurai was where hed left it around the corner from the el sols office halfway up the hill it was a long way up the silent dark street he felt under the drivers side fender still there he sat in the drivers seat feeding the bullets he had taped under the bottom of the glove compartment into the chambers he didnt think he was going to shoot rusty on sight but playing it as though the man was just screwed up a oncenice guy gone a little bad had nearly cost him his life tonight and he wasnt about to let it happen again the sky behind him was starting to get light he heard something drop onto the canvas roof of the car a large dark shape appeared at the top of the windshield hardy knocked at it with his hand and the lizard skitted down and off the hood into the leaves on the side of the road hardy shivered get moving he said even if you dont know where youre going the ignition caught right away hardy slipped the samurai into gear sitting still even for a moment sapped his energy he thought he had probably lost a fair amount of blood but not enough to weaken him the fatigue must be from the hourhed been awake now for nearly a day one filled with more than the usual ups and downs but once a month or so at the shamrock hed pull an allnighter talking to moses so he felt in shape that way he hoped at the corner he stopped suddenly remembering that there was one other person in acapulco who might know where rusty lived and he knew where to find her though she might be a little tough to wake up make that knocking go away there was dim light at the corners of the curtains dull gray light of very early morning but he could see everything in the room he didnt feel like hed slept more than two hours dc who definitely had been worth the stop lay turned away from him on her side naked and uncovered absently he ran his hand along her flank she made a sleepy purring noise more knocking he listened somebody was already up playing tennisrusty heard the rhythmic thok of the ball being hit that must be it no it was the door someone knocking on the door jesus what time was it si servicio señor dc stirred whats that she asked room service she mumbled that they had the wrong room rusty tried to say wrong room in spanish but it didnt seem to take the guy knocked again dc moaned and rolled out of the sack ill just tell him rusty watched her walk across the room he wondered how breasts so big could ride that high he liked how she looked as she reached up for the chain undoing it opening the door a crack to tell the guy stepping back away her hands to her mouth and before rusty could react dismas hardy was inside the door closed behind him pointing a gun at his head remember that thirtyeight special i recommended you buy he said i thought youd like to see what one looked like chapter twentysix you cant shoot me i cant please god dont shoot us dc said hardy grabbed the sheet that covered rusty and threw it toward dc wrap yourself up and sit down he said he motioned to a chair with his head and leveled the gun at rusty now back up against the headboard naked covering himself im sorry where were we youll never explain the gun this gun the one you stole from me in san francisco whats he saying both men ignored her hardy continued you mean the gun we fought over and it went off by accident this gun theyd never believe that i think they might if a san francisco cop came down and said you were already a murderer rusty whats he saying hardy glanced at the girl shivering and huddled in the chair about four hours ago your friend rusty here pushed me off a very high cliff she looked at hardy as though he were a madman no he was here all night i remember you both were driving in the car with me and wrong hardy said you passed out we went for a nightcap and rusty tried to kill me she looked at rusty whats he saying rusty shrugged diz give it up what are you gonna do hardy drew it out one word at a time i am going to bust your ass he cocked the gun i hate to be so melodramatic but get some clothes on russ you cant do this dc said this is kidnapping or something he was here i know he was here hardy kept the gun on rusty he moved closer and kicked the bunch of clothes that were next to the bed into the middle of the room you gonna need help with your bad arm and all rusty flexed his bandaged arm grimacing ill need the sling pants first hardy said he felt the pockets checking for a weapon then threw them onto the bed ingraham was silent remember that womanmaxinei mentioned earlier last night the friend of rustys just a friend she nodded rusty here killed her he shot her three times close up with a smallcaliber gun she crawled about twenty feet before she died i bet that was a long twenty feet it was dcs turn to be silent hardy threw rusty his shirt and that horrible gaff wound in his arm you ever been on a real fishing boat rusty theres no mate in the universe will use a gaff to help a human being pull up good basic idea though given short notice to come up with it creative hardy was back at dc he needed something to explain the wound through his arm since what he in fact did was shoot himself to make it look like someone had killed him his blood all over the place a trail of it leading to the edge of his barge where it disappeared into the foaming brine youve got it all figured dont you ingraham said yep hardy was curt shoes he said he thought of his own aching feet better yet no shoes get up is this all true dc had pulled her feet up under her on the chair tucking the sheet in all around this is the gospel hardy said lets go russ he threw him the sling and rusty draped it around his neck then he leaned over and reached for one of his shoes hardy took quick but careful aim and fired in the room the shot was a bomb blast the pair of shoes exploded there was a gash in the floor and plaster fell from the wall where the bullet had ricocheted up and through hardy smelled the cordite dc screamed then settled into a quiet sobbing jesus hardy youre crazy no but i am a little pissed off no shoes he went to the door opening it pointing the gun at rusty wed better move i imagine that woke up some of the neighbors he clucked looking at dc horrible the way these mexican kids will just go shooting off barrel bombs at all hours right you understand the girl terrified nodded hardy said he hoped so rusty was at the door hardy looked back in at dc this is really happening he said and what i want you to do now is sit in that chair until youve counted very slow to three hundred dont open the door for anybody dont make any noise dont do anything do you understand she nodded again and hardy closed the door other doors around the complex were opening hardy kept the gun out of sight under his windbreaker he was grinning this is fun isnt it now were going to walk briskly to that car next to yours looks like a jeep and get in and drive away into the sunrise is the plan clear because if its not a mistake could happen look diz ive got a lot of money maybe we can maybe but lets talk later perhaps well do lunch the thing about running around is sometimes you didnt take the time to think abe glitsky wasnt running now he had had three hours alone on the plane three hours to sort facts without interruption now beginning their descent into acapulco he was drinking a glass of papaya juice over ice and wondering how he had let himself slip so far in the past couple of weeks he imagined it had been a function of all the bs at the hall the pissing and moaning about the bureaucratic aspects of the job wondering whether laniers cases intersected with his wanting to close the book on investigations just because he didnt want them outstanding when he left if he left he was thinking now with ingraham alive what that did to his neat little package regarding maxine weirs death after hector medinas suicide or apparent suicide it had all seemed clear he hadnt given that case a thought during his four days in los angeles he was so satisfied with what must have happened he had chosen to accept that medinas grudge against ingraham had been reawakened by his involvement with the rainesvalenti investigation he had hired johnny laguardia to go kill rusty laguardia had somehowah how easily that somehow slid down when you wanted to get around somethinggotten hold of ray weirs gun and used it to shoot rusty and maxine whose presence there was just bad luck for her finally since laguardia was the only thing tying medina to the crime medina aces johnny but once abe glitsky shows up already suspecting medina he sees that hes about to be accused again therell be another murder investigationhis job will go his reputation the same thing that happened beforeand he cant take it anymore so he jumps from the roof of the sir francis drake all plausible but now with ingraham not dead with ingraham trying to kill hardy a good possibility that none of it was true which left the reality of johnny laguardia with a bullet in his brain and medina maybe still a suicide but maybe not he crunched some ice as the plane descended he was the one who had given hector medinas name to angelo tortoni smart abe he thought disgustedly real smart so what hed really done was to provide a mafioso with a way to apparently cover for the execution of his own lieutenant he had told tortoni he suspected medina so how about this abe tortoni has one of his sons go and push medina off a roof case closed courtesy of your local sfpd and glitsky had somehowagain that wordchosen to ignore or forget what he realized was a major psychological truth about hector medina as the sole support of a semiretarded daughter he wasnt ever going to kill himself medina would tough it out no matter what he hadnt liked medinahe was a bad copbut he was no quitter he wouldnt run from another investigation hed fight it the way hed gone back for raines and valenti he might fight dirty he might lie cheat steal do violence but medina wouldnt run wouldnt cop outwouldnt kill himself but abe had swallowed that he had done just that because it was convenient because it closed his caseload like it was sweet sweet candy san francisco cases again his city his turf he knew why he was down here he was a san francisco cop and rusty ingraham was as he had told flo his collar his personally how much money hardy asked rusty ingrahams feet were belted to the leg of hardys bed at the el sol hardy sat in the reading chair the shades drawn gun in hand trying to keep awake his own foot was throbbing and he felt the unmistakable onset of fever he didnt want to but if abe didnt show up in about an hour he was going to have to try and figure some way to get the mexican police involved and avoid getting himself arrested for having a gun because if he didnt have the gun on rusty even for a minute rusty would be gone what made it worse was that rusty had slept for over two hours after theyd gotten here with his feet on the ground belted hard to the bedpost he had simply put his back on the bed and was snoring in five minutes hardy had ordered a pot of coffee from the lobby and opened the door a crack to take it in rusty hadnt stirred now rusty half reclined on his good elbow eyes sharp alert close to fifty thousand it amazed hardy this guy would lie to his dying mother what happened to the other thirtyfive he asked it took rusty a minute jesus you do know everything hardy nodded i know maxines check was for eightyfive grand and her husband didnt see any of it hardy took a few minutes telling him the other things he knew what hed really done since rusty had turned up missing im impressed you really floated out the canal checking the current i wasted a lot of time not just that rusty didnt seem nervous anymore even seemed to be enjoying himself reminiscing i probably should have just left you out of the plan but i needed somebody who was out of the loop and still had access to it i mean weyou and iwerent exactly buddies anymore theyd believe you i think they were coming around to it so why didnt you just let it go hardy couldnt think what to say it was like trying to explain red to someone who was colorblind he could just hear himself saying because it wasnt true because i almost shot my best friend because you had me scared to death for a week because of frannie and jane he poured the last of the coffee bitter and tepid and then rusty would say so what the one thing i dont understand hardy said instead was how come you didnt just pay off you had the money i mean even before maxine came over you had whattwentyfive grand so give the five or six to johnny laguardia youre out of the hole forget about it rusty didnt even have to ponder you dont forget about it diz you dont ever get out you know how much i paid fucking angelo tortoni over the past five six years how about five hundred to a thousand a week for like two hundred and fifty weeks thats the vig alone like a quarter million bucks and his people seeing everything so every case i settle every horse i hit johnnys there with his hand out you know what thats like three grand four grand a month down the drain he shook his head theres no way i give him another dime then maxine comes around theres that much more girl always did have lousy timing so she was just an afterthought killing her rusty shrugged hey no way i take her with me number one she cant keep her mouth shutshe tells one of her friends her husband somebody and next thing you know johnnys down here putting me in a blender plus diz you know i know what women you know you get to a certain point you kill them rusty laughed hey the thing is were here ive got the money you get maybe twentyfive i get maybe whatever i want i might take it all where is it no no no see then i lose my leverage hardy cocked the gun the guy had colossal balls your leverage position is weak at the moment russ wheres the money he just shook his head nope you shoot me you dont get it anyway you take me back for trial and ill need all of it for my defense what defense tortoni finds out youre alive and youre meat anyway im thinking the best thing to do if it comes to it is to turn states evidence against tortoni cop a plea turn the thing around hardy uncocked the gun youre an impressive piece of work rusty you got a lock murderone with maxine you also tried to kill me and im not inclined to let it go why not diz no i mean it it wasnt personal i like you so i pay for your inconvenience i disappear someplace else and we forget the whole thing we forget you tried to kill me right we forget you set up louis baker using me to do it fucked up the rest of his life rusty ingraham rolled his eyes oh please hes just a dirtbag nigger excon anyway right at best he sat up leaning forward on the bed come on diz whatd i do to the guy he didnt deserve anyway he should have done his thirteen for what we put him down for they let him out after nine thats their problem fuck louis baker even thirteen years wasnt enough they should have thrown away the key i think they will with you rusty hows that grab you rusty shook his head smiling i think its unlikely listen diz who knows but me and you what really happened i guarantee you baker was there so he shot maxine and me im hit but i get away it still all works i give you half the money and the white man walks rusty raised his good hand gesturing still smiling conspiratorial its not black or white he said its who i am and who baker is hardy emptied his coffee cup in a long swallow thats right russ thats exactly what it is after hed shown up at hardys room at the el sol abe had gone out and bought a length of rope a pair of cheap sandals for rusty and some overthecounter tetracycline mexico was different that way hardy had said he couldnt do anything until hed gotten a little sleep so abe had moved ingraham over his polite objections tying him elbows and knees to a chair while hardy took his pills and crashed on the bed ingraham had spoken little pretty beat himself he showed no inclination to deny killing maxine weir and eventually dozed off so abe had spent the afternoon on the terrace reading loren estlemans bloody season and wondering how wyatt earp had ever acquired such a good reputation every ten minutes he checked through the double doors at a little after three he had finished his book and awakened hardy he had a fever but he was okay he had taken some more pills they sat across from each other on the terrace okay abe said now what i was hoping youd tell me abe sat back and sucked some air through his front teeth you want to drive him back all of us three days small car i dont know how id be hardy said i have felt better he thought a minute isnt there any way they can hold him here abe shook his head i dont know im not here officially i cant arrest him but they can arrest him down here cant they abes scar tightened through his lips there is a rumor that anybody can be arrested here for anything a humble and cooperative california police officer such as myself for example could probably speak to the locals and arrange something abe stood up yawning and glanced back inside hes tied up good diz lets go down by the pool the reason they had never taken him was they werent too smart okay they had the gun but a weapon doesnt do you any good if you cant use it hardy taking that shot this morning had rattled him a little made him forget where they were for a while it was possible that maybe hardy was crazy enough to shoot him and the consequences be damned but now with glitsky here it wasnt going to happen glitsky was a good cop and he was going to try to arrest him and have him held until they could get the extradition together at least thats what theyd said with the door open thinking he was still sleeping not too smart it was surprisingly comfortable with the pillow and the blanket rusty reviewed his options when they untied him theyd probably manhandle him away into hardys car and even if it was a long trip that would be their only choice well he didnt want to spend three or four days tied up heading back to the border on the other hand he could pretend to cooperate be docile let them bring him to the mexican police and then gently point out that messrs glitsky and hardy here were the ones that had kidnapped him and see look at this they are illegally armed dont you mexican authorities look with extreme displeasure upon civilians with guns especially foreign civilians most especially bigshot united states policemen coming down here doing their extralegal wedontneednostinkingbadges extradition bullshit without okaying it up front any good macho jefe would likely be outraged at the imperialistic arrogance of it all no question theyd take it up with hardy and glitsky first it was a far better chance than the drive they wouldnt hold him on glitskys sayso after that there wasnt even a warrant for him in the states did they forget he knew this stuff im a lawyer fellas this is what i do he smiled under the blanket hardy and glitsky were coming back into the room hardy saying its still risky glitsky prodded him with his shoe pulled the blanket off him rusty moaned stirred made a good show of it that was a good rest he said what time is it they sat alfresco in the late afternoon three american tourists at a table on the esplanade looking out at the bay the bodies in swimsuits the beggars hardy carried his gun loaded tucked into his belt under his windbreaker they were all eating shrimp cocktails and drinking draft heineken rusty said hed pay for it from his winnings the day before he was well rested in apparent high spirits hardy excused himself to go to the bathroom i appreciate the last meal rusty said abe nodded noncommittal your nickel ive heard stories about mexican jails you know where its just like a hotel i mean you buy your food have women sent in same as a hotel just depends on how much money you have abe sucked the meat from the tail of a shrimp thats nice he said and youve got money right he drank some beer though i dont think youll be there too long yeah well you gotta make the best of the cards youre dealt glitsky didnt pay much attention he ate as though he was hungry hardy came back up to the table you got him abe asked hardy nodded and abe got up later he said personable guy rusty said looking after him very personable hardy picked up his fork i dont think he likes you with two shrimp cocktails two beers and a cup of coffee inside him rusty felt good but hardy wasnt being much company abe had been gone about a half hour rusty moved his chair back into the shade of the umbrella over their table it was still hot but the sun was moving lower whats taking him so long think about it you in a hurry rusty smiled no i guess not but he couldve just taken me straight in not really he had a little explaining he looked up the street here they come a couple of guardia with their green uniforms and submachine guns were following a few steps behind glitsky next to him walked a very tall skinny man in a black suit white shirt electricblue tie a regular party rusty said the guardia stood on the sidewalk glitsky and the tall man pulled up chairs this is lieutenant mantrillo abe said he turned to hardy weve been having a nice talk up close mantrillos face was sallow and pocked he pulled a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and threw them onto the table several other patrons looked over do you speak english rusty asked mantrillo nodded pretty good he smiled and pointed a finger at hardy this guys got a gun on him right now under that jacket mantrillos black eyes flared in his sad face good rusty thought it was the reaction he had hoped for mantrillo turned to hardy back to glitsky who shook his head wearily he came with us voluntarily abe said like i told you rusty was getting into the performance he shook his head back and forth no check him i came with them because i thought it was my only chance to get away from them theyve had a gun on me all day rusty met mantrillos eyes lieutenant theyve got the gun theyre breaking your laws not me damn he was thinking i am good just like in court he looked again at hardy please check him mantrillo didnt have to move hardy stood up unsnapped a few buttons and lifted his jacket away from his body he turned all the way around lieutenant i dont know what hes talking about hardy said he looked down at rusty too many beers buddy aint no gun here mantrillo was pushing up reaching for the handcuffs lets go he said we will get the but it was impossible hardy had the gun he had been with him the whole time except the bathroom he cried out he left it in the bathroom hardy smiled at him rusty whirled or tried to whirl to run back and check for himselfhardy had stashed the gun to set him up for thisbut mantrillo grabbed him by his good wrist he heard glitsky say the poor boys deluded mantrillo was starting to pull him around get the other wrist lets go roughly now he pulled back came free no no you cant do this he backed up into another table the customer turned around hey watch it hardy was coming around the side of him cutting him off he stepped forward and grabbed a knife from the table with his good hand he tipped the table up spilling everything shoving it at glitsky and mantrillo he swung the knife at hardy the guardia had come up into the eating area behind mantrillo there was only one way out through the other tables and rusty broke for it vaulting the low fence sprinting up the sidewalk with the confusion around the tables rusty got a good start mantrillo blew on his whistle the two guardia were pounding down the pavement after him blowing their own whistles blocking the crowd aside several people were on the ground hardy his foot killing him was trying to keep up behind mantrillo and glitsky more guardia had appeared from the narrow streets leading back into the city it was too crowded there was a sound like firecrackers and screaming ahead people lying down now getting off the sidewalk onto the sand far ahead of him a sea of bodies still was visible parting to let the runners through now hardy saw rusty maybe a hundred yards ahead suddenly appear on the beach the crowd on the sidewalk must have pushed him out into the open either that or rusty thought they were slowing him down breaking his stride slogging through the sand rusty threw a glance over his shoulder around the sunbathers and vendors glitsky and mantrillo were twenty yards in front of him now crossing the sand themselves hardy took the short fall off the pavement a dozen guardia were crossing the beach rusty got to the hard sand near the water and turned backtracking up toward hardy but that area had pretty much cleared with everybody coming up to see what all the excitement was about rusty ran along silhouetted against an orange evening sky on the nearly deserted stretch of beach more firecrackers seemed to be going off everywhere and rusty cut into the water back up running with his legs high another burst cut a line in the sand coming up to him and he stopped abruptly he started to raise his hand up his other hand the one in the sling he half turned and a string of cherry bombs went off fifty yards up the beach to hardys right rusty ingraham lay in a heap when hardy got to him mantrillo and glitsky were kneeling on the sand the lieutenant had turned him onto his back and the wash of a wave was retreating from him in a pink foam the dumb shit glitsky said hardy took the weight off his hurt foot and went down to one knee rusty opened his eyes he stared at the sky gradually focused on hardy hey diz he said dont let em tell you gamblers always die broke he tried his courtroom smile im loaded where is it rusty hardy asked the money he closed his eyes opened them i tell you i lose the leverage he said he started to laugh then coughed once his face froze in that rictus and then his eyes still open werent seeing anything epilogue marcel lanier put a leg over the corner of abe glitskys desk youll be happy about this he said whats that louis baker abe put his pencil down louis is back at quentin yes he is that makes me happy no whatll make you happy is you know how the da didnt go on the holly park thingno evidence he killed dido abe suppressed a small smile yeah justice prevailed and you dont think he did it anyway abe shrugged evidence talks shit walks not that im burning a candle for louis baker but he looked better for maxine weir than he ever did for dido lanier got a little defensive he looked okay for dido well hey marcel this is america lets pretend if you cant prove it he didnt do it huh well he didnt is the point abe leaned back in his chair no shit nother guy street name of samson took over didos cut and seems he stepped on a runnerthis kid called lace where these people get their names abe they make em up marcel so what happened so lace evidently got this guys gun samsons and being aced out of the cut had no place to go so he shoots samson no mystery does it in front of about forty people two of whom remember seeing something about it but twos okay i can live with two and ballistics matches the

didnt nail him for it did we score one for the good guys abe looked out the window at the october fog it was late in the day he tapped his pencil on his desk if you say so marcel if you say so the trees across the street at the border to golden gate park bent in the freshening wind hardy pulled a bass ale for a customer and limped up to the front of the bar where hed put his stool where frannie sat with a club soda she looked at her watch ten minutes wheres my brother hardy reached over and took her hand hell be here hes always here hardy had been back three weeks he had told jane jane had met someone in hong kong and was going to tell him they had laughed about it they had also gone to bed cried about it put it to rest friends no doubt forever maybe he squeezed frannies hand she was showing now still radiant blooming sometimes lately hardy hadnt known at all what to do with it how are you feeling he asked okay nervous do you think he knows he squeezed her hand again i think he suspects do you think its too soon nope im glad youre sure i kind of need you to be sure hardy watched the wind bend the trees some more the fog was swirling ten feet away outside the picture window in the near dusk the traveling wilburys were on the jukebox singing bout last night hardy thought of last night at frannies just kind of wondering if she would like to be married to him remembering how she had answered him he slid off the stool and stood on his good foot and leaned over the bar kissing her im sure he said john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of
